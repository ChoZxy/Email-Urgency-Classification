Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to our MBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group is interested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring. Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall on valuation issues. 2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by the Bank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics and major corporations. They are doing a special issue on Energy and are interested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for risk management. Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such an article? 3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility of giving lectures to Enron employees on valuation. Ehud and I sent you a proposal but didn't get a response. Is there still an interest in this. 4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that we think is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well as real investments. If you think this approach might be potentially useful for Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your research group. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The Fed's second 50 basis point cut in interest rates in a month to stave off a recession in the US - a move widely discounted in the marketplace - was the subject of many headlines this week. While the cut is the largest since the 1982 recession, and has raised eyebrows regarding the true state of the US economy, there was also plenty of other important news. ABN Amro unveiled plans to boost its risk management and derivatives business by purchasing a large slice of ING Barings' North American investment banking operations for $275 million. Competition in the US and elsewhere will be fierce, however, with leading player Salomon Smith Barney creating a new global interest rate and derivatives products group, following an overhaul of its fixed-income and derivatives businesses. There appears to be no long-term role for Citibank's Fred Chapey in the new division. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's decision to axe about 2,600 staff following a restructuring of its operations into two business groups, will have a negligible impact on its derivatives business (see Headlines). London-based broker Tullett & Tokyo Liberty was back in the news again for alleged racial discrimination. Laurent Weinberger, a broker on the new issues desk until last May, initiated a racial discrimination and unfair dismissal case against his former employer this week. Previously the firm had a run-in with client Citibank, when a Tullett employee allegedly made racist comments to a Citi official (see People).

I can confirm that CHARM does express traditional exposures in a VAR format. One of the beauties of CHARM is that it expresses any quantifiable exposure in a VAR format, i.e. financial, insurance, weather risks. In addition, it has the capability of incorporating correlations between risks - to the extent that they can be quantified. 2. To get the ball rolling, I will send you a broschure of CHARM this week. I also suggest a conference call with Carl Groth of our NY office. Carl knows CHARM well and my thought is that we can give you some more ideas of this product in order for you to decide whether or not you would like to pursue a presentation. A presentation can be arranged at the location of your choice. Let me know if the above fits your purpose or if you would prefer to move in another direction.

(NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free. ""The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades,"" said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. ""This application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."" According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion market. ""The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in benefits for all concerned,"" said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of FuelCell Energy. ""Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users."" Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. ""This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment"", said Walt Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center. ""We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems."" ""In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells,"" said Leitman. Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process. About FuelCell Energy, Inc. FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation. FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and industrial applications."

99	low	"FYI. ---------------------- Forwarded by Kay Mann/Corp/Enron on 06/13/2000 08:52 AM ---------------------------Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up: 1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and 15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not involve approval ""required"" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which refers to adverse ""rate approval"". However, Peoples' intent may be to obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified ""in any manner which is unacceptable"" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to circumstances when a ""required"" approval is revoked.) While the broadened termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency arrangement. 2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C) eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue. Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3, apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be needed. 3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint. 4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion. Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples can, at most, ""propose"" changes in its sole discretion. How about: ""the effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be modified from time to time."" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here. 5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this further. 6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be certificated as a ""natural gas company"", if there is another entity with clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. 7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in information re firm capacity. Perhaps ""in its sole discretion"" can be delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to ""appropriate"". 8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois tariffs have equal scheduling priority. 9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement, however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples, MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or (ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2). 10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds for ten business days. Should there be an interest component? 11. Sect. 3.4. This Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm don't see how this occurs under the revised language. 12. Sect. 3.5. Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on Wed. 13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with ""material"" contractcs and Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some Laws/Judgments? 14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not have a flat fee component. 15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to both Peoples and MEH, People should not have ""sole"" authority to prepare and file all applications. 16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word ""expressly"" in the first sentence. 17. Sect. 11.1. Should the Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold? 18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had a section along these lines. 19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval. 20. Former 15.1 (f) now deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH is dissolved. This seems necessary to me. 21. 15.1 (g) Peoples wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need to demonstrate reasonableness. 22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have access to this information under a protective agreement. This would unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in the NIGAS approval case. That's all. Let's discuss tomorrow."

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near Lusby, Md., the company said. Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA). The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory approvals. The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG imports by the three companies. The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent) storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location. Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage facilities including the new LNG storage. Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday. -By John Edmiston; Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com Folder Name: LNG Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 98 ______________________________________________________________________ To review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent). LG&E's gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000. Rockey and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability. The unexpected (and unmetered) deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period. Accordingly, I assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should not affect earnings. I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter. DF"

While I can appreciate that Diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the Calgary stuff. Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen. While I know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service. Unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service. That is a terrible internal PR issue. Let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by Rob Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada). She responded to Rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time. But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place. She can fill you in on the details in that situation.

We have been assured over and over that this will not happen again, however, it continues to happen. Luckily, this confirmation went out without any errors in it.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona. When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia. I phoned the permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns. In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule. As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.

My phone number is (617) 492-9551. I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came straight to MIT for a Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management. In my first three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics, optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in psychology (at MIT and Harvard). I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran, and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations. In particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and companies (hence the interest in psychology). The (tentative) title of my PhD thesis is """"Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet"""", and I am sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about. Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week. Paulo Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet Objective: To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet. Motivation: This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses. The technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices. Furthermore, companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to. The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies. Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g. VCRs or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy. Companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer. This type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about. The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet. The methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings, such as pricing services. Services are unique, and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company. Our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services. Research Strategy: Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies. These components are choice models and optimization models. Choice Models: Choice models describe how customers make choices. The management literature draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics. The common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods. These methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains. These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis. Economists focus on utility-maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models. The most common economic model of choice is the logit model. The problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet. The first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet. Optimization: Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon. On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers. Short term profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them. The optimization problem must therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component (learning)."

Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was slated to go elsewhere. I picked her up, after that, and she too is someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last summer, and at Wharton recruiting events. Prior to John's coming down Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler. I have no idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either of them.
