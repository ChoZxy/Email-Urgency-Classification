829	high	"Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW compressor stations in Arizona or NM? In case that is still a possibility, let me pass on something we may want to follow up on. I called an old law partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business this week to have lunch and catch up. This guy says he has come up with a good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap. He's got an 80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in service on July 1. Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen. Here's his racket: 1. He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained. His Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in typical electric utility gold plated style). He didn't say, but I suspect there is no warranty on the units. Obviously, this isn't a bold new strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used equipment. 2. His siting/permitting strategy is to use ""brownfield"" sites--i.e., existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some existing air emissions sources. His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp. of America plant on the Great Salt Lake. Magcorp is an ex-client of mine and I know it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues. Our compressor sites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other things in common with this strategy. 3. Here's a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site owner (Magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a TW project) but the corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated as a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes. That means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions source as the host/site. I'm not sure how/whether this works in a TW scenario, but it might be worth looking at. We'd need to make sure that any power plant deal we chase doesn't screw up the timetable on the RedRock expansion application at FERC. MKM--if we could preserve the ""separate source"" concept for air permitting purposes, could we even start work on developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we have a FERC certificate in hand?? Let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this. I'm having lunch with this guy on Mon. and will probably learn more. The thing he is proudest of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of installed capacity, the project is expected to pay for itself in TWO MONTHS and then generate 100% upside. Sounds good to me if its real. DF"

Work is consuming my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass.

We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely.

They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling agreements in place for those projects.

687	medium	"This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at downstream points. Here's the problem: the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points. With rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the Cal. border. Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage. It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline. That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point ""x"", it should resell the gas at point ""x"" and not haul the gas to point ""y"" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product. My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the ""furthest upstream point"" requirement or both. Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at a point other than Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it. I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it. Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation: We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points. Once we receive it, however, it is no longer ""fuel."" It becomes line pack until it is burned. Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc. It also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel. It is our job to manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long. If we end up long at the Cal. border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels. I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal. border, but thats not what we are talking about here. I can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline. MKM--OK with you? DF"

I am aware of several of these sales and have been informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic reason for them. I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the following information: 1. What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2. What is the process that is followed to make such a determination? 3. Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary? 4. In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years? 5.

992	low	"Gary, 1. Correct 2. Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for all of it's employees. Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year. The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance. It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance. The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources. It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver. Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC. 3. I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way. An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology. and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool. I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage. It was a very customer driven (internal and external customers) process. It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center. I hope that helps. Sincerely, Mike"

As a result oil prices pushed slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at 25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as follows: Algeria - 32,000 Indonesia - 52,000 Iran - 146,000 Kuwait - 80,000 Libya - 54,000 Nigeria - 82,000 Qatar - 26,000 Saudi Arabia - 324,000 UAE - 88,000 Venezuela - 116,000 Total - 1,000,000 ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham, Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB (11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit Offshore area. Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum (co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km. Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.' For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum Bulletin. REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli, produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release. Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV, TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the company. AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of blocks offered by NOC in late 2000. *******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001****** The MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for the top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of Middle East and North African power development.

A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on: http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp The Aims & Objectives of the Conference Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the international oil and gas community. With a new licensing round under discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector. Moving away from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments within the Algerian oil and gas industry. It will focus on the commercial opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier. It will examine current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion: I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie. On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece). The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday. Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you. I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend. Sue PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related."

I'll check with her. do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled? If not, you can get a copy of my copy. It is not a standard agreement. On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to sign a CA as well? It is a good question. Ta ta for now, Kay"
27	low	"Gabriel, I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the Canadian origination variance. You may already be aware, but on the Orig Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day. However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate applied is the average rate for the month. Therefore these values will never be the same. Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada on Monday. Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate. If you haven't recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris. Thanks, Robin PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd. I'll be in a little early tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th. Bye. ---------------------- Forwarded by Robin Rodrigue/HOU/ECT on 08/24/2000 11:43 PM ---------------------------Robin, I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her explanation is as follows: This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination. Therefore, the total origination as per the ""origination"" tab will NOT equal the origination as per the ""report"" tab. Robin should add in the translation gains/losses to get it to reconcile. I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never again be the same. Please call if you have any questions, Nicole"

Looking at the data I feel confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily options curveshift is valuing correctly. However, I am still concerned with the valuation from 10/31. Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 11/3 for 10/31's position.
