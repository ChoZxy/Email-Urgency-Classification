Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and had to be in bed for a long time. In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to another state out of the Dabhol plant. I have developed the concept whereby we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm power sale during the monsoon. The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal. I am currently in Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870. I maybe needing a surgery for the slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed. I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further. I can see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get some help from your end. Regards, Sandeep. ---------------------- Forwarded by Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/25/99 10:17 PM --------------------------- Team, Please find my comments in the word document attached.

Many independent software vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded. Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software. Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of ""Pervasive SQL 2000,"" a true relational database system which nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the Btrieve 6.x specification. A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1 includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000 enough for the administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any Btrieve-based applications the network might be running. There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators could be caught off-guard when applications stop working. For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10 included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and the real killer most current applications (such as Computer Associates ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15. Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better choice.

597	low	"---------------------- Forwarded by Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 04/27/2000 04:16 PM --------------------------- Friends, Greetings from India. Just a brief update to let you all know what is happening. This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai. I think that is the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life. I asked the students one day who lead them to Christ. Everyone single one of them have been saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in their school over the last year. But what was even more exciting than that was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family. All of the others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family. That young man's name is Anifa. He came to Christ through one of the pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to Christ. Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord. Anifa will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school knows that he is a man of prayer. Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back and reach his people for Jesus. Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated, because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a single Muslim to Christ. Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others. Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates, and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler. They will be coming in June and July. We will be starting 2 new Churches, and ministering in the schools. And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was started last summer by the team from Southwestern. I look forward to seeing you all this year. Angela and I are praying about God's direction for our future. Please pray with us that for God's guidance as we plan for our future together. God bless. Chad Germany"

38	low	"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/08/2001 01:32 PM ---------------------------George, Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the Sagewood Phase II project. Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows: 1. Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows: Pro-Forma Bank's Adjustment Unit Unit Rent Rent/BR Unit Rent Rent/BR 2 BR/2.5 BA $1,150 $575 $950 $475 3 BR/Unit $1,530 $510 $1,250 $417 2. Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 3. A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 4. Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 5. The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year. 6. Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following: Land - $1,121,670 Deferred profit& Overhead $ 415,000 Cash Equity $1,419,268 Total $2,955,938 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of actual hard construction costs. (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls) - MAPTTRA.xls"

439	low	"Dale, My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London. We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around him any longer. I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market. We see the market for technical people going through the roof in practically every location where we operate. A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false security for both an employee and the company. I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc you.

He specifically asked my partner at RobertWalters in the UK to investigate Enron through my new relationship with you guys. He would be Howard Haughton, attached below (CV). The other 2 resumes are my students at the University of Michigan. Howard Lin received a 4.0/4.0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it takes to intern at Enron for June- Aug. I have his picture included as well. The second is Sung, they are friends. Howy will be done expected in May 2001 and Sung in May 2002. They are my favorite interns and I expect they can be cultivated to the Enron culture with no real cost to you (a ""test drive before committal. I have agreed to represent them and shall take ownership, as they become graduate candidates upon their degree completion. I hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of talent to Enron. Thank you for your acceptance. Best wishes for the weekend.

For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page. This would simply be an additional step to verify all deals are being captured.

145	high	Is this correct? Rick ---------------------- Forwarded by Rick Buy/HOU/ECT on 12/21/2000 03:25 PM ---------------------------Shane and I spoke yesterday regarding the USD curve. Whilst taking a curve other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&L concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the amounts). Depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the business heads here in London. James

975	low	"---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 03/17/2000 04:07 PM ---------------------------Dear all, Firstly, apologies for the delay in finalising this study; a considerable amount of data analysis was required. The idea is to aggregate monthly, weekly and daily volatilities such that we can price individual options on half hours into the future. We have a reliable methodology for the monthly vol curve at the EFA slot level. The first issue to address was to use a ""reverse basvol"" to estimate the monthly vol curve at the half-hourly level of detail. This required an estimation of half-hourly price return correlations. This resulted in a scaling factor of approximately 1.30 that is applied to all EFA vols to convert to half-hourly (the scaling factors are slightly different by EFA slot, but not by nearly as much as might be expected). For the weekly and hourly half hourly vols, a historical analysis was carried out on the past few years data; a weighting-scheme was applied to add more emphasis to standard deviations calculated on more recent data. COMBINING THE VOLATILITIES The idea is to let the monthly vol curve get us to the start of the month and then assume that all half hours are positioned at 2 weeks and 3 days into the next month. The volatility is aggregated using these time-weightings to ensure that we don't have a wildly different volatility for the options at the start of a month and at the end of a month. Below is an example for half hour #38: I put the spreadsheet HalfHourlyVolModel.xls into the public directory, S:\RESEARCH\ANJAM\HHOPTIONVOLMODEL\. I suggest we use the matrix of forward volatilities on the summary page and see what kind of numbers we get. There may need to be some fine-tuning of the time-weightings, but in general, I believe we can start utilising these semi-final numbers. Regards, Anjam"

We have been making the Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels. I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at the end of October/beginning of November. She will be interviewing students at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4. They will be staying with us at our house. It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one another! She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well. By the way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here she will be about six months pregnant. I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in Houston at that time. It would be fun for all of us to get together. I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, who was on his first day here. We could also schedule a First City reunion if you could be here. If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour. I may need to head to London in October or November. I will let you know if my travel plans develop. I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain climbing!!!!!!! How was it? I will be anxious to hear. --Sally"

In the year since, we have a number of copycats and variants of Melissa invading our e-mail systems, though not to the same extent. Now, the e-mail virus du jour is the ""South Park"" virus, named after the animated series on Comedy Central. The South Park virus, known in security circles as W32/Pretty.worm.unp, attempts to send itself to all the addresses listed in an infected user's Outlook address book every thirty minutes. By doing so, the virus causes an ""e-mail storm"" that can bog down and crash network servers attempting to relay the flurry of mail. South Park appears to come from a known user and contains an icon featuring Kenny, one of the characters from the show. Security software maker Finjan Software has reported seven variants of the South Park virus, which itself is a variant of the PrettyPark virus that made the rounds a few weeks earlier. For more information on South Park and its variants: http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0306southpark.html http://www.finjan.com/attack_release_detail.cfm?attack_release_id=3D32 Before we get to the latest alerts, two other resources to check out: 1. The Shmoo Group, a security consultancy, has written a paper entitled ""How to Write Secure Code."" It can be found at: http://www.shmoo.com/securecode/ 2. Eric Knight of Security Paradigm has written an online book entitled ""Computer Vulnerabilities."" The book looks into how hackers exploit vulnerabilities and what methods they use. Knight's book is available in PDF format at: http://www.securityparadigm.com/compvuln_draft.pdf Now on with the latest alerts and patches: W97M/Melissa.AO virus Computer Associates is reporting a new version of the Melissa macrovirus that could be making the rounds. This one disables the Tools/Macro command bar, Virus Protection, SaveNormalPrompt and ConfirmConversions options in Microsoft Word. It also makes a couple of changes to the Windows registry. Like the original Melissa, this version replicates itself to the first 25 users in the Outlook address book. http://www.ca.com/virusinfo/ *********** Microsoft had a busy week, releasing three patches covering a variety of problems: 1. Patch available for ""Registry Permissions"" vulnerability. It seems as if the security on a couple of registry settings in Windows NT 4.0 is not as secure as the Redmonians first thought. This patch fixes the problem, which could let a malicious user gain additional privileges on a system they are logged into. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-008.asp 2. Patch available for ""SQL Query Abuse"" vulnerability. This patch for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine 1.0 plugs a hole that could enable a remote user to author malicious SQL queries that allow the user to take unauthorized actions against on the database or underlying operating system. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-014.asp 3. Patch available for ""Clip Art Buffer Overrun"" vulnerability. A feature in Microsoft Office that lets users download and install clip art from the ""Microsoft Clip Art Gallery"" has a potential hole. Using a very long embedded field in the clip art files, a malicious user could crash or even execute code on the system where the clip art file is downloaded. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-015.asp *********** Red Hat releases nmh packages Following up a vulnerability that was reported here last week, Red Hat has released new nmh packages. A vulnerability in the previous nmh releases allowed specially formed MIME headers to execute code using nmh's 'mhshow' utility. http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D9921 *********** Network file resource vulnerability Eric Hacker of Lucent=01,s NetworkCare division is reporting that applications running in Windows could provide remote access to user name and password information. Hacker warns that programs such as Internet Explorer, Eudora, Word and Outlook running on default configurations of Windows can be duped into sending a user name and password information to unsuspecting users. Though this information may be encrypted, it is easily crackable, Hacker reports.

Kewlhair reports that engineers are failing to set the passwords during installation at customer sites. SBC is using Cayman DSL routers. For more information on how to set the password: http://cayman.com/security.html#passwordprotect *********** Astar application vulnerability TESO, ""crew of coders and freaks who care mostly about network and Unix security,"" are reporting a hole in the astar application that ships with the Halloween 4 Linux distribution. Malicious users could use the application along with obscure command-line code to gain root access. Vendor Web site: http://www.halloween-linux.de/ *********** Vulnerability in StarScheduler S.A.F.E.R. is reporting a vulnerability in StarScheduler, the groupware server that comes with Sun=01,s StarOffice product. The underlying Web server used by StarScheduler is vulnerable to remote execution of code and root access, according to the S.A.F.E.R. advisory.

397	low	"Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me... The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: """"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,"""" and the additional frustrating language """"[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."""" At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate. Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place. In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates. """"[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service. Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power."""" The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations: when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate. """"When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff."""" The example cited by the Commission: If a pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery). When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that """"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."""" Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority. Solutions?? I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question. I feel as if I've really been chasing my tail here. I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now. But I keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October). Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system. I think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this. Do you agree? Stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition. Might be worth it to us, though. Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate. After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates. We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone. However, despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency. We wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure. But I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that recourse rates be available. That requirement has not changed. Have either of you seen anything to the contrary? I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to discuss briefly with you first. Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes. Thanks."

If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude. For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life. - CG, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor"""

Then I talked to Matt Motley, who talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully solve this once and for all. You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want everyone involved to be aware of the procedure. Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore. Thanks, Kate"

Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/18/2000 09:54 AM --------------------------- Dave, Marty, In general moving the deal to just a Selkirk deal minimizes a lot of the concerns surrounding centralized decision making etc. The plant manager is on board as is Doron Grossman. As a result the sales part should be largely completed but the deal is far from closed. I believe driving to closure with margin with GE in 2000 will be a challenge. I haved attached some information regarding Marte's other questions and would be happy to discuss with the team. ----------------------- Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed. Can you answer Marty's other questions? Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/16/2000 09:39 AM --------------------------- Hi David, I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would change my mind. If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney describes. What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to ""influence"" the GE negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements? Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail? Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change from current practice? Do we know what that is and what the deadline for action for change is? Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the potential impact on the margin in the deal? Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the prospect that we can attach these pieces to that? Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000. HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go for it. I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for. If it was my opinion, that is above. If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the probability go up, I'll be glad to help. If it is some other, just let me know. I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with margin in 2000. I would love to participate and do what we can to make this work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to raising the probability of victory. Thanks ---------------------------------- Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction. This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so. Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $200 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product. Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/13/2000 09:36 AM --------------------------- Dave, The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide. The deal value is roughly $4-5 million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income. The obstacles to closure are: - the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted more - there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to pay us and they are not yet agreeable to, - the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M Deal Stats Are: Electricity 230,000 mwh/yr $12 million/yr Steam 430,000 lbs/yr $3 million/yr Gas 470,000 mmbtu/yr $2 million/yr O&M $3 million/yr Total $20 million/yr 10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten. I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case. The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind. In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU. I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse. Regards Delainey"

Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.

167	low	"For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for activity for December 22-26, 2000. The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint. Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone: Nicor Gas Company $18.16 20,000 Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade GDD +.05 10,000 NGPL Nicor WPS GDD 5,000 NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company $12.00 20,000 NGPL Nicor PG&E $14.00 9,000 NGPL Nicor Kaztex $18.16 4,000 NBPL/Nicor The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th. As a result, volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period. I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd. While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price. My volume is a little over-stated, but simply from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information."""

I believe that this is the total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project. Ben is planning to talk with Lee at GE. I talked with Panda this morning. They do not have a fixed close date. They are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of signing the Letter Agreement. I believe that this is doable. Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates. He is working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not yet assigned serial #'s to the units). What price are we assigning to the LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement? Let's stay consistent with that document. The person who will be signing for Panda is Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President. The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement. The balance of the purchase price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing. Is this the pricing information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont? Ben: We need to talk re: the transformers. We quoted Panda $950K per unit for the two transformers. It is not clear if the transformers will work for Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration. If we are re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at LV Co-Gen? Kathleen: I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's. I will let you know when I hear back from him. Fred --------------------- Fred, Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming? What are you projecting for a closing date? We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much? If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house. We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel. In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal. Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready. If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's. We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm. Kathleen, please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers. Kay ------------------- Steve: I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units. I have left a message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review. I have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents and proceed. I understand that you are in Houston. Please call/see me tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction. Kay: We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this transaction. Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York? Also, what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units. Let me know. Kathleen: We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed CA's from Panda. I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda entities at my desk for Ben's signature. These need to be received prior to sending Panda the definitive agreements. We will fax signature pages to Ben tomorrow. Chris: See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were sent to Panda I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning. Thanks, Fred x35406"

All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it. In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow. Thanks, Kate"

Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 02/20/2001 07:43 PM --------------------------- I would like some guidance about outside counsel fees related to the California situation. We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the managing down of the trading positions with PG&E's unregulated entity. I would say that EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a 50/50 basis. However, there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, I would say that ENA will have more issues that will come out of the bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as a company the increased legal expenses. Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or whether we should adopt another approach. One other fact: We also have joint representation in the class action lawsuits filed against the power marketers. To date, no sharing has been agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit (i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not benefit from the volatility this summer)."

Bidweek was kinda rough this time. In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end. The line has been split into two seperate systems. Handling that has been a constant battle. Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business. It's a little harder to get things done. Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house. But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer. We are extremely busy. The kids are loving the stairs. You ought to see Jake go down. We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly. Well, that was too slow for him. Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs. He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach. Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough. Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him. It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going. Anyway, I need to get back to work. Hope the family is doing well. Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.

I called Wed to set up a meeting with you, unfortunately you were out of town. Since I just got my computer and email account set up today, it was not that convenient to contact you. Please let me know when you are available. Please see the following for the interesting article about Enron, and it is exactly what you have been worried about and now it is starting to catch Wall Street's attention. So I belive what you have been promoting to do is very constructive to the company. In addition, please let me know if you need any help with Tiger Team. I didn't forget yesterday's conference, but I was so tied up in a meeting and couldn't leave. The learning curve is quite steep for a freshhand like me at the very beginning. You are such a remarkable person, and I feel lucky I got the chance to work for you. I really appreciate your help and your kindness to me, and I benefit from it tremendously. Please please let me know if there is anything I could help. Best Wishes! Li Is Enron Overpriced? It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial statements are nearly impenetrable. So why is Enron trading at such a huge multiple? Bethany McLean 03/05/2001 Fortune Magazine 122+ (Copyright 2001) In Hollywood parlance, the ""It Girl"" is someone who commands the spotlight at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson. Wall Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still such a thing as an ""It Stock."" Right now, that title belongs to Enron, the Houston energy giant. While tech stocks were bombing at the box office last year, fans couldn't get enough of Enron, whose shares returned 89%. By almost every measure, the company turned in a virtuoso performance: Earnings increased 25%, and revenues more than doubled, to over $100 billion. Not surprisingly, the critics are gushing. ""Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary franchises in several business units in very large markets,"" says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. Along with ""It"" status come high multiples and high expectations. Enron now trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more than 2 1/2 times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more than twice that of the S&P 500, and about on a par with new-economy sex symbol Cisco Systems. Enron has an even higher opinion of itself. At a late-January meeting with analysts in Houston, the company declared that it should be valued at $126 a share, more than 50% above current levels. ""Enron has no shame in telling you what it's worth,"" says one portfolio manager, who describes such gatherings as ""revival meetings."" Indeed, First Call says that 13 of Enron's 18 analysts rate the stock a buy. But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company remains largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its admirers are quick to admit. Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for what it terms ""competitive reasons."" And the numbers that Enron does present are often extremely complicated. Even quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so. ""If you figure it out, let me know,"" laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman at S&P. ""Do you have a year?"" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credit analyst, in response to the same question. To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's pricey stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine. ""I'm somewhat afraid of it,"" admits one portfolio manager. And the inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty surprise. ""Enron is an earnings-at-risk story,'' says Chris Wolfe, the equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private bank, who despite his remark is an Enron fan. ""If it doesn't meet earnings, [the stock] could implode."" What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago. In 1990 around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas- pipeline business. But Enron has been steadily selling off its old- economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000, 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its operating profits came from ""wholesale energy operations and services."" This business, which Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like the ""financialization of energy""--but also, more simply, as ""buying and selling gas and electricity."" In fact, Enron's view is that it can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity. But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a ""logistics company"" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to its destination. Enron also uses derivatives, like swaps, options, and forwards, to create contracts for third parties and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables. If you thought Enron was just an energy company, have a look at its SEC filings. In its 1999 annual report the company wrote that ""the use of financial instruments by Enron's businesses may expose Enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates."" Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. ""It's very difficult for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have,"" says Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron's competitors, but ""wholesale operations"" are usually a smaller part of their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) ""Enron is a big black box,"" gripes another analyst. Without having access to each and every one of Enron's contracts and its minute-by-minute activities, there isn't any way to independently answer critical questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is boosting Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for sure. ""The ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for the future is mostly an exercise in futility,"" wrote Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters in a recent report. To some observers, Enron resembles a Wall Street firm. Indeed, people commonly refer to the company as ""the Goldman Sachs of energy trading."" That's meant as a compliment. But the fact that part of Goldman's business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders is precisely the reason that Goldman, despite its powerful franchise, trades at 17 times trailing earnings--or less than one-third of Enron's P/E. And as Long Term Capital taught us, the best-laid hedges, even those designed by geniuses, can go disastrously wrong. ""Trying to get a good grip on Enron's risk profile is challenging,"" says Shipman. Nor at the moment is Enron's profitability close to that of brokerages (which, in fairness, do tend to be more leveraged). While Wall Street firms routinely earn north of 20% returns on their equity- -Goldman's ROE last year was 27%--Enron's rate for the 12 months ended in September (the last period for which balance sheet information is available) was 13%. Even less appealing is Enron's return on invested capital (a measure including debt), which is around 7%. That's about the same rate of return you get on far less risky U.S. Treasuries. Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its business as black box-like. It also dismisses any comparison to a securities firm. ""We are not a trading company,"" CFO Andrew Fastow emphatically declares. In Enron's view, its core business--where the company says it makes most of its money--is delivering a physical commodity, something a Goldman Sachs doesn't do. And unlike a trading firm, which thrives when prices are going wild, Enron says that volatility has no "

Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue. If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI. Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS) and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed). The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect. The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks). ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current. ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position. I will request that this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect). I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon. I believe that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the interconnect design. It also addresses the ordering and payment responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed interconnection. Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this week, we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior to having a clear value proposition in our sights. I will have recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday. I am simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so. From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI. I believe that we executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines Green Land Development, L.L.C. Call me if you wish to discuss.

I am sure he must be a good guy if you have been dating him this long though. Speaking of alcohol I have kind of come to a realization recently that I need to cut down on my own drinking. That is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend. I am not going to stop going out for a few beers but, I am just tired of how I feel the next day and just laying around and shit. And the thing with my dad has really scared me into being more healthy. Although it doesn't seem to really show to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and I just don't want to be my Dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is havning right now. I think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you think you have a big enough future with Dave to go through with trying to help him with the problem. If you think you do and the drinking thing is an issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but if you don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away. Good luck and if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me."

We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better. Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine contract. The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at closing. Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table? Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it. Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the indemnities lasting longer. I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2 years in this deal. I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the facility agreement. 14. I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the equipment is being acquired from ENA. I would also eliminate ""or any other third party"" on the fifth line. Defined terms: ""Commercial operations"" isn't in the definitions of the turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their somewhere (an EECC specialty). Please verify. Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement? Thanks, Kay"

Although I understood from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the que position) by then. I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings. Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two projects. Thanks Dick."

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. I will know more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W.

Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said: ""Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"" And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the Christmas tree."

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the people of Houston. Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON. These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today . (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.) Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line. Tickets are not required for the lawn area. About Coppelia Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: """"Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."""" Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, """"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."""" (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria."""

I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely Dipak Agarwalla"
964	low	"A W4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay period. There are two basic drivers: number of dependents and filing status. The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld. Married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately. There is really no good or bad answer, only opinion. If you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on April 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly. If you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately. I hope that made sense.

931	medium	"---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 01:41 PM ---------------------------Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials ""agent"" when buying an industrial's excess power to insert into the grid. Generally, an industrial would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 60 days) in order to sell into the grid. EPMI and EES have not requested the ""Impower"" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings. (Also, Enron generally has to also file for ""EWG"" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not required.) I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made. Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to InPower (on a profit share basis). InPower made the filing stating it estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit ImPower to IPPs in MAIN). InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises approved by the local utility. Further, the generation must be capable of producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or commensurate with agreements with the local utility. Total sales made by IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour. The IPPs are in businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking ""incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."" When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's jurisdiction as a ""public utility."" Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at peak times). FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made to those suppliers. This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market based rates authority. The are some additional reporting requirements FERC waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order."
