My Name Is” dropped / Started thinking my name was Fault / ‘Cause any time things went wrong / I was the one who they would blame it on / The media made me the equivalent / Of a modern-day Genghis Khan / Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog / Gangster? Nah, courageous balls / Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft / And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws / And the fangs been out since then / But up until the instant that I went against it / It was ingrained in me / That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought / No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught / ""Do I really belong in this game?"", I pondered / I just wanna play my part / Should I make waves or not? / So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on / And I don't wanna seem ungrateful / Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon / But sometimes you gotta take a loss / And have people rub it in your face / Before you get made pissed off / And keep plugging, it's your only outlet / And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it / Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah / Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times / How many times can I say the same thing / Different ways that rhyme? / What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt / When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to— / I was a… afraid to make a single sound / Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out / Afraid I'd never be found / I didn't wanna go another round / An angry man's power will shut you up / Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love / Run out of excuses for everyone / So here I am and I will not run / Guts over fear, the time is near / Guts over fear, might shed a tear / For all the times I let you push me round / I let you keep me down / Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear / Feels like a close, it's coming to / Fuck am I gonna do? / It's too late to start over / This is the only thing I, thing I know / I know what it was like, I was there once / Single parents, hate your appearance / As you struggle to find your place in this world / And the pain spawns all the anger on / But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song / Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark / Started to spit harder shit / Learned how to harness it while the reins were off / And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part / Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck / Haters started to appreciate my art / And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused / But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone / And the lights go out in that trailer park / And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen / ‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from / Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun / So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song / But I rather make “Not Afraid 2” / Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah / Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent / When I discuss my lows and my highs / My demise and my uprise, pray to God / I just open enough eyes later on / And gave you the supplies and the tools / To hopefully use that'll make you strong / Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt / ‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt / Just having to balance my dang self / When on eggshells, I was made to walk / But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the / Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium / Least I made it out of that house / And found a place in this world when the day was done / So this is for every kid who all's they ever did / Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted / I represent him or her, anyone similar / You are the reason that I made this song / And everything you're scared to say / Don't be afraid to say no more / From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk / Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off! / The legend of the angry blond / Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a— / I was a… afraid to make a single sound / Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out / Afraid I'd never be found / I didn't wanna go another round / An angry man's power will shut you up / Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love / Run out of excuses for everyone / So here I am and I will not run / Guts over fear, the time is near / Guts over fear, might shed a tear / For all the times I let you push me round / I let you keep me down / Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear"
