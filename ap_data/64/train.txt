It's 15 degrees / And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!"" / Ma, let me grab my fucking coat! / Anything to have each other's goats / Why we always at each other's throats? / Especially when Dad, he fucked us both / We're in the same fuckin' boat / You'd think that'd make us close  / Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine / And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go / Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road / And I was the man of the house, the oldest / So my shoulders carried the weight of the load / Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old / And that's when I realized you were sick / And it wasn't fixable or changeable / And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but— / I guess we are who we are / Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on / Maybe we took this too far / ‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though / ‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow / But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" / At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so / Never meant that far to take it though / ‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes / That song I no longer play at shows / And I cringe every time it's on the radio / And I think of Nathan being placed in a home / And all the medicine you fed us and / How I just wanted you to taste your own / But now the medication's takin' over / And your mental state's deterioratin' slow / And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though / But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo / All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both / Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours / But I love you, Debbie Mathers / Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause / One thing I never asked was / Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was / Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address / But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus / Owned a collection of maps / And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas / If someone ever moved 'em from me / That you coulda bet your asses / If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em / And although one has only met their grandma once / You pulled up in our drive one night / As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers / Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you / And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness / Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and / I saw your headlights as I looked back / And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to / Thank you for being my mom and my dad / So, Mom, please accept this as a / Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to / Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to / Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten / My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin' / So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that / I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom / I guess we are who we are / Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on / Maybe we took this too far / I want a new life  / One without a cause  / So I'm coming home tonight  / Well, no matter what the cost / And if the plane goes down / Or if the crew can't wake me up / Well, just know that I'm alright / I was not afraid to die / Oh, even if there's songs to sing / Well, my children will carry me / Just know that I'm alright / I was not afraid to die / Because I put my faith in my little girls / So I'll never say goodbye cruel world / Just know that I'm alright / I am not afraid to die / I guess we are who we are / Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on / Maybe we took this too far / I want a new life"

Can you see me? Get your Visine on / Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on / If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on / Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold? / I'm really too young to be feeling this old / It's about time you admit it, who you kidding? / Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh / I know way too many people here right now / That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all? / I swear it feels like the last few nights / We've been everywhere and back / But I just can't remember it all / What am I doing?
