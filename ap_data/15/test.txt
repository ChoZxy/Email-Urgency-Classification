P. (EOTT) announced today a recapitalization plan which includes the conversion of all outstanding subordinated units and additional partnership interests (APIs) into common units and the implementation of a refinancing plan.   Upon successful completion of the plan, the board of directors of its general partner, EOTT Energy Corp., intends to increase the annual cash distribution on common units from $1.90 to $1.95.   Elements of the plan require unitholder approval, which will be sought later this year."We believe that the plan enhances the value of EOTT's common units and places our common unitholders in a position to realize immediate benefit from increases in the partnership's available cash," said Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of EOTT.Conversion of Subordinated Units into Common UnitsA key component of the plan is the conversion of all subordinated units to common units.  Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and Koch Petroleum Group, L.P. (Koch) have agreed to convert all 9.0 million outstanding subordinated units and $9.3 million of APIs into approximately 4.3 million common units.  These changes in capital structure are expected to enhance EOTT's ability to increase cash distributions to its common unitholders.  An amendment to the partnership agreement will be required to affect this conversion.  FinancingsAs part of its recapitalization plan, EOTT intends to affect equity and long-term debt offerings to refinance short-term debt incurred in connection with its $117 million asset acquisition completed in June 2001.  It also intends to replace its existing working capital credit facility with a new facility with lending institutions.  An amendment to the partnership agreement is not required for the financings, which are anticipated to be completed by year-end.Unitholder Approval and ProxyThe amendment to the partnership agreement must be approved by a favorable vote of holders of at least two-thirds of each of the outstanding common units and subordinated units.  Additional details regarding the recapitalization will be included in proxy materials to be mailed to unitholders this fall. Lehman Brothers acted as sole financial advisor to EOTT on the recapitalization.EOTT Energy Partners, L. P. is a major independent marketer and transporter of crude oil in North America.  EOTT transports most of the lease crude oil it purchases via pipeline, which includes 8,200 miles of EOTT's intrastate and interstate pipeline and gathering systems, and a fleet of 285 owned or leased trucks.  In addition, EOTT owns and operates a hydrocarbon processing plant; a natural gas liquids storage facility; and a liquid pipeline grid system.  EOTT Energy Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp., is the general partner of EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. with headquarters in Houston, Texas.  EOTT's Internet address is www.eott.com .

I thought I would mention toyou, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually useclassical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decisionis for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is thePresident's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is thecustomers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where theassumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM forlarge industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utilitycurves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is itsrole in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most marketparticipants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higherthan spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lowerthan spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers(including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for thecertainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lowerbid prices.Just some random thoughts,Michael-----Original Message----- Date:  01/04/2001  10:41 am  (Thursday)  From:  "Heather Mason" <hmason@hesinet.com>To:  HQ3.EM5(Michael Schilmoeller)Mark Your Calendar-Tuesday January 23, 2001 Downtown Houston Hyatt HotelHenwood will be hosting a comprehensive ERCOT Symposium on Tuesday,  January 23, 2001.

It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals?

Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.Brad

And with concerns about the future of onlineadvertising intensifying throughout the year as one 'Net firm afteranother lowered their ad-revenue forecasts, DCLK has become one of thebiggest losers among large-cap 'Net players. Even with Tuesday's 16% gain(to $13.88), DoubleClick is down 89% this year.So why the post-warning spike? Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares alreadyhave been discounted enough. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion,DoubleClick is valued at 3.2x trailing 12 months' revenue of $433 million.Not a bad price for a company that dominates its sector.Or it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClick's Q4 advisory,which warned that revenues will be 8% to 10% below expectations and thatthe bottom line will range from break-even to a net loss of 3 cents pershare.While those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q4 estimatescalling for a net profit of 2 cents per share, they hardly are indicativethat the sky is falling on DoubleClick. Yet.It looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April forevidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit. Until then, don't expect manydays like Tuesday for DCLK shares.Getting back to PSINet, its nearly 50% gain (or 53 cents) on Tuesdayhelped slash its year-to-date loss to 94.7% from 96.5%. The layoff of 300workers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale. InNovember, PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategicoptions.As a group, the 50 members of the Internet Stock Index, or ISDEX, gained6% in the week of trading ended Tuesday, closing at 501. For the year, theISDEX has fallen 41.8%./-------------------------------------------------------------------\GUINNESS FLIGHT internet.com TM INDEX FUNDAccess the Internet with the Guinness Flight internet.comTM Index Fund.Created to track the Internet Stock Index, known as ISDEXc the Fund isthe first Internet index fund.

The confirmation language states that "Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties...or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties..." Therefore, per Gerald, we can discontinue preparing paper confirmations between the two Enron entities.Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Thanks,Judy

As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved Gaby over to support the effort. In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and purchases) remain in Argentina. I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be supported best with their respective local legal talent.Please let me know your thoughts. MFG

The document falls short of describing howto use the method in practice, but rathergives some general motivation. I am confidentthat I myself could not develop an algorithmbased on this document, unless all of thederivative valuation functions are explicit(and rather nice) functionswith explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which casethe VAR problem is not so hard in any case,as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case.(My comment here is critical of exposition.I do not suggest that the proposed methodis weak!)2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Panaddresses only normal returns is notcorrect. The main point of our paper was to allowfor jumps, including fat tails and skewness.The comment that we rely on delta-gammais a good criticism,and the main potentialadvantage of the reliability approach,if it works in practical cases.3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines fromthe bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 linesfrom the bottom.5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) doesnot mention what machine was used.6. The example (page 8) doesnot really have much non-normality. Skewness=0,and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?)are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosisis an extra order of magnitude, with lotsof skewness.Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot,and left me wanting more clarity,and a cookbook.I hope `events' at Enron have not made thingsdifficult for you.I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.Warmest personal regards, Darrell> X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft Exchange V6.0.4418.65> content-class: urn:content-classes:message> MIME-Version: 1.0> Subject: The first document for audit> Date: Mon, 16 Jul 2001 12:47:45 -0500> X-MS-Has-Attach:> X-MS-TNEF-Correlator:> Thread-Topic: The first document for audit> Thread-Index: AcEOH2t+YrCeSfbQQ9uW1MfwNSwcgg==> From: "Kaminski, Vince J" <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com>> To: <duffie@Stanford.EDU>> Cc: <vkaminski@aol.com>> X-OriginalArrivalTime: 16 Jul 2001 17:48:09.0130 (UTC)FILETIME=[79ADE8A0:01C10E1F]> X-UIDL: 1c3d3038b819e9d553dd6b2f57734529>> Darrell,>> I am sending you the first document for review.

Open Seaso=n is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=ge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=ne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=se the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=stem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=rth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=es from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an= 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=x with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=thern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and= trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=ect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=ive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=ern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=tural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,= have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=ject attractive.     "As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=ne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=ers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=acity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets," commented Michael Morrel=l, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. "The increased storage and t=ransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=ices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas."      S=RP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =Areghini, concurred.  "As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=ng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability= to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=ng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=mers and others in the Southwest for many years."     "The additional natur=al gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=specially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to= help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest," said Dwain Boettcher, v=ice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. "The ho=urly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =transform the way storage service is offered in the future."     Customers =participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=ed flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=s supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=r portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=nergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=ulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =Open Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of= the Open Season.

Parental GuaranteesLavo/Mark, although it has been a chronic problem, the seemingly inexcusable delay at processing guarantees by Enron Corp. (both Enron Corp. and Counterparty) seems to be getting worse of late.  It is becoming an impediment to transacting and to our reputation in the market as the largest and most responsive energy marketer.  As you know, our business is essentially transacted off Enron Corp.'s credit, and procuring guarantees is often unnecessarily difficult and time consuming.  I know that Commercial, Credit and Legal are all frustrated by the process.  I know Bill is seeing if there is something he can do, but I was wondering whether there was also something you could do to speak to this issue in Houston.Peter.

If you ever needto  leave the  list,  you  will find  the  necessary instructions  below.Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  allfuture subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mailfolder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that youare subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go onvacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill upyour  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcomemessages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive aftersubscribing to a new list.To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,just send mail  to RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. This is  called "sending mailto the  list", because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERVmakes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address(RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG)  is also  called the  "list address".  You mustnever try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributedto all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the"LISTSERV  address",   LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.  It   is  veryimportant to understand  the difference between the  two, but fortunatelyit is  not complicated. The  LISTSERV address is  like a FAX  number thatconnects you  to a  machine, whereas  the list address  is like  a normalvoice line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial theFAX number  when you  wanted to talk  to someone on  the phone,  you willquickly realize  that you used the  wrong number and call  again. No harmwill have been done. If on the  other hand you accidentally make your FAXcall  someone's  voice  line,  the  person receiving  the  call  will  beinconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. Thefact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to thevoice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop doesnot mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number.People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way withmailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  orthousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect alot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the listaddress.You may leave the list at any  time by sending a "SIGNOFF RRGA-L" commandto LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You can also tell LISTSERV how youwant it to confirm  the receipt of messages you send to  the list. If youdo not trust  the system, send a "SET RRGA-L  REPRO" command and LISTSERVwill send you a  copy of your own messages, so that you  can see that themessage was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a whileyou  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mailprogram does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informsyou that new mail has arrived from  RRGA-L. If you send a "SET RRGA-L ACKNOREPRO" command, LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead,which  will look  different in  your  mailbox directory.

The bottom line is that the outcome of the election is unlikely to adversely impact the pace of energy sector deregulation in Japan. There are a couple of reasons:(a) the LDP is a status quo party  - no single leader is powerful enough to radically change the policy direction of the party; and(b) the LDP represents only one pillar of the policy making triangle, which includes the bureaucracy and large industry.However, the choice of leader will impact market sentiment and the Japanese economy as a whole, which in turn will have an indirect impact on the pace of reform.Basic Energy Law Bill. John, you are probably starting to see press on the progression of the Basic Energy Law Bill. The Bill recently moved up for consideration by the LDP Energy sub- committee, the committee headed by Mr Y Kamei. We are still confident that the Bill will not pass beyond Mr Kamei's committee. Mr  Y Kamei and METI are opposed to the Bill. In addition, there is growing opposition from politicians representing environmental and anti-nuclear interests.In the unlikely event that the Bill does receive the approval of Mr Kamei's committee, its passage is likely to be delayed until after the election for party president and the upper house elections in July. Further, the Bill is currently in summary form and will need to be drafted in full, with due consideration given to the impact on existing laws, a process that takes some time.In the meantime, our lobbying efforts continue:The US Government is fully briefed and stands ready to intervene if the Bill progresses further. In addition, the USG voiced their opposition to the Bill last week during a visit to Washington by the promoter of the Bill, Mr Kanno a member of the LDP and an ex TEPCO VP.The Nikkei newspaper is likely to run an editorial on the Bill in the next week or so, aided by information from Enron.We are using our position in the "new entrants" group to lobby the Japanese Government.We continue to keep Y Kamei informed on an informal basis.Transmission Access.Following on from our discussion last Thursday, Enron Japan will be making an application almost immediately with Kyushu Electric for transmission access in connection with a transaction Morton Eric is running. The transaction will raise several regulatory issues and, if successful, will give us an SSEUB "licence" and access to the economic power exchange (Keizai Yuzu).kind regards

I can change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.

My former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to these deals.

We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.

The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

Jeff Merola has been working on how we can do physical delivery and how we can address this issue.  I know he thinks it is a roadblock, but not necessarily an insurmountable one.  On the other hand, this is another way to focus on the issue of wanting a PJM-type model and perhaps the next step would be to educate ICC Commissioners and Staff on the problem.

We will try to confirmthis tomorrow.As lawyers, please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of anyfurther assistance.> Christopher J. Townsend> Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe> 203 N. LaSalle Street> Chicago, IL 60601> (312) 368-4039 (direct line)> (312) 630-6300 (direct fax)> christopher.townsend@piperrudnick.com>Energy Imbalances1.Jurisdictional IssuesThe ARES Coalition, Alliant, and IIEC argued that the Commissionshould address energy imbalances in the proceeding.  Enron and NewEnergyabandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properlyaddressed within Edison's OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protractedlitigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission wouldnot address the propriety of FERC's asserted authority over energy imbalanceissues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way"waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service atsome future time."2.Factual & Policy IssuesEdison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customerscontaining the following provisions:*Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour andsettlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour's imbalances;*For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2MW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs ("OPC"),regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;**Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their ownindividual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% ofOPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discountsapplicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discountbelow.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:**From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  willapply under this provision.**From January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discountwill apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%or more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,the adder/discount shall apply to all hours.**Starting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to thoseRESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hoursof the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discountshall apply to all hours.*Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalanceattributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourlyimbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is withinthe 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, asnoted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, inaggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, butimbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadbandseparately from all RES load.*Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, beforeapplying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this featurewill allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchangingoverscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the samehour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison'sOPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to theopening of the trading window.**The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be chargedan adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs whoare out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceedstheir individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-shareof the amount by which these individual RESs' imbalances exceed theirindividual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separatelyfrom charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, anyadder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billedseparately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.**Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling withseasonal adjustments.  Edison will not require the installation of intervaldemand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time.**Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth (i.e.,no adders/discounts) when the imbalances are due to (1) Edison interruptionsand restorations, or (2) customer force majeure events, that are in eachcase material to the RESs' schedule and of which the RES could notreasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule.**Edison will include a description of the methodology for determiningOPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC.The IIEC opposed Edison's proposal and requested that the Commissionrequire Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distributionlevel.  Blackhawk also opposed Edison's proposal and supported the IIECproposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energyimbalance service at the distribution level.  Mid-American opposed anyeffort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances.The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issueconsistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum forsuch issues.  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in somefuture FERC proceeding.____________________________________________________________________________The information contained in this communication may be confidential, isintended only for the use of the recipient named above, and may be legallyprivileged.

We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.Ben -----Original Message-----From:         Roensch, David  Sent:        Friday, January 25, 2002 8:03 AMTo:        Asante, BenCc:        Whippo, Jeff; Schoolcraft, Darrell; Matthews, Ron; Graves, Jerry; Watson, KimberlySubject:        San Juan Lateral Eff.Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.

"While these actions should provideshort-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers interms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesaleprices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address," saidthe governor. "No combination of state actions can substitute for federalaction to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets."Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to risingelectricity prices in San Diego:On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by allstate facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricityemergency and rolling blackouts.On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the SanFrancisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective onthe price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted tothe governor and released on August 2.On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators totake swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates inCalifornia and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars inrefunds.In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and twoCalifornia-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to takestrong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed toreduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takesnew power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates bynearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &Electric.The governor also reached an agreement with the California GrocersAssociation that will save enough electricity to provide power to between50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed toreduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clintonurging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether currentelectric rates in San Diego were unjust.On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to releaseemergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-risingelectricity bills.On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' requestby releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income SouthernCalifornians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The Presidentalso asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into theoperation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administrationto use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators onlegislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signedtwo bills into law on September 6, 2000.Please see attached letter (below).# # #SEPTEMBER 12, 2000STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVISTO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OFWHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIAThe Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis thatseriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens andbusinesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is theextraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillaryservices, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In SanDiego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare ofresidential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining Californiaelectric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated ratefreeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts forthe first time in our history.As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directedCalifornia regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and theElectricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to takeimmediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate thedamage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy toreport that those measures have been adopted, although not withoutconsiderable resistance from self-interested parties.In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enactfurther relief within the existing framework of options now available to thestate. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expeditegeneration licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction anddemand response and remove constraints in transmission and distributionsystems. I have also established a task force comprised of key stateofficials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency andalternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability andlonger-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, thefundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remainsthe responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action toameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of theCalifornia Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices inCalifornia result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise ofmarket power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market AnalysisDepartment and the Market Surveillance Committee of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behaviorof wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, andsubjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful thatCalifornia wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and becomecapable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot andwill not accept the liabilities to California that result from the currentsituation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all stepsnecessary to restore economic stability to the electric serviceinfrastructure of California.FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just andreasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensurethat a workably competitive market exists before California consumers andCalifornia's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-basedelectricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that theCommission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possibleto restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that haveresulted from the exercise of market power.###OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A00:245FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASESeptember 12, 2000GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAMSACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of MichaelA.

I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.Thanks for writing to me.Love,Dad -----Original Message-----From:         "Kathryn Martin" <kitkatmartin@msn.com>@ENRON  Sent:        Tuesday, November 13, 2001 3:55 PMTo:        Martin, Thomas A.Subject:        HI!DAD HI THIS IS KAT.

Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration.  With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

See below.>>> http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/> A 1960 Moment> Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone> else--something to cheer about.> BY PEGGY NOONAN> Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT> The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so> smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may> turn> this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate> effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los> Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton> fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their> presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe> Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the> world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He> is> independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all> of> the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the> electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him.> But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he> is> an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love> America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and> great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically> conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all> morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a> producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in> California to give him the news and they both got choked up. "This is like> 1960," she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful> when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and> says "What's in your heart is most important."> If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have> been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only> reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr.> Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do> such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore.> I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was> a> little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had> gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics> to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting> and> moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of> joy.> It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this.> And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever> politics> or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone> should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday.> However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following.> Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly> uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be> Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound> bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in> arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just> about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their> side.> The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a> symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our> guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and> co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly> talked> to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie> stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more> helpful.> This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr.> Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right.> Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see> all> of those who love God as part of the same "cultural minority."> Conservative> Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their> political> desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and> such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews.> They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative> gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz> and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians> is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was> wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer> Breakfast last February.> A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that> there's> "no upside" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He> was surprised and said, "He can't even campaign on Saturdays!" I said so> what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first> one day a week.> I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not> campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There> were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none> greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World> Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and> Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too.> Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens> part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are> the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them> forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic> senatorial> candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New> York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot> of> previous bad static.> But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not "Is It Good for> Hillary?" The headline is: "It Is Good for America." It is a wonderful> country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a> member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major> vice> presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding> hurrahs.> This is really a great day. We should all be happy. We really are a> maturing> democracy.

Most all of his questions centered around the determination of the highest value.   Bottom of page 7, last paragragh, we say Shipper call options will be awarded upon the highest rate payable for the  option component. Then in the bullets that follow we say, based on the criteria known in advance-  I told him that we would post the   elements and it would determine the highest value. Then in the next paragraph we say again sold in a bidding process to only those parties that place the highest value  on the option. Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in  33 c) method of awarding options, ?? being is the highest value Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer to the elements that make up the highest   value; volume , rate and termAs you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the highest bid,  I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the option call was for.   We need to clarify these in writing as soon as possible.  I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions.  He said the sooner the better.  We also need to add expriation date on tariff sheet 98 c as to items included in the posting, since it could be different than the exercise date.  I'd say all in all this is good that this is his only concern and that he called before any protests etc.  He said he like the filing-  but was just confused on what we meant by awarding to the highest value.  Susan, I assume you will be drafting the answer, although at this point I haven't seen any protests, let's try to have the answer filed Friday or Monday at the latest.    Please call if questions-  MK

Nemec FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net CorporationHOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.netREMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm     The days of the legal research cartel are waning as firms nationwide revisit the need for onerous ongoing annual contracts in favor of cherry-picking just the right tool for the job from an array of options spawned by the Internet.     For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it. Choosing the right tool for the job is easy once you know your options.http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm--THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE     Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high falutin' icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary. Its a fact that all of these enhancements have caused many attorneys to shun computer research.     TheLaw.net, by contrast, is very easy to use and understand and it is affordable to all. Best of all, we provide a national scope the turns a blind eye to state lines and practice area boundaries.     Our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations and accordingly, you may well always have a relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice-area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the optimum matrix of tools.     Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world:----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter----you may discover that it makes sense to use these services only on a transaction basis when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, faster, for less money     We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning experiences.See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm     General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to resource. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific slice of WestLaw, for example, adding us on as "meter insurance" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut the mustard.     All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed developed the definitive best practices software solution for getting around online; a solution that allows anyone to instantly begin leveraging tens of thousands of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of their online enterprise.--A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW, FLAT-RATE--------$395 annually for you--------$575 for you and a partner--------$1195 for your five-user workgroup--------Unlimited access to everything we have--------30-Day Unconditional Money Back Guarantee--------Enterprise Licenses are also available.See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm     TheLaw.net Custom Browser also delivers a baseline of over 50,000 handcrafted, detailed, menu-driven, deep-links to Federal and state statutes, rules, regulations, forms, courts, executive agency databases, legislative materials, law reviews, dictionaries, encyclopedias, people finders, news, corporate backgrounders, columnists, polls, and nearly 1,000 law office facilitators intended to streamline every day business tasks.

Today we had a meeting with Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman to discuss the private firm model. They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the Moody's Riskcalc model.  I noticed that you also have been looking at RiskCalc - as indicated in your paper entitled "Pricing Parent Companies and their Subsidiaries:  Model Description and Data Requirements" Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test statistics, scores, etc.   Also, you stated that you used Amadeus database.  We are in the process of trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.  In the mean time, may we have access to the Amadeus database or some sample dataset?

Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor GrayDavis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partialpayment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities thissummer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-doormeeting with the governor said.     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are thecompanies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meetingin New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and EdisonInternational's Southern California Edison, the state's largestutilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-buying debt to consumers.     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers toaccept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utilityanalyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York ina meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who werenot allowed to attend.                        No Names Mentioned    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., CalpineCorp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are amongthe biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke aboutforgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians inSacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing theidea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than fullpayment of its debts.    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owedus,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked invery good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into themarket, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and workingwith them to solve the problem.''      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecifiedreserve for possible losses in California, has not been approachedabout debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not addressthe immediate problem of electricity shortages in California thissummer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which hasalready had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more thissummer when power demand surges.                     Buying the Grid     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&ECorp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, thoughhe was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power forFitch Inc.     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E andEdison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmissionlines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money atlow interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement tobuy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talkswith Sempra are continuing.     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&Ecould be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag onlonger, Fetter said.       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conferenceafter the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side ofManhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) andrelatively close with Sempra.''      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get autility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rateincrease, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to beneeded at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'doubts about California's plans to save its utilities frombankruptcy.    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out ofit,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse FirstBoston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a finalsolution in sight.''     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.--Mark Johnson and Jonathan Berr in New York (212) 318-2300 ormjohnson7@bloomberg.net and jberr@bloomberg.net with reporting byMargot Habiby in Dallas and Jim Kennett in Houston/alp

I've been asked to complete this on Monday of next week (sorry for the short notice, I think this decision was made only yesterday). These hedges will be done in a structured hedging facility known as Raptor 2.In order to write the confirms and complete this process, we'll need at least to do the following. We'll need a complete description of the equity interest we're hedging. We'll need the full legal name of the issuer of the equity interest, a full legal description of the equity interest (common stock, preferred stock, warrants, etc.), the number of the certificate (if any) representing the interest  and the number of shares or warrants being hedged.I understand that the hedge will be structured as a price return swap and the initial equity notional amount of the swap will be based on the book value of the equity interest. It would be helpful to see the latest financial statements showing that book value.We will also need to investigate whether any contractual or other legal restrictions may affect our ability to enter into these hedges.This is an initial list that I've prepared very quickly. I'll be reviewing this with Sara later today and will supplement this email as necessary.Randy, I've tried to reach Frank this morning but he is traveling. Can you or someone on your staff assist us on this? Thanks!

We currently have Ken scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.  I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening (6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime in the near future.  Same with Rowe.Rosalee Fleming04/27/2001 07:12 PM To: Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Sherri Sera/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan M Landwehr/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: ken lay tourI received a return call from Lelanie in Governor Davis' office this evening.  She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs.  I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken.  Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.  She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.  Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.  He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2.Talk to you Monday.RosieJanel Guerrero04/27/2001 02:39 PMTo: Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: ken lay tourJust so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be addressed enroute to CA.  Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.

Essentially, I am trying to determine how pervasive the problem is of credit not receiving accrual books with credit risk.  The probable reason for this is that certain books require accrual treatment for accounting purposes.  Once I hear from Debbie/Mark on the message below, I will start working with the individual risk groups.  RegardsShona -----Original Message-----From: Wilson, Shona  Sent:Friday, October 12, 2001 1:42 PMTo:Brackett, Debbie R.; Ruane, MarkCc:Considine, KeithSubject:accrual booksI've been thinking through credit's need for the forward values on 3rd party trades that are treated as accrual for accounting purposes.I'm planning a meeting with the different risk heads to discuss the volume of transactions that fall into this category, but before I do that I need confirmation from you that I fully understand what you need the information for.  If you could, please confirm (or explain what I'm missing in my reasoning) the following in regards to forward values for third party trades treated as accrual for accounting purposes:Margins - you do need these forward values for margining purposes.Credit limit - you do need these forward values when determining total exposure per counterparty against their limits.Analysis - Potential Exposure, margin liquidity, counterparty by curve - I think you would need these positions for your analyses.Credit reserve - the value would not be needed for the credit reserve, as the purpose for the reserve is accounting related.  As these books are treated as accrual for accounting purposes, they should not be considered in the reserve.Once I hear from you I'll work with the different BU's risk groups to see if there any problems with these types of books (problems such as them not being calced daily).  I'd like to meet with them early next week, so if you could get back to me as soon as you can, I'd really appreciate it.Best regardsShona

Since we are moving here from an outline to prose, I thought that a "marked" copy showing changes would be more confusing than helpful. So my sections are in blue text, if you just want to read what I wrote. I leaned heavily on the outlines from Rick and from John Leslie, which I believe everyone will be able to do to save a lot of drafting time.I look forward to receiving the other pieces, and comments or questions on my work, soon. The testimony has to be filed by Friday. John Leslie needs, I suspect, a full day to format, proof, print, and ship the document. So we have a real deadline of, say, noon on Thursday. If we want to give SoCal a peek, then we need to wrap this up by Wed. morning. Michael Rochman  <<Counihan Testimony in SEMPRA v00Apr28mjr.doc>>  - Counihan Testimony in SEMPRA v00Apr28mjr.doc

While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for liquids fallout.

First Message that was sent out:As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote aggressive ideas.  Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Cleveland struggles against most  any==20RB but especially tough, physical rushing teams.? Taylor and the Jaguars fi=t=20that  bill.? This season has seen some  rushing performances of historical==20significance this year.? You might see another one this  week.? On paper, i=t=01,s a dream  matchup.???Tyrone Wheatley (Oak)  vs Steeler Defense?? I know it=01,s hard to believe =but =20the numbers show that over the past four weeks, Pittsburgh ranks # 28 in=20rushing  yards allowed per game.? They=01,re  allowing 171 yards rushing on= the=20ground.?  Granted, Fred Taylor, Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into==20that  number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isn=01,t too far down below thei=r=20class.? He=01,s healthier now than he has been in a  while.Ricky Watters (Sea) vs Falcon  Defense?? I=01,ve been a Ricky Watters fan  =since=20the 49er days.? One of the  best combinations of rushing and receiving in==20some time.? He=01,s had an age defying season and the  roll should continue==20against a Falcon unit that=01,s been awful defending the run  lately.? For =the=20last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed per game.? For th=e=20year, they=01,re # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.??  Eve=ryone=20keeps wondering  when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets==20blown out here (which  I have hard time seeing) I think you=01,ll see plent=y of=20Ricky  Watters.?Corey Dillon (Cin) vs  Cardinal Defense?? Like Fred Taylor vs. Cleveland, ==20this one looks almost too good to be true on paper.? They don=01,t always t=urn=20out that way in  reality but you=01,ve got to be drooling over this game if= you=01,re a Dillon  owner.? His running in the lack of a  real passing game threat==20is an amazing feat.? Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be  effective=20throwing the ball which will help even more.??Prime  Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense??Tony  Richardson / Kimble Anders (KC)? vs  Patriot Defense??  Our support o=f=20Christian Okoye  last week for a Chief RB didn=01,t garner much support fro=m the=20KC coaching staff  so it looks like another week of Richardson / Anders.?==20Anders actually got plenty of carries  last week and promptly did very litt=le=20with them. Richardson appears to be the  better back right now but who know=s=20how this will play out.? It=01,s hard for me to advocate  either.? But if y=ou do=20go with one,  know that they=01,ll be facing a pretty soft New England rush==20defense that ranks #  25 in rushing yards allowed per gameover the  last fo=ur=20weeks.?Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Brad Hoover (Car) vs Rams  Defense???

For==20the year, they rank # 23  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.???J.R.  Redmond (NE) vs Chief Defense?? The Patriots are a tough team to =20figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg ==20rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny.? But if he can hold them==20together, I=01,ve  got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here.? Th=e=20Chiefs rank # 23 over the past four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam=e.? For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  R=B.?

It sounds like Curtis Martin is  ju=st=20going to have to play with the strained buttocks.? (you=01,ve heard enough =jokes=20by now, I=01,ll  spare you)? The Indy defense is  definitely vulnerable to =the=20rush.?  For the season, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the=20opposing  RBs.? This game will be in New York  and the Colts are soft when =it=01,s cold outside so Martin could have an  edge.?James Allen (Chi) vs Green  Bay?? Let=01,s give Allen the benefit of  the d=oubt=20and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced.? (although I didn=01,t =see=20Curtis Martin  fumble three times and he was there too=01()?

This is one of ==20those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper.?=20Jacksonville has yielded an average of  120 yards rushing per game over the==20last four weeks.? That ranks them # 20.? They also rank # 20 for the year i=n =20Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs.? But they=01,re playing better =than=20that now  I believe.? And the Browns are just  playing out the season.? And==20the  bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel==20White has  looked impressive.? It=01,s a decent  matchup for Cleveland but =I=01,d=20probably shy from these guys if it were  me.?Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense?? A case of both sides being bette=r =20than what many people think.?  Michael Pittman is a player.?  Since Vince==20Tobin left, it=01,s been pretty much Pittman=01,s show on the  ground much =to the=20chagrin of Thomas Jones owners.? And on the other side of the ball, the =20Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for.? On the ground, they==20rank # 17 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.?

I=01,d feel ok with Pittman if he was= my =20guy but I wouldn=01,t be overly excited.?Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense??

Granted, 3 of those games  don==01,t=20factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have ==20thought.? The Bills rushing game is  a mess.? The team is calling Morris=01=, =20ankle questionable so we=01,ll have to wait and see.? Bryson has done very==20little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn=01,t produce or we woul=d=20have never seen so much  of Bryson and Morris.? With a  healthy Zach Thomas=,=20I=01,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.????Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense?? Emmitt Smith said he=01,d never =been =20knocked out in his career but that=01,s what happened Thursday.? He=01,s bo=unced=20back quickly and says he=01,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.?  The Bucs= are=20tough but not invincible.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in=20rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.?==20Emmitt=01,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his==20career so I=01,m not overly  concerned with the matchup.? He=01,s a  gamer =and I=01,d=20say he=01,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa= Bay.Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense??  Be very leery  here.? Stephen Dav=is=20demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of==20salt.? Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recoveri=ng=20from injury.?  Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w=as=20sure he=01,d  start, I=01,d think very hard about going elsewhere this week=.? It=01,s=20not like he=01,s facing Seattle and  this is a dream matchup or something.?=  The=20Giants are tough against the run ranking # 2 for the year in Fantasy  Point=s=20allowed to the opposing RB. ?So unless you know for sure he=01,s going,  I==01,d=20strongly consider my other options.?Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib ==20fracture which must sound worse than it is.? Either that or he=01,s one tou=gh=20guy.? The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense==20lately.?  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushi=ng=20yards  allowed per game.? That=01,s a marked  contrast to their year long==20numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.=?=20Adding  Fletcher=01,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don=01,t see much fro=m San=20Diego on the  ground Sunday.?Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins??  To me, Barber is  looking muc=h=20more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don=01,t see  New= York=20taking a lead where they can grind out the clock.? If you=01,re a Dayne own=er,=20you=01,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in==20favor of Barber  when his team trails.? The Giants  are a good team but I d=on=01,t see them jumping all over Washington.? Plus, the Redskins play very good==20rush  defense.? For the year, they rank #  4 in Fantasy Points allowed to t=he=20opposing RB and over the last four weeks,  they rank # 8 in rushing yards==20allowed per game.???James Stewart (Det) vs Viking  Defense?? Stewart=01,s great game against Ta=mpa =20Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but he=01,s go=t a =20surprisingly tough situation here.?  Minnesota over the last four weeks ran=ks=20# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? For the year, they rank # 14  in==20Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Part of that has to do with the==20Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up==20but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there.? LB Dwayne Rud=d=20should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I=01,m==20still not overly excited about the  matchup.? Still though, Stewart is  one==20of the better backs and I=01,d think he=01,s likely a starter for your team= unless =20you=01,re loaded with RBs.???Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense?Darnell  Autry / Stanley Pritchett (Phi) vs Titan Defense??  The Eagle RBs==20have been very little factor and I don=01,t see them all of a  sudden emerg=ing=20against a very tough Tennessee defense.? Especially one in a foul mood afte=r =20another last second loss from the kicker.?  It=01,s a tough job, but QB Don=ovan=20McNabb carries this team almost solely  on his shoulders.? He could be the ==20teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs.? For th=e=20year, the Titans rank # 6  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.??=?Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense?? I like Mike Anderson and he=01,s a= =20great story but he=01,s got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans=.?=20The Saints rank # 3 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing==20RB and over the last four games, they  rank # 5 in rushing yards allowed pe=r=20game.? They=01,ve just averaged 81 yards per game  allowed rushing.? Anders=on is=20still  probably worth a start unless you=01,re really deep at RB but just b=e=20aware he=01,s  facing a tough defense.?Charlie Garner (SF) vs Charger  Defense?? With a week off to prepare, Garne=r =20comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first =20victory.? They=01,re playing rush  defense like we=01,re accustomed to seei=ng from=20San Diego ranking # 4 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four==20weeks.? Garner isn=01,t your normal back but he=01,s  facing a tough game h=ere.? I=01,d still  start him as he=01,s got that big play potential with the ability =to go=20the  distance at any time, but I=01,m not excited about the  matchup.?Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense?? Jerome Bettis was built for =20grinding down defenses in the December cold but he=01,ll have a tough match=up=20this  week against Oakland.? The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks==20in rushing yards allowed per game.? That=01,s partly why their passing defe=nse =20is so bad: teams can=01,t run so they go to the air.? I like Bettis and I t=hink=20he=01,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a=20difficult matchup  here.?Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense??

Over the last four weeks, they rank # 3  in rushing yards allowed per==20game allowing an average of 74 yards per game.? Ricky Watters and Seattle==20only managed  to post 85 against them Sunday.?

I believe SW is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the "event". I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes you feel like you're getting squeezed...At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either through a buyer or a settlement with SW.I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort.
