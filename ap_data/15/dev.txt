Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.  Thanks.

My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September.

Stephen Davis [mailto:csdlaw@pacbell.net]Sent:   Wednesday, April 04, 2001 8:33 AMTo:   Steven KellyCc:   Douglas K. KernerSubject:   Proposed Windfall Profit TaxGentlemen:       I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of theCalifornia Legislature is contemplating a charge against theelectric-generating industry in retaliation for recent price increases. Thecharge is to be styled as a "windfall profit tax" modeled on PresidentCarter's tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in1980 (The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, 26 USC 4986 et seq.).The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between thecurrent wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price setby Congress, multiplied by the applicable rate. I understand the Californiacharge will similarly be calculated by reference to a 1999 base price andcurrent prices, to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied.You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirmfrom either a policy or legal perspective. The basic policy problem is thatthe tax will discourage sales of electricity in California.  California willbecome the market of last resort.  Another problem is that the Tax might beseen as promoting a "California First" policy at the expense of otherstates. This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC ratebase as  "taxes other than income taxes," and thereby be shifted to othercustomers.       The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well. The principal problem ispreemption by The Federal Power Act. The states are prohibited fromregulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce.The proposed charge, whether called a "windfall profit tax" or an excise taxor a sales or use tax or something else, is underground rate making. Thereis little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on allrevenues measured with reference to a certain price point from theperspective of the interstate electric wholesaler. Thus, the burden oninterstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenuesusing a price base is comparable.       The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the priceallowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return. Theproposed historical base price will not, for example, reflect recent fuelprice increases.       Two other potential issues arise as well. First, the tax has many ofthe hallmarks of a use tax, i.e., the tax is levied on the purchase of goodsfrom an out-of-state provider for delivery to and use in California. Thegross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales anduse tax for more than 50 years. Rev. & Tax. Code Section 6353. While thisstatute could, presumably, be amended, doing so would be a major policydeparture and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales. Asecond concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a resultof the Legislature's meddling in rate regulation.       I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed awindfall profit tax on electricity sales.       The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening withDoug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research. The issues are complex andcould not be much developed in the time available. This material is bestviewed as informed "issue spotting."   Nevertheless, I feel strongly thatthe proposed "Tax" can fairly be characterized as rate making.Very Truly Yours, C. Stephen Davis

While this is good news for those of us fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their resources in that effort.My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and execute a "full court press" defense which is proactive as we move into increased future efforts at the  Federal level by the Alliance through their other front organizations.  These organizations have been created to burden pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests.From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but  these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I have seen and heard.  AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing. Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable, experienced and capable. They have been through this battle and other battles in the past.  So this is not a criticism, but just a friendly observation from a remote vantage point, that if the entire pipeline industry does not develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the next year, we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety regulation perspective.  It has been my experience with the Alliance in the past, that to any extent they are successful,  they will then multiply their efforts and broaden their field of attack.The issue is not safety of pipelines, but competition for the transportation of energy.  We have an industry that can be very proud of it's record of safety, economic benefits, reliability, public service, energy efficiency and environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of transporting energy.  We have learned from our experiences, research and mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve.  Our entire energy pipeline industry (natural gas and petroleum) needs to shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime competition. Thanks for your interest.  This is a "heads-up" that is probably not needed, but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very difficult current and future issue.

The state hasmade an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up wheneverit's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds."Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment lateThursday.Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, hasdrafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday orSaturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity tofinance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts,aides in his office said.Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who usethe least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aidessaid.Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For StateThe 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billionannually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected togenerate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, thecommissioners said.Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissionerssaid.Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricityon behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit SouthernCalifornia Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric andPG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, whichmust be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-termpower supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensurethere is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance thecontracts are likely, state officials have said.But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit theutilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutionsthat there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billionin revenue bonds to be sold.The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said stateTreasurer Phil Angelides.The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another ratehike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming toterms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power sincelast year.After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation ofCalifornia utility executives and energy officials, talks broke downMonday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. GrayDavis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, whichcould have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to SteveMaviglio, press secretary to Davis.An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionsaid Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refundsto California because the state's utilities owe far more money to thegenerators than what he thinks the state is owed.-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com

The only item that has occurred recently (which really doesn't appear to have been a problem)  Their Jan. reservation invoice was revised and billed with a due date of 2/20 (this is an automatic defualt in TSS & must be overriden).  Thus, they delayed payment until Cynthia followed up when they didn't pay timely.  Otherwise, Cynthia indicates she hasn't had anything significant occur.  Sheila

Only Detroit Edison's Transcoproposal comes close to our initial vision.  Given that what is most likelyis a bunch of not-for-profit ISOs being created in the East and West, whynot re-establish our position.  This meeting gives us an opportunity toreally set up this distinction and draw some "bottom lines".JimTo:   Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@ENRONcc:   Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ENRON, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES@ENRON, Joe      Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeff Brown/HOU/EES@EESSubject:  Re: EEI Conference Series on RTOs and Markets: Mark Your      Calendars  (Document link: James D Steffes)From what ESCA was telling us, I don't think that they typically would goto these as speakers.   However, it may be something they would want to doto promote their systems (hopefully that will be consistent with the Enronmodel).Since Scott Miller and Massey of FERC are on the agenda 9/28-29 , it maymake sense for Enron to make sure that Ed Cazulet of APX and the Cal PXpeople on the agenda are promoting the "Enron" model.  Cal PX is coming innext week.Steven J Kean@ENRON08/21/2000 07:33 AMSent by:  Steven J Kean@ENRONTo:   Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT, Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT, James D      Steffes/HOU/EES@EEScc:Subject:  EEI Conference Series on RTOs and Markets: Mark Your CalendarsShould we (or ESCA) start looking for opportunities like this now to getthe word out?---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 08/21/200007:30 AM ---------------------------"Christina Forbes" <CFORBES@eei.org> on 08/18/2000 02:54:52 PMTo:   <Anthony.Duenner@enron.com>, <chris.gaffney@enron.com>,      <dallegre@enron.com>, <ddorman@enron.com>, <dfossum@enron.com>,      <eaafedt@enron.com>, <fbay@enron.com>, <fking@enron.com>,      <jhartso@enron.com>, <JKeller@enron.com>, <jsteffe@enron.com>,      <julia.murray@enron.com>, <Lhuber@enron.com>, <mary.hain@enron.com>,      <meyer@enron.com>, <mpavlou@enron.com>, <rfrank@enron.com>,      <scorman@enron.com>, <scovino@enron.com>, <skean@enron.com>,      <snovose@enron.com>, <stweed@enron.com>cc:Subject:  EEI Conference Series on RTOs and Markets: Mark Your CalendarsEEI is pleased to announce a three-conference series addressing RTOs andelectricity market design.*  RTOs and Market Design:  How to Get Electricity Markets to Work.September 28 and 29, Hilton Washington Embassy Row.Current draft agenda attached.

We run a report that checks the east positions to ensure that we as a company are flat on a daily basis.  Every morning that I can remember for the past few weeks one or all of the real-time desks are not flat with the term or cash books causing our group to spend time finding the problem and than fixing it.  We have a noon deadline to report P&L to  upper management.  When we miss this deadline we are forced to document the causes to the Corporate reporting group.  We are normally able to rush through and meet our deadline in the nick of time.  Could you please institute a policy in which the night group checks the positions and ensures that all of the real-time desks are flat prior to 6:30 A.M.  I know we keep bugging you about this problem but it needs to be addressed as we have reached a point where our group cannot even start our daily tasks until 9:30 - 10:00 every day.  When we came in this morning the only real-time desk to be flat was the Hourly Midwest desk.  Let me know if our group can help in any way.Thank youDonnie Vinson

She confirmed for me that none of the conditions in Section 18 would allow us to recover either the option consideration ($5000) or the purchase price ($265,000).  Further, the language at the end of Section 20 specifically states that the option consideration is true option consideration and is deemed earned by the Optionors upon receipt.Based upon our discussions this afternoon, I will let Kay know that you are comfortable with the agreement being executed in its current form.Thanks,Fred

The SO2 marks for both the underlying and volatility positions currently in the 2007 through 2010 timeframe create a value differential of $2.6 million between our evaluation and their marks.  For the sake of not continuing the unproductive task of negotiating this value, we will move forward to transfer despite our differences.I strongly recommend continuing to use and pay for all personnel in risk, documentation and settlement that currently perform these duties for emissions. I would like to utilize these resources until further notice.  I am not comfortable committing to any transfer of risk, documentation and settlement duties until we have the time to evaluate this further.  I would appreciate if you could help on this matter to ensure a smooth transition.KJM

TheEnron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed ata specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored untilfurther notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived onP:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicatecopy elsewhere on the network.'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volumeneeded from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to thesupply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  Forthe current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated usingthe previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gasday is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was infact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, thechange is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less theFirst-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since thefirst-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., Iftoday is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect tothe first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additionalpurchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheetshould be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that wetake or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA atpre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes orfor swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated.'Comments':Doug KinneyPh:  703-561-6339Fax:  703-561-7317 - 08-30-00 daily vols.xls

Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain other items we raised during our meeting.  Nevertheless, your input is required on the following:1.  We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if Delta /  Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages.  Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that approach.2.  We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility Agreement that would be part of our transaction.3.  Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project.4.  Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below.5.  Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and whether we need to respond in writing.  Sheila Tweed's position was not to.6.  John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time charged within the Blue Dog file?Thanks and we'll talk tomorrow.----- Forwarded by Carlos Sole/NA/Enron on 03/05/2001 05:46 PM -----        Jake Thomas@ECT        03/05/2001 02:34 PM                                 To: Stephen Thome/HOU/ECT@ECT                 cc: Carlos Sole/NA/Enron@Enron                 Subject: Re: Initial Draft of LLC Documents with Panda EnergySee Comments in Red BelowStephen Thome03/05/2001 12:23 PMTo: Jake Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Carlos Sole/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Initial Draft of LLC Documents with Panda Energy  Jake,  Do you want to make suggestions with regard to #3, #7, #13Please advise of the following additional information in order that we may completethe enclosed documents:1.

Andthere are cheaper ones....that you can buy at Sam's or other warehouses andput up yourself......However, I picked out two that could go with our fort and sandbox out thereand really provide the swinging and climbing part of the playscape.  It wasaffordable and they come out and set it up.I would like to order soon.  They can have it too the Perd in about threeweeks.

He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway!Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything interesting happens I'll let you know.

In order to accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is doing off of HPL's pipe.I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will this give me everything that I need?Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!Thanks in advance.

It is my understanding that special ordered sets are recognized automatically (internally) by Cplex. This seems to be the case for both Cplex and OSL according to AMPL's web page and other references (check http://www.ampl.com/cm/cs/what/ampl/FAQ/index.html#HowcanIusethesolver'sspecialorderedsetsfeature). As a result, the Cplex people feel that there is no need to provide the user with the tools to represent special-ordered sets in OPL. As a matter of fact, the incapability of Xpress to recognize them automatically concerns me. If you have special requirements, C code may be used to pass the information to the solver (which is straight forward; all of Chonawee's testing was done this way). Chonawee's benchmark shows a superior performance by Cplex (which you indicated yourself in an earlier message).If you feel that Xpress is the only way to go, then feel free to purchase it (the purchase order is on hold for the time being). However, we need to check with Vince first. I strongly feel that we should have one solver in order to minimize cost and contractual headaches.Let us try to get this issue resolved by this afternoon. Thanks.-Samer

I know for a fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's "Enron" files left on EB38.

Don Schultz and a couple of his partners have substantial litigation experience both for and against the S.D. tribes (Ogalla Sioux, etc.) on federal jurisdictional issues.  One of Don's partners is general counsel of the Rushmore Electric Cooperative in Western South Dakota and has had dealings with the tribes on right of way issues for years.   They have cleared conflicts, and are available  if we ever need a third opinion or if we get into a spat with the tribes elsewhere.  Sorry it took me so long to run this to ground.  Thanks. DF

LaSalle Street> Chicago, IL 60601> (312) 368-4039 (direct line)> (312) 630-6300 (direct fax)> christopher.townsend@piperrudnick.com>                Energy Imbalances                1.        Jurisdictional Issues        The ARES Coalition, Alliant, and IIEC argued that the Commissionshould address energy imbalances in the proceeding.  Enron and NewEnergyabandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properlyaddressed within Edison's OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.        The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protractedlitigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission wouldnot address the propriety of FERC's asserted authority over energy imbalanceissues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way"waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service atsome future time."                2.        Factual & Policy Issues        Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customerscontaining the following provisions:*        Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour andsettlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour's imbalances;*        For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2MW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs ("OPC"),regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;**        Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their ownindividual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% ofOPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discountsapplicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discountbelow.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:**        From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  willapply under this provision.**        From January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discountwill apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%or more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,the adder/discount shall apply to all hours.**        Starting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to thoseRESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hoursof the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discountshall apply to all hours.*        Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalanceattributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourlyimbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is withinthe 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, asnoted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, inaggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, butimbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadbandseparately from all RES load.*        Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, beforeapplying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this featurewill allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchangingoverscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the samehour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison'sOPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to theopening of the trading window.**        The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be chargedan adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs whoare out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceedstheir individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-shareof the amount by which these individual RESs' imbalances exceed theirindividual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separatelyfrom charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, anyadder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billedseparately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.**        Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling withseasonal adjustments.  Edison will not require the installation of intervaldemand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time.**        Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth (i.e.,no adders/discounts) when the imbalances are due to (1) Edison interruptionsand restorations, or (2) customer force majeure events, that are in eachcase material to the RESs' schedule and of which the RES could notreasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule.**        Edison will include a description of the methodology for determiningOPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC.        The IIEC opposed Edison's proposal and requested that the Commissionrequire Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distributionlevel.  Blackhawk also opposed Edison's proposal and supported the IIECproposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energyimbalance service at the distribution level.  Mid-American opposed anyeffort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances.        The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issueconsistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum forsuch issues.  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in somefuture FERC proceeding.____________________________________________________________________________The information contained in this communication may be confidential, isintended only for the use of the recipient named above, and may be legallyprivileged.

But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.

I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.Louise -----Original Message-----From:         Richter, Brad  Sent:        Tuesday, August 28, 2001 2:39 PMTo:        Kitchen, LouiseCc:        Webb, JaySubject:        RE: eNYMEXBob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.Brad -----Original Message-----From:         Kitchen, Louise  Sent:        Tuesday, August 28, 2001 8:34 AMTo:        Piper, Greg; Leach, DougCc:        Richter, Brad; Webb, JaySubject:        RE: eNYMEXI am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex. -----Original Message-----From:         Piper, Greg  Sent:        Wednesday, August 08, 2001 3:14 AMTo:        Leach, Doug; Kitchen, LouiseCc:        Richter, Brad; Webb, Jay; Whalley, GregSubject:        RE: eNYMEXI would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.

Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Unicredito Banca Mobiliare is planning to become a market maker for credit derivatives in Italy. It is looking at credit default swaps, total return swaps, and credit default options, and will likely be a market maker in these products by the second half of next year. JUMBO CANADIAN PENSION FUND TO PUMP UP EQUITY DERIVATIVES USE.  The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, with CAD72 billion (USD48.42 billion) under management, is looking to explore equity derivatives strategies. One of the most sophisticated end users in Canada, the fund is looking at starting a range accrual options and options overwriting program. INDIAN ASSET MANAGERS DIVE INTO SWAPS.  A bevy of Indian asset managers are jumping into the rupee-denominated interest-rate swap market for the first time, which market players believe could boost liquidity. High interest-rate volatility, a better brokered market, and more future interest rate uncertainty are drawing the asset managers in droves. ______________________________________________ Use your User ID and Password to access the entire site.

This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.     Thanks, Tony JarrettBenefitsExt. 3- 7829

TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines. If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.   I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now. Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all. Lynn

In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Laird

I assume we would want FERC to have to approve their budget, correct?  When you say "not industry funding" -- where else would it come from?  I assume we don't want to allow the "piper to call the tune" so to speak based on who pays the bill?  My recollection is that in the NERC version of the bill they "walled off" the funding in a manner we would find objectionable, but let me double check that fact.

Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). Or is our focus still only gas and power?

I return from Argentina this weekend.  I am having some problems with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return. I am traveling with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of the daily problems which I have.  The problems are:1.  Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message:  "This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client  - YES or NO"2.  "Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk.  File is in use by another program.  Delete the file and create a new workspace?"Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related to.  I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word.  When can we review these problems?  Thanks.  Sara

Thanks!  JeanMarch 26, 2001MEMORANDUMTo:    IEPFr:     Ray McNally, Richard Temple, Tony Russo, Jean Munoz, Tom RossRe:   Initiative Campaign Strategy OutlineHarvey Rosenfield has on numerous occasions threatened to place an initiative on the 2002 ballot to re-regulate the power industry.It is not a hollow threat.Not only has Rosenfield successfully placed initiatives on the ballot in the past, but the current energy crisis has become the number one issue on the minds of voters dd making it easier to qualify a ballot measure.  And our own internal polling for IEP shows voters would initially support the concept of re-regulating the industry.However, qualifying an initiative for next year?s election is not a foregone conclusion.  And passing one is an even more difficult task.Rosenfield faces several roadblocks:o    The current energy issue is complicated, and all potential solutions have weaknesses that could be exploited in a political campaign.o    IEP?s internal polling shows Rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses that could be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state-run energy department that could be compared to the DMV and CalTrans.o    Rosenfield would have a difficult time funding a campaign, especially raising the resources to overcome a strong, well funded "no" campaign.o    The burden of "proof" always falls on the "yes" campaign rather than the "no" campaign.  Voters are concerned about giving their approval to changes that could make things worse.  Rosenfield will have to prove his case beyond a shadow of a doubt, and therefore it is easier to defeat an initiative than it is to pass one. o    If power generators become motivated they can be a formidable opponent.Following is (1) a preliminary timeline Rosenfield would face in trying to qualify an initiative for the ballot in 2002, (2) strategic concepts that should be considered before pursuing a plan to defeat the initiative, (3) preliminary strategic and tactical options in opposing the initiative, and (4) a discussion of campaign costs.We recommend using this outline as a starting point to develop an effective campaign plan that could successfully defeat Rosenfield if he pursues an initiative strategy.TimelineTo date, no proposed ballot initiative has been submitted to the Attorney General for title and summary.  Accordingly, there is not sufficient time available to qualify an initiative for the March 2002 ballot.  However, there is still adequate time to qualify a measure for the November 2002 ballot.  We believe Rosenfield could submit a measure to the Attorney General as late as September, 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the November 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power blackouts, skyrocketing energy bills, and the image of a bungling Governor, legislature and regulators.The following timeline would allow Rosenfield to submit language for title and summary as late as September 28, 2001 and qualify the initiative for the November 2002 ballot:September 28, 2001Proposed measure is submitted to the AG for title and summary.November 20, 2001Attorney General prepares and issues title and summary.  Proponent can begin circulating petitions.April 19, 2002The proponent files the petitions with county elections officials.May 1, 2002County elections officials complete petition raw count totals and certify raw numbers to the Secretary of State.June 23, 2002County elections officials verify and certify results of the number of valid signatures in their counties and turn in counts to the Secretary of State.June 27, 2002Secretary of State determines if the initiative qualifies for the ballot. Proponent needs 670,816 valid signatures to qualify a constitutional amendment or 419,260 valid signatures to qualify a straight statute.Strategic ConceptsThere are several strategic concepts that should be reviewed:o    While satisfying Rosenfield may be impossible, IEP could push hard to ensure a "solution" is passed by the legislature to give credibility to the criticism that Rosenfield is an extremist whose initiative could undercut the legislative remedy.o    The industry could organize a well-funded campaign that contains an early advertising blitz to quickly define the ballot measure in the most negative manner possible, and that delivers a knock out punch in October.o    Generators could promote a counter-initiative proposal, either through the legislature or qualified by petition dd stopping Rosenfield?s proposal if more "yes" votes are received for the counter initiative than the Rosenfield measure.o    Paid signature gathering firms could be put on contract for industry-related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for Rosenfield.  Another variation would be to hire firms to gather signatures calling for legislative action dd thus gaining names of voters who support our position, but also keeping signature gatherers too busy to help Rosenfileld. o    The industry could pay to gather signatures on petitions that removes names of people who may have signed the petition for Rosenfield?s initiative.  This could cut down the number of valid signatures accepted by county election officials.o    A paid advertising campaign could be run during the proposal?s signature gathering phase urging voters not to sign the petitions.  An added benefit of the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the ballot. o    We could organize a legal assault on the proposal dd stopping their signature gathering efforts or keeping it off the ballot.Campaign StrategyIf the proposal qualifies for the ballot, the industry must pursue an aggressive strategy to defeat the measure.  We need to identify weaknesses in the proposal and share those weaknesses with voters.  We must also push voters to question the motives behind the initiative.  We need to make sure voters are uncomfortable with all or portions of the initiative to ensure they vote no despite wanting adequate and affordable energy.The campaign should conduct thorough research to determine the best strategy to defeat the measure.  Initially we believe the "no" campaign should focus on testing and developing the following messages:o    The measure will hurt taxpayers.  A $40 billion price tag is too much for voters to accept as the only solution to the problem.o    The proposal will hurt public services.  The cost of Rosenfield?s measure will keep money away from more important programs  dd like schools, public safety and programs for children and seniors.o    The ballot measure is simply a way for elected officials to get more tax dollars to cover up their failures dd and they should not be rewarded with public support.o    Rosenfield?s proposal will result in higher taxes to pay for more bureaucracy and wasted tax dollars.o    The proposal will result in more inefficient government that will produce unreliable power dd hurting consumers, and vital services such as hospitals and public safety.o    The measure will hurt the economy and cost jobs at a time when the economy is hurting.Campaign Tactics The campaign should follow an aggressive battleplan that includes the following components:ResearchFocus groups and quantitative surveys should be conducted to help craft the best messages to attack the proposal.  This research would also be important in efforts to secure the most favorable ballot title and summary possible to our goal of defeating it.Demographic and election research should also be conducted to determine voters most open to our campaign messages.  We should also conduct thorough research on Rosenfield to expose his true motivations for proposing this measure and its inherent weaknesses.Legal, Title & Summary, and Ballot Argument ChallengesWe should pursue every possible legal option to either get the proposal off the ballot, or ensure the most favorable title & summary and weakened ballot arguments for the initiative sponsors.  Our experience shows that the ballot title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 points.Paid AdvertisingStatewide campaigns in California require paid advertising dd including electronic media, direct mail, and telemarketing.  Advertising should be carefully targeted to ensure the most "bang for the buck."Earned MediaEditorial support is an important part of successful statewide campaigns, as is ensuring favorable media coverage of the campaign.  A focused earned media campaign would greatly enhance the chances for success and editorial support and Op-Ed?s can provide important third party credibility to the no campaign.Coalition BuildingIt will be critical for the industry to gain credible allies in its fight against Rosenfield.  We do not want the campaign to be portrayed as generators versus consumer groups.  Therefore, we need credible, third party groups standing along side us to broaden our appeal and message, like taxpayer groups, business leaders, consumer organizations, energy experts, economists, educators, law enforcement and seniors.Campaign CostsHow much will be needed to defeat Rosenfield will depend on several factors.  Depending on several variables, the cost of a "no" campaign can range from a few million dollars to as much as the $40 million spent to defeat Proposition 9.  Campaign costs to defeat ballot measures are contingent upon several variables:o    The popularity of the measure with voters.  The more they like it on the natural, the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure.o    How much money Rosenfield can raise to promote the measure.  If he has few resources, the "no" campaign will have an uncontested paid advertising campaign, which will make defeating the proposal much easier.o    How bad the energy crisis impacts voters.  If the next 15 months produce an on-going crisis, campaign costs will rise.o    The effectiveness of messages against the proposal.  If focus group and survey research confirm the proposal has an Achilles heel, the cost to defeat the measure will go down dramatically.Thorough research of Rosenfield?s actual proposal will better enable us to recommend a campaign plan, message and budget.  In summary, defeating the Rosenfield initiative will cost from a few to several million dollars and a united industry effort.

If I left anything out please respond back to everyone, thanks!Andrewx57534Day1 requirements - RisktRAC operations1) User List Need to gather list of all employees that will be using risktRAC for book administration, verify list, then ensure they are setup in the RisktRAC database.(related to 3) Security Access).2) Migrate users to NetcoNeed to check with network security and/or integration team to find out when the users IDs will beconverted to run on the Netco network.  (Dependency for running RisktRAC on Netco).3) Security AccessWork with Stephanie to follow up with Security on approval for RisktRAC application: confirm groups and approvers.  Ensure everyone who does not have RisktRAC will have an e-request submitted.4) RisktRAC TrainingOnce users have access to Netco RisktRAC setup timeframe for basic training.  If time permits a hands-on overview could also be arranged, as long as someone can access the Netco RisktRAC from their desk (either user or developer).5) Website connectivity: Distribute RAC website URL to Netco employees (confirmed with Bhupesh - http://rac.netco.enron.com )6) Disable Spreadsheet Position loading: In RisktRAC disable the ability to load exotic spreadsheets for Day1 users.7) Day1 Portfolio Hierarchy(This step can occur before the books are loaded into RisktRAC.)Review with Frank Hayden the ideal portfolio hierarchy that should be setup, then have users start building the structure without any associations to real portfolios.The book-portfolio tie-in will occur with action item 8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet.8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheeta) Discuss timeline for loading Day1 book data from the book-setup spreadsheet;    Discuss validation issues and cutoff for loading data.    Note expected book counts are 164 for Gas and approximately 55 - 60 for Power.b) Add two columns in the spreadsheet for portfolio creation and hierarchy placement, have users fill in this data with guidance from IT.9)  Control RisktRAC screen-accessDiscuss necessary business groups and screen-access to setup in RisktRAC:  Gas Users, Power Users, Credit Users, Market-Risk Users, any other groups that come to mind.10)  Book-creation/Portfolio audit:Develop simple adhoc report to help audit books that are not associated with portfolios.  Discuss validation specifications with Ramesh.11) Financial checks and balances:  How can reported position/P&L numbers match up with those reported by accounting?  Need to find out who owns the accounting reporting and see if some adhoc verification can be implemented.Known RisktRAC requirements beyond Day11) Desktop RisktRAC portfolio security Review how to implement portfolio-level security in the RisktRAC that is already present on the RAC website.2) Benchmark Server:Review with infrastructure how to migrate a copy of the Benchmark Server to a Netco server. Debbie and Ramesh to discuss further.

Westminster Ave.  113Los Angeles, CA 90020NancyObiz@aol.comTo Mr. Ken Lay,I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.Sincerely,Nancy Oliver

INVESTMENT IDEASBubble-free bullishnessHas the NASDAQ come too far too fast? Who cares! There are lots of othergreat ideas available.By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research, Multex InvestorNot everybody agrees with my generally bullish views of the stockmarket. That, in itself, is not a big deal. Every day there are both buyersand sellers, so you can never expect to see unanimity of opinion. What isinteresting is the sort of reasoning I often hear from bears. "Look how farJuniper (or any one of countless other circa 1999 market superstars) hascome. It's way ahead of itself." "There's been so much overbuilding intelecom, it will take years before supply and demand come back intobalance." Etc.Such sentiments are fine, and for the most part, I agree with them. Theproblem I have is that so many bears seem to confine their discussion tothe same group of stocks that mesmerized so many investors during thebubble days. That's unfortunate. The same mistake that causes so muchfinancial pain on the way down seems likely to strike again. The sourceof the pain: an inappropriately narrow view of the market that focusestoo much attention on too few stocks that often have too little investmentmerit.Click here for morehttp://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=5766&nd=0112======================== Sponsored by =========================Tech Buyback Portfolio Posts Stellar Gains: +39.23% YTD!David Fried knows a stock is undervalued when the companybuys back its shares.
