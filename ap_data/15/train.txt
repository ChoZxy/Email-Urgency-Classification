I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My                                                      is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index.                                                2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs.                                                3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file.                                                4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July                                                5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer.                                                6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation.    I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract. Please free to give me a call if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

Per their contract, they are owed a monthly credit for their excess energy i.e. energy sold back to the grid.Due to the return to bundled service, and the chaos which ensued, needless to say, this credit calculation fell through the cracks.  The credit calculation has not been done since January 2001.  The customer is now very anxious for that amount.We have agreed to give him an amount (not the check) by EOB tomorrow, 9/28.  Since the only volumetric data which the customer has provided so far is for August, we only need to provide that months credit amount.Per our conversation, here is his August interval data.  I've also attached a sample of what has been done in the past.  If you have any questions, please let me know. << File: Rg608.txt >>  << File: USCF Generation Pricing 031301.xls >>

Hope you're feeling better by the time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy redlined by hand. Thanks again for all your help.Tony

Of course, much of this may be attributable to the divestment of assets in the oligopolistic generation sector, now competitive, but it is a very fari example of the benefits of competition and should be cited as a counterweight to those arguing that competition is a "failed experiment".  Paul Dawson, head of our UK regulatory team, can provide any necessary further insights./details.   mcs

The site will provide secure access for customers & prospects to selected internally generated fundy reports, historical price charts, and indicative pricing. Morgan Stanley, J. Aron, and BP all have similar sites and customers frequently ask where our site is. Access to the site will be administered by my group (Admin & analyst) and maintenance will be provided buy Enron I.T. as needed. The current scope of the project is concentrating on crude & refined products, but the incremental expenditure required will be minimal to expand it to other EGM commodity groups if desired.Attached is a copy of the statement of work for the project. The I.T. group is ready to get started on the project immediately with a planned "go-live" date before the end of the year, so your prompt attention will be greatly appreciated.Bill BerkelandEnron Global Markets L.L.C.Bill.Berkeland@enron.com(713) 853-7004

Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one "major" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition. Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.  Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business "easier" for companies like EES.  We should play this up.  We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.  I didn't see that language on consumer benefits.Jim -----Original Message-----From: Novosel, Sarah  Sent:Monday, October 08, 2001 9:36 AMTo:Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Lindberg, SusanSubject:One RTO Coalition DraftsRick, Jim and Susan:Enclosed is the One RTO draft comments on the Northeast Mediation.  We would like to include Enron as a signatory party to the comments, so please read them to make sure that you are okay with us signing on.  Although the date issue is somewhat amorphous (we support PJM (with a Nov 2003 date but we also urge implementation as soon as possible -- Dec 2002 if possible).  This was the best we could get the Coalition to agree to -- there are many parties who strenuously opposed advocating any date early than Nov 2003 and I had to threaten to take our name off the comments if we didn't say something about an earlier date.  We have not given final signoff, but they would like to hear from us by the end of the day (comments are due tomorrow).Susan, please show the comments to Kevin, Dana, Paul (and anyone else who would like to see them).  We are also writing our own comments, which we will circulate by COB today for filing tomorrow.  They do not need to read the affidavits -- just the comments to make sure we're not saying anything they disagree with.Also attached is the Henning affidavit that supports the Mirant study.  Although Mirant probably did not make the best choice in using an internal regulatory person to do the study presentation at FERC, everyone who I have talked to thinks that FERC staff reacted favorably to the study's findings.  One person overheard FERC staff say that they expected $440 million in savings per year, and they weren't questioning these savings, but wondered if these were enough savings to justify a movement to one RTO.  It seems to me that $440 million is significant savings, but who knows.  Anyway, we need to discuss whether we want to join in the Mirant Midwest study.  Provided that a similar study can be conducted in the midwest (since there are no ISOs there), with a similar good outcome, I think we should consider supporting the Mirant effort.Please let me know what you think.

In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement? -----Original Message-----From: Concannon, Ruth  Sent:Monday, March 04, 2002 2:42 PMTo:Germany, ChrisSubject:FW: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Contracts --  EES  -----Original Message-----From: Concannon, Ruth  Sent:Wednesday, February 27, 2002 4:35 PMTo:Vanderhorst, Barry; Hewitt, Jess P.; Draper, DavidCc:McMichael Jr., Ed; Garza, Maria; Mann, KaySubject:Tennessee Gas Pipeline Contracts --  EES Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a global Enron bankruptcy filing.

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  About CoppeliaCopp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Here's my wish list:1.  The business units within Enron are very segmented and that can prevent the cross-pollination of solutions for customers.  For example, if we could put together a program that linked commodity sales for a variety of customer sizes of load with load control devices and the offering of curtailable products, it would create a mechanism to 1) provide savings/income to customers during peak periods, 2)make power available to Enron during peak periods for resale and 3) help modulate the potential for outages and insufficient capacity.   The packaging of other energy efficiency services could also be considered in conjunction with this.2. Coupled with and also apart from suggestion #1 above, Enron should increase its marketing of renewable products.  By doing so it would 1)work in hand with a curtailable program, by freeing up generation during a hot peak day - if photovoltaics are used, 2)enhance Enron's image in the community, 3)serve a market niche.3.  Have the opportunity to add two more wishes.4. Coupled with and apart from suggestions #1 and 2 above, Enron should focus more on distributed generation alternatives which can 1) provide significant savings to customers since in many states stranded costs are not assessed on DG, 2) can be used as a source of energy during a peak period by paying the customer a premium to curtail and make the power available to Enron to sell on the market 3) help offset the problem of delivering power into a constrained control area where there is dg power we can tap into.5. Create a forum within government affairs to collectively brainstorm and develop strategies to implement the needs of Enron's business units.  Clear identification of the goals and problem solving not only provide good solutions through the contribution of diverse viewpoints, but it is also an excellent learning experience for all participants as a clearer understanding of the goals emerge.  Also, participants can take with them a better understanding of what may be achievable, while others may  pick up ideas that can be reshaped and used in their jurisdictions.  I hope this is in line with what you were looking for.  If not, please let me know and I'll ask for three more wishes.Janine

The notes on the Core Main Tab  indicates this. Parking 96016654:  I spoke with  Sandra Grimes at Oasis Pipe Line Company and she indicated that this contract did not exist in their system.  They do not have any documentation.  Their contract nos. start with 028......she is not aware of OPLC Synthetic as their contract no..  Therefore,  the other Parking and Loan Agreements effective May 1, 2000 are not the same contract.  Further, the documented status confirms that no paper exist and was setup in completely.  I will probably terminate this contract in Global Contracts becasue it appears that it was setup in error. In fact, the contract does not have contracted services.Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.Marlene3-9167---------------------- Forwarded by Marlene Hilliard/HOU/ECT on 08/08/2000 02:47 PM ---------------------------Eric Gillaspie08/08/2000 02:31 PMTo: Marlene Hilliard/HOU/ECT@ectcc: Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: OasisMarlene,I'm reviewing the amendments to the Oasis contracts that you have forwarded to me.

Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.Deal Terms--        The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.--        ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.Management of Newly Formed CompanyChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.  In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.

HarveyMorris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to thefive subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   Wenegotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus anopportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope ofthe request for production of documents.   This will include a furtherextension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as areservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  Weare working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team inPortland on further refining both responses and potential objections.However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office andsenior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation withthe CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating theoverall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extremepressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what washappening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "manyparties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to theGovernor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providingresponses and raised objections to the requests for production instead ofcooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" whichwould be made available to the Governor and legislators and that suchparties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would neverinvoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do soby CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I respondedthat such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simplytrying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discoveryrequests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This commentspeaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achievea politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enronofficials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of thisincident.Mike Day

After nearly 25 years with Enron, Cindy has decided to leave to assist her husband in his trucking and transportation business.  Her commitment and enthusiasm, even during these difficult times, have been inspiring and will be missed.Robert Jones, managing director in Human Resources, will assume Cindy's responsibilities and join Enron's Management Committee.  Robert joined Enron in 1980 and has held numerous managerial positions.  Prior to Enron's bankruptcy, Robert led Human Resources for Enron Wholesale Services.  Robert was instrumental in developing the retention and severance plan that was ultimately approved by the creditors' committee and the court.  His experience and leadership will be invaluable as we move forward in our restructuring efforts.

Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon. Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like.  Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality.  Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded. I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline. Your thoughts?Greg Piper President & CEO Enron Net Works LLC  _____

He is> representing Dynergy in both the Hendricks and the Gordon litigation.  He> wanted to know if we could represent Morgan, Stanley.  When he learned> that we were representing Enron, he invited us to join the joint defense> group that has been formed among the Gordon defendants, subject to> approval of the other defendants.  That group is> made up of the following:>> Reliant - Baker & Botts/Luce, Forward (Steiner)>> AES Corp. - Williams & Connelly/Dicks & Shapiro>> NRG Energy - Sheppard, Mullin>> Southern Company - White & Case/Trautman, Sanders>> Williams Energy - Gray, Cary/Jones, Day>> So far as I know, Duke Energy and PG&E are not represented yet.>> Doug says his group has already filed a low number/related case petition> to get the Hendricks case transferred to Mac Amos from Myers.  The group> also plans to remove the Gordon case on federal question grounds based on> some group research they have done.  They would like to remove the> Hendricks case at about the same time, but haven't been able to line up> all of the defendants.  I assume that was part of the reason for his call> and his request that we represent Morgan, Stanley.  Apparently an earlier> case filed against SDG&E was removed and assigned to Judge Gonzales.  If> Hendricks and Gordon are removed, they will be low numbered to Gonzales.> She is one of the better federal judges, but she has some shortcomings> that we should talk about.>> Anyway, it looks like teams are forming, and we should think about> coordinating with them.  I asked Doug to send me a copy of the joint> defense agreement they are circulating, but he could not do so without the> other defendants' approval.  They are concerned about including Sempra's> counsel in their group, and therefore haven't included any Hendricks> defendants who are not also in Gordon.>> Dan=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Did you enjoy Jim Crist and John Adamiak?  Would you prefer having an Enron speaker or an outside speaker at any future electric sessions?Did the class cover the right topics?

Wellhead supply remains troublesome, however, and pricesmust remain above those of alternative fuels, keeping most flexible end usersout of the gas market.* For the remainder of February and March the gas market is not yet out of thewoods; prices could still rebound quickly with cold weather.* Storage inventories, though still well into record low territory, are higherthan was expected and feared earlier this winter, and the prospect of inventorylevels that would test overall system reliability and cause widespreadcurtailments of firm services appears less and less likely.* For March, occasional weather-driven price spikes may still occur, but in thecontext of prices settling toward a level just adequate to keep a necessaryamount of demand out of the gas market.

For the record, Ihave said early and often, that the inter-agency disputes among thefinancial regulatory agencies (which the Administration of George H.W. Bushinherited and did not create, by the way), are unacceptable and must beavoided.  The Dems, of course, love to get this sort of thing going, as itenables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation tore-regulate. The fact that this President's father came to the White Housein the denouement of a multi-billion dollar savings and loan crisis which hedid not create is also usually forgotten.As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms, I thinkthere is no substance to the rumor that Sen. Gramm would be opposed to mynomination.  As one of the few who contributed generously to his ownPresidential Exploratory Committee in 1995-6, I think I stand in pretty wellwith the Senator and we would work well together.

Aquila can restrict themselves via the administration function should the elect to.  This will mean that Aquila's contract and credit people will need to talk to their commercial people. Debbie Brackett requested collateral on all financial trades done by Aquila Energy Marketing.  This prompted Aquilla's credit to say they would stop trading as such.  Aquilla's traders feel we should provide an alternative solution.    The contractual solution we have proposed will resolve the contractual issues however it does not fix the intraday credit issue.  EOL will not apply the trades to the correct headroom number when doing the credit look prior to the completion of a transaction.We need to evaluate if there is a systematic solution which can afford to give the customer what they want and cover all the credit bases.  The solution would have  the system compare the ID and the product and then allocates the trade to the appropriate company for both contractual and headroom purposes.For now we will continue to assign trades between companies and credit will continue to request collateral as appropriate.Please let me know how you would like to proceed.David Forster12/29/99 03:24 AMTo: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Aquila Risk/Energy Marketing Profile ChangesBob,Is this the latest on Aquila?Is this still an issue for KN?I note that the Aquila contacts requesting a profile change are Contracts and Credit - have we spoken to the traders? I'm not comfortable that limiting the profiles provides the best solution for the customer - bearing in mind that our primary customer is the trader, who will be the one actively using EOL.I'm also not real happy about restricting a customer's profile - although I realise that we have done so for Power (license issue) and we do so for credit purposes. More importantly, though, we are talking about restricting a customer's profile to make it harder for an actively trading counterparty (valid or not) to be doing trades.To my way of thinking, we need a solution which encourages the traders to trade without annoying other elements in Aquila to the point where they pull access to EnronOnline - which brings me back to the assignment solution, hairy though it may be.Thoughts?Dave---------------------- Forwarded by David Forster/LON/ECT on 12/29/99 09:17 AM ---------------------------Brant Reves12/28/99 04:08 PMTo: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Molly Harris/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Aquila Risk/Energy Marketing Profile Changeshello all,After spending much time on the phone with Aquila, it was requested by them (Scott Eckermann, Contracts and Terry Batt, Credit) that we take active measures internally to limit the product profile of both Aquila Risk Management and Aquila Energy Marketing to their respective trading competencies.

I have only researched the requests that have to do with Recall, Right to do Partial day Releases and Partial Day Recall. As you know, these have  been added to a Two day BPS meeting in Colorado Springs next week (OCT 10 & 11),  which I will be attending. At the last EC meeting the LDC's wanted this issue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an issue that needs further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC asked for guidance from the members and it was suggested by the EC members to send this issue back to the BPS committee for further discussion, with a commitment from the LDC's to have parties in attendance. Then BPS was to present a report, on progress, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeting. In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.

Daschle and MinorityLeader Lott pledged to work together to conduct business just asthey worked through issues when Republicans held the majority.Meanwhile, Republicans scaled back their demands for what must beincluded in a new organizing resolution - the first major taskfacing Democrats and Republicans in their newly reversed roles.Daschle told reporters he recognized the unique historic natureof a mid-session shift in power, and said Democrats would striveto be fair in their dealings with the GOP, often havingcriticized Republican rule in the past. "It would be hypocrisy atits worst if we were going to take the same tactics. We're notgoing to do that," said Daschle. "The tenuous nature of ourmajority requires that we act accordingly." Lott took a similartone, saying: "The good times, we will remember and try torepeat. The bad times have already been forgotten."There were continuing signs of a de-escalation of rhetoricover the organizational resolution, which must be passed beforenew Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively.And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand thatthe resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senateconsiders presidential nominations. Senate Republican ConferenceChairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who last week hintedRepublicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did notmeet their concerns, today said, "I've said all along that Idon't want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantagemembers." Democrats - despite their accommodating rhetoric - haveshown no signs of willingness to cede new authority toRepublicans on nominations. Daschle said Democrats would "respectthe process" currently in place.Minority Whip Nickles said: "I think it's going to work . Ithink it's going to be fine." Nickles said he expected a minimumwage bill, accompanied by some tax relief, to pass this year. Buthe said "it remains to be seen" whether a compromise can bereached on a patients' rights bill, which Daschle has pledged tobring up after completing work on the education bill. Sen.Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a key moderate, said it would be betterif Republicans and Democrats can come to some "mutualunderstanding, rather than making some major changes, that maynot stand the test of time." The softening of the GOP stance cameas Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status.The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., as the new Senate president pro tempore.The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet todayto discuss a new organizational resolution, and Daschle wasscheduled to meet with new committee chairmen. Until the Senatepasses a new resolution, freshmen must go without committeeassignments, and panels are composed of members from the 106thCongress, many with GOP majorities. Daschle said Democrats wouldmake decisions about new panel assignments after theorganizational resolution is passed. - by Geoff Earle and CharlieMitchell-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-TAXESHouse Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut LegislationFrustrated that the change in Senate leadership hasovershadowed passage of the $1.35 trillion tax cut, HouseRepublicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief asPresident Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday."Every paycheck, whether it be weekly, biweekly or monthly, willbe bigger in take home pay," House Ways and Means Chairman Thomassaid at a news conference today with GOP leaders. A spokesman forHouse Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen. James Jeffords,I-Vt., saturated media coverage just as the House and Senatepassed the tax cut bill. "Our view is we have to go out there andcommunicate our message," the Hastert spokesman said, adding thatthe new Democratic-controlled Senate does not override theirplans.Thomas sought to correct what he said included "flat outwrong" media explanations of the tax cut. Thomas said alltaxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer. Heemphasized that it was not a "one-time stunt," saying the tax cutincludes a permanent reduction in income tax rates. "It is anongoing gift to the American people, who are hard working,"Thomas said. However, the tax bill, which passed under budgetrules, includes a provision that would "sunset" the tax cuts Dec.31, 2010, unless they are made permanent. Thomas said the Senatewas responsible for the sunset provision, and sought to put theonus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent. HouseMajority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislationto do that, commenting, "Why should we tell families and smallbusinesses the relief they need will disappear in 10 years?"In a memo distributed today to House Republicans, RepublicanConference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, who is responsiblefor GOP communications, said Jeffords' switch complicated hisparty's ability to talk about tax relief. "Sen. Jeffords'decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good newsand had two significant ripple effects - however temporary - forHouse Republicans," he wrote. Watts said the Jeffords defectiongave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated themedia so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cutbill.Meanwhile, Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said it was "possible" to take up a bill extending theexpiring tax breaks this year, while adding, "I think that'sprobably wishful thinking, although I would welcome it." He saidhe had met with Finance Chairman Baucus, and the two wouldcontinue to work together on prescription drug legislation andupcoming trade issues. He mentioned small business tax breaks andenergy provisions as other tax legislation that could still movethis year. He also said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., may be the"leading candidate" to take the new seat on the Finance Committeecreated by the party switch of Jeffords. But he noted Sens. MikeDeWine, R-Ohio, and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., are both more senior,although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignmentsto claim it. - by Mark Wegner-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-POLITICSHouse GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key IssuesHouse Republican moderates said today their leadership hasmade no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of thedefection of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., but complimented HouseSpeaker Hastert's leadership style and attentiveness to theirpriorities. House GOP moderates hope to see movement on suchissues as patients' rights, a prescription drug benefit, campaignfinance reform and the environment. Moderates such as Rep.Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., described the Senate as a body of "100independent operators" and said the Jeffords defection is lessrelevant to House moderates, especially given Hastert's openness."We have access. He hears us out. We could not ask for a betterleader for the time," Boehlert said. He said the leadership mightnot always heed moderates' wishes, but said he has seen progressthis year on some environmental issues, debt reduction andeducation. Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay, often atarget of Democrats for his conservative positions, "has reachedout not only post-Jeffords, but pre-Jeffords."Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., similarly said she has seen noadditional outreach from leadership, but called Jeffords'decision a "red flag" for national party leaders. "In a two-partysystem, you need to bring people together if we are to be in themajority," she said. Roukema cited education reform as "goodevidence of excellent progress," but said she also would like tosee action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform.Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who urged Jeffords not to defectand has been largely content with Hastert's treatment of campaignfinance reform, said moderate issues have found their way ontothe table this year. "That's why we don't have the problem in theHouse," Shays said.Speaking with reporters Tuesday, National RepublicanCongressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used asports metaphor to describe Hastert's management of the GOPConference. Davis said that, unlike the Senate, House Republicansmay disagree in private but play "team ball" in public. "The keyto our success is we all play together," Davis said. Hardlineconservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficultfor members representing marginal districts. Rep. Michael Castle,R-Del., said he hopes the new Democratic-controlled Senate mightprovide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative inhis approach. "I'd assume our leaders think 'pure Republican'positions need to be established in the House, but some of us inthe House would prefer that we pre-negotiate some things likewe've done on education," Castle said. "There will be somepulling and tugging as we go along." - by Mark Wegner-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-ENERGYHouse Drops Calif. Energy Bill, Daschle Wants ActionHouse Republicans pulled the plug on a short-term Californiaelectricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal withDemocrats on a controversial price cap provision. The developmentcomes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make Californiaenergy legislation a top priority of the Democrats' first monthin power. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingamanwill focus on producing a short-term bill in the next few weeksbefore shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after theJuly Fourth recess, he said today. "We'll see what we can agreeon in a short-term bill" by July 4, Bingaman said at a sessionwith reporters. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Daschle, clarifyingearlier remarks, said Congress should order the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission to limit prices in California's wholesaleelectricity market if FERC refuses to act.In a letter to California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, Daschlesaid that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices, "Congress will haveto consider legislation to address this issue." Although Daschlesaid he does not believe Congress "can or should establish adollar amount for the price of electricity," he endorsedlegislation offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., andGordon Smith, R-Ore., that orders FERC to limit prices. "UnlessFERC acts soon," Daschle said, the "legislation should be takenup and passed . I will support all necessary efforts to meet thatgoal." Daschle's comments come after Daschle appeared to softenhis support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview latelast week.On the other side of the Capitol, House Democrats blastedRepublicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committeemarkup of the California bill. "I think that the canceling of themarkup was a mistake," Energy and Commerce ranking member JohnDingell, D-Mich., said at a news conference. Earlier, Energy andCommerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and AirQuality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, told reportersthey pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel. TheRepublican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill andreject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices. But thecontentious votes would have made it more difficult to gatherDemocratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan thissummer. Still, Tauzin said the planned committee action hadspurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers toimplement many of its provisions. Barton, the author of the bill,said the victory was bittersweet. "I hope I don't have many morevictories like this," he grumbled. - by Brody Mullins-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-ENERGYGOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against AttacksRepublican legislators on the House Resources Committee andInterior Secretary Norton today made a pre-emptive strike againstcritics of President Bush's national energy policy at a newsconference before Norton's testimony before the committee.Resources Chairman Hansen, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzinand Norton defended the administration's energy policy, repeatingthe mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections,conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energymeasures as well as provisions to increase domestic oilproduction. Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism againstincreasing domestic oil production, arguing that the UnitedStates must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent futureenergy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries. ButTauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administrationwill concentrate their efforts "big time" on conservation, demandreduction, environmental protections and alternative energysources.Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designatednational monuments for drilling, Norton said the InteriorDepartment is studying the designated lands on a "case-by-case"basis - receiving comments from state and local officials onsupport for the national monuments, which were designated by theClinton administration during its final days. Norton noted thatsome states steadfastly support their national monuments, whileothers vehemently oppose the land restrictions, adding that thedepartment will take this into consideration before opening theselands up for domestic oil production. Added Hansen, "What can beopened up, should be."At the other end of the hall, two Democratic panel membersheld their own news conference to call attention to a designatedarea in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July. Acoalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groupsjoined Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Resources ranking memberNick Rahall, D-W.Va., to introduce legislation to overturn afederal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw, apristine Montana valley. The coalition argued the site containsone of the most significant collections of Indian art on theNorthern Plans, including prehistoric, multicolored drawings ofshields, animals and human figures. Last month, a state agencygave Denver-based Anschutz Exploration Corp. permission forexploratory drilling in the valley. Anschutz holds leases to oilrights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and haspermission to start drilling as early as July 21. During Norton'stestimony, Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop thedrilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibitthe drilling, but promised to continue to monitor the area andwork with local officials and tribal groups. - by Greta Wodele-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-FINANCELaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of InvestorsHouse Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,said today he intends to "aggressively" pursue an investigationinto the SEC's capacity to protect investors, saying that toomuch of Congress' financial agenda traditionally has been"industry driven." A case in point, LaFalce told a group ofreporters, is pending SEC fee reduction legislation, which hesaid ought to have been considered in the context of "anexamination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be."While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors,LaFalce said he felt a "much larger look at issues and questions"was warranted. While acknowledging the committee's work in thearea of financial modernization, he said, "This has been theagenda of industry." Asserting that investor protections havebeen ignored for the last 25 years, LaFalce said one issue wherethere is "a crying need for a thorough, exhaustive investigation[is] the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given [theagency's] limited resources and reach of the law. I intend topursue this aggressively." In that vein, LaFalce expressed adesire to see the SEC's enforcement capabilities beefed up byincreasing the agency's enforcement staff "not by 2 or 3 percent,but by 200 to 300 percent."With the Senate's shift from Republican to Democratic control,LaFalce contended that the "stumbling block" to consumer advocacyin that chamber "has been eradicated. Proponents of consumeradvocacy have been emboldened." Noting that newly installedSenate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protectionconcerns, LaFalce said he expected he would be helped bothoffensively and defensively in the House. "It will help me bothadvance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose," LaFalce said.Overall, LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leveragein the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda. "Ifyou know an issue is going to be taken up in conference, youmight as well take it up now," LaFalce said.As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley, who has beencriticized in some circles as relying too heavily on thefinancial industry in setting his agenda and priorities, LaFalcedescribed their working relationship as still evolving. Whileexpressing great affection for Oxley personally, as a friend of20 years, LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxley's "substantivedisposition" on a number of fronts - consumer protectionincluded. He intimated there might be too much top down control,with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen onwhat and when to hold hearings and markups. "I don't think that'sthe way to legislate, LaFalce said. "That is not my idea ofthoughtful legislating." - by Pamela Barnett-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-HEALTHManaged Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation FactorLeaders of the managed care industry today sketched out forreporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the nextseveral weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients' rightsbill - that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patientsmore than it would help them. "It would be impossible not toconclude . that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcaresystem," Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of the AmericanAssociation of Health Plans, said at a briefing. Ignagni saidthat by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans inboth state and federal courts, the bill sponsored by SenateCommerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards,D-N.C., and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions ChairmanKennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of healthinsurance. "And the only way for [employers] to recoup is forworkers to trade additional wages, or workers will have to paymore directly for health care," Ignagni said.While the AAHP has expressed "concerns" with the leadingalternative measure - sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt., and backed byPresident Bush - Ignagni was careful not to rule out thepossibility that the organization could ultimately back someexpansion of liability in federal court only. While theorganization has been steadfast over the past five years in itsopposition to any expansion of liability while supporting arequirement for independent outside review of health plandenials, Ignagni said a decision to support the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill or any other substitute "will be made by ourmembers," who "will be instructing us every step of the way."Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and businessopponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry, whichhas been largely supportive of patients' rights legislation,particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay foremergency room care. Further study of liability language hasshown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits,Ignagni said, but also hospitals. "Every hospital in this countryis as vulnerable as every physician," she said. - by Julie Rovner-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-TRADELegislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat BoardSenate Finance Chairman Baucus, Budget Chairman Conrad, Sens.Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Larry Craig,R-Idaho, and Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., today urged theInternational Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue anaggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board, a statetrading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat.Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested theinvestigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act lastOctober, and the ITC has said it will submit a confidentialreport to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative by Sept.24. Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained thatsince the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect in1989 the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretivetrading practices to sell wheat in the United States and inmarkets where U.S. and Canadian producers compete."What we need from the commission in this investigation is anexhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricingpolicies of the wheat board and the most precise possiblequantification of the effects on U.S. producers of these unfairpractices," Baucus said. "And we need that information to be madeavailable to interested parties and the public to the maximumextent possible." Charging that the Canadian government and thewheat board have "stonewalled" previous U.S. efforts to getinformation on the wheat board's operations, Baucus urged the ITCto "use all secondary sources in the U.S. government and the U.S.and Canadian private sectors" to collect information and draw"meaningful conclusions."Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to apetition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission, theinvestigation has the support of national and other state wheatgroups as well. Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support forfuture trade agreements has eroded in the northern border statesbecause residents there believe the agreement with Canada hasworked to their disadvantage. Pomeroy also said that, if theCanadians refuse to provide information, "silence can and must beused against them." Dorgan said U.S. farmers had been "patient"with the government for 10 years and that the U.S. response tothe Canadian situation to date has been "pathetic." An ITCofficial noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Boardwas invited to testify, but chose not to. - by Jerry Hagstrom-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-FINANCEGrassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On BankruptcySenate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, todaysaid he intends to meet as early as this week with HouseRepublican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge aconsensus strategy on "the difficult parliamentary situation"brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation.

I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the  Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties?If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see. However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established protocols for drafting GTCs? Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted under English law there is an exclusion of "special damages".  In Australia and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?  How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just regulatory compliance issues.If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 9229 2310.

Essentially, the list is to help internal sponsors and managers understand the issues at hand prior to and during the formation of these businesses, and be able to talk to legal experts such as yourselves about the business' role in the context of material legal issues.  I would appreciate your comments--any and all are welcome.  Potentially, triggers or thresholds for "classification" may be relevant, but I defer to your judgement those issues that may be of relevance to the non-legal businessperson.

(PR); Mara, Susan; Kaufman, Paul; Robertson, Linda; Landwehr, Susan M.; Badeer, Robert; Etringer, Michael Cc: Subject: FW: DWR ContractsFYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation. Best, Jeff Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. "We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. "The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. "Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. "To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. "First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. "In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. "The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. "It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. "There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. "But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" ***************************************************************** State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01 SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. "We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." New contracts would increase 'green' power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. "I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state's businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. "I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. "It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. "The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

Interns that came in through this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her skill level.  With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any questions, please let me know.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Shelly Butler/HOU/ECT on 10/11/2000 03:46 PM ---------------------------From: Jennifer Fraser on 10/11/2000 01:18 PMTo: Shelly Butler/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Ted C Bland/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Sheila Chang  Shelly and Shelly:I believe that Sheila should receive an offer now.

Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who can think outside the box.Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in Global Markets upon her graduation.If you need any further information, please let me know.Thank you for your assistance with this matter.Jen Fraser

In addition to myself and Chris Wood, she was interviewed by an Enron Wind German lawyer (who has left and she is replacing), an Enron Corp. German lawyer, and by a German lawyer from Punder.  The feedback is unanimously positive.  I think I have run all of the interview traps in Europe, and am confident that she will be a real asset to our department and to the Enron Wind Europe team.

This source believes that such talk is overblown, at least==20for now.RJARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUINGExecutive SummaryThe recession in Argentina is deepening and the government faces painful=20choices in addressing itWhile the current strategy of deflation is unpopular, default or devaluatio=n=20could be even more painfulDeflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;==20if his government falls, both default      and devaluation become likelyMexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20devaluation than they were in 1998November 16, 20001. Argentina RecessionThe question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20administration will succeedin stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20recession in five years. Indeed,the 11-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20quickly losing marketconfidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=MF=20and Washington,the outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20trapped in a fixedexchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its==20competitiveness andlong-term prospects.2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=ce=20the differencebetween internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=se=20of action, attemptingto cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20crisis. The adjustment ofrelative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A==20variant of this scenariowould be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the==20increasingly onerous interestpayments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=he=20last shred ofconfidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=l=20markets, and ruin thecountry=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=untry=20could opt to devalue.Arguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=he=20country could recoverrelatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.3. Recession Threatens De la Rua SurvivalThe outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in==20power. Thegovernment is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =it=20will pay off by nextyear, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20international markets ismaintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20recession becomessocially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate==20and the president could beforced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to==20devalue immediatelyafter taking power.4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 1998The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20instability, notably inBrazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress==20made by the lattercountries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=ow=20feature a floatingexchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their==20fiscal accounts. Thus,in the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=s are=20well equipped toovercome temporary financial turmoil.

At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.RegardsDelainey   ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 11/02/2000 09:41 AM ---------------------------Rob Milnthorp11/02/2000 09:17 AMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Reporting StructureDave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very demotivated lawyer on my hands.Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to "stay in the loop" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a dollar and time perspective.  Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between Houston and the employee.I would appreciate your thoughts on this.RegardsMilnthorp

First, it helps win theall-important field position battle. Second, it gives a team's defense timeto rest.But this game, while it was a nail-biter for a half, turned into a runawayprimarily because of the tough UT defense, Vasher, DE Cory Redding and thefind of the year - freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum.The Longhorn defense held North Carolina to 211 yards total offense andRedding scored the game's first touchdown on a 22-yard pass interceptionreturn that included an awesome dive into the end zone to avoid two tacklers.Vasher broke a 96-game Longhorn drought in touchdown punt returns, set upanother easy TD with a 59-yard punt return to the Tar Heel 5 and  kept thecrowd on its feet regularly with exciting punt returns. He also gift-wrappeda touchdown for North Carolina when he bobbled a bouncing punt at the UT 17.Mangum, the gritty young kicker from Mesquite, booted a 49-yard field goalinto the wind on the last play of the first half to send the Longhorns intothe dressing room with a 20-14 lead and some momentum.He later kicked a 51-yarder and a 36-yarder and is perfect this season oneight extra points and five field goals. Not bad for a walk-on.Coach Brown said after the game a 30-point victory is to be enjoyed notcritiqued, but the Longhorns need to use this open date to figure out a wayto run the ball better and be more consistent on offense. A bunch ofthree-and-outs in a row will get them beat pretty soon if they don't.Here, briefly, is how the game wentFirst QuarterTexas won the toss and deferred. Just like last week, that decision paid offbecause most of the first quarter was played in North Carolina territory.After an exchange of punts, Tar Heel QB Ronald Curry's pass in the right flatwas intercepted at the 22 by Redding, who ran it back to about the 5 and thenleaped over two would-be tacklers into the end zone. Mangum kicked the extrapoint to give UT a 7-0 lead with 10:04 left. The Longhorn defense forcedanother quick punt and Vasher got loose on a 59-yard punt return to the 5. Healmost scored but lost his balance tip-tooeing down the sideline afterleaping over one Tar Heel. An offside penalty moved it inside the 3. TBVictor Ike ran to the 1, then QB Chris Simms scored. Mangum kicked the extrapoint for a 14-0 lead with 6:45 left. The Longhorns had no first downs atthis point. After the kickoff,  Curry led the Tar Heels on an impressive77-yard scoring drive to cut the deficit to 14-7 with 3:44 left. The Longhorns ran only nine plays and had just 17 yards offensively in the quarter,while North Carolina ran 23 plays and had 105 yards offensively.Second QuarterVasher tried to scoop up a low bouncing punt at the UT 17 early in the periodand North Carolina scored in two plays to tie at 14-14 with 12:40 left. Hecame right back with a 31-yard return to the Tar Heel 18. Three plays laterthe Longhorns were on the 19, facing fourth-and-11, so Mangum kicked a36-yard field goal for a 17-14 lead with 5:48 left. Simms led the Horns on a51-yard drive in the final 45 seconds, connecting on four passes for 46 yardsto set up Mangum's clutch 49-yard FG into the wind on the final play for a20-14 lead at the half. The Longhorns had 122 offensive yards in the periodto the Tar Heels' 54.Third QuarterUT went 3-and-out to start the second half, and the Tar Heels went deep ontheir first play after the punt, but CB Quentin Jammer, after being burned ona couple of long passes in the first half, made a lunging interection at theUT 14. After an exchange of punts, UT put together its only long TD drive,going 89 yards in 12 plays to take a 26-14 lead with 2:25 left. Simms triedto pass for the two-point conversion, but it failed. RB Ivan Williams had a31-yard run and Simms completed four passes for 31 yards. Freshman RB CedricBenson got the score on a 7-yard run. Texas had 121 offensive yards in thequarter and the Longhorn defense gave the Tar Heels fits, allowing them torun only seven plays for minus 5 yards.Fourth QuarterMangum's 51-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter gave Texas a 29-14lead. Then the UT kickoff team forced the Tar Heels to start their nextpossession at the NC 5. Curry tried to pass on first down and DT MauriceGordon sacked him in the end zone for a safety and a 31-14 lead just 27seconds deep in the quarter. Vasher's 44-yard punt return for a touchdownwith 9:06 left put UT on top, 38-14. Longhorn LB Reed Boyd's interception atthe North Carolina 14 set up TB Brett Robin's 12-yard TD run with 36 secondsleft, then backup QB Major Applewhite took a knee on the extra-point play,leaving the score at 44-14 to honor Cole Pittman, the UT player who waskilled in a vehicle accident in February.Pittman CeremonyThe Longhorns gave Cole Pittman's family an honorary T-Ring before the gameSaturday. In a tradition started nearly 50 years ago by Darrell Royal,T-Rings are presented to every Longhorn football player who graduates.Pittman was killed in an automobile accident last February while returning toUT for spring football practice. He was a junior defensive tackle.When the Longhorns scored late in the game to reach the 44-point plateau,redshirt freshman quarterback Chance Mock, who was Pittman's best friend onthe team, told coach Mack Brown the score matched Pittman's jersey number.Texas did not try to kick the extra point after the score, electing to take aknee to preserve the final score in Pittman's honor.900 Number Updated DailyI update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news.The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 orolder to call.Coach's CornerCoach Mack Brown said Sunday he wants the Longhorn offense to develop moreconsistency, but he also said he isn't worried about much of anything whenhis team posts a 44-14 win."We're stressing the team, not individuals and stats, this year," he said."I'm not into statistics, how much we run it,  or how much we throw it.""I'm not as concerned about all that as I am about is time of possession, thenumber of plays we have as compared to them, the kicking game and turnovers."But he said, "We haven't had as many explosive runs or passes as I would liketo see."The UT staff defines explosive plays as runs of 12 yards or more and passesof 16 yards or more.In two games this season, both lop-sided victories, the Longhorns have runthe ball 80 times and they have had only six runs of 12 yards or more. Theyhave thrown 75 passes and have completed six of 16 yards or more.Brown said the Longhorns have been very conservative offensively and haveforced the run in situations where the defensive formation normally wouldcause a pass to be called."We're still not clicking on offense all the time," he said, but said onereason "is we're forcing the run some now in situations that we probablywon't later in the year."He said he wants the team to be able to run the ball when it wants to run itat times because a solid running game is necessary to pick up short-yardagefirst downs, keep some pressure off the quarterback and run the clock toprotect a lead late in the game.But, as a whole, Brown said he was very happy with the victory over hisformer school."After studying the film, I'm really pleased about almost everything. Thereare still a lot of things we can improve but nearly everything was positive.""The special teams were very exciting and really helped us win the game, but(the fumbled punt) gave them a touchdown," he said. "We've got some things towork on."Brown said the offense "had 326 yards against them and they were giving uponly 255 yards a game against Oklahoma and Maryland. The Carolina defensiveline is very good. I think they have six or seven pro prospects on theirdefense."True freshmen LB Derrick Johnson led the team in tackles and had two sacks,and Brown said he "has the ability to play as good as anybody in the country.He's tall, he's fast and he likes to hit. I think he's got a chance to bereally special."Sooners Still OutlawsI normally don't write a lot about the other teams in the Big 12 unless I ampreviewing their games with Texas.But the University of Oklahoma issued an interesting press release about 10days ago. Here's how it went, in part:"Lynn McGruder, who began his college football career at Tennessee, isenrolled at Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma athletic officials said today.According to head football coach Bob Stoops, McGruder has yet to join thefootball program.""Stoops said that McGruder is not practicing or participating in any footballteam activities and will not be until a past off-the-field incident isresolved.""OU expects its student-athletes to represent the best values of theuniversity both on and off the field," Stoops said. "We have set very highstandards of excellence, and we are not going to compromise them in any way.""Our process of evaluating Lynn McGruder has included intensive conversationswith him and members of his family and those who worked with him in previousathletic programs.""While we have not yet made a final decision about whether or not he willultimately be allowed to participate in our football program," Stoopscontinued, "we believe in looking at the whole character and background of aperson in deciding whether or not he deserves a second chance.  We recognizethat it is only human to make an isolated mistake and the important thing iswhether or not we learn from that mistake.  If we end up deciding that hewill join our football program, we will hold him very strictly to the higheststandards of behavior.  Not a single deviation from that standard will betolerated."That's what the press release said, and, coming from OU, I guess I shouldn'tbe that surprised.McGruder was kicked off the Tennessee team after he was charged with felonypossession of marijuana with the intent to sell and deliver.The charge said there were marijuana plants, a scale and other things thepolice report described as drug-related material in his room.Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer sometimes gives scholarships to kids otherschools won't touch. Do you remember the offensive lineman a couple of years ago who was chargedwith raping a student at Florida while he was on a recruiting visit to theschool? Florida dropped him, but Fulmer signed him.In other words, when Fulmer boots a kid for character reasons, you knowsomething is really wrong.The odd thing about Stoops taking him is that, if convicted, he might do someserious prison time.Stoops didn't say whether McGruder is on scholarship, but I think he wouldhave stressed that he was walking on if that was the case.I wonder what parents of top recruits will think of Stoops' decision.Perhaps he can tell them that, if their sons come to Oklahoma and want to buysome dope, at least they won't have to leave the athletic dorm to get it.We shouldn't be surprised. After all, the original Sooners were the crookswho cheated on the land rush back in 1899. They didn't participate in therush, but hid out along the way and grabbed choice pieces of property.That's kind of like the marathon runners who get caught hitching a car ridepart of the way.Of course those runners get disqualified and don't get the race named afterthem they way the Sooners did. Oklahoma is, after all, the Sooner State.Corrections* I wrote in a recent newsletter that the University Interscholastic League(UIL), the governing body for high school sports in Texas, had a rule againstrecruits taking paid visits to colleges while they had eligibility remaining.That rule was repealed five years ago and there is no such rule now.* I wrote in my last issue that Victor Ike and Ivan Williams ran behind thefirst-team line and Cedric Benson ran behind the defensive line. That shouldhave been the second-team line.Subscribe To The E-Mail/Fax To Get Year-Round Football& Recruiting Scoops !Save Big AsAn Internet Subscriber !Whether you live close to Austin or far away, the True Orange E-Mail/FaxService is the way to keep up with Longhorn football and Longhorn recruiting- instantly.

We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  We embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow us to focus development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  However, due to what we believe to be inherent deficiencies in the J2EE specification, we have gradually reduced our use of these technologies.  In fact, EnronOnline's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  The problem areas are performance and enterprise integration.  Specifically, the specification does not allow for sufficient tuning.  The result is that many of the "features" cause significant performance penalties, even when those features are not relevant to the application at hand.  Additionally, as B2B markets evolve, there is a greater need for integration between multiple platforms.  This need is not addressed at all.It is our perception that the J2EE specification is influenced too heavily by vendor input.  We believe that large end-user customers should have an equal voice in the evolution of the specification.  Such input would be particularly valuable since vendor competition issues would not taint it.  We would welcome an opportunity to participate in such a committee. -----Original Message-----From: Bibi, Philippe A.

We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.Solutions:Create a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.Rethink EJBs.If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.Regards,Michael GuadarramaDirector, E-Commerce Application DevelopmentEnron Net Works, LLC.

INVESTMENT IDEASCharge!!!Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investorswill come to the rescue of the street.by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, WallStreet StrategiesLast week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliancewent from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Talibanback on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels inthe southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggestedthat stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree thatthe prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believethat the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I thinkthe most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were releasedlast Wednesday, once again beating expectations.In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumersentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates,and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, Idont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.http://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=4401&nd=1120WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR--------------------------Determine Your Net WorthKnowing your net worth gives you a picture of your financialcondition and helps you plan for the future and set investment goals.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An executive descri=bed as "a seasoned trader" will lead Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications= unit after its current chief executive takes a different position within c=orporation in the next two weeks. James Fallon, president and chief operati=ng officer, will lead Enron Broadband Services after it becomes part of Enr=on's Wholesale Services Group.   Broadband Services Senior Vice President K=elly Kimberly told Dow Jones Newswires Fallon will lead the organization af=ter Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive, moves to a corporate job at= Enron.   Fallon was unavailable to talk to Dow Jones for this story.   One= broker said Fallon's selection indicated Enron isn't backing away from dev=eloping the bandwidth market.   "Jim Fallon is a seasoned trader," the brok=er said. "He made a killing in the power markets. He has a huge reputation =for making money."   The broker speculated that Fallon may increase the num=ber of traders Enron has in the bandwidth market. Broadband Services has an=nounced plans to reassign and possibly layoff non-trader employees in the c=oming two weeks.   An analyst said Fallon's appointment indicates future gr=owth for Enron's bandwidth business.   "I think Fallon is someone who would=n't be there if it isn't a good opportunity," said Raymond Niles, director =of power and merchant energy research with Salomon Smith Barney.   In his n=ew role, Fallon will report to Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive o=f Enron Wholesale Services, and Greg Whalley, president and chief operating= officer of Wholesale Services.

The PUC is expected to vote on Thursday, September 20, 2001, to accept a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer that would transfer its ratemaking authority to the DWR.  "Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis setting rates without public oversight?" asked Jones.  "The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal.  He has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's best interest to give Gray Davis and the DWR a blank check," said Jones.        AB1X specifies that DWR be entitled to recover the costs of its energy purchases after advising the PUC of the costs.  Most recently, DWR has informed the PUC that their purchases for energy through 2002 will reach $12.6 billion.  If the PUC accepts the draft decision, DWR will now be the state agency making the determination of whether its own purchase costs are "just and reasonable."            "Pure and simple it's a rate scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional.  If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the DWR," said Jones. - MORE -BJC:27:2"As our state weathers this energy challenge and faces great economic uncertainty with a budget deficit looming in the future, never before has it been so important for the PUC to responsibly perform its vital oversight duties, acting in the best interest of Californians," said former Governor George Deukmejian, who joined Jones and past PUC Commissioner Stan Hulett today in criticizing the pending PUC action.            As a former California Attorney General, Deukmejian also expressed strong concerns regarding the legality of the PUC's abdication of authority.            "The PUC's power to review rate increases is a power expressly granted to it in our California Constitution.  The Legislature cannot simply delegate this power to another state agency by passing a simple statute.  This transfer of power can only legally occur if a constitutional amendment is passed and AB1X is not a constitutional amendment," said Deukmejian.            Former PUC President and Commissioner Stan Hulett also raised serious questions regarding the shift of constitutional responsibilities from the PUC to the DWR."Even something as seemingly innocuous as relocating the PUC's headquarters from San Francisco to Sacramento would require a constitutional amendment, according to the opinion we received from former Attorney General John Van de Camp when that issues arose some years ago," Hulett said.  "A shift of responsibility of this magnitude would clearly and unambiguously require a constitutional amendment given the enormity of the proposal."            Secretary Jones implored the PUC to suspend action on the draft decision until these extraordinary constitutional questions are addressed.            "California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all our sakes, and for the future of our state, we must not allow that to happen," said Jones.- 30 - Remarks by Secretary of State Bill Jones Regarding the Unconstitutional Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the Public Utilities Commission to the Department of Water Resources (As Prepared) Good morning.   Thank you for being here today.  . As you know, tomorrow the California Public Utilities Commission will be voting on an extremely important issue that will affect all Californians for years to come.    The PUC will consider abdicating its ratemaking responsibilities to the Department of Water Resources based upon a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer. I am here today because I have grave concerns that if the PUC adopts this decision, they will be violating a major provision of California's Constitution.   As California searches for ways to deal with our continuing energy situation it is incumbent upon each of us to examine the ramifications - both short and long term - of every decision we make.  This past weekend the California Legislature chose not to bring legislation affecting the pending bankruptcy of Southern California Edison because many members of the legislature believed that the legislation was severely flawed.  Let's examine for a minute why this issue and vote will be taken tomorrow.  This decision rests wholly on the new rate scheme embodied in Assembly Bill 1X (AB1X.).   Since January of this year, the DWR has purchased electrical power on behalf of cash and credit poor Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  AB1X granted this authority to DWR.                                     AB1X specifies that DWR is entitled to recover the cost of these purchases, and that DWR is to advise the PUC of this amount.  DWR has recently estimated that it will require $12.6 billion to cover the costs of power purchased through 2002. AB1X further stipulates that the PUC will approve rates, designed by DWR and paid by the consumers, to cover DWR's expenditures for its energy purchases. Under the law, as laid out in AB1X, DWR and not the PUC will make the determination as to whether its purchase costs of $12.6 billion are "just and reasonable" under the law.              Pure and simple, it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional. If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the Department of Water Resources.   This is a dramatic and extremely troubling break from the current role of the PUC.  For decades, the PUC has aggressively performed the vital task of oversight, through public hearings, to ensure that rates charged California's electrical energy users are "just and reasonable."  Now, that indispensable oversight authority would be delegated to a bureaucratic state agency, the DWR, with no public oversight and no independent decision making authority. Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis' setting rates without public oversight?  The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal and he has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's interest to give Gray Davis a blank checkbook. DWR and Gray Davis would become the sole arbiter of whether the cost of their own energy purchases has been "just and reasonable." Through AB1X, the Legislature has diminished the PUC's role so greatly, that its function is to simply allocate shares of the $12.6 billion revenue requirement to the three utilities. This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house - it must not happen. The PUC must not vote to accept this illegal transfer of authority. The PUC must vigorously defend its role.  It must not allow the Legislature to abolish the crucial role it performs: reviewing the reasonableness of the overall purchase costs before they are passed along to ratepayers. As I noted earlier, the reimbursement scheme set forth in AB1X is a violation of California's Constitution. The Legislature's attempt to strip public accountability for the reasonableness of rate increases from the PUC and give it to DWR is appalling.  Nowhere in AB1X is it specified what a reasonableness review conducted by DWR will now be.  Will senior officials at DWR and Governor Davis gather at a conference table behind locked doors and declare their own power purchases reasonable?  Will they hold public hearings and subject their expenditures of billions of dollars belonging to the people of California to the scrutiny of the people of California?             Looking at their track record, the answer is no. The PUC's power to review rate increases is not merely based on statute.  It is explicitly set out in the California Constitution. This is a very critical distinction. The Legislature cannot transfer or delegate this critical power by a simple statute. It can only be done by constitutional amendment. And AB1X is not a constitutional amendment.  According to California Courts, the PUC "is not an ordinary administrative agency, but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers." Article XII, section 6, of the California Constitution states the general grant of authority for the PUC to fix rates.   Section 6 provides: "The commission may fix rates, establish rules, examine records, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, take testimony, punish for contempt, and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction." Thus, "[t]he Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities, including the power to fix rates, establish rules, hold various types of hearings, award reparation, and establish its own procedures." This is basic California law, reaffirmed time after time by our courts.   These constitutional powers are based firmly on the authority to make factual inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates to be fixed.  In one notable case, PG&E v. Railroad Comm., the federal court reviewed natural gas rates set by the Railroad Commission, predecessor to the PUC.  The court discussed the duties of the ratemaking body to make sure that the rates it fixes be "reasonable."  Because the PUC has the authority to "fix rates," it therefore has a corollary duty to make sure that the rates it fixes are reasonable.   This must mean that there is a constitutional duty and right to examine the costs underlying those rates.  AB1X cannot alter or eliminate that duty.  AB1X also cannot strip the core component of any reasonableness review: the close and open-minded examination of those facts being used to justify a rate increase. The Legislature cannot deny the PUC these constitutional powers.   By depriving the PUC the authority to examine underlying costs in the exercise of its duty to "fix rates," the Legislature has improperly sought to modify, curtail and abridge the constitutional powers of the PUC.  To that extent, AB1X is invalid and unconstitutional.             In a startling break with California's past history, AB1X allows DWR to retain title to the energy it purchases and then "resell" it directly to consumers. The utilities then collect the energy costs from their retail customers and return to DWR the portion of the revenues DWR has said it must have as reimbursement.             By any other name, this is a tax. It is an enormous sum of money being paid out by the people of California.             According to our courts, the power to set taxes is a legislative function.  DWR is an agency within the executive branch of government.              The California Constitution specifies that the powers of one branch shall not be exercised by another branch.  The following example highlights the impropriety of the Legislature's delegation of authority to DWR to determine the reasonableness of its own energy purchases.               The Legislature assesses California's highway and transportation needs and then sets the rate for the gasoline tax. Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax, on a cents per gallon basis, whenever they buy gas. The Legislature cannot delegate to CalTrans the authority both to determine its own highway construction budget and to set a gasoline tax rate calculated to fund that budget.  This situation is identical to DWR. The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power, as it needs, at prices it is willing to pay. The Legislature has further directed the PUC to authorize rates, without any review to determine their reasonableness, in order to reimburse DWR. The PUC cannot legally - and must not under any circumstances -- abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California.     This is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X, and it's unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function: providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California. For these reasons, I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision: 1.      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved 2.      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor 3.      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues             California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all of our sakes, and the future of our state, this must not be allowed to happen. -# # #-

A FERC staff investigation, which was to be released in full later on Wednesday, found California's market structure and rules "flawed," which combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to record highs in both wholesale and retail markets.FERC has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the California Independent System Operator (ISO) and Power Exchange (PX). The draft changes would eliminate the need for Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and SoCal Edison from having to sell into or buy from the power exchange. Other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent, non-stakeholder to oversee the ISO and PX; modifying the auction market; new reporting requirements; and accelerating new siting of power generation facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants. If approved by the full commission at its Wednesday meeting, the changes would become effective in 60 days. California regulators and industry officials have until Nov. 22 to comment on FERC's proposed changes.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation report, unveiled Wednesday, which found no "smoking gun" evidence that power sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit.Instead, FERC blamed the state's mandated market structure for the electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to retail customers in San Diego. At the same time, utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of millions of dollars due to a state-mandated rate freeze that required them to sell power at below cost.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business; Financial DeskU.S. to Decide Action on State Energy Crisis Utilities: Regulators today will release plans for tackling electricity costs. Potential solutions include price caps, moves to foster competition.CHRIS KRAULTIMES STAFF WRITER11/01/2000Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-1Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe fate of California's rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to intercede in the state's dysfunctional $23-billion energy market or to let free-market forces continue to wreak havoc. The four-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will release a long-awaited staff report analyzing the root causes of California's energy crisis and, more important, issue a draft order or action plan on how to solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs.During public hearings in San Diego in September, FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker promised that the commission would take action and "do whatever it takes" to repair California's electricity market, whose deregulation was set in motion by landmark state legislation in September 1996. Just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense speculation on the eve of their release. The FERC commissioners could impose new price caps or order an overhaul of the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator, the state agencies that conduct daily auctions for electricity. The commissioners may ask the state to undertake new initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still dominated by the three big investor-owned utilities. But an indictment of power generation companies--which some in the state accuse of "gaming," or manipulating the system to wield unfair "market power" and wringing excessive profits from customers--is unlikely, according to published reports and state industry principals and government officials. The FERC commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in California for a supply-demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity prices skyrocketing in July to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, more than triple the July 1999 average of 3.9 cents. A typical residential customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, the first state utility to fully deregulate, saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in to cap retail rates in August. Just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates remain sky-high today, even after the end of peak summer power demand. Wholesale rates in October averaged about 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, double the average cost a year ago, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator. In any case, billions of dollars of investments as well as the political careers of prominent California politicians could be affected by what FERC does. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is coming out from Washington to hold a news conference with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento this morning to announce new, unspecified initiatives to address California's electricity problems. The Davis administration has gone on record demanding that FERC, which oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the country, to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore "just and fair" electricity rates in California. The ballooning of electricity rates in San Diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated until the state Legislature imposed its caps. Rates paid by retail customers in the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being. But $5 billion in "undercollections"--the difference between what the investor-owned utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can charge consumers--looms overhead, worrying Wall Street. "I have no idea what the FERC will say," said state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee who says she is as much in suspense as anyone. "But we are expecting a substantial order that would move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in California." Consumer advocates and the state's major utilities would like to see FERC impose some sort of wholesale price controls--even gut the Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator because they are clearly not working as intended. "We expect some radical surgery," said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric. Some consumer groups would like to see FERC declare the wholesale rates collected by generators "unjust and unreasonable," legal code words that would open the gates to actions by the PUC or the Legislature to force the power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit. Such an action, which would lead to litigation by the power companies, is considered unlikely. Business interests, including the power generators that have reaped enormous profit from the dysfunctional market, are arguing to let free-market forces prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the market's evolution and possibly stifle construction of new power plants, which offer the best long-term solution to the state's predicament. "We expect that the FERC will find that the high prices of this past summer are a result of supply-and-demand imbalance and market design defects on the retail and wholesale side, but that the market participants have been playing within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming," said Brent Bailey, general counsel of Duke Energy North America of Houston, a major generation player in the California market. Duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state's municipal utilities, notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power: that the industry in essence be re-regulated by imposing a system of cost-based rate controls, similar to how electricity rates were set before deregulation. Such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by Duke and other power merchants alleging "confiscatory" actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds of millions of dollars they have invested in California power plants. Bailey favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance, as well as new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition. Los Angeles DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who has led calls for temporary imposition of cost-based rates, said California's failed deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is intrinsically an "un-deregulatable" service. "Three years ago, I thought it would work. Then we had a train wreck," he said. "I'm not committing heresy when I say that I think it may not work out."Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  Wewill, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that thereare major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gapbetween GAAP and the real world in which investors must make theirjudgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,including the need for a common language to describe them.  We willelaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that weneed a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is basedon the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty isto make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,knowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.We will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,institutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficienciesof the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.All of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the lastdraft - that is, we're against more regulation at this time, againstprescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that themarket is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly orcomprehensively enough.2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can youbegin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want tosay what:* Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent"Fair Disclosure" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.Len, can you take the lead?  I'd suggest no more than one page, preferablyhalf a page.* John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value ofdeveloping a new language for intangibles.* John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accountingfor pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, canyou take the lead?If anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.We would appreciate these submissions by October 15.3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to "get it right" and not to stop untilwe do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:* Get you a new draft* Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to bescheduled* See where we are thenHowever, I'd like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December15, 2000 if at all possible.Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional ideas.Best regards,Jeff

continued his vitriolic attack on DA and took on green choice as "fraudulent." The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today. The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.  There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties "on notice" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001. Our attorneys are reviewing this, but on first blush, our California attorney says the CPUC would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of DA.

If we aren't going to try to rebut the "funny money" argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we argue this???

I'm not as confident  that she will be as indignent as I would be about why we spent so much money on transactional reporting if nobody is going to use it.    I'm going to write up a q/a for her on this points.  We probably should make transparency a focal point in our follow-up comments.

This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy buses."While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they demonstrate continued compliance.Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market.Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority.The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of:1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees5.  Dr. Gene Coyle6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon SorbonneThe panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role.  Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego.Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA.  While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases.UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well.  TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing.2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants.  Rate Cap related bills1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy componentThe bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals.  The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HOUSTON (AP) - El Paso Energy Corp. said Monday it completed a $24 billion acquisition of The Coastal Corp., creating the nation's fourth-largest energy company. The deal between the two Houston-based companies was completed hours after it won approval from the Federal Trade Commission.El Paso agreed to sell $112 million in investments in 11 offshore pipelines to win regulatory approval. That concession eased concerns about the recent consolidation of the gas-transportation market, said Molly Boast, the acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline network in the country, and it increased that network by buying Coastal. It will operate a 58,000-mile pipeline system and hold operations in wholesale marketing and trading of natural gas and power, oil refining and gasoline marketing. The merger will result in layoffs, but the new El Paso Energy Corp. provided no numbers. The company also said it expects an increase in hiring over the next year. Coastal shareholders will receive 1.23 shares of El Paso common stock for each share of Coastal common stock. El Paso also will assume about $7 billion in Coastal debt and preferred stock. Within the energy business, El Paso will trail only Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. - which is buying Texaco - and Enron Corp., said executive vice president Ralph Eads. El Paso and Coastal also announced fourth-quarter earnings on Monday. Excluding special items, El Paso reported earnings of $456 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $295 million, or 48 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue more than tripled to $7.5 billion from $2.4 billion. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 67 cents per share. Including one-time gains and losses from asset sales and other items, El Paso had fourth-quarter net income of $127 million. In its final quarterly earnings report as a stand-alone company, Coastal reported record net earnings of $208.3 million, or 93 cents per share, compared to $169 million, or 78 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected 91 cents per share. Coastal had fourth-quarter revenues of $6 billion, nearly double the $3.2 billion a year earlier. For the year, Coastal reported net income of $654.4 million, or $2.96 per share, on revenues of $18 billion, compared with earnings of $498.9 million, or $2.30 per share, on revenues of $10.3 billion in 1999. In late morning trading Tuesday, El Paso shares rose $1 to $64.10. The company's stock has doubled in the past year. Coastal stock closed Monday $79.50, $2.50 higher.DeWitt Announces Highlights of 26th Annual World Petrochemical Review01/30/2001PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) HOUSTON, Jan. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- DeWitt is placing special emphasis on two areas this year in response to the interests of our clients.

The state's 1996 deregulation law created the exchange as amarket where buyers and sellers could buy power and where priceswould be posted to ensure openness and encourage competition. Itbegan operations in March 1998.     The state's three biggest investor-owned utilities wererequired to buy their power there until last month, when theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized Californiautilities to enter into forward contracts to buy power, bypassingthe exchange.     Power prices have soared in California during the last monthto 10 times as much as year-ago levels. The high prices werebankrupting the utilities, and the state is now buying power themand turning to advance contracts that lock in lower prices inreturn for agreements to buy power for years.     With no requirement that companies trade on the exchange,volume has fallen from an average of 536,000 megawatt hours beforethe FERC order to less than 25,000 this week.     The exchange will continue to arrange delivery and payment oftrades made until it shuts down tomorrow, spokeswoman BethPendexter said. No firings were announced.     The exchange said it will continue to perform all contractsettlements and scheduling services for market participants.--Gene Laverty in Calgary (403) 232-8188, orglaverty@Bloomberg.net, through the Princeton newsroom (609) 279-4000/alp

It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.4. Item #4 is fine.5.

("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show itscurrent organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It isintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financialinformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in thesecond wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions.  For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose thatthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the Californiawholesale market.][Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous PortlandGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be madeavailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would likecopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portlandin a third wave of document productions]TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction datafor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or asale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI'scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of theCommission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronicTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many ofEES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  Weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions orcomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Dayor myself.Brobeck Phleger & Harrison LLPGary Fergus=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally  -----Original Message-----From: Dyson, Fernley  Sent:Friday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AMTo:New, James; Jordan, MikeCc:Beck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO LondonSubject:RE: UK & Continental Power DoorstepThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.ThanksFernley -----Original Message-----From: New, James  Sent:25 October 2001 20:38To:Dyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, MikeCc:Yeo, RobertSubject:FW: UK & Continental Power DoorstepIt's official, we are being door stepped.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.Sincerely,Audra Loyal

Option 1:Move Stan and Cindy to level 39. Option 2:Leave Stan and Cindy on 50; Move you, Danny, whomever you and Stan decide to the empty offices on 50.Also, to consider in an effort to consolidate the Danny McCarty's organization back into more functional environments:Level 30 is currently being used for Disaster Recovery thru year-end. Levels 31 and 32 are vacant and available to us now. Both floors are high density (trader desks), approximately 280 desks per floor. However, these floors present a problem situation for Shelly et al because of Gas Control location.Level 44 has high density (188 cubes), and would be the fastest and most economical solution to fit Danny/Shelley groups on one floor in the upper stack. The only down side to this floor is the lack of offices and team rooms -- only 7 offices and 1 large conference room. My uderstanding is that Jim Fallon is planning to consolidate Broadband on level 44. Danny McCarty is calling him to inquire about these plans and to discuss the possibility of relocating them to the 30's bank.

Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISOSummary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.Specifics:The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as "the guilty party so to speak in front of you" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for "cease and desist" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to "self police" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that "icap" in PJM is the problem.  FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.

This year will be, in fact, the 20th anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL:http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htmMichael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a short Q&A period.Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,PaulPaul Kleindorfer215 898-5830

K. Steel Confirmation DraftLou / Nick,As requested, attached is a draft copy of a confirmation for the optional steel purchase from A. K. Steel. I am not sure this is the type of document needed for this part of the transaction, as I discussed with Nick this morning.  I also, think we need an additional agreement, other than a confirmation or master agreement, to actual define the deal - the gas fixed price option, the payment of $2,280,00.00 over twelve months, the option to purchase the steel over a 42 month period.  Also, there is no provision in this confirmation to address extending credit to A.K. Steel.I would like to meet with you for further discussions.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

If you have suggestions or comments on the file, contact either me or Mark.Megan - You can copy the Jan 01 Est tab and update the volumes with actuals.  The file should calculate the resulting settlement with Tenaska.  I will then update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month.  Since we haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet, we may have to do some tweaking with the formulas.  Anyway, this should give us a good start and you will be able to see where we closed the month in Logisitics.The file is located in O/Logistics/Cleburne Plant/2001FuelMgmt.xls.  If you don't have access, we can look into creating a new location on the O drive.  The spreadsheet is attached for this month.  This is definitely a work in progress.  So, if you have ideas to make it easier, or if you need something added, let us know.D

Although clearly slanted, the following is rather astute local coverage of the issue.John12/06/2000The HinduCopyright (C) 2000 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, DEC. 5. Strange as it may sound, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) would be paying less for the energy it buys from the Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more. If it buys only half of the present capacity, the state- owned power utility would pay, as it does now, around Rs. 95 crores per month towards unbought power. That is its entrapment signed and sealed with Enron. Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol- based independent power producer, the pricing of its output has two components: capacity charges and the variable or fuel charge. If it buys power, it pays a combination of the two and if it does not, MSEB has to fork out the capacity charges which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy.At present, MSEB is allowed to buy only 3,044 million units which is about half the Dabhol plant's capacity during its currently operating Phase I because the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from Dabhol, then the ceiling is 3,044 million units. That means, when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available, it is also paying some Rs. 95 crores towards the capacity charges and which is loaded on what has been bought. This arithmetic has pushed the price, in addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the $30 per barrel of oil in the international market, to hover at close to Rs. 7 per unit. Arguably, it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the present Phase I capacity of 740 mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have money to pay for that. Therefore it would like to evaluate its options, as advised by the Maharashtra Government, so that the right ways and means could be found to handle this issue. One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is produced, since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II capacity which is pegged at 1,444 MW and then get energy at a lower average price. That means it can avoid paying the capacity charges it can ill-afford. Says an official : "it is throwing good money behind the bad." Let us look at the prices paid hitherto, when the US currency had a different parity with the rupee. When it was Rs. 43.02 to a dollar, the MSEB was billed at Rs. 3.37 per unit in May 1999. Then it was tossed upwards, to reach Rs. 6.81 now and next month, move to about Rs. 6.90 per unit. "If the rupee slides further, we pay more," an official explained. There is a nice little twist to the Enron story. If the Power Purchase Agreement, as re-negotiated by the Shiv Sena - BJP Government had not made the 1,444 mw Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in the earlier PPA, this need a re-look at the Phase II or the entire project may not have arisen. Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain :"If it was an option, we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I and decided on our steps. But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in 1996 itself by the previous Government. There seems to be no escape route except to ask the IPP to lower its prices by managing its cost of funds." That is now being done. Some FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered burden is transferred to the MSEB in the tariff. This is yet to become a widespread offer from FIs but the MSEB may, with the Maharashtra Government's help, quietly lobby towards that objective. That would not mean a lot but in the payouts, a few paise per unit less. When the first block of Phase II is activated by June 2001, at present dollar-rupee parity, with the price of petroleum products being the same, the price of power from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs. 5.43 per unit but that too to a financially crippled power board is stiff. But it can do little because of the "take or pay" deal with Enron. If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide, and when the second block of Phase II is operational, the price of power could dip but "we are talking of a situation which we can guess at." This is on the basis that MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for not buying energy. According to present estimates, outgo towards power bought and not bought, would be Rs. 511 crores per month June 2001 onward, Rs. 712 crores per month October 2001 onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs. 920 crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses, its own and others. That is unlikely to go up substantially, not in the near future.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Probably has to do with the softening of job market and decrease in other opportunities.)  We are still checking with other recruiters and agencies and will keep you posted with updates and any increase in turnover.

I posed the question to probe into the number of Enron candidates on the street.According to one of my sources, the number of Enron people who have expressed interest in looking into opportunities has increased... although it was her feeling that the majority of the people interested in making a change were from the less established Enron businesses (Azurix, EES, EBS...).  She said that the Chronicle article seemed to trigger this increase.I will follow up if I get any additional data to share.Regards,Tony

It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like that.How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I don't change my ways.D

As I looked around the room at your= breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important manage=ment roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, =work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (col=lege, etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Other=s were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's t=he quick hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly= I'm in the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about =the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans a=nd how the time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short t=ime here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a g=reat Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediate=ly to the company. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce =that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this ha=s led to the great success over the years. However at the end of the day th=e business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectivel=y complements this young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things tog=ether and keep the sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in th=eir mid to later years of their work life. During the good times no problem= as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things. However we are possib=ly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for som=e extended period of time. =20Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle= aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value= you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retir=ement plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the compa=ny look like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the "quick hits" els=ewhere? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we= keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional se=curity? Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question =about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement progra=m we have in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we='ll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash bal=ance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron'=s is rather weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%.= Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considere=d over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen=. In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and =I'm not saying lets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our w=orkforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contrib=ute regardless of age.=20Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned= when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loy=alty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certa=inly have my concerns as I know you do also. =20Thanks for listening - Bob

In general, the schedule is acceptable.Please work with Merle on the details.  Can you or Mike confirm myunderstanding of the following?1.  Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer,GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attachedmodifications (i.e. NOx will be reduced even further to the 7.5-8.5 ppmrange).Response:  The GE target will be to have NOx at 7.5-8.5 range. In additionthe expectation is that CO will also be around 10ppm at Base loadconditions.2.  The liners will have their dilution holes resized.  Will the secondarynozzles also be modified, or is this not required?Response:  The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new groupnumber change which will increase the effective area. This is an engineeringrequirement. In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change withthe new part numbers. The liner dilution hole change will be standard acrossall the units.3.  You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season(December/January).Response:  The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but inthe event that a unit was run after modification without a test, the risk ofcompliance would be to Enron. GE feels very strongly that a reliableoperation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical aftermodifications.  In the event the units will not run until 2Q 2001, theabiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the highnumber of new unit start ups.4.  This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduledtest, in the event of an unexpected run call.Response:  The units would be available to run, but the operator may notknow where the unit would be in a regards to compliance.  We are also tryingto bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature.

This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can changeIf Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structureEdison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announcedWe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----From: Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:Tuesday, October 02, 2001 2:45 PMTo:Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff

Economists may debate the health of the economy, but there's little doubt where Corporate America stands: Profits have shrunk for three consecutive quarters now. Higher energy costs, the gut-wrenching hangover from tech-spending excesses, and the strong dollar have all contributed to a slowing economy--and continue to take a heavy toll on earnings. That's despite seemingly strong revenue gains. Although overall sales rose 8% in the second quarter from the year before, BusinessWeek's flash profit survey of 90 bellwether companies shows that net income shriveled 34%. But on a closer look, sales weren't so hot either. Much of the jump stems from Enron Corp.'s 196% revenue gain. Barring that, overall sales were flat. DEPRESSED. Nor is the carnage over yet. First Call/Thomson Financial says earnings will drop 8% in the third quarter. Worse, recent earnings surprises have the Boston firm backing away from a projected 3.3% profit recovery in the fourth quarter. So far, 811 companies have warned of lower second-quarter earnings, up from 263 a year ago. ``You don't switch from record earnings warnings to normal overnight,'' says Charles L. Hill, First Call's director of research.Few sectors escaped the bloodbath. Tech companies continued to lead the downturn: Intel Corp.'s net dropped 94% on depressed demand for chips, while Motorola Inc.'s $759 million quarterly loss was one of the worst among the 90 companies. Carmakers and airlines didn't fare much better. General Motors Corp.'s profits plunged 73% on weaker sales and losses from overseas units. ``The strong dollar is becoming an increased problem in the marketplace,'' says GM CFO John Devine. Among carriers, UAL Corp. was one of the worst performers, posting a $292 million loss. Corporate travel cuts will force losses at most major carriers. The financial services sector was a mixed bag. Citigroup's net rose 9%, to $3.7 billion, on higher global business growth. But venture capital investments in technology dealt Wells Fargo & Co. an $87 million loss. There were few surprises among the quarter's star performers. Jack Welch will retire with his legacy as a master of strong and consistent earnings intact: General Electric Co. earnings rose 15%, to $3.9 billion. Pharmaceuticals were also healthy. Pfizer Inc.'s net surged 56% to $1.8 billion, and Johnson & Johnson's climbed 9%, to $1.5 billion, on increased drug sales. Good thing. If the economy stays sick, we're all going to need plenty of painkillers.Table: BusinessWeek's Flash Profits Survey (This table is not available electronically. Please see the July 30, 2001 issue.)

Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In WestBy Mark GoldenOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES07/26/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana."The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region." About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power plant. The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could power about 45,000 homes. "You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said. After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%. But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in Washington that could have added 300 megawatts. FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open market in the past few months. The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in June. Not Everyone Blames FERC The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity. Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the cancellation of projects to price controls. "I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said. "The market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is sending now." The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer. "Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. "The need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling." Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze. Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago. "The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director with the Northwest Power Planning Council. Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap. Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity." As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six months. And orders for new generators have been canceled. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The deal reached in Bonn will allow the trading of greenhouse gas emissions whereby a company polluting below its limit can sell credits to a company polluting more than is allowed. Advocates of the system believe this will create incentives to cut emissions and will help reduce costs of lowering emissions. The allowances of greenhouses gases a company can emit will be denominated in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Energy giant Royal Dutch/Shell predicts a traded price of $5 a tonne of carbon in 2005, rising to $20 a tonne (equivalent to $6 a tonne of CO2) by 2012. "Our investment criteria today incorporate that cost of carbon," said David Hone, Climate Change Adviser to the Anglo-Dutch group. "What that's doing is starting to steer our investment portfolio and our project portfolio to lower emission projects, or forcing higher emission projects to go down the route of more investment to mitigate that carbon in the first place." "This is a big agenda now. It's serious stuff," said Mark Lilley, a partner in risk management at the consultancy Accenture. "Business, and not just the energy business, just has to be part of it on every level, or it risks getting burned." NEW TOOLS Besides the internationally tradeable carbon pollution credits, the governments agreed initiatives such as Clean Development Mechanisms (CDMs) that allow developed nations to score credits by funding climate friendly projects in developing countries. On top of this, they have their own decisions to make on what kind of domestic legislation to use to get the message through to industry. Their options include bully tactics such as UK's Climate Change Levy on greenhouse gas polluters, incentive-based schemes like Germany's guaranteed prices for greener electricity, or a combination of both styles. But it will be the business community that does the emissions reducing, the trading, and the innovating. "Now (after Bonn) we have targets, timeframes, market mechanisms and opportunities to develop some new energy technologies," said Nick Hughes, environmental policy adviser to the British oil multinational BP Plc. "Now that those elements are there and there's an opportunity to do something on a global scale, the ball is really rolling." Green investment funds springing up everywhere are not just focussing on the obvious alternative energy plays. Emma Howard Boyd runs the Environmental Research Unit of British fund Jupiter Asset Management, managing two green funds worth about 230 million pounds ($330 million). About 70 percent of her funds are in "solution providers" like Danish wind power stock Vestas and the British public transport operation FirstGroup that is involved in testing fuel cell powered buses. But the remaining 30 percent is reserved for companies from a wide range of sectors that are minimising their environmental impact. "We believe we are focussing on the companies of the future," she said. "There are strong drivers coming into place to encourage their growth." Nevertheless, it looks as though Big Oil, the motor industry, and power utilities are destined to play the biggest part. "It's not a revolution we are looking at here, it's mainly about doing existing things better," said David Kernohan, Manager of the Energy Environment Service at the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics. "The new fuel technologies and fuel efficiency improvements achieved by the energy producers and motor manufacturers are major achievements, even if not very flamboyant ones." The prospect of emissions trading alone will bring the trading skills of existing energy giants and gas and power traders like Enron into play. And, of course, all the corporate oil producers - even the environmentally conservative giant Exxon Mobil - recognise the shift to cleaner gas, and are scrambling as fast as they can in that direction with their production portfolios. "Gas has a major role to play as a bridge to sustainability and we are talking about decades in that role," said Frank Chapman, chief executive of the gas-rich energy group BG. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) like International Power and Calpine and their construction partners are obvious beneficiaries of CDM projects, building cleaner replacement plants in developing countries for maximum carbon credit points. But nuclear generators, too, are looking for rehabilitation, now that the environmental focus is off the toxic waste debate and on CO2 emissions - where they are zero emitters along with more expensive wind and solar power.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

JAPAN: UPDATE 1-Kobe Steel to raise 165 bln yen for power business.07/26/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd, Japan's fifth-largest steel maker, said on Thursday it would raise 165 billion yen ($1.34 billion) in project funds from banks to launch an electricity wholesale business. It will borrow funds from banks including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.Kobe Steel is currently building two coal-burning power generators with output capacity of 700,000 kilowatts each in the western city of Kobe, with plans to begin supplying electricity to the wholesale market from April 2002. As part of ongoing moves to deregulate the power industry, Japan opened up the market for the supply of electricity to large-lot consumers in March 2000. The electricity is supplied to office buildings and commercial centres among others, and represents some 30 percent of the power market. Only a handful of firms have been successful so far in taking business away from Japan's 10 main power utilities, which until last year enjoyed a regional monopoly on the wholesale business. Some foreign firms have also expressed an interest in carving a niche, most notably Enron Corp, a U.S. energy marketing and trading giant. Japan plans to review its deregulation measures in 2003. Kobe Steel's shares ended the day up 3.13 percent, or two yen at, 66 yen. ($1=123.58 Yen).Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. LOCALENRON CANCELS MIAMI-DADE PLAN POWER PLANT BUILDER FAVORS DEERFIELD SITEELLIS BERGER Miami Bureau07/26/2001South Florida Sun-SentinelBroward Metro4B(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)Enron Corp. is focusing its energies on building a power plant in Deerfield Beach now that it has canceled construction plans for a site in far south Miami-Dade County, a company spokesperson said Wednesday. "We're not renewing our option on the Miami-Dade property," said Lea Sooter in a telephone interview from Enron headquarters in Houston. "This makes Deerfield Beach that much more important to the citizens of Florida. I don't know what the big picture is for Florida, but there is a definite need for power."But Sooter refused to conclusively rule out the possibility Enron could someday build on another site not far away in south Miami- Dade. She acknowledged that a company project manager met with officials of Homestead, a city faced with severe financial problems. But nothing came of the meeting. "We were approached by the city of Homestead, and were listening to what they could bring to the table," she said in a prior interview. "We do that all the time on projects that never get developed." Charles LaPradd, Homestead's communications and project manager, said city officials had no specific site in mind, but let Enron know the company would be welcome in the city that has its own power plant. "It never went anywhere, but it's still open," LaPradd said. "It was a `we're here' kind of thing. We showed our power plant to them. It's always good to have backup. We have three of our 16 main generators down." The Deerfield Beach project is currently stalled. Given the go- ahead in June by the city's Development Review Committee, it was put on hold last week when the Broward County Commission imposed a moratorium on new power-plant construction. Enron officials said the company was considering legal action as well as trying to convince the state Department of Environmental Protection to intervene. The moratorium, enforced by denying the air-quality operating permits are required for power plants, is to end May 1. Sooter said Enron's Miami-Dade decision was based on which site would best serve the public interest. "It is not unusual for us to look at multiple sites and choose to build on the one that is going to work best for everyone," she said. The action clears the way for Miami-Dade's Department of Environmental Resources Management to close a construction landfill near the 61-acre site at Southwest 256th Street and 97th Avenue, east of the Homestead Extension of the Florida Turnpike. Environmentalists and residents of the nearby Lakes of the Bay neighborhood vehemently opposed the project. But Sooter said that opposition had nothing to do with the switch in plans. "Enron wants to be seen as the good guys," she said. "The primary benefit we can give the residents of Miami-Dade is to let the county close the landfill in a timely manner. DERM can now go forward on their own time line with Enron out of the loop."Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. A SectionRove's First Step Toward Shedding Stock Took 5 MonthsGeorge Lardner Jr.Washington Post Staff Writer07/26/2001The Washington PostFINALA04Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedShortly before he was named as President Bush's senior adviser in January, Karl Rove met with a transition team lawyer who took a look at Rove's stock portfolio, heavy with companies that do business with the government, and told him he would probably have to sell. "He wanted it cleaned up as fast as he could," said the lawyer, Fred Fielding. "He didn't want the bother." But Fielding advised Rove to wait until he obtained a certificate of divestiture from government lawyers -- a determination that the stocks did, indeed, pose a conflict -- in order to defer paying capital gains taxes.Yet, it took more than five months for that step to occur, and, in the meantime, Rove met with officials or trade association representatives of at least six of the companies in which he said he had more than $100,000 worth of stock: Intel, Enron, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Cisco. Given Rove's preeminent position in the Bush White House and the size of his holdings, those meetings have generated the very trouble Rove had said he wanted to avoid. Democrats have seized on the meetings to accuse the administration of the kind of ethical lapses that Republicans were quick to jump on during the Clinton administration, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) has demanded that Rove's conduct be referred to the Justice Department. Republicans have said the controversy smells of political payback -- "putting politics before the facts," White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said of Waxman -- and dismissed suggestions that the meetings constituted a conflict of interest. In a June 29 letter to Waxman, White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales defended Rove, saying that he "either had passing, inconsequential contacts" with some of the companies in his portfolio "or participated in broad policy discussions" on issues affecting them, such as energy policy. None of this, Gonzales said, "presents an ethical problem under applicable regulations." But several ethics experts said they thought that determination should be made by the Justice Department, not the White House, although they said they doubted a review would result in anything more than a civil penalty, if that. One expert, a Republican who asked that his name not be used, blamed White House lawyers for political ineptitude in failing to see that "top guys" like Rove should have been given priority instead of being kept waiting for weeks while lower-ranking staffers had their holdings reviewed. "If the system had worked efficiently, within a short period of time, a certificate of divestiture would have been issued, [Rove's] stock sold, and that would have been it," the source said. "A lot of forms have to be reviewed, but if there are problems, most of them are going to wind up on the Fed Page. If the chief of staff or senior political adviser gets into trouble, it's Page One." Under the federal conflict-of-interest law, it is a crime for any government official to take part "personally and substantially" in a government action about any "particular matter" in which he or she has a financial interest. Regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics cover appearances of a conflict, or situations that would not violate the criminal law but "would raise a question in the mind of a reasonable person about [the official's] impartiality." Failing to meet that standard can result in a reprimand, suspension or dismissal. President Bush told his staff at its swearing-in ceremony Jan. 22 that he expected "every member of this administration to stay well within the boundaries that define ethical and legal conduct. This means avoiding even the appearance of problems." According to the White House, lawyers from the counsel's office met with Rove in early April and again April 24 to inform him of several options he had in addition to selling his stocks. White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said these included seeking waivers that would have allowed him to participate despite a conflict or selling his stocks down to permissible "threshold levels." Rove said he still wanted to sell everything and the lawyers started working on an application for a certificate of divestiture. Under OGE guidelines, it amounted to an affirmation on Rove's part that he had to sell the stocks "to eliminate or prevent a conflict of interest." Waxman said last week that the White House did not have the power to judge Rove's conduct. He cited the federal law requiring that executive branch departments, including the White House, report to the Justice Department "any information" relating to criminal violations by an employee. "Congress appropriately believed that the Department of Justice would be in a better position to render an impartial judgment than the employee's own department or agency," Waxman wrote. The Clinton White House was boxed in by that law on two occasions. Former White House counsel Abner Mikva said he was forced to ask the Justice Department whether national security advisers Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger and Anthony Lake had violated conflict-of-interest rules by failing to dispose of certain stocks after being told to do so. Mikva said he viewed the violations as technical and completely unintentional, but under the law he had no choice. "They had stock in a couple of oil companies, nothing approaching a significant holding," Mikva, now a law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an interview. Berger and Lake "never met with the individual companies, but they were dealing with the energy crisis," Mikva said. "Beth Nolan [Mikva's deputy] brought it to my attention. She said, 'You've got to turn this over to Justice.' I said, 'This is ridiculous.' She said, 'The law is very clear; we have no discretion.' " In Berger's case, he was told by White House lawyers to sell 1,500 shares of Amoco Corp. that had been held for years in a trust established by his wife's grandfather. He was reluctant, fearing a stiff tax for stocks held so long, but he was informed in March 1994 that he had to sell since he was involved in questions about whether to keep sanctions on Iraq and Libya, policy decisions that could affect his stock. He was told he could defer his capital gains taxes by using the proceeds to buy "permitted property" such as an open-end mutual fund. Berger agreed to sell, but then, sources have said, forgot to do so until White House lawyers prodded him in mid-June 1995. Lake was "even more innocent," Mikva said. Lake was told in 1993 to sell stock in four energy companies -- Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Duke Power Co. and TECO Energy Inc., because he would be making decisions on energy policy as national security adviser. Mikva said Lake told his secretary to forward the instructions to his broker, but she simply filed the instructions, thinking the sales had been completed. Lake has said he discovered from his broker in June 1995 that he still owned the stocks and sold them the next day. Justice "sat" on the cases for more than a year, Mikva said, but Lake eventually paid a fine of $5,000 to close a civil probe, and Berger agreed to pay $23,000. The Bush White House, Mikva said, "couldn't be more wrong" if it thinks it can absolve Rove without Justice Department scrutiny. Rove's March 12 meeting with Intel executives and associates has generated the most controversy because they brought up a merger application that they hoped the government would approve. Gonzales said Rove was "noncommittal and offered no substantive response." The White House counsel said the matter was in the hands of an interagency review panel "on which Mr. Rove did not sit and in which he played no part." New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said he did not think Rove could be called to account for saying, "The people handling this are Joe and Harry.' I realize they may then go to Joe and Harry and say, 'Karl sent me,' but I don't think this violates the rule." Another ethics specialist, Monroe Freedman, disagreed, saying Rove created "an appearance of impropriety" simply by meeting with Intel when he held more than $100,000 worth of stock in the company. "The problem you have is that a reasonable person would question the propriety of what went on," Freedman said. "We are not required to accept what they say about their meeting not having anything of substance to it." Gonzales said Rove sought no waivers because he "took care to avoid" any direct participation in matters that would have required one. Gonzales did not address the question of an appearance of impropriety, but White House spokesman Bartlett said Rove rejects the notion that he had created one. In addition to the Intel meeting, the White House has also acknowledged that Rove attended meetings that helped shape the administration's energy policy at a time when he owned a substantial amount of energy company stock, including Enron Corp., the Houston-based natural gas and electricity trader embroiled in energy disputes in California, and General Electric Co., which has a nuclear power division. He also reported holdings of up to $50,000 each in Royal Dutch Shell Group and BP Amoco. Rove spoke with Enron Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay on subjects ranging from energy policy and global warming to appointment of an Enron-favored candidate to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Gonzales said that Rove was not a member of the task force that developed Bush's energy policy and that the discussions he took part in about "the contours" of the policy were general and had no direct and predictable impact on his Enron holdings. Rove also met March 20 with a group of executives from the Nuclear Energy Institute, which develops policy on key legislative and regulatory issues affecting the nuclear power industry and which counts GE's Nuclear Energy division as one of its members. On May 11, he met with John Chambers, president of Cisco Systems Inc., which makes Internet routing equipment, during a trip to Palo Alto that Rove made for the Republican National Committee. On June 5, Rove set aside half an hour in his office for an introductory meeting with two lobbyists from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association; its members include Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc. He finally received his divestiture orders June 6 and sold all his stock June 7.

Insider Selling by Enron Execs Speaks Louder Than Their Words By Christopher Edmonds  <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>Special to TheStreet.com7/20/01 7:32 AM ET URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/funds/chrisedmonds/1496696.html>At Enron, actions are speaking differently than words. At the same time as Enron Chairman Ken Lay and Enron President and CEO Jeff Skilling were touting their company's stock as undervalued, both were in the process of selling hundreds of thousands of shares. In an exclusive interview </comment/streetsidechat/1186095.html> with TheStreet.com last November, Lay suggested that Enron stock -- then trading in the mid-$70s at nearly 50 times earnings -- was undervalued. "Comfortable that it's worth that [50 times earnings], yes," he said. "As a matter of fact, some of us here and, of course, many analysts would maintain that even that is undervaluing the company." Yet, since the beginning of the year, Lay has simultaneously exercised and sold nearly 400,000 shares, continuing a program of exercising options and selling the shares that dates back to last November. This year's sales were all at prices below the November prices at which he said the shares were undervalued. According to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call, Lay's options transactions occurred between $52.95 and $82 a share. In February, Lay stepped down as Enron's CEO, retaining the title of chairman. Skilling's words and actions were similar. During a January analysts and investors meeting in Houston, Skilling said he believed Enron stock was worth $126 a share. At the same time, he was in the middle of completing sales of 130,000 shares of Enron stock he registered in November 2000. Since January, Skilling has registered for sale an additional 270,000 shares of Enron. And since the first of the year, he has sold stock at between $52.95 and $80.57 a share. Both Lay and Skilling still hold large positions in Enron. As of May 30, Lay and his family reportedly owned more than 2.66 million shares, and Skilling controlled more than 1.1 million shares. They each acquired more than 100,000 shares from the company in January. Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer says the sales are "program sales" that involve the exercise of expiring options and the sale of stock to cover the costs and tax liability, a common practice among executives at many major corporations. And, Palmer notes that Enron's compensation makes such sales almost routine. "A very significant portion of senior management's compensation is paid in equity," he says. Mixed MessagesAnalysts and investors worry about the messages such high-level insider sales send, especially when at the same time executives are touting the stock's appealing value. "Certainly, it's a concern to see the chief executive selling so aggressively," says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., a Houston energy investment boutique and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. </comment/streetsidechat/1242533.html> "Especially when they are saying the stock is undervalued. That sends a very mixed message to investors." While acknowledging Enron's unique equity-based compensation program, Dietert says recent selling at the top is unique. "You constantly see a regular group of people selling as they monetize their compensation" at Enron, he says. "However, the larger sales from senior executives are different. Sales have been weighted much more heavily to Lay and Skilling than they have been in the past." Dietert's 12-month price for Enron is $58, and his firm has not provided banking services to Enron. Simmons does not rate companies. Another analyst who asked not to be named was more critical. "The [insider sales] are disconcerting to say the least. In a market like this where the slightest indication of lack of confidence sends a stock down precipitously, their actions are speaking louder than their words." Dream vs. RealityOne reason for the mixed messages may have been the company's belief in broadband. At the time Skilling made his now famous $126 tout, he indicated that nearly $40 of value would come from Enron's now flailing broadband business. As my colleagues Adam Lashinsky </comment/siliconstreet/1489696.html> and Peter Eavis </comment/detox/1489630.html> have aptly chronicled, Enron's great dream for broadband turned into a nightmare. "The world certainly looks a lot different today than it did in January, especially to Enron," says Tom McIntyre, president of Dessauer & McIntyre Asset Management, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser. "You sure don't see projections from anyone assigning value to broadband now." In fact, on Enron's second-quarter earnings call, Skilling lamented the fact that investors seem to be assigning negative value to the company's telecom operations. McIntyre holds a long position in Enron. Still, investors might have expected Skilling's words to be backed by his actions. When he made the bullish comments in January, Skilling was selling stock even though the shares were trading near $80 a share, a 57% discount to his target price. That led the analyst to quip, "If it's not an expensive stock, why are they out there selling it?" To others, however, the sales are just noise that distracts from a solid growth story. "You would prefer it if they would never sell," says McIntyre. "I'd rather watch them hold the shares like I do. However, [Skilling] still owns well over a million shares, and the consistent sales suggest they have a program to sell whether the stock is near its high or at its lows." (Records show that Skilling has been selling 10,000 shares each week since mid-November.) The two executives "have a long record of creating and sustaining value for shareholders. I have a high level of confidence that Skilling can continue that record," McIntyre said. But appearances count. "It's a question of perceptions," says McIntyre. "In this market, anything can get a company, and the insider-sales news does hurt." That's especially true when actions and words don't mesh. As the analyst quipped, "It's what they call an oxymoron. You are saying one thing and doing another." Enron's Own Dot-Com Bubble Finally Popped By Adam Lashinsky  <mailto:alashinsky@thestreet.com>Silicon Valley Columnist7/13/01 9:58 AM ET URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/adamlashinsky/1490114.html>Enron (ENE <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=ENE>:NYSE) is no longer an Internet company. Of course, the Houston-based energy distribution and trading concern never was a dot-com, though it tried to convince Wall Street it was. In early 2000, Enron went so far as to suggest to investors the precise value of its nascent money-losing bandwidth business. Wall Street obediently obliged, inflating Enron's share value by as much as 75% from the time the company started bragging about its prospects, a disconnect noted disapprovingly here </comment/siliconstreet/928870.html> a year ago April. Now that dot-com valuations have gone the way of full-service gas stations, Enron is finally owning up to reality regarding the broadband business. "It's like someone turned off the light switch," Enron President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling told investors Thursday morning while announcing an otherwise solid quarter. "Revenue opportunities have just dried up." Indeed, Enron recorded a $109 million loss related to its broadband businesses, compared with income before interest, minority interest and taxes of $17 million in the year-earlier period. Skilling noted that Enron would dramatically scale back the burn rate for its broadband business and that the expectations for resuming progress in this market have been pushed back by at least a year. The story was so different a year and a half ago. With Enron's shares trading in the low 50s, Enron convinced analysts -- who openly admitted their ignorance of the telecommunications issues important to the broadband market -- that bandwidth delivery opportunities were huge. Enron cajoled the stock price into the $90s by August, after telling analysts that the broadband business alone was worth $37 per share, or $27 billion. Today, despite sound performance in its key, wholesale energy-distribution business, Enron's shares are worth $49.55. Even Wall Street, convinced perhaps that the prospects for an IPO of the once-hot Internet operations are totally dead, has gone back to analyzing energy prospects. Ronald Barone, a "natural gas/energy convergence" analyst with UBS Warburg in New York, lowered his price target Thursday on Enron from $102 to $70. In a report, he noted that his earlier projected price applied a multiple of 40 to his previous 2002 earnings target of $2.10 per share and $17 worth of value for broadband services. Now Barone assumes 32 to 33 times estimated 2002 per-share earnings of $2.15 (the same EPS estimate CEO Skilling offered on Thursday's conference call) and zero value for broadband. Enron must be one of the most promotional companies on the planet. If investors played the old Bob Newhart drinking game and had to refill their mugs every time Skilling said "outstanding" in relation to second-quarter performance, they would have been drunk before the question-and-answer session. But Skilling doesn't like the new reality. "Everything has been taken out of our stock for the bandwidth business," he correctly observed. "We are probably getting a negative impact on the stock, and I don't think that's right." Interestingly, as recently as January, management at Enron suggested to Wall Street that its discounted cash-flow models suggested a value of $126 for the stock, including $40 a share for the broadband business. Why companies feel it's proper even to comment on their own stock prices is a wonder. Skilling had nothing to say about the $126 valuation, and analysts didn't query him about it. Oh, it's right all right. No longer the bright shining prospect, broadband is a real drag on the company now, albeit a small one. Robert Franson, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York, notes that the old IPO rumor has been replaced by one suggesting Enron will sell or lease its broadband network while maintaining the services businesses built around it. "One great thing about Enron is that it is constantly getting out of businesses that aren't right," he says. Bear Stearns had the luxury of initiating coverage on Enron only in December, so it was able to sidestep the trap of perceived value to the broadband business. Donato Eassey of Merrill Lynch is hanging on to hope. "We believe Enron at current prices offers investors a free call option on the future of broadband, and the ultimate turnaround in the telecom market once it occurs," he told clients in a report. Eassey has a price target of $74.50 on Enron's shares. For what it's worth, in April 2000 Enron traded for about 43 times Wall Street's 2001 earnings estimates of about $1.65 per share. Now the company predicts 2001 EPS of $1.80 (showing the success of its main wholesale business), and is valued at about 23 times its own 2002 earnings estimates. It's worth noting that Enron is a good example of a company that has taken advantage of the Internet. Skilling said 60% of the company's transactions occurred on the Internet in the second quarter. That's impressive, but no more so than all the business Dell or Cisco does online. Efficient use of Internet infrastructure does not an Internet company make. Interestly, Enron is in much better shape than the upstart companies to which it eagerly compared itself 18 months ago in justifying a higher valuation. By giving up all of the hype-driven market value it received from gullible investors with dot-com stardust in their eyes, Enron merely is back to about where it belongs, or, as Skilling argues, perhaps a little lower. Comparable stand-alone "bandwidth" companies like Akamai and Exodus have given up most of their boom-time value. Enron prudently says it will maintain a stake in the ground of broadband services so it can benefit when the market materializes. Perhaps when that happens, Wall Street will value the incremental business for what it's worth, not what they dream it's worth.

The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to "immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure."  The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.Overview of OrderThe Order reflects a thorough review of  "all of [FERC's] rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply"; however, the Commission noted that its authority is "somewhat limited."  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection "underscores the regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace."  Accordingly, it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets.EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities.The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, include:-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based rate authorization.-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale market-based rates.The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November 1, 2002.-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.EPSA's CommentsIn its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be "concise and focused."  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the following areas:? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties.? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a "rolled in" approach to interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant recommendation.? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, are favorable developments.We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact either Julie Simon, jsimon@epsa.org or Mark Bennett, mbennett@epsa.org at (202 628-8200).

It still does not cover a number of items several of us have discussed, including certain insurance matters.  These items are part of an ongoing list of issues.  That list also includes the practical applicability of the infamous Section 5.07(b).   The Disclosure Schedules remain critical.  Please continue to review both the parent disclosures and the regional disclosures for gaps, inconsistencies, and duplications.  For example, while Corp. Risk Management is scheduling the various insurance handled by it, that group is not aware of insurance obtained at the local level.  Those policies at the regional level need to be listed, as well as checked to confirm that they are not implicated by a change of control.  The parent level policies have been reviewed for change of control implications.  Also, please confirm that the schedules include all claims against the involved entities; for example, there appear to be many claims made under the various insurance policies that have not yet become a litigation matter.Timing of the deal could soon become quite ugly.  Thanks for all of the help.  Lance. - Houston_290706_1.WPD - Houston_296564_1.WPD - PSA.8.11.00.pdf - CMP.PSA.8.11.00.pdf

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press WriterTuesday, April 10, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/04/10/national1812EDT0713.DTL (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a ``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price controls on wholesale power. Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California, engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that are expected to go only higher this summer. ``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC commissioners. California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999. But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt, said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed. FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power generation. Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to propose a price cap for deliberation. Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be tempered with common sense.'' ``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago. Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million in refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of tracking market abuses. The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided over whether the government should regulate electricity prices. Keeping tabs as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them, five against and three uncertain. Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in Olympia, Wash. ``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the problem. Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&E into bankruptcy.'' Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based price cap in the Western markets. ``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker of the California Assembly. He cited state actions to boost conservation, increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is ``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a year ago. Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing. ``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting. Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls. She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price implementation plan.'' The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator. Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate. While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little to address problems in the power markets. The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and reasonable'' wholesale power prices. ``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said. ``Politically we're getting beat up.'' Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to deal with the troubled electricity market. Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers. On the Net: FERC Web site: www.ferc.fed.us/ ,2001 Associated Press ?

The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.

I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.Kevin----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications on 11/29/00 08:38 AM -----ras22@cornell.edu11/29/00 06:19 AM  To: Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc:  Subject: Kevin-Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron'sparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and thepossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had achance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots onyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope allis well with you.            Nov.2 email textWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger linkwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of theagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictablemarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would likeEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in DynamicOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell andbeyond.The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a keyspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  Asdescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of threeconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations andstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "livecase study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,2001</underline>.You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, thisis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Layand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders andthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for thecorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, KenChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announcedPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has adistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved incontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of LeadershipWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from GoldmanSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Companyand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus FrankRhodes, but these are still long shots.The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at theJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanteda platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  Ifthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, thedate is March 28, 2001.       The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the samelines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, itcould become the basis for the March conference live case studypresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability toliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and managean organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in placethat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems tobe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems andpractices make this possible.I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational andleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team tobuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyerfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in theEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fastmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficientway.Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas andhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can tomake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  Asalways, thanks for your great personal support.Dick

London seems to be the same as when I left in August - no sun, cold, serious looking people, expensive, etc.  In addition, we have had May Day riots, a post office bombing, train strike, etc.  Not to mention all the excitement in Enron Credit. It would be nice to know who I am supposed to be reporting to.  I am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from Vasant.  According to you and Slava, the strategy paper/Duffie report seems to be a higher priority.  However, Vasant seems to indicate (in his forwarded email) that this is not the priority at the moment. In addition, there seems to be lots of chaos in Enron Credit - not only in the Houston office, but even more so in the London office.  This brings to mind a Russian proverb I learned from Slava when he expressed his views on the current state of Enron Credit - " a fish rots from the head." Finally, I would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this Duffie report:  Do you want to hear what Enron Credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "infrastructure"?  Or do you want to hear what I really see, hear, read, etc.?  If the latter is true, then I may need to write two reports, because what I am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the Enron Credit personnel too happy. Well, I think I have said enough for now.  Look forward to your feedback.Thanks,Iris -----Original Message-----From:  Shanbhogue, Vasant  Sent: Friday, May 04, 2001 3:39 PMTo: Mack, IrisCc: Dhar, AmitavaSubject: london workHi Iris, Amitava must have told you that both he and I are getting swamped with work here.  As a result, we expect you to take the lead in scoping the Enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied.  You should also make sure to understand the econometric/data analysis software side of the project -- this is probably more important than preparing a document for Duffie right now.  You should definitely sit with Ben/George and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used.  But we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data.  Both Amitava and I will help as best as we can, and answer any direct questions, but we will have limited time to review documents, etc.  I expect Amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming, but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data.Hope the trip is going well.  Would you be extending the trip for some more time?Vasant

It was my mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my added responsibilities.Sincerely,Mike Grigsby

I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below. -----Original Message-----From: Zisman, Stuart  Sent:Friday, January 11, 2002 11:02 AMTo:Nemec, GeraldCc:Redmond, Brian; Parks, JoeSubject:Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emailsI think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.Several interesting points from the meeting:1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. 2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. 5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.Stuart

In the attached spreadsheet you will find a listing of most of the channels which VisuPro uses to record data.  With some exceptions, each channel should correspond to a transducer on the turbine.  The channel name and number can be found in the left columns as they are presented in VisuPro.  The "Alias" column is my attempt to better understand the channel and put a more meaningful label on the channel for presentation to the field personnel.  Wherever there is a blank it means that I do not have a good explanation of the channel and need more information.  You can ignore the grey shading.  It is just an indicator as to whether the particular channel is currently included in the existing version of our SPC analytic.  The more interesting column is the "Include" column which is our future plan regarding inclusion of the particular channel in the next revision of the analytic.Please do provide comments regarding simplified label names.  Also please note that I need further clarification on cells with comments inserted (look for the red traingle in the top right corner of 3 of the cells).The other thing I would really like to have is a picture, or drawing, of the exact location of each of the transducers we are planning on including.  This would give myself and the field personnel great insight as to what the measurements really represent.Thanks,Hollis

Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., thelargest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in alawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronictrading system.     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction SourceLLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller SpecifiedExchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperlyusing that patented technology through its Internet-basedelectronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commoditiessuch as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringingthe patent, and is asking for damages.     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas inNovember 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it'shandled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685billion, the company has said.     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million onrevenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.     Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.

Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.   It is currently envisioned that if any sale of the interests by Enron does occur, it would be open to the public as well as employees.Please note that your response will not obligate either you or Enron in any way.  Responses will be considered an expression of interest only, and do not guarantee if, when, or at what price respondents may be able to purchase these assets. If you have any questions, please call Elizabeth Linnell at x33896.Location Price per PSLPrice per Season Ticket  Total Price per seatA$3,900$745$4,645B$1,900$645$2,545Club 1$2,100$2,575$4,675Club 2$1,900$1,575$3,475

This year, we have tried a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.

All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.  Thanks in advance for you help on this.

Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:1)        We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)2)        We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)3)        Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)4)        Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.Regards,Jon

Pattern devel=oping as advertised, but will the cold air materialize?  The Southern strea=m storm track is alive and well and should continue to be so for the next c=ouple of weeks. All of the models point to the potential of healthy winter =storms in the midst of a warmer than normal temperature pattern. The lack o=f realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again the air simply is n=ot that frigid. We are still below normal relative to normal over much of t=he South and West. In the West, it is due to high pressure trapped in the I=ntermountain region while in the South it is in response to inclement weath=er along the storm track. The North and East are back into a warming mode i=n spite of the fact that a trough will reform in the East. Upstream over th=e Western h! alf of Canada, it is just not that cold anymore. The MRF is up= to its old tricks of a sharp cooling "just past this period" and the Canad=ian still insists on a moderate intensity high coming down this weekend. It= may well turn cooler, but certainly not in an excessive way. The five day =numbers will be warming, not cooling.     Tomorrow: Thursday, February  7, =2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " future California", we propose the following changes:1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

Byrne It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch. Under his leadership, General Electric reinvented itself several times over by integrating new and innovative practices, including Six Sigma and the Internet, into its many lines of business. In Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_47>, Welch, with the help of John Byrne, talks about his career and the style of management that helped to make GE one of the most successful companies of the last century.

In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and "dangerous" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com.

Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why "values" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.    <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>Read more <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_65> Our Price: $19.25    You Save: $8.25 (30%)         <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281777/ref=mk_del_235668_67> Toward Rational Exuberance: The Evolution of the Modern Stock Market <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281777/ref=mk_del_235668_68>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>by B.

Koehn In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.   <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>Read more <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_73> Our Price: $27.96    You Save: $11.99 (30%)        More Business & Investing Editors' PicksThe Essential Drucker <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066210879/ref=mk_del_235668_75>The Agenda <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609661/ref=mk_del_235668_76>The Attention Economy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157851441X/ref=mk_del_235668_77>Breaking Windows <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743203151/ref=mk_del_235668_78>Now, Discover Your Strengths <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201140/ref=mk_del_235668_79>Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046508138X/ref=mk_del_235668_80>  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>See all Business & Investing Editors' Picks <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/221638/ref=mk_del_235668_81>   <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>Best Books of 2001: Customers' Picks   <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/shadow.gif><http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399144463/ref=mk_del_235668_821773040>Check out our list of bestselling business and investing books of 2001.

We can find a way to get a long term commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the price risk.  On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an additional reference point.

Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts?  Jeff

For example, if I want to see all business that is being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12 different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.  Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk first when submitting a report.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.Thanks!Kathy

I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.

The second should be an update of the deal with NNG.  Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events.  Call if you have questions.  Thanks.

Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

Our current language merely states:  "Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or empoyees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording."  Here are the facts and issues:1.  Our agreements provide for arbitration (most likely) or jurisdiction in specific courts or are silent as to jurisdiction.2.  ENA policy is to destroy trader tapes after 6 months.3.  If we are doing our job, a written and signed confirmation should exist in our files for each and every financial transaction.  On occasion, we have not confirmation signed by ENA's counterparty.By agreeing to add "admissability" language, are we waiving the parol evidence rule?  Do we always want the ability to introduce existing recordings?Can you provide us with language acceptable to ENA that we might propose to a counterparty (when asked)?Here's an example of a recent request:  "Any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the prupose of extablishing any matters pertinent to the [ISDA] Agreement."

Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).

According to the company's Articles, it may prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the Sweden and Finland.Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?Martin

I would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below:IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 7/25Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future.A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones.All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow later):1 Mega conference room1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities1 Large conference room - no videoconference 3 Team roomsFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible.At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries and distribution.Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building.I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible.Mike

I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.Any questions -- give me a call.S.Christine Stokes08/03/2000 09:26 AMTo: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRONcc:  Subject: TW IOS PostingSusan, please review the following IOS posting.

Crop receipts issued by cooperatives in Brazil==20are 11 percent greater than they were in 1999-2000.   Our top source in=20London believes that the 2000-2001 crop has been largely discounted by the==20market and that the focus should be on 2001-2002.2. 2001-2002 CropThis is the crop that should be currently flowering in Brazil, but was=20impacted by the June frost and the October dry weather.  The harvest for th=e=202001-2002 crop will run from April 2001 to November 2001 and will be export=ed=20in the second half of 2001 and in the first half of 2002.  The Brazilian=20government is likely to release its 2001-2002 forecast in December or Janua=ry=202001.  The 1999 plantings garnered expectations of a 2001-2002 crop yield o=f=2044-46 million bags.  However, recent weather problems have caused a=20significant downgrade of this forecast to between 33 and 40 million bags.Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential==20for even greater damage to the 2001-2002 crop, in the range of up to a 50==20percent drop, or 22-23 million bags.  Agronomists from Cooxupe, the largest==20coffee cooperative in Brazil, have already pegged their first estimate at==2027.8 million bags.  Again, however, it is critical to remember that growers==20tend to exaggerate weather damage, which is then further exacerbated by=20market rumors.  As evidence, dry weather in the spring (Sept-Dec in Brazil)==20of 1999 caused alarm regarding the 2000-2001 crop.  Even though the dry=20weather did not end until December 1999, there was still time for flowering=,=20which caused many market watchers to upgrade their forecasts.While analysts and growers agree that the highly irregular status of the=20coffee trees makes the 2001/2002 crop one of the most difficult to evaluate=,=20the occurrence of average to normal rainfall will greatly sharpen crop=20forecasting efforts.  It is most critical for the rest of November and=20December.  Recent rains since the last week of October have begun to addres=s=20the hydrological deficit in the soil.  Continued, steady, well-dispersed=20rains will help offset losses, but estimated irreversible damage to the=20expected yield of 44-46 million bags from frost and dry weather to date wil=l=20be a minimum of 15 percent, making the new yield forecast no greater than==2038-40 million bags.  A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the==20end of December could bring yield down to a 30 percent loss from the=20forecast, in the range of 33-36 million bags.Rain is particularly significant because the new planting in recent years h=as=20been concentrated in the Cerrado (savannah) region of Northern Brazil.  The==20coffee can be mechanically harvested in this region, but requires significa=nt=20irrigation.  The irrigation alone will only partially offset the dry=20weather. =20The frost damage from June 2000 accounts for a 75 percent crop loss in Para=na=20and a 20 percent crop loss in Sao Paulo, but these states only account for =20=20percent of total Brazilian production.  In Minas Gerais (almost 60 percent =of=20production), the crop losses are only 10 percent.  Crop losses in Espiritu==20Santo, which accounts for 10 percent of production, have been negligible.Our sources will monitor rainfall and flowering/cherry formation on the=20coffee trees, which must occur by January 2001.

Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.Pre-Petition ExpensesWe will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.Thank you for your patience.

6x16; capacity with monthly take or pays; and swing capacity.The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis' proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs. Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility DebtWorking on a forbearance agreementNo more information out of that groupEnron in attendence; Houston credit people on Friday.QF GroupThis group met for the first time Thursday evening.Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using long-term gas tolling agreements.Status of Major Issues from Long-Term ContractsMAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made.Kind of Auction or RFP -- Seems to be resolved as discussed above. Absence of Any State Officials -- Continues to concern participants.  Everyone standing firm that no deal can be struck without State buy-in and relief from litigation and investigations.Next StepsWG1 reconvenes at 9am Friday to finish its report and work products.Apparent joint meeting with WG2 at 10:00 am.QF Group reconvenes at 2pmTreasury and others will assess whether Saturday meeting with "principals" (CEOs, Governore) should take place. Tentatively planned for 3:30 pm.

Morning Market View(TM) for Tuesday, September 4, 2001                       as of 9:30AM EDT Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research ================================================================MERGER MANIAThe extended vacation weekend appears to have recharged the competitive batteries in both the technology and energy sectors as several companies headed down the acquisition trail this morning. Equity index futures hinted at a negative open for stocks, extending the downside bias from Europe, despite some early enthusiasm following Hewlett Packard's (HWP,23) bid for Compaq Computer (CPQ,12.35,f4).Computer giant Hewlett-Packard has agreed to purchase rival Compaq Computer in a deal worth $25 billion in stock, as both companies look to enhance their competitiveness in an industry plagued by languishing sales and an ongoing price war. Hewlett-Packard will own 64% of the combined company with Compaq owning the remaining 36%. The announcement could put pressure on computer titans Dell (DELL,21,f1) and International Business Machines (IBM,100,f2), and the pricing war is likely to extend to computer services and network storage.Oklahoma-based Devon Energy Corp. (DVN,46,f2) has made an offer to purchase Canadian energy company Anderson Exploration Ltd. (AXN,17.07) for $3.4 billion, plus the assumption of $1.2 billion in debt, in a deal that would make the company the largest among independent North American exploration and production companies. The move comes just three weeks after Devon announced its acquisition of Mitchell Energy Corp. (MND,57) for $3.1 billion.In other energy news, Santa Fe International (SDC,25) agreed to acquire adversary Global Marine (GLM,14.40,f2) for approximately $3 billion in stock, plus the assumption of $900 million in debt, creating the world's second biggest offshore oil and natural gas driller.Chip stocks could see some volatile trading action today after the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that worldwide semiconductor sales in July fell 37.2% from the year-ago period to $10.86 billion. Sales were down 6.1% from June, but the agency's President said that he anticipated an end to the inventory correction in 3Q, with sequential growth beginning in 4Q.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Bonds were fairly active in front of this morning's National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey scheduled for a 10:00 a.m. EDT release. A Dow Jones Newswires forecast is looking for the index to move up to 44 from July's 43.6 reading, reflecting a slight deceleration in contraction in the manufacturing sector. The upward bias comes on the heels of last Friday's Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, which showed a regional slowdown in the pace of contraction in manufacturing.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETS Hewlett Packard's announced bid for Compaq sent stocks soaring overseas early, but gains were reversed with the Bloomberg European 500 Index down 0.33% as of 8:55 a.m. EDT. Early gains were tempered a bit by Ericsson's (ERICY,4.98,f1) warning that it sees no imminent recovery in the market for telecommunications products next year. Adding fuel to the fire in the beleaguered industry, both Marconi's (MONI,1.68,f1) CEO and chairman stepped down as the company said that it would post a first-half operating loss, due to substantial writedowns for inventory and recent acquisitions. The company had previously expected a breakeven first-half. The euro was lower against the U.S. dollar after failing to extend its recent uptrend, amid some sanguine economic data in the U.S. last week.Technology shares led Asian markets higher, with Japan's Nikkei closing up 3.49%. The yen was lower against the dollar as rhetoric about FOREX intervention to cap any unwarranted strength in the Japanese currency continued. Japan's prime minister gave banking stocks a boost after confirming that the worst of non-performing loans would be written off the books within two to three years.----------------------------------------------------------------FUTURES WATCH In the September Globex futures contract as of 8:55 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 Index was down 1 point, while the Nasdaq 100 Index was down 4.5 points (4 points below fair value). The September DJIA futures contract was down 30 points (6 points below fair value), and the October crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX were down $0.06 at $27.14/barrel.William Johnson, Market Analyst################################################################Log in using the links below to:Access your account:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=YView your Email Alert customization options:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlertsPerform research or request a market quote:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=QuotesPlace a trade order:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStockTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:http://www.schwab.com/-----------------------------------------------------------------To unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,log in using the link below or copy and paste it into your browser's address window:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlertsNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format, using helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that connect you directly to information you want.

Weather a little cooler for this week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  Leads to more upside potential in short term.  My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside.  Thoughts?

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is not valid for the deal?When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be added to the deal.

This is a very high policy issue for Enron Corp.  As a matter of Enron Corp. legal policy, Enron Corp. cannot agree to waiver of jury trial.  This policy is specific to Enron Corp. and may or may not   apply to the operating companies.  If there was an agreement to such a term, it would require approval by Mr. Derrick.  I can only recall one time that Mr. Derrick approved the waiver.  Also, in Part 4(h), by virtue of the language, Enron Corp. agrees to jurisdiction in any court.  If jurisdiction is to be contractually agreed upon (and silence is not an option), the choices should be Texas (which in this case is probably not an option) or New York, with the specific courts being the United States District Court for the Southern District sitting in Manhattan or, if in state court, the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.

Also, attending the meeting on behalf of the Alliance Partners was a representative from Arthur Andersen who will be assisting them in this process.  AA has also been working with the Partners since their own inception of forming an RTO.Overall the meeting was productive and we focused on both asset valuations as well as structural issues.  We itemized a general list of data/info (deliverables) that will be necessary to begin the analysis/negotiation process.  We also highlighted a list of specific issues related to structural aspects which we (ENE) felt were critical path items and have to be addressed.The Alliance Partners focus is that the combination of operating synergies, revenue enhancements, growth and financial engineering for a Pipe/Wire combo has to produce significant upside value that the Wires Co can't get on its own.  Of the 5 Alliance Partners, it is clear that 3 of them (AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison) are definitely "in the game" and serious about moving forward.  We're not so sure about either CMS or Va Power.  The primary obstacle seems to be both parties apparent reluctance to divulge the level of financial/operating information (which they feel is too sensitive of info to be shared on an individual basis at this time) necessary to move the deal forward.  They did however agree to AA playing the role of an information clearinghouse whereby each Alliance Partner can send its individual data to AA who in turn will aggregate it into one "Wires Co."  Finally, both CMS and VP seem to be somewhat "non-committal" towards how they would participate (i.e., divest, lease, etc...) but AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison all made it very clear that once the group (at least a majority thereof) decides to move forward, any entity not divesting would be excluded from subsequent discussions, etc... where values, structural issues, etc... are being discussed.  They would essentially be treated as a counterparty in an ordinary contracting process.The path forward with action items and deadlines are as follows:1/7 - ENE is to provide AA with basic GPG financial info pursuant to the list we discussed in the meeting (basically, FERC Form 2 data)1/7 - ENE is also to provide to AA for each of the 5 Alliance Partners, the financial info, assumptions, etc... we have used to date in our analysis1/7 - CMS to decide if they're interested in including their pipes (PEPL and TGP)1/10 - AA is to distribute ENE's assumptions/info to each respective Alliance Partner for them to review/confirm/edit (as needed)1/17 - AA is to have gathered the individual data from each Partner and "aggregate" it into one Wires Co and submit it to all parties including ENE1/28 - AA is to analyze and quantify the potential operating synergies for Wires Co and submit a new "synergized" version of Wires Co financial data/info2/4 - next meeting with ENE and Alliance Partners scheduled in Houston at ENE office (Beth Ryan coordinating details)ENE to outline/summarize details re: all structural issues and send to Alliance Partners prior to the 2/4 meeting in HoustonIf you have any questions/comments, call me at x33212 to discuss.RANDY

This is a very delicate situation in that WWF will use whatever you say, even the hint of the slightest committement, against Enron in the future. As you know, I have found this group the most dishonest, back dealing  NGO I have ever dealt with.When Shell has these meetings, they have my counterpart meet ahead of time with the the WWF top staff person and work out an agenda. For example, you will have to be throughly briefed on the Bolivian situation before we go in.  I also would find it counter productive to include any of the low level WWF staff that went to this meeting when Shell held it last.   Remember, this is the group that publicly announced that Enron has gotten away with murder for years and we are going to get them.  They also have te goal of wanting to lock us up in a world wide partnership. This is the last groupo I would do this with.I guess this is a long way of saying that we need to go in their well prepared with our eyes wide open. Did you commit to any agenda when you set up the meeting? I will contact their staff and see what they want to discuss and when I get back to the states, I start pulling materials together.

Furthermore, thecolumn is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) andmisleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-awayCapacity").

If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news. We need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.Stacey BoltonEnvironmental StrategiesEnron Corp713-853-9916 direct 713-303-2632 cell sbolton@enron.com <mailto:sbolton@enron.com>

That was the assessment Adrian Moore, executive director of Reason Public Policy Institute, gave of a state Senate committee's recent move to hold Enron Corp. in contempt for refusing to hand over subpoenaed documents.  We're inclined to agree. The Texas-based energy merchant has filed a countersuit in Sacramento Superior Court, arguing that the Senate has no right to wield influence beyond state borders and that putting the documents into public view "jeopardized confidential business information," the Register reported Thursday.  The court should order the Senate either to make its document request more specific or to drop the contempt charge and subpoena altogether. Robert Levy, a constitutional law expert at the Cato Institute, told us that Enron's point about disclosing confidential information will be its strongest argument in court.  While Enron can't hide behind state borders, Levy says the Senate's request is not tailored narrowly enough to ensure information that could damage Enron's market viability is not released. He said the Senate should have to let a judge decide whether releasing the documents is necessary for its investigation and avoids unfairly harming Enron.  Instead, the full Senate just has to approve the committee's recommendation for Enron's executives to become criminals. "It seems to me that's a scary proposition," Levy said. "Why should the Senate have such plenary power?" Good question.  Moore told us it's because the energy crisis has created an "all-bets-are-off" situation in Sacramento, where anything goes so long as it's attacking the energy companies. Because Enron is just a merchant, not a producer, of energy, it couldn't have had much at all to do with manipulating the market. "It's impossible," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer told us Friday. "We don't have anything to withhold.  We don't have an interest in high prices in California. We're just interested in a marketplace that works." Added Moore, "It's pretty hard to spin a realistic scenario where they (Enron) engaged in gouging." Moore said a judge's recent ruling that criticized Davis' allegations against energy producers gives hope the Sacramento court very likely could side with the law rather than the witchhunt. Here's hoping he's right. Sue MaraEnron Corp.Tel: (415) 782-7802Fax:(415) 782-7854

We agree with Chairman Hoecker and other FERC commissioners that this report is a sound beginning to the process of repairing the marketplace, but that more actions will need to be taken, at both the state and federal level, before the goal of a working, competitive energy market can be realized in California. "The new bid framework the Commission ordered represents a creative attempt to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to evolve. Our hope is that this new framework will be successful in moderating electricity prices. "While the report does not find evidence of market power abuse in California this summer, FERC does provide for potential refunds, should abuse be discovered, effective as of the beginning of October 2000. "We are very pleased with the opportunity the Commission has given us to review and comment upon this report, and look forward to providing our comments on November 9, and throughout this proceeding."The FERC action comes one day after Pacific Gas and Electric Company made an unprecedented $790 million payment to the Power Exchange for wholesale electricity costs for the single month of August 2000. "The wholesale electric market in California is clearly broken," said Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "We cannot continue to borrow money to pay excessive wholesale power prices, which will hit our customers sooner or later. We welcome thoughtful intervention to repair the market." # # #

You then apparently decided to put yourself back into the process and schedule a meeting that I did not agree to attend. I made it very clear that it would be difficult for me to attend a meeting today, but that I could try to break free for 2:30. I then thought that it would be on ME not yourself to schedule this meeting if I was able to break lose from my meeting by 2:30.I left my schedule open most of last week in order to resolve this issue. However, we never got a response from Steve to allow us to close this item. Before any phone call takes place to Steve tomorrow, you and I will talk about the handling of this item going forward. Please stop by at your earliest convenience so that we can put this issue to rest.

It's been truly chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.Thanks for your patience,Kate   From:  Kimberly Allen                           01/17/2001 11:11 AMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: #485446Kate, did we ever find out if this language for Price on the the Constellation confirms was o.k.?KI---------------------- Forwarded by Kimberly Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/17/2001 01:11 PM ---------------------------   Enron North America Corp.From:  Kimberly Allen                           01/10/2001 10:45 AMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: #485446  Man what planet did you come from:) Your awesome!KI   Kate Symes                01/10/2001 10:34 AMTo: Kimberly Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: #485446  Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and get someone else's opinion.Thanks,Kate   From:  Kimberly Allen                           01/10/2001 06:57 AMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: #485446  Kate, I just faxed over the Constellation confirm just in case you need to view it.
