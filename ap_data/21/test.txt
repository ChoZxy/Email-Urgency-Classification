564	0	I figured out why you've been so tense. You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.  That's not your concern.  I just checked the stats myself. Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here. They're exactly the same as last month.
93	0	 [to Kramer] You left the door open?!  Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I  Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
185	1	 (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!  I shrunk it.  I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, "It's not
598	0	So, Dad, can I, uh, interest you in an ice-cold Ballantine? Yeah, sounds good. You know, I may even join you myself. I've got some pork rinds here and some of that creamy Lipton onion soup dip
563	0	And on the other hand, it does bode well for Dad getting a 'yes' when he proposes. He has a right to know about this. But we already told him we weren't involved in the investigation, we can't just tell him now we were lying Maybe there's some way to impart the information without explaining how we came by it. You know, just sort of drop it casually in the conversation.
181	1	Original. No, sorry haven't seen him. Then what's that big lump under your covers?
650	0	Tip-top shape. Oh... Stanley? No. Um-um.

627	0	I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.  Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance.
805	0	Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. Its not a library... So, Dr. Green, hows the old boat.
638	0	 All right, now you call it in the air.  No catchin'.  No no.

551	0	I just tune it out. It's like a white noise machine. First off, that's racist. Second of all, you caught the Disco Strangler, right? That dude wrapped a lot of yo-yos around a lot of hookers' necks. Nice collar. But the thing I can't understand is: young superstar detective takes down a serial killer... why'd it take you so long to get your first command? Because I'm gay.
1	1	 P-muls!  Wait...Before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face. Someone died. No! You won a prize! I'm not getting better at this.  I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.
354	1	Err, "I think you know".  "Bastard"! "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
896	0	 I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?  Boy.. I don't know.  I'd do it but I don't have any money.
365	1	Oh, yes, well, speaking of Daphne. While you're waiting for Daphne, why don't you go out, get yourself a candy bar out of the machine. Mommy says candy rots tooth enamel. Yes, well, chew on the side of your mouth, rot your baby teeth.
496	1	 It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish  Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?  Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
423	0	Not that weird.  Cold? Like a dead guy?  You're reading into that.
516	0	Happy birthday to you. Find a key. Happy birthday...
856	0	 Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before. It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8. Detective Smith. We called him Smitty. He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed.  But then he found a case, and he solved it. And now he's married to Kate Upton.  No. No one would go out on calls with him. He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team. It was actually quite violent.
567	0	I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.   ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams... My theory is that...
583	0	Awww, just like his daddy. Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The deans office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour? What-what about Monica?
373	1	Although... I'm listening. What do we actually accomplish by learning to change our own spark plugs? Oh yes, of course we acquire a new skill, but aren't we taking a job away from a qualified mechanic?
492	0	 I think it's real turkey.  Is there a real bird in the back?  No, there's not bird but-
57	0	 Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.  Alright.  (To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

210	1	Key's in the envelope. Thank you. What do you need that so loud for? I swear you've gone deaf as a post
574	1	(to the bear) Whelp... we did it, Fuzzy. We got 'em. You can come home now. (as the bear) "I don't know if I can. I've been undercover so long, I don't even know who I am anymore. I've done terrible things." All right. (as Fuzzy, crying) "I strangled a Mr. Potato Head with my bare hands. Oh God, what have I become?!"
796	0	Hey! Hey! What are you up too?
531	1	I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know? So, you think you'll do it on his couch? Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
132	0	No-- We don't have-- Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.  Uh... Yes.
828	0	 What are you guys talking about?  Um, just weird s*x stuff that has nothing to do with work.  I once had s*x on a futon. And it was in couch mode.
524	0	I don’t know. I called his cell, I called his house... You’re going to have to go on for him. Me? Yeah, you – well, I’m not. Last time I did it, it was a total disaster
758	0	Ooh, you know, you really need to stop saying that. You've got to make your feelings clear to her, and the sooner the better. There's very little point letting it drag on like this. You're right. I'll speak to her tonight.
802	0	Ok, read it back to me.  Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets. Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
392	1	 Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?  Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.  Well, this is it. I'm selling.
5	1	Oh, thanks.  Michael? Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
746	0	 Sell it, just say I'm selling!  (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He  You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
623	0	How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping.  Mope?  You're already moping!...Would you take the place?
854	0	Give me that. Listen, this is Dr. Niles Crane. I've never been treated so shabbily in my entire life and I've a good mind to come over there and create an embarrassing scene. Niles, they've already hung up. Ah... thank God Well, what now, Frasier? It's Saturday night, quarter-to-eight, and we-we're not going to get in anywhere.
675	1	 Granted.  Are you sure you didn't mean "don flan"? Thanks.  Nice. Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.

352	0	Losers.  To sign up to become junior police officers.  Snitches. What about it?
526	0	 Now I gotta read something?  Greetings. Fine. I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.  [scoffs] I don't need your help. It's nothing personal. It's just... You're not a cop, so I'm not really sure you could help.
414	0	Meow I'm glad you're on my side. I can do this. Sorry, everyone Oh, you newlyweds Just can't be apart for one second
237	1	Uhhhh... Thank you, Dr. Crane, for your most insightful comment. G-Goodbye. Wait, Sid Sid, if you're listening, your insecurity is rooted in your fear of making a mistake. In order to beat this thing, you're going to have to practice. If you work at it very hard. Then, one day, you too may achieve the command and confidence to which we all aspire to... be having. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good mental health. That was a show good, Frasier.
892	0	Heh heh.   Do you have your passport? I have my passport.

789	0	Sure.  All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!   Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
12	0	Now, now, Frasier, don't get me wrong. I think you're witty, you're clever, but funny's different. Funny's somebody who makes you laugh with your belly. Now, Bulldog's funny. Duke's cousin, Louie, now he's really funny He's like Jackie Gleason, only loud He makes you laugh so hard the beer comes out of your nose. You know what feels good through the nose? A warm cup of cocoa. I just may go home for Christmas this year. You know, just because I haven't caused anyone to blow beer through their nostrils doesn't mean that I can't. Anyone who can compose a clever ballad can certainly master the intricacies of the whoopee cushion

(Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean. Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
662	1	That's what I'm thinking. Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? (to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!

480	0	Well, think about it. Walking the streets, picking up trash; You can see how Roz would go with the familiar. Old people just make me uncomfortable. Roz, have you considered that your discomfort around the elderly may stem from your own fear of growing old?
30	1	 All talented detectives haves their ups and downs, Peralta.  So you think I'm talented. You said it. No takebacks.  You know why Boyle doesn't slump?

167	1	 Thank you, sir. But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina. She's the one that got through to the kids.  Yes, I am amazing. And I only ask for one thing in repayment. A 600% raise.  Or... I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing. I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good at the job.

Perhaps a crossword puzzle. Maybe watch a little telly. Oh, I know--how about a nice hot bath?I'm just teasing. Now, I know that you're used to eating canned tuna, so this will taste different, but if you're like me, I think you'll agree it's much better. If only there were a treat here for me.

I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious.

460	0	mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it. I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night. I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
