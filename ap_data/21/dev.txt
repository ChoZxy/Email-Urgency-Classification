288	1	What? What happened? What?
411	1	Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey. I can't be your monkey, Dwight. I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
626	1	No kidding, that goatee sure came in fast. I know. I credit the hothouse atmosphere of this tropical paradise â€“ that and our nearly constant nudity.Gone is the citified dandy of just last week.

Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...
925	0	OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
978	0	You don't watch much basketball, do you? It's my game, man. Because of me we've lost six in a row. Oh. Well, I'm not very well-versed in sports psychology, but I could certainly schedule a session. No, no. I need something fast. We got Phoenix tonight.

826	0	But it's cool, and it's- This isn't a good use of company time, Michael. Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
222	1	 And yellow. And I see the letters "L", "R", "S", "T", "W", "E", and "B."  So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?  Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage.
604	1	Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. Yeah? Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
38	0	What's happening?  I think they're laughing at you.  That's never happened before. I don't like it.
832	0	Take it.  Who is it?  It's for you.
8	1	You know what? It might be a bit soon, but I think I'm gonna give Monica a call. D'you see that? The character in this movie dialed the phone and at the exact same moment, our phone rings. It's like Montgomery Cliff's callin' me. Say hello to him for me.
133	0	Thank you. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. Yes like a chime or a bell...
258	0	How'd it go with Rosa? We will not be seeing a movie. But -- and this is big -- she called me "sweet." Sweet's pretty good, right? Sweet's not good. Grow a pair.

833	0	Oh you knew that. Good! I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
313	0	No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did. Might've done. And how... do you figure?

128	0	You can't stop me. I'm going. You're not going, actually. Because if you'll just take a quick peek to your right, you'll see Detectives Boyle and Diaz. Over there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Can you believe that? A captain, on a stakeout! He's kind of a hands-on dude. Point is, we have you surrounded -- -- oh my God, I figured out the tie thing! Captain -- hey, I figured it out!

646	1	 Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here. I got in touch with Smitty. He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck. Okay? Now you try it.  Okay. Yep. It's definitely helping. I can feel it. The curse is lifting off of me. Ah, hand cramp!  Rub, rub, rub.

589	0	I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud. Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
691	0	Quiet, please. Come on, guys, I don't want to have to raise my voice. Rosa? Shut up! Everyone shuts up. Thank you, Rosa. First off, Gina has some administrative announcements.
404	1	 The fairy princess castle has defeated me. I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain. I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours. Why does it have to be so hard? Look... This screw has three point sides. And nowhere to screw it in! [screw clatters to floor] And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? [screams as he starts destroying what's left of the castle]  117A. Yes. 117B. Yes. 118A. Wait a minute. Hey, just heading to the can.  Take the rabbit's foot.

I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.  Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.

192	1	Help yourself. Okay, well where were we? Oh, that's right, my husband. Anyway, he says he doesn't love me, he's bored, blah, blah, he's suffocating. If only, I say. I would've gotten a nice little settlement. I mean, we were covered up the yin-yang. He had a sweet whole-life policy that paid double for accidental death. I borrowed against it to get my Hyundai.

189	0	 So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?  Ah, maybe. All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases. [deep breath] And I now see that that was your plan all along. And that you're capable of smiling.  All talented detectives haves their ups and downs, Peralta.
639	0	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you? No. I... Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.

And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it.   Come in.
773	0	 (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while still on the phone.)  I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.  I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit

33	0	Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. No! Why? Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really I don't mind.
993	1	Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us! Which one are you?  I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
