564.0	1.0	Everyone in this play is stupidly in love.
93.0	1.0	Story and wording are cute. But the illustrations are not quite my thing.
185.0	2.0	I gave up after eight chapters. The characters were relatable or likeable and if I'm honest the whole past and present thing put me off completely. However, Jenny Han is still a great author and Burn for Burn is amazing!!
598.0	4.0	(violence) I suppose this would be a good place to start if you have a child interested in Norse Mythology. My complaints are many, though.   First, the preface in the edition I read was not helpful. In fact, the preface seemed almost like an apology for the fact the the D'aulaires followed a old Norse work of poetry (one of the two oldest written works of Norse mythology- it was an oral tradition before that). In the Norse poetry, the gods (except nine) destroy themselves in a giant battle and then the earth starts again in a Christian type era serving only the Almighty. Of course when any book adds in a Christian aspect, it tends to be shunned, so the preface does it's best to remove an validity of the Christian myth and at the same time demotes the Bible to just another book of myths.   Second, the authors tried to turn the Norse Myths into a continuous story. This doesn't work well for myths. Most are short, sweet, and disjointed. Trying to force them to be something they are not is more distracting than anything else. It also helps people who are unfamiliar with oral traditions/myths and anything more than brief Bible stories to make cute comparisons between mythology and the Bible.   Third, and I know I will be alone in this, but the artwork didn't impress me either. Yeah, they made real stone lithographs to create their work, but it just wasn't exciting me.
563.0	1.0	An odd conception, somewhat cartoon-like. The slight change to the ending isn't an improvement.
181.0	5.0	"My review will be spotty as I'm reading this interleaved with the rest of the Avengers vs. X-Men event books.   Nice setup - finally we see Hope's Phoenix power really threaten, and we get some genuine-seeming interactions between the key characters.   However, once the fighting begins, the ridiculous narration as each pair of fighters punch each other is brutal. It's like an amateur boxing announcer, trying to generate gravitas and meaning from what are generally meaningless events. ""Wow, looks like Luke Cage really got a good left hook on Namor!"". Actually, the real writing is even more embarrassing: ""Organic diamond meets multi-billion dollar armor. The most expensive punch in history.""   Some of the fights come out of nowhere on pretty trumped-up charges - like Wolverine vs. Captain America. When there's no natural tension, it's hard to care about the outcome or to feel caught up in the ""epic nature"" of this event. It creates a momentary interesting stress for Wolverine, and a couple of smiles at his predicament, but it wraps up all too quickly. The futile searches in issue 4 are hints of action that presumably unfolds in other comics, or doesn't matter - everything leading up to the fearsome meeting of force and host.   The turning point mid-way through took me by surprise, and even though it seems too cool I'm sure the event mechanics can't help but screw it up somehow. And so they do - a pretty weakly-thought-out pretext for the US government to desire to intervene with Avengers (not even consistent with current policies let alone with logic) starts the whole ball rolling, and the rather extreme reaction by the X-Men in charge is even more out of place (among the many other options and historical behaviours available). I know this series is billed as ""versus"" but it's still klangs falsely to see everything so quickly reduce to ""us or them"" within the space of every issue or so.   The most authentic in-character moment of this turn is when Namor throws a tantrum and finds a way to take ""overboard"" to a new level. I don't get Scott Summers being quite the asshole he's turned into here (though he's shown signs over the last few years), but the Emma of this part of the series is exactly what I'd expect. Unfortunately the two Russians are pretty much left out and not displaying a whiff of their true personalities.   What I find frustrating about these Events is that the antagonists only get to enjoy their victory for about one issue before things start to go to hell. It's absolutely like they're on a clock, and there's no time to waste on exploring the new reality that comes about. I'd love to explore the world of the Phoenix Five for a less-limited time period (is this a world we could do a separate series on, like House of M?), and while some of the crossover books are trying to pick up this thread, in the main book it's like we're on rails and can't slow down to look around. I'd be just as interested in exploring the Avengers characters while they deal with defeat after defeat - what does Captain America start thinking when he just loses all the time?   You know what this (and Shadowland, and Siege, and Fear Itself) reminds me of a little? Final Crisis, where Morrison wove decades of mythology together into the most compressed and inexcusably impossible-to-enjoy Wikipedia article on DC. It felt like all facts, no exploration. These events aren't *quite* that bad, but if you examine the main title only, it's hard to feel like you care when they follow such predictable story arcs: massive new threat, heroes gang together and lose, they regroup and find some arbitrary weakness of the threat, and inevitably come out bruised but victorious (optional: someone dies for up to a year).   However, even despite this I felt a little thrill when Scott Summers finally starts to falter at an opponent he can't blow away, and the way that they've tied the different mythologies together to make this climax come about is creative, if not always entirely consistent or natural.   Oddly, even though all writers are credited with the Story for every issue, the different writers' styles and biases start to really show near the end. When Scott decides he needs more power during a fight with Hope, it looks like he's gone over the edge (Brubaker). Next issue, he's afraid and disgusted with Emma's comfort with the power (Bendis). Hard to feel like a clear through-line was really well thought out. Bendis amps this up exactly the same way he amped up Siege - same double-page emphasis on dumb moments, same bombastic/fatalistic dialogue from characters who usually know better than to go to the edge and stay there. It's about the only destination you could go with the way this story has been structured, but it's disappointingly predictable.   Then Aaron comes in at the end and does a great job pulling the challenges of a railed event together into a finale. I even accept how the Phoenix Force is dealt with, though I would far rather have liked to see Hope act as the Phoenix for a couple of years at least. But holy crap does Aaron (or the plotting team) fumble the wrap up. ""Without his visor, Scott Summers couldn't open his eyes. But somehow he could still see all the blood on his hands."" ""this is something a bit more Uncanny.""""Tony Stark, man of faith. Will wonders never cease?"" ""If only the ends always justified the means."" Aaron just pulled off such a poetic ending for Scalped, and then he (they?) delivers this series of thudders.   The VS issues are hit-and-miss, but on their own they're almost as much fun as ""best of"" team-up/one-shot comics classics. Just a way to blow off some steam between the heavily-plot-constrained issues we're wading through. Gambit? Forgettable. Spidey? Fun as always. Note: this is the one time I'll say it - Loeb does a decent job with his contribution to this book. A ""versus"" cage match between two bruisers? No subtlety or intelligence required, just muscles and grand displays of strength? Pretty much a gift for Loeb's limited ""talents"". I must admit tho, the NE-page fights in issue 6 are totally worth the $3. They don't make this whole book worth it, but they're pretty enjoyable in that they don't take *any* of this shit seriously.   So does this event work? If you factor in the half-dozen crossover books and read them at the same time, this is actually a 4-star story. If you pull out just the 12-issue event plus these doofy VS scrawls, though, it's pretty much the same cobbled together, not-very-satisfying story that all recent Events from the Big Two are doing lately. This book doesn't stand on its own, and that's a deliberate choice by Marvel but ultimately makes for a bad experience as a single volume. Some folks like Sam may never bother to read the rest of the crossover books, and that's a damned shame because they're where this wooden toy becomes a real boy (Christos Gage notwithstanding)."
650.0	1.0	Meh.. The book is NOT better.
235.0	2.0	I just can't rally behind this. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but I couldn't help but feel locked out of these. It's all a matter of aesthetic differences, and I think I learned a lot from reading it, but in terms of loving a book of poems, I just can't say this was my favorite.
28.0	2.0	"Ah, another take off on ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" by Clement Moore. It always helps to be familiar with the original, before reading a spin off. However, young children will accept this story with no prior knowledge of the poem. Afterall Santa is ill, presents need to be delivered and certainly Pete the Cat can do it. I did like the subsitution of a minibus for Santa's sleigh. This Pete the Cat title doesn't contain the originality of the previous two, afterall it is constrained to a prior work. I prefer the first two titles in the series."
614.0	4.0	I want to put out the disclaimer that I am am not bashing Bella at all when it comes to my thoughts and opinions about her first novel. In fact, I applaud her since she is, or had, dyslexia and I am impressed and a little proud that she wrote and sold a novel. So, please take into account that, for everyone and anyone who likes Bella Throne, that I am not personally bashing her and this review is just my thoughts on her first novel.   Oh boy, do I have a lot to say about this book.   So, Bella Throne, a Disney Channel star, has published a novel. I will be honest, when I first heard about this I was interested. With the exception of Hilary Duff, no other Disney Channel star has published a book, and I was interested in it. I didn't have any expectations about this going into it, except for a subconscious hope it would not be a cliche/something that could easily become a Disney Channel TV show or an original movie.   Unfortunately, it was. I swear it felt so reminiscent of one (especially from like the last 4-5 years) that I won't be surprised if it will be made in a movie in the future. I will give you two reasons that made me feel it could easily be made into a Disney Channel movie.   Reason #1: The Plot/Plot Development: I mean, the synopsis says it all. Autumn, our main character, moving into a new town and is the new girl in a contemporary high school setting. With it, throw in a mix of blandish characters to be her friends, the boy everyone loves, and the popular clique, you have a recipe that can take this story places.   Reason #2: Characters: Oh my god. This was my least favorite aspect of the whole novel. In short terms, I felt like that all of the teenagers, sophomores in high school, acted like 5th graders. Here's the long version:   The clique group (the popular kids). It was, in my opinion, the biggest cliche I have ever read in my life. You have Reenzie, the leader and who tried to ruin Autumn's life completely by doing things that most people can't even comprehend if they have a conscience, but then acts sugar sweet and rainbows to get something she wants. Although, although I did like that Sean (our love interest) was part of the group but was super nice and caring.   Then we have Autumn's own group. We have Jack (who I personally didn't really care about), Amelita (I think that's her name) who was my least favorite out of them because she was super stubborn and believed that revenge is right and only really focused on revenge and it was like:   To anyone and everyone she didn't like.   And then we have J.J., who was my favorite character in the story and was very interesting. He was snarky, and he (especially when he and Autumn first meet) likes talking anagrams. And also there was an undertone of a potential love triangle that could grow in the future books in this series.   Lastly, Autumn herself. Oh dear god, Autumn reminded me of a contemporary and more stubborn version of America Singer from the Selection series. I swear, a lot of times in the book (especially in the prologue)I felt like was acting like a brat over her having to move. Not to mention that when she starts venting about her feels in the journal, she said wished for things for selfish purposes and didn't (most of the time) think about the consequences.   And she made so many decisions (and a big one during the climax) that made me want to throw my ereader to the ground at how stupid of a decision it was. Congratulations Autumn Falls, you are now number #1 on my list of most frustrating protagonists ever. Yes, she even beat America Singer.   I know what you are probably thinking: Is there anything that you really liked about this book? Well there is one thing. The writing. I mean, it isn't the best I've ever read but it isn't the worst I've read. There were sentences that I felt like could have been structured differently (and as a writer myself, I noticed that there were a lot of adverbs and I felt like this book shouldn't have had as many), but there were some that I really liked.   And another thing was that (except for the times I was most annoyed at Autumn) I liked/wanted to comment on. I didn't want to put this damn book down. However, unlike the Selection series, I will not be continuing this series at the moment I am writing it.   There is one more thing that I want to talk about before I end this review: I felt like this should have been made for a more middle-grade audience. My main reason is that I think most of Bella's fans are tween girls between the ages of 8-12, and most of those fans will want to read her book. While I do think for the most part it can be intended for that age range, there is some content (especially in one part of the book) that is for a more young-adult reader.   So, I was not a huge fan of Autumn Falls. Not just because of the plot, how I felt like this could easily become a Disney movie, and the characters, I was just not invested enough to want to read the rest of the series. The writing could be improved a little bit, but I overall thought it was good. However, it is not enough for me to raise the rating. My final rating for this book is a 1/5 stars.
469.0	2.0	This is one weird manga. I haven't read anything quite like this yet. It is about high school students, witches, illusory magic for which I don't yet see the purpose, fuzzy evil bunnies that kill, lots of fire burning fights (though I don't see that anyone was seriously injured yet they should be dead), pantie shots, and big boobs.   For some reason, this really popular high school girl who is also a witch has taken a liking to an ordinary guy. Yet it seems he's important. Not sure why yet. He doesn't yet know, either.   I think I may read the next one. These scenes of fighting the evil bunnies and their attendant witches with lots of violence and fire were just bizarre.
339.0	4.0	"This is a trimmed down version of my review, to view the full review visit The Book Ramble.   This book was provided by HarperCollins on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.   Esme is sent to her grandmother's house after she starts to cause trouble for her sister. The trouble is no one can see her, and the people she can see can't be seen by anyone else. Everyone she knows seems to be dead, and maybe Esme is dead too. Esme has to figure out how to let everyone know she's there and help the ghosts in town cross over before the man that killed them all kills her too.   I didn't really enjoy this book. I found the plot confusing and poorly explained, the tone was boring and uninteresting, and the characters were hard to connect with. It was a fairly easy read once I actually got into the book, but that took an extremely long time to do. I think this was a fun enough read but I didn't really enjoy it at all and was kind of disappointed with the ending.   The story follows Esme as she lives with ghosts in her grandmother's house. Honestly it's all a little unclear. You're never really made to understand what is going on with Esme, which has the power to speak to ghosts. Then there are several lines of action about her grandmother's career, parent's death, sister's dancing past, the ghosts' individual lives, the man who killed them all, and there's a romance plot. It's a lot and it doesn't tie together all that clearly to be honest. I think it was easy enough to follow but if you thought about it at all it stopped making much sense and got just kind of confusing. Nothing is explained, in fact the idea of ""not worrying about it"" is sort of written into the book, which just felt lazy.   I didn't really care about any of the characters particularly much. I didn't feel that things were developed well character-wise. I was never sure what age anyone was supposed to be or the type of character they were meant to be. Things just sort of swayed back and forth randomly in terms of personality. This also meant the tone was hard to follow and it just didn't connect for me. I was not a fan of the characters or story telling.   Overall, I was not a fan. It was an easy enough read but it wasn't something I would recommend to others."
627.0	3.0	"|Review in EN & FR|   Huge disappointment ! ""Fracture"", that's a good name !   I liked the first two books of the serie and maybe I have evolved as a reader but this one seemed to me flat, Allie was unbearable and the story itself was absolutely not credible. A bunch of guards that were useless, teachers disappearing several days from this luxury school, a villain whose intentions are hard to understand... I won't read the next books !   ----------------   FR   Grosse deception. ""Rupture"" le livre porte bien son nom !   J'aimais les 2 premiers tomes et peut-etre ai-je evolue en tant que lectrice mais ce tome-ci m'a paru plat, Allie est insupportable et l'histoire en elle-meme n'est absolument pas credible. Une ribambelle de vigiles qui ne servent a rien, des profs qui disparaissent plusieurs jours dans une ecole huppee, un mechant dont on comprend mal les intentions... J'arrete ici cette saga !"
805.0	5.0	I'm still finding it incredibly hard to believe that Richelle Mead wrote this book.   When this book was first announced, I was super excited about it. A Deaf community? Chinese folklore? A fantasy stand-alone by someone whose books I really enjoy? How could I not be excited?   But then the book came out and reviewers whose opinions I trust were giving it... less than favourable reviews. And still I decided to give it a shot. Because a) Richelle Mead and b) Tastes are subjective. Maybe this will be one of those books I love but they hate.   Aaaaaand this is why I gave up on blind optimism a looong time ago.   I mean, this book was so bad, that I don't think I can even give it a full review. I'm pretty sure the only reason I even finished it was because I was hoping it would get better. And even then, I skim-read after I hit 53%. That's it - hope. That was my only motivation. I wasn't even curious about the big mystery.   And on that note, here's the best review I can give you guys.   THE PREMISE:   Great on paper. Great in theory. In execution, not so much. But this is also a writing issue, so I'll get back to this.   THE PLOT:   Boring. They climbed down a mountain, discovered The Big Thing, and then climbed back up the mountain. There was also some junk about magical, flying, glittery kitties . More on this later.   THE CHARACTERS:   Again, boring. I've seen cardboard cereal boxes with more personality than these characters. Honestly, I don't even remember their names. And I remember shit, okay? That's, like, my thing. I remember stuff. And if I can't remember something as simple as the main characters' names, you know you have a problem.   THE WORLD-BUILDING:   Nonexistent. Pull up a map of the world. Close your eyes. Point to some random place on the map. Even if you point to a spot somewhere in the middle of the pacific ocean, it could still be the setting for this story. There was nothing remotely Chinese about this place, or the people in it. There was nothing Chinese about the culture. At one point the MC even walked around the school while sipping a cup of tea, and it seemed so... rude. Like, I've never seen anyone do that. And the only reason I even remember this was because I texted a friend to ask if I was crazy for finding that weird.   THE WRITING:   Flat. Boring. Monotonous. Tell-not-show. Boring. Dry. Boring. Did I say boring? When you write a book about Deaf people, you have the opportunity to go crazy with the other senses. Mead did none of that. Everything, from the MC's thoughts, to the movements and actions of the people around her, was so lifeless and robotic. There was almost no use of scent, and she barely scratched the surface with sight. I am not joking when I tell you that I can't believe Richelle Mead wrote this. I've seen 14 year old fanfic writers who've written more compelling, believable stories than this.   THE FANTASY:   Ridiculous. I mean, can you even call this fantasy? The whole thing with whats-her-face regaining her hearing was weak. There was just one or two breadcrumbs leading up the big reveal at the end. The entire fantasy element (the giant, glittery, flying kitty cats) was so random and dumb, it felt like it had just been tacked on to the end of the book at the last minute because the author couldn't think of anything else.   Bottom line? This book was an utter disappointment and a bloody waste of my time. I would not recommend it to anyone. If I could go back in time and stop myself from reading it, I would. Save myself from feeling as upset as I am right now.   Richelle Mead. What happened?
638.0	3.0	"2.5 stars   ""Hey remember when we told that Regent story in Secret Wars: Renew Your Vows last year? Well we're telling it again, except making it canon this time. That makes it an original and interesting story right?""   Like the majority of Marvel stuff post Secret Wars there are great moments in this book, but the overall story is a miss and in this case (as with the current Civil War II event) it's quite derivative. At least they waited a decade to revisit Civil War."
553.0	3.0	This is a four or five-star concept with a two-star execution. I expected the novel to be an exploration of the immediate aftermath of the disease that causes Lock In, a total body freeze with complete mental clarity. What a terrifying and interesting concept. Instead, this is a mediocre crime novel set decades after the outbreak. While I suppose the allusions to modern civil rights and corruption are interesting in their own right, neither develops deeply enough to truly get the reader invested. The writing (like the crime story) was basic, at best.   I typically enjoy dystopian novels, but the spoon-fed style and superficial plot put this one really low on my list. Maybe I'd feel differently if the intro novella was printed first (rather than following the text of the novel) -- poor decision on publishers' choice.
551.0	1.0	Really wanted to like this book, this sounded like a children's book I'd enjoy. Unfortunately it wasn't for me, I ended up quitting 1/4 of the way through.
1.0	1.0	Cute book about bedtime good for older readers--late preK and school age.
354.0	1.0	I put this down about 30 pages in and have no desire to pick it up again. I think this was more aimed at a younger audience, which is why I didn't get on with it.
896.0	1.0	Oh, yes, you see, I didn't even put it into the 'poetry' shelf.
365.0	1.0	SO CHEESY AAAAH PLEASE SAVE ME I WAS CRINGING THE WHOLE WAY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. :(
496.0	4.0	"FTC Disclosure: I received an Advanced Reader's Copy of this book from the Amazon Vine Program in exchange for an honest review.   The Wild Book by Margarita Engle   Summary: Fefa struggles with words. She has word blindness, or dyslexia, and the doctor says she will never read or write. Every time she tries, the letters jumble and spill off the page, leaping and hopping away like bullfrogs. How will she ever understand them? But her mother has an idea. She gives Fefa a blank book filled with clean white pages. ""Think of it as a garden,"" she says. Soon Fefa starts to sprinkle words across the pages of her wild book. She lets her words sprout like seedlings, shaky at first, then growing stronger and surer with each new day. And when her family is threatened, it is what Fefa has learned from her wild book that saves them.   When I first read the description of this book I was eager to read it. Recently, my school has put into place to programs to help dyslexic students. I was hoping this would be a great resource for those students. Sadly, I was disappointed.   The story is about an 11 year old girl with ""word blindness"" who receives a book with white pages to write her thoughts as a way to work her way through the challenges of being dyslexic. A great idea, but it doesn't live up to it's potential.   I'm not sure who the target audience is. Is it students who face these challenges. Is it parents or educators who work with dyslexic students? Amazon recommends the book for ages 10 and up, but based on my experience with my students, I believe it would be not only a difficult read, but one that would not appeal to very many of them. Older students and adults will be more suited to appreciating the beautiful word play and verse format.   This is not a book, I will be purchasing for this for my school library."
423.0	4.0	Okay, maybe two stars is a little harsh. Goodreads says two stars means 'it was okay' and I thought this was pretty so-so, but I didn't hate it. But then again if I paid 50 dollars for this book, I have the right to be harsh. I honestly think that is an absurd price. I understand it's large and whatnot, but 50 dollars for book that I read in maybe an hour? Feels kind of ridiculous.   Blankets is a very, very large graphic novel memoir. I was unaware going into this that this was a memoir, and I don't think I would have picked this up knowing that. There really isn't much of a plot at all, just a story about life and growing up.   I had no idea this book was so heavily focused on religion either. When I say heavily, I mean every other page there was something religious. While that's fine if you want to read about that it honestly brought my level of enjoyment down, though I will say it definitely made me think quite a bit on the matter.   I don't understand why there are always inappropriate images in every graphic novel I pick up. Maybe I'm a wimp, but I really don't wanna see that stuff (I'm talking nudity by the way). It's just unnecessary in my opinion.   I wasn't a fan of the characters at all. Yes, I know they were real people, but in general they just kind of annoyed me. I didn't like the romance, and thought the book was at it's best when focusing on the relationship between the brothers. Neither of those subjects had any sort of resolution in the end.   All in all I think there are way better graphic novels out there. Recommended for fans of memoirs, but I honestly wouldn't say this is worth the price. The artwork is quite pretty, but the story isn't strong enough on its own.
516.0	2.0	Blah.   After enjoying two of his earlier books, this one really missed the mark with me. Very meta-the narrator is a poet trying to write an introduction to a book of poetry-and probably much better for readers who care a lot about poetry.
856.0	1.0	Very strange. It might be different for those who grew up with these stories but to me it simply was too much nonesense (as I should have expected!)
567.0	1.0	There were a few poems in here that I really liked, but some others were so full of nonsense that I can't give the overall book a better rating.
583.0	2.0	Not much to say about this really. Had all of these books as a kid and read them over and over. Don't get the same enjoyment from it now. Simple messege but the pictures were nice. Not sure why there is a dragon. I know that new characters have to be added to expand The Little Mermaid World, like Sandy. She makes sense. But a dragon!? Say what!
373.0	1.0	Horrible. Never want to read again
492.0	2.0	"I love how the author said ""Poetry is anything you want it to be"" because I feel that this is one of those occasions that anything was thrown into this and was called poetry.   Being that I'm incredibly too new to poetry to see all the deeper meanings behind every poem, and maybe I read it too fast to allow myself to completely digest things, but... why is this poetry? I'll continue to make efforts to read poetry because I do find it interesting."
57.0	2.0	Poems take the form of the background and tell pieces of a story about a dog and a cat who don't get along but are forced to hide out under a picnic table during a rainstorm. For example, the clouds are formed from bubbly white words that describe that they are building and getting ready to make a storm.
436.0	4.0	"I started on this series when I came across quite a number of fair reviews on it.   The novels revolve around the lives of 4 girls of Rosewood Day School -- Spencer, Hanna, Aria, and Emily. They were almost nonentities in their school till Alison chose them to be a part of her posse. Together they became the most enviable group and suddenly the girls found themselves to be the center of attraction at Rosewood. Then, Allison went missing and the girls fell apart even though they were bound by a few secrets.   Alison is continuously described as the most popular girl at Rosewood Day school. She chose the other girls to be a part of her posse and thus giving them whole new identities. However, as the story progresses, we find that she was not very kind to her friends and often held their secrets on their heads. She emerges as this popular, unkind and manipulative girl with a hell lot of secrets of her own.   Aria is again maybe the most confused girl in the series. She is someone who wants to stand out and always feels misunderstood. She is connected with a lot of guys, including a teacher, her friend's ex and even her mother's boyfriend.   Hanna starts out as a chubby girl who wanted to be like Alison. Her fixation with becoming the ""It"" girl, leads her to developing Bulimia. She is prepared to give everything else up for becoming someone like Alison. So much so that even though she starts of as the girl obsessed with winning the love of her childhood crush, yet over the time she even gives up true love for her fixation of becoming the ""it"" girl.   Spencer is supposed to be a very talented academic, yet someone never seen to sit down with a book. Instead she cheats and lies her way through. She is very competitive with her elder sister Mellissa, another excellent academic person, but is shown to take it out only by going out with elder sister's boyfriends. Later on she has problems with her identity crisis.   Emily is obsessed with Alison. As a person who is confused about her own sexuality, Emily is in love with Alison. She then proceeds to date both girls and boys in an attempt to understand herself.   To be frank, after reading the first three books, I wanted to dump the series. But I do not like leave things unfinished and so I toiled through the rest of the books. I was amazed to see how the central characters always focused on only boys and fashion while there were surrounded by murders, suicide and threats at any point of time. I could not relate to even one character in the book, whether it be a boy or a girl or even an animal!!! The girls were more concerned about what brand handbag was in fashion rather than the murders of their friends. While murder investigation was on or someone was on trial, all they could think of was who they could hook up with. And, then there are the parent-children relationships that were so appalling that made me wonder if my parents are abnormal!   The only positive thing about this series is that the title is appropriate for it as the characters are pro at 'lying, cheating and stealing'. I would not recommend anyone to read this series, unless they are interested in making a list of branded products or ways of committing infidelity & adultery."
210.0	3.0	"This book lost me at the beginning of chapter 3 where the lifeguard ""was helping somebody with her beach balls."" The illustration shows a woman holding two inflated beach balls in front of her breasts in a way that can't be interpreted as anything other than suggestive. This is a book for six-year-olds, so I'm not sure how that image got past an editor, and I could never feel comfortable handing it to a child knowing how it is likely to be interpreted by the parents. The rest of the story is just okay, with a weird digression into a pirate adventure in the last quarter of the book."
574.0	3.0	"Tandy and Tyrone have always had a...complicated relationship. It's not quite ""Ultimate Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver"" complicated, but there's some co-dependence and sexual tension there that the ""opposites attract"" theme just can't help but suggest. Plus the whole ""I'll feed you my light, that will take your pain away"" thing.   This one-shot was a little too squicky and angsty for my tastes. These two could be low A-list if they were taken more seriously, or given a better mission than ""saving kids from drugs"" (which is a byproduct of them being created in the 80's when Marvel took money from Nancy Reagan or the shadowy propaganda machine behind the 'war' on drugs).   Not to mention completely pointless - why tease us with any glimpse of T+T if it's going nowhere? It'd be like giving us an episode of Batroc the Leaper on vacation in Hawaii - who cares?"
796.0	1.0	Picture book -- Great repetition (guided reading maybe?) but not great for everyday read
531.0	2.0	I think a lot of people are pretty harsh on this book. So okay it's pretty damn cheesy, and okay it's not exactly thrilling, engaging literature, and yeah, okay I've read a lot of young adult novels and this one is pretty average at best.   But it honestly wasn't that bad. The characters were cute in an excited puppy dog kind of way, the storylines pretty far fetched but it's fast paced enough never to be that bad and it was overall kind of refreshing to read.   Some moments I wanted to put it down based on the cringe factor alone and it took me a while to get the motivation to pick it up again because although Penny and Eliot are cute they're a bit annoying. I would have probably enjoyed this book when I was 12, and not 23, although I doubt I'm it's target audience.   Either way Zoella brings an important message to the book if you can get through, which is don't be a dick online.
132.0	4.0	T H O U G H T S:   this is the story of extreme manipulation, brain-washing, and human trafficking. this is the story of naivety and misplaced trust and willful ignorance. but, alternating between past and present timelines, it unravels at a frustratingly slow pace, dragging along into a lull. is the pace meant to illustrate the gravity of mental manipulation? of how hard it is to change beliefs ingrained to you? perhaps. the ideas, after all, that the narrative means to explore are horrifying and haunting and profound. but the execution of the premise doesn't compel or capture the reader in the same way its philosophical implications do. in the end, the writing is simplistic and the plot is implausible and the protagonist's naive disregard for the truth is exasperating. i couldn't stand the lack of awareness (and that doesn't equal tension or suspense). i wanted to throw the book across the room. a brilliant premise, but a fail in execution.   R A T I N G:   plot // 2   pacing // 1   language // 1   story world // 1   protagonist // 1   antagonist // 2   secondary characters // 2   1.5 stars

524.0	1.0	Predictable. I couldn't get used to the teen speak throughout and I thought the characters were flat. Kudos for a T.S. Eliot reference, but that's it.
758.0	3.0	The format - alternating between graphic novel and print was awesome and something I had never seen before. The story was a little confusing and there wasn't much depth to it.
802.0	2.0	The collection includes poems for _A Ghost Is Born_. I love Tweedy, but c'mon!
392.0	1.0	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I should have left Jessica and Elizabeth where they were in my mind back in Sweet Valley High.
5.0	1.0	I really wanted to like this book. I read about 3 chapters and couldn't go anymore. One day I might try it again I guess.
746.0	3.0	"Barbarian wrestler monsters tearing eachother apart in a penal colony, without any hang-ups over actual storytelling, characters, anything beyond senseless action. Which has a certain kind of arguable awesomeness I guess, like Fantagraphics went and published a bunch of violent classroom doodles from some bored middle school punk (not for nothing Johnny Ryan apparently made his name in ""Angry Youth Comics""). I dunno though, it gets kind of monotonous, especially in volume two. Like, I'd probably get more into a chapter of the protagonist just wandering around aimlessly as a break from the decapitations and whatever. Not really something I would put any work into reading, but I didn't have to: one of my roommates left this and the second part in the living room and they only took about 10 minutes to read."
623.0	3.0	This book, with illustrations, is geared towards older grade schoolers. It's easy to read and follow, and well-organized. However, I did catch one factual error; it states that all 52 children who perished were third class. Actually, one first class child, Helen Loraine Allison, 2, died. Also, I've seen different numbers of children from different sources. The book also states that Ismay went on a lifeboat because there were plenty of seats and no one else was getting in. From what I understand, the general consensus now is that he was ordered onto one of the lifeboats. I do like how snippets are given of some of the passengers and crew.
854.0	2.0	"Wow...this one is ...well, I don't quite have the words but I bet OKD would. Verbal acrobatics accurately describes this collection, but those gymnastics got in the way of my ability to connect with these poems. I really wanted to like this, but I abandoned it as each poem started feeling more and more like a struggle to get through and to understand than the one before. Liked ""And Her Soul Out of Nothing"" much better."
675.0	3.0	"A new bride is haunted by the presence of her husband's deceased wife, but not in the way you're thinking.   __________SPOILERS AHOY AHOY____________________   I'll tell you my confession straight up. For the first half of the book, I only read the dialogue. Correction: I only read the dialogue that actually occurred. The unnamed narrator of this book had a penchant for imagining long imaginary conversations that tended to wallow in the events of the story. You'd be surprised how much dialogue I skipped. A little bit of the reason I skipped a lot of the first half is because I was in a time crunch, but mostly it was because it was a lot of flowery description of the house and how naive the narrator started out being. I swear half of the words I skipped were ""Manderley,"" the name of the estate; ""Rebecca,"" for obvious reasons; and ""Yes,"" because that is the only word the narrator would utter in most situations.   But I have to tell you when this story gets going it's way more complicated than it seems. There are some major twists that completely qualified this novel as a classic for me. We're talking early 20th century Gone Girl type crazy-ass shit. Rebecca was one horrible creature. After her reveal as the devil incarnate, I enjoyed thinking back through all of the narrator's misunderstandings about her: her employer's warnings, her presumed assumption of Maxim's obsession of his first wife, her insecurity of not living up to Rebecca's reputation.   The masquerade scene is fantastic in misdirecting the reader. I loved analyzing Maxim's reaction to her appearance in Rebecca's costume. So many exquisite misunderstandings happening in one moment.   The narrator's click after Maxim tells her of the murder was really well done, too. How the knowledge empowers the narrator to take control, how she grows into her role in a second. I thought that part of her character was interesting. Although all the stuff she does to placate her murderer husband is rather alarming to read in today's age. Also, the fact that townspeople are willing to cover up what Maxim did is aggravating. Supposedly no one knew how terrible a person Rebecca was, yet the police are willing to cover up the murder for the rich dude. Grrr.   Two stars for the masquerade scene and the twist. Three stars missing for the first half of the book being absolutely inconsequential. If I had been the editor on this book, I would have cut up to the masquerade.   Book group is tonight. I'll add more soon.   ______________   The first thing said about this book when we met was that the author was obviously a ""repressed lesbian."" Most of the group found the first half of the book really boring- ""This is the book where nothing happens."" I brought up the point that this kind of suspense was new at the time - this was the Gone Girl of its day. So many young women at the time probably got a swift blow of reality from the plot of this book. Daphne du Maurier was pretty much saying ""You know that elysian marriage you think is awaiting you? Yeah, well, this is what could happen to you so be careful.""   Our actor mentioned that plays written at the same time as this novel were incredibly detailed, then had detail, then more detail. This novel was probably following that fad. Other authors writing at the time were really into the personification of nature, which is probably the first third of the book. Those techniques probably appealed to the masses at the time.   Many of us were preparing for Manderley to be haunted. We were all happy about where the novel ended with the couple rushing to their burning house. We laughed at the realization that Jasper the dog's mom was Mrs. Danvers in canine form. For as much as we hated the beginning, we listed several characters that we loved, Sister Bea being the one mentioned most.   We talked a lot about the fact that the narrator was never given a name or ever described, but we knew everything about Rebecca. Perhaps the author intended the narrator to be a blank slate so that the reader could more easily put themselves in her shoes.   2 stars: one for the twist- getting through all that stuff about azaleas really does pay off eventually and one for characterization."
275.0	2.0	"Just to let you know - I would give ""Distric & Circle"" a 4 stars. Very disappointed."
937.0	3.0	Made it through the series and what can I say? Wish I'd stopped at The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe or Prince Caspian, books I actually enjoyed. The series loses charm with each successive chapter, and this last volume continued the decline. There are annoyances at almost every turn: racism (the dwarfs frequently call the Calomen 'darkies') and sexism (Susan isn't in Narnia because she's interested in makeup) etc.   As Christian allegory, I suppose it works, but as a story it is thin, and as a conclusion to a series it lacks the punch of any number of books.
361.0	2.0	Eh... Meh and a half stars I guess. The Dinobots and Headmasters stories were terribly boring and uninspired. The first few spotlights also less than inspiring.   The Drift miniseries (and spotlight) and Jazz spotlights were the only redeeming qualities of this one... saved it from being a 1-star I suppose.
591.0	3.0	I have no idea what Lowry was trying to convey with this but what I got from it was 'Utopia does not exist' (No shit?) and 'The people who lead you are evil.' It's pretty much every conspirators theory on how the world will become if the government continues on.I read this once when I was in 4th or 5th grade. I liked it at the time but I didn't really 'get it.' I thought 'what was the point of this?' Yeah, I liked it anyways, leave it.   I reread it and thought'Okay, good fine, burn the book.' The beginning was alright, I was interested. I like things about politics and the whole 'we takez ovur ur mind' and even still by the end, I was thinking 'okay. Point?'   As for writing, it didn't stick out to me. A friend told me she used a lot of symbolism but oh well, didn't catch it in my second reading, not rereading this. I would say this is for very little children - just water it down. Or tell them 'nuffin' is purrfex' and spare them.
352.0	3.0	"I've only read the first book of this series, but it was pretty darn terrible. Basically, the story is about a boy who secretly loves ""feminine"" things, but feels he has to hide that side of himself and instead be overly masculine. Inexplicably, his friend is a secret manga artist drawing a manga based on the main character.   I'm all about breaking gender roles and stereotypes, trust me, but this just felt like it actually *enforced* those stereotypes more than anything. It still felt very binary and only marginally progressive, in spite of the opportunity for this to be so much more.   Not to mention, the characters are all fairly one-note, and remained undeveloped through the entire book. I realize it's only the first book of many, but there was still plenty of story and time to make the characters more three-dimensional and less shallow.   I don't believe I will continue on with this series."
526.0	2.0	Eh. This just didn't feel right. Good art, good one liners, but the team felt poorly written, it almost felt like a parody. We have a team of heroes who have been doing this for a while, some of whom have been Avengers and they come in tripping over their own feet, like new recruits. They are almost owned by a bunch of super annoying villains that despite not having reason to be a well trained team, work together way better than the champions. But the monsters show up in the end and it's better from then on.
414.0	2.0	This book explores the idea that having students depend on leveled books can be detrimental to their journey to becoming an independent reader. It contains lesson ideas for literacy as well as ideas to how teachers can structure their reading libraries.
237.0	2.0	I really liked the Green Hornet in the main Legenderry crossover series, but this solo outing just didn't do it for me. The characters were boring and had no depth whatsoever, although I did like the design of the Brass Hornet character.
892.0	4.0	"Not at all my favorite Shakespeare; in fact, I think it managed to sink to the very bottom. The plot itself, centered around two sets of identical twins (each set having the same name - go figure!) and an escalating case of mistaken identities, is naturally far-fetched. You come to expect that with a Shakespearean comedy, but in this case the coincidences, however necessary for the sake of the story, never struck me as particularly amusing. The characters, too, grated on me: Antipholus of Ephesus was a horrible individual, made worse by the fact that no one in the actual play acknowledges it.   As far as style goes, again, I don't think Shakespeare was in his rarest form. The puns felt stilted, characters' lines carefully arranged so that another actor could deliver a witty retort; there was no subtlety to the dialogue, just bold-faced ""humor."" And I'm afraid the frequency of rhyming couplets really did make me groan. Of course, in Shakespeare's defense, this was an early work - and it still manages to make people laugh. I just happen to think that as far as a comedy of mistaken identity goes, he did a much wittier job in ""Twelfth Night."""
552.0	1.0	Used as a placeholder for a periodical since Goodreads doesn't allow for them
204.0	3.0	this is quite a pretty book - nice cover, even nicer illustrations, some lovely lines. and that's it. splitting the book into themes was a bad idea, because that highlighted just how repetitive the poetry was. gill would take a concept and write about it in fifteen different ways, one after the other, with very little variation. and half the poems were just... nothing. not meaningful or new in any way, and not even well-written
789.0	1.0	It had a lot of potential, but (as usual) was poorly executed.
12.0	5.0	"Spell Robbers is a fast paced action novel aimed at kids around 8-12 (or grades 3-7). In the novel the young Ben Warner gets invited to join an after school ""science club"" where he learns how to manipulate reality on a quantum level. While grounded in science, the title gives a nob to the tried (and some might say tired) adage from Arthur C. Clarke that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Overall, Kirby has penned an entertaining novel that sure to fire the imagination of children. However, Spell Robbers never really rises above the level of cool and exciting, despite the many chances it has to do so. Children's literature, when it's at its best, has a sort of universal appeal. As an adult I am delighted by the worlds of characters like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter. There is a level of detail there that helps the fiction really stand out. It is a level detail that Spell Robbers never quite seems to rise to; though I think it could.As an action/adventure novel Spell Robbers is absolutely top-notch, but I think it definitely could have been more.   Over the course of the novel the scientist, Dr. Hughes, who teaches Ben and the other students is kidnapped by men who seemingly wield abilities similar to Ben's. After this attack Ben, along with his friend Peter, wakes up to find himself conscripted into the titular Quantum League. Unfortunately, in order for this to occur Ben has been excised from the life of his single mother; she no longer remembers who he is or even that she had a son. This organization then goes on to manipulate Ben's feelings for his mother, using them into maneuvering Ben to help recover Dr. Hughes. To Kirby's credit he definitely goes out of his way to demonstrate that the Quantum League is not to be trusted. However, no one except for Ben seemingly has any issue with them forcibly kidnapping children and conscripting them into what is essentially a paramilitary organization. If the books focus had been more squarely focused on Ben's struggle against the Quantum League I think things would have worked a whole lot better. Kirby, has set up a very fascinating premise that touches on some key emotional points (namely the bond between child and parent) that are ripe for exploration. Unfortunately, the novel's focus on action over substance gets in the way. The motivations and methods of the Quantum League are secondary to the action, despite the fact they are the most interesting aspect of the novel.   Kirby, misses several other aspects that could have been more adequately developed. It is strongly hinted at that Ben's mother suffers from a mental illness of some kind. She and Ben have moved from place to place quite a bit, there is a moment when Ben reminds her to take her medication, and the fact that Ben seemingly has to take on some parental tasks (making dinner, etc.) but isn't talked about directly Kirby hints at the deep relationship between Ben and his mother but doesn't quite linger enough to let the reader into that relationship. The introduction of Peter as a foil to Ben is also interesting, but seems only to serve to emphasize Ben's connection with his mother. At one point Peter reveals to Ben that his father only seems to care about his intellectual capability and as a result Peter's relationship with his family is almost the exact opposite of Ben and his mother. Where Ben finds his ability to manipulate things on a quantum level come to him almost naturally, Peter has to scrape and struggle to do what Ben does with ease. Peter and Ben are too perfectly opposite. As a result Peter never really feels like a complete character.   While I was hoping for a science fiction tale for kids with the breadth and detail seen in the best of children's literature what I read felt like a book of missed opportunities. While certainly exciting Spell Robbers never rises beyond its premise and ends up feeling underdeveloped. Kirby has in place a number of elements that could make for a truly great story but seems a bit gun-shy in delving into them headlong. The finale of the novel leaves some hope for future volumes however, and I'll definitely be willing to see where the next book goes."
232.0	3.0	"This simple story of a father who plays with his baby has strong rhythm. For young readers, it would be a fun interactive read. The author writes the story in a dialect--possibly Caribbean or West African--where the word ""my"" is replaced with ""me."" It provides a different voice to a familiar story. The illustrations are simple with cartoon-type, dark skinned people and bright background colors."
514.0	3.0	UGH. I read this to my 6 year old, and for him, it was mostly all right. If I consider it a work of fiction, it's pretty good, though awkwardly and uncomfortably unwoke for a book very heavily trying to play up her solidarity with POC. I like him being able to see a strong woman who is fighting against constant gender discrimination, and to learn a bit about how politics work, so for that I give it an extra star.   But as the grown-up reading it, it was kind of painful. I've never read anything more heavily, suffocatingly propaganda-ey before, and so much of it is just... straight up problematic and/or seems like it's taking creative liberties with the truth.   I really like the illustrations, and it succeeds in making a 6 year old (and their parents if they aren't particularly politically aware) think she's a super awesome great unproblematic fighter-for-justice, which is a great thing to have kids look up to-- but ughhhhh. So biased. So problematic in parts. Sigh.
172.0	3.0	"I'll start out by saying that I absolutely loathe The Giving Tree. I think it sends a terrible message to kids about using people (or trees), and codependency. Yes, I might be reading too much into it, but there you go! I don't know if this predisposed me somewhat to disliking this, or if it's just that I wasn't exposed to it as a child, but this was just ok for me. There were some snippets that I absolutely loved:   ""But all the magic I have known,   I've had to make myself""   ""He wasted his wishes on wishing""   And the one I loved the most, was the parody of The Little Engine That Could:   ""If the track is tough and the hill is rough,   THINKING you can just ain't enough!""   I absolutely love that this doesn't coddle kids and tell them that if they wish on a star, believe they can, (insert The Alchemist-esque bullshit here) that they can do anything. Because they can't. Thinking you can does not actually equal being able to. I'm all for encouragement, but kids also need a dose of reality.   But still, on the whole, this was just ok. I don't think I'll be reading any more Silverstein books. He's just not for me."
174.0	2.0	Possibly, it's because I grew up with a love of Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka and just loved that movie, but I didn't enjoy the book. It just wasn't as full as the movie. Maybe I'm just too old, now, for the style the book is written in. My kids loved it, though, and I'm good with that.
662.0	2.0	"On ""if you don't have something nice to say..."" rules, um, the paper quality is pretty fantastic...   Aside from that: who in their right mind appoints Terry Moore to write a superhero/action book? Isn't that like asking Rob Liefeld to write a sensitive, feminist coming-out story?"
403.0	4.0	"** spoiler alert **   I will preface this by saying this is not a genre or type of book (coming of age, teeangers, blah blah blah) I would normally purposefully read, but I like John Green and the Vlogbrothers channel and this book was recommended by a friend. I thought it was OK.   It was well written for the most part. I did find it interesting that it is basically a story about the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope:   ""The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is there to give new meaning to the male hero's life. She's stunningly attractive, high on life, full of wacky quirks and idiosyncrasies (generally including childlike playfulness and a tendency towards petty crime), often with a touch of wild hair dye. She's inexplicably obsessed with our stuffed-shirt hero, on whom she will focus her kuh-razy antics until he learns to live freely and love madly.""   Margo is the manic pixie dream girl of the story (MPDG), and the final climactic argument is that he has been treating her as the MPDG and that is shallow and terrible and in treating her that way he didn't really know who she was. That being said, in an ironic twist... she was STILL a MPDG for Q outside of the context of that revelation.   My two big complaints about the book are that:   1. Margo is a terrible person. I really dislike her. She is selfish and dramatic and I have no empathy for the character and I am confused. Am I supposed to like her? Is she supposed to be compelling? Even in the first part of the book, she is a selfish twat while talking to Q during their adventure and he is only angry for a moment. It's very hard to want to read this book when Margo is so incredibly terrible. I was hoping against hope that the end of the book would be Q coming across Margo in her dramatic little writing hovel, and realizing that the MPDG trope is shit, and that Margo is shit, and that the real event that was his ""coming of age"" was his final weeks of adventure with his real high school friends. But that didn't happen.   And 2, not only did the end of the plot kinda ruin the book for me, I feel it was well written until the last few pages where it got bogged down in metaphors and bullshit and was really hard to read. Like, a four page ending of metaphors about strings and roots and burying the past? Really? It was forced and over wrought and seemed very amateur in contrast with the rest of the book."
592.0	2.0	"I think I'd rather read the book, to be honest, as I was tempted to read the dialogue and flip through. I felt I was missing a lot of the build up to the lessons, and therefore the ""moral of the story"" jumps out without a lot of depth or substance.   Nice illustrations, though, and a very pretty book. Was worth a flip through to get the gist what the book itself was about."
607.0	3.0	I really love Gaiman. Sandman is my favorite ongoing series ever, and I've enjoyed a good deal of his prose as well (although to a lesser extent).   but jeez, he really seems to phone it in with his marvel work. he's still a good writer, so it's still fine, but i get the sense that he wasn't really inspired for this.   eternals didn't really do it for me. romita jr's art is really good as usual, and if there was any success out of this series for me, it's that it made me want to check out Kirby's Eternals.   two stars may be a bit harsh, and I could see myself giving it three stars if it were written by someone whom i didn't have such high expectations for, but that's just the way it goes. i read this as issues, month to month (with some delays if i recall), and since it's been awhile I should probably read it all at once. it's very possible it reads much better as a trade, as is often the case with comics and especially mini-series.
629.0	4.0	I feel terrible for not writing a review about this book when it was fresh in my mind because I've forgotten a lot of the funny stuff about it. I read a particularly hilarious review on this book in which it was stated that it was the best $10 spent ironically. I love to read bad YA but I think that may have set up my expectations a little too high because this book was just...not as entertaining as I thought it would be.   So we're in a future where the USA is no more. Now there's a monarchy where princes marry common girls (so who marries the princesses?) in The Bachelor-type contest. There's a class system in which your number corresponds to what you do in society. There's not much movement between classes. Our heroine is America Singer, who is in (you guessed it!) the arts and entertainment class. Right off the bat, this system doesn't make any sense. So a person is in a class that their ancestor was put because of their particular skill. I just imagine future artists drawing stick figures or having terrible singing voices because they are pigeonholed into a particular skill set of their caste. It is implied that artists don't make much and the Singer family doesn't have enough food but the kids all have their own bedrooms and a backyard with a treehouse in the suburbs? Sixes work in hospitality but Aspen's sisters were in the drama club at school...why? Schools had intermingling when it would make more sense for each caste to have their own trade school. It seems like the world building-my favorite aspect of these types of books-was neglected.   Now this book obviously is riding on the coattails of the Hunger Games. Instead of districts, there are castes but people still have weirdo names and there's not enough resources. However, the grit of HG is missing from this book. Everything felt too safe and cushy. It's like the Hunger Games if it just focused on the love triangle. Which there shouldn't have been in the first place. If you're planning on being in the competition for only a few weeks, please don't immediately commit treason by cheating on the prince. Keep it in your pants, you silly teenagers.   This story is aggravating because the most interesting parts of it (the history and society) are downplayed for a lukewarm romance that I'm just not feeling. I'm hoping that the plot thickens in the next few books because it's thinner than Kriss in this one.
868.0	3.0	Ok, let's be honest. The only reason I read this book was because of the show, which is why the majority of people bother with it. I abhor James Patterson, but this book makes Patterson look like Dickens. It reads like an hour-long television show. It was extremely short with little development for characters, the scenes or the overall plot. It was probably written in a day. The only reason it gets two stars from me is because, like I said, I like the show. God knows I'm all about the gimmicks. And now I feel cheap and used. :(
720.0	2.0	"This was an enjoyable enough read, although it felt a little contrived. It was a really quick read - I breezed through it in a couple of hours. It captures the angsty-teenage angle and the heartbreak of first ""love"" fairly well, but I wasn't blown away by it."
315.0	5.0	This novel gets two stars because, from a sheer technical standpoint, Tabitha King can write.   Unfortunately, no matter how well things are described, no matter the actual quality of the writing, it doesn't make up for a meandering, slow story that, for pages and pages and pages, simply goes nowhere. And from a plotting and pacing standpoint, King made some very odd choices.   Why not have someone wake up in the White House, and slowly, to their horror, realize they're not in the real one, but a small-scaled model? Then the story can go back and dig into how they got their. Instant mystery, instant intrigue.   Instead, King goes for a good opening fraction of the book before any of this stuff comes up. And when it does, I'm sorry, but I simply could not get past the absolute unbelievability of this device that shrinks things down. I mean, for all intents and purposes, it's a damn camera. But it knows exactly what you want shrunk and it shrinks only that? And it just happens to shrink things to the specific size of an already-built scale model of the White House? Like, bang on?   And King seemed to not be able to decide on the exact size of her shrunken characters. Could they fit into a match box? Or were they inches tall? It seemed rather fluid through the novel.   But overall, the greatest sin of this novel? Aside from a fun little nod to hubby's The Shining, this book was quite boring. Which is why it took me damn near two weeks to read a 329-page novel, the last third of that in one sitting today just to clear it from my task list. Because, by this point, it was a task.
44.0	2.0	Not crazy about it. The two main characters are both psychos
480.0	2.0	When you set out to write an origin of a Superhero story - you take on a GREAT responsibility of explaining the origin of much more than just the superpower / strength but where did that motive / that spirit / that personality came from ?   Paul Jenkins gets it very rarely in this story. This is clearly not his best work - not is this one of the best Wolverine's I have read.   Not recommended.
30.0	3.0	Definitely in the minority here, once again, but---   I am just NOT into this one at ALL. It basically feels like a 50 page advertisement for the X-Files so far, and I've seen the show, so I am BORED OUT OF MY MIND! It feels way too explainy, you know? The characters just feel like big long lists of things they like, and I can't seem to bring myself to actually care about either of them because, I think, all the damned pop culture references are getting in the way. It's one thing to say two characters got to be friends because they both enjoy x, y, and z, but it's another thing entirely to have to listen to their conversations and monologues about those things when you just want them to GET TO THE ACTUAL STORY ALREADY!!! Both characters can so far pretty much be summed up as: X-Files word vomit. Call me crazy, but it's just not enough for me.   Anyway, maybe it improves later on, but I have too many other books sitting around on my to-read shelf to force myself further through it.
750.0	5.0	"This review and more can be found on my blog, The Library Canary.   ***I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This has in no way changed my opinion of the book. The review below is my open and honest opinion.***   There are some pretty terrible reviews for this book on Goodreads which I noticed, but didn't really read before I started it. I requested it because it sounded different. A crazy cult? Definitely unique. And I do enjoy a good thriller so I thought I would give it a try. I should have listened to all those negative reviews. I honestly don't even know why I finished this book. I guess mostly because I wanted to see the cult and by the time I actually got to that part I was over halfway so I thought I would just finish it. But I should have DNFed it.   The first problem this book had was a major case of instalove. Oh my gosh, this is probably one of the worst cases I've ever seen. Because it wasn't just ""I love you."" It was more like ""I would die for you. I am nothing without you. I can't remember my life before you."" *throws up everywhere* Seriously??? You've known each other five minutes. Maybe calm down.   The characters were also pretty terrible. Both Scarlett and Noah were dull and lifeless. I didn't connect to either of them. Scarlett was whiny, clingy and she could be kind of a bitch. Noah was just plain boring. I couldn't find one interesting thing about him. He just seemed to bounce around the book, doing his thing, professing his love for Scarlett and I didn't care about him at all.   Because this book alternated POVs, the twist was revealed to the reader early on. I say poor choice by the author. I think this book could have been much more effective had it been told just from one of the characters' POVs. There would have been more twists and surprises and it would have made the book more enjoyable.   The cult wasn't even that interesting. They were just creepy and everything was kind of anticlimactic after we finally got to see the cult. I think it was supposed to be high suspense towards the end, but I just really didn't care at that point so I didn't feel it. I was basically just skimming and trying to get through the rest of it. I've read lots of books with bad reviews on Goodreads and ended up liking them. But this is one that you should probably listen to the bad reviews on."
501.0	1.0	I thought this sounded interesting. While I don't mind some language, after 8 f-words in the first page and a half, I thought 'Maybe this isn't for me.' So I'll never know now.
379.0	1.0	Acts of violence piled so high on top of one another that the whole plot collapsed into a messy heap. The narrative and characterisation was about as credible as a six dollar note. Thank heavens I only borrowed this.
905.0	3.0	Not my favorite. I'm not a fan of unreliable narrators in the first place, and really not a fan when the characters are poorly drawn one note characters. Too many stereotypes -- the detective could have been Columbo, the kidnapper was a misunderstood boy from the wrong side of the tracks, mother was a stiff upper lip British lady, father was an evil money grubbing lawyer, and the worst bad guy just happened to be the only black person in the book. UGH! The pacing was slow at the beginning and when the events of the ending were unfolding it was as though the author only had a few pages to wrap everything up so the ending feels very rushed.
860.0	3.0	Not impressed.   Apart from the horrible insta-love and the plot twist I called before even picking this book up, there are so many things wrong with this book. Stereotypes, lazy descriptions, and the language used to describe her mother later in the book are what stick out most to me as the reasons why I did not like this book. I don't understand how people love this book so much, it was boring, repetitive, and nothing new like everyone claims it to be.   Overall I just didn't like it, I don't need to shit on it anymore, just don't pick this one up.
533.0	1.0	Too young adult for me
167.0	3.0	DNF at page 80 something..   Usually I try to make it to page 100 before calling it quits, but THE LIGHTKEEPERS was just too dull to hold my attention. Okay, the cover is beautiful, the premise sounded potentially eerie--outcast photographer travels to the foggy Farallon Islands for adventure, but the writing's just OKAY--nothing to weep over--and after that, nothing really happens. Or, I was just too impatient to wait for it.
797.0	1.0	It took a lot for me to get through this book. I was so confused on who was who since there were so many characters.
110.0	3.0	I wish this book had more explanation/summary. I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable on Renaissance literature; I've read Marlowe, Dryden, and Sydney, and I've taken two separate courses just on Shakespeare, but Spenser's language was so archaic I was lost for 90% of this text. The rhyme scheme and high poetry were nice, but that's really about all I can tell you about this book. I can't summarize the plot and I probably should have given up and read the Sparknotes or Wikipedia page instead because there's no 'this is what's happening, ok?' anywhere in this book. Even the introduction has this rather infuriating assumption that the reader already knows the entire plot and is only reading this book for the allegories and rhyme schemes. I'm kind of frustrated.
520.0	1.0	"This book, despite the name, really can't be called a work by Hafez. The ""translator"" Daniel Ladinsky, doesn't actually speak a word of Persian, and admits that his work on this edition is not to translate Hafez's words, but instead, to translate Hafez's ""meaning"". That sounds great, and Ladinsky is quite talented in that regard, but in the end, it is quite far from Hafez's work in Persian, and I wonder if it's really possible to ""translate the meaning"" of Hafez's work, considering how interpretive Sufi poetry can be."
679.0	4.0	"""Susan has an unusual talent, you'll tell her your darkest secrets"". This made me think I was about to read a psychological thriller, as did the blurb at the back. But I really don't know what sort of book this was. Maybe it was the voice of the narrator, or maybe it was the translation, but at no point did I feel anxious or worried about any of the characters. Nor did the overall situation seem to be terribly convincing.   The general theme was saving an elected few from a (secret) prediction that the planet would be destroyed. But why Susan and her family were involved never made any sense to me. In fact nothing about it made sense. It was like one of those Hollywood movies that are all car chases and explosions but without a plot.   The style was different to Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow. It seemed more whimsical and more like The Hundred Year Man Who Jumped Out of a Window. There was danger, but no real threat. The sixteen year old twins kept popping up out of nowhere and relationship between Susan and her husband was complicated yet not compelling. I couldn't get to grips with any of the characters, why they were there, why they were killed - what was going on!   Perhaps it's me. Perhaps it's the translation. But this book just left me feeling bewildered."
449.0	1.0	Seemed like an early draft of an idea with potential.
88.0	3.0	I was pretty disappointed in this installment. Two parallel stories that don't really cross but to give Harry a reason to have access to the law enforcement system for his private investigator business. The connections on the heir search to Harry's past is tenuous at best and the secondary story of a serial rapist is just too convenient. Either story on its own would've made a good book with more detail. Just seemed disjointed and light.
383.0	1.0	I waited forever to get this book--and I'm not sure that I liked it a bit. It seemed to leap from situation to situation and I swear the last two chapters lost me completely. I have two more from this series to read but.....
755.0	1.0	Another wildly over-rated, over-blurbed, over-funded postmodern poet who makes no sense.
690.0	2.0	This is the story of a little girl's mom who comes to Kindergarten with her one day. She has trouble following all of the rules, and her daughter becomes very embarrassed by her actions. By the end of the day, mom is doing what she is told, but declines when she is invited to return. The text is meant for older children. There isn't a clever end like I was expecting, which was disappointing. The story just made the mom look like she didn't have a life and wanted to stay with her daughter all of the time.
794.0	1.0	It had some good parts but it was pretty boring overall. I'm not a huge fan.
719.0	1.0	The writing wasn't polished enough for publication, but probably could have gotten there with the right help.
561.0	3.0	"** spoiler alert **   The blurb for this book looked extremely appealing, however I found myself incredibly disappointed. FOLLOW ME BACK was incredibly problematic, with underdeveloped characters and plot.   The novel follows Tessa Hart, who has extreme agorphobia after a traumatic experience the past summer. Confined to her room, Tessa fangirls over music-sensation Eric Thorn on Twitter, starting the trending hashtag, #ERICTHORNOBSESSED. Meanwhile, Eric Thorn just wants to be left alone for five minutes of peace and quiet. He starts talking to Tessa under an assumed name, and the two slowly fall in love. The catch? Tessa has no idea she's chatting with her idol.   The plot read more like fan fiction than anything else. The character's motivations were weak and many of them seemed drastically underwritten, even Tessa. The lack of depth in character and plot was incredibly disappointing.   The ending was also problematic for reasons that involve spoilers. The twist ending made absolutely no sense and wasn't cued even a little bit in the book. I needed some indications in the novel to make me buy the ending, but I was never given those clues.   The way Tessa seems to suddenly get over her agoraphobia is not only inaccurate, but damaging. There are an abidance of narratives of girls who ""get over"" mental illness when the right guy comes along. I was hoping Geiger would have treated an illness that is often debilitating, with a little more research and respect.   Overall, I give this book 1/5. I was hoping for so much more than I got.   I was given a free copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
375.0	2.0	This book was... okay. Perhaps I just expected more out of it due to the fact that it is being recommended by others. The writing style was okay, however, I found myself losing interest with the story, and just waiting for the climax. Suddenly, I am at the end of the book, without feeling anything. But still, this book is recommended to the fans of suspense novels.
177.0	3.0	This rebooted Constantine seems somewhat neutered. The characters have traits but no depth. The horror is restricted to the lowest level (gore) and does not seem to want to aim higher. The start of the Batwoman reboot has a much better grasp of the full range of horror.   Another thing hurting this book are only three of the issues in the collection are part of an arc. That arc resembles a pilot pitch and nothing more. I was not enticed to continue reading after finishing this.
680.0	2.0	Lucy is a puppy who used to have a wonderful luxurious home but now roams the streets and has a well established routine. This story is also about a father who has stage fright and through perseverance is able to conquer his fear.   It's an ok story, a good bedtime one, since I was bored through much of it. The message is clear - don't give up on your dreams, for the puppy this was having a home, for the father it was entertaining an audience.
424.0	1.0	0/5. This is legitimately one of the worst books I've ever read.   Full review: http://mikescreenthoughts.blogspot.co...
413.0	2.0	"Overall this volume is totally out of pace. It is confusing, non-sensical, and the humour seems to be struggling with finding its grip on the story.   On my cover it says: ""A great oddball tale that captures the energy of a generation.""   Maybe that is the whole point then. But to me, it was pretty disappointing."
816.0	3.0	That was a trip.   I'm honestly really tired of Russian villains. This is so cliche and boring. I also don't buy characters who are claimed to be ingenious at their field of work the moment they are confronted with main character are portrayed silly and they are acting out of their mind. I also don't buy main character being the most clever of them all, one time being completely devastated about his daughter's hijacking and five seconds later being ready to be the most intelligent and witty lawyer in the court. Wtf.
761.0	1.0	This is so freaking confusing. Is it suppose to make sense with Tales vol 1?
248.0	3.0	"Might have missed the point of this (dystopian teen themes?), but I just found the characters unlikeable and the story gratingly dull. The art was good. But! BIG BUT. I really hate self-perceived ""subversive"" comix (which I presume this is) drawing intentionally ugly characters and then making them huge jerks. We already have a huge cultural ridiculousness, where beauty is equated with ""good"", and ugliness ""bad"". So ""underground"" art which purports to be gritty, realistic, pessimistic, etc, but just has ugly people being ugly and doing ugly things to each other makes me think, bah, so unimaginative."
491.0	1.0	Finished the novel, but came close to shelving the story. Glad I finished, but am not looking forward to the sequel -- yes, l will read the second story since the first book is continued.

873.0	2.0	Inara made a mistake, Dust devils captured Mal and the rest of the crew had to rescue him. Another pointless addition to the franchise.
603.0	2.0	I'd rather read a book written by the person who wrote the publisher summary for this book than these poems. I just didn't connect with a thing. I wanted to read what was described but that wasn't what I found.   Poetry is pretty subjective; your mileage will vary.
402.0	2.0	Okay, I've been to Oktoberfest and from what I remember (admittedly not much) there were hardly any meat cleaver murders. The guy in this book is doing his best to change that though: see, he hates the krauts because of World War Part 2, so he's going around murdering them, and later he ups the ante by blowing up a building too. Naturally a detective is on the case, but unfortunately this book happens in 1973 when they didn't have FAX machines, the Internet, cell phones, good music, or anything else that didn't completely suck, so he has to travel all over the world to solve the mystery.

517.0	1.0	My teacher in 6th grade read this to us. It was ok. The characters were pretty amusing and I think it held the attention of both the boys and the girls in class.
866.0	3.0	Just couldn't do it. I am about halfway through this book I am have no desire to finish it. In fact I would rather listen to the radio then keep listening to this book and I hate the radio. The characters are not likeable and the story is just dragging on forever. I don't care how it ends or care to know anything more about it. I am done. Ugh!
511.0	1.0	the star said it all there is nothing else that i can say!

194.0	2.0	It was ok but the worst conneelly ive read so far.
686.0	4.0	"I received the ARC of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.   I read this book in a day, but simply because it was short. This book is really boring. Short summary: Molly's - she is a main character and a narrator - father re-marries a year after her mother dies, and new weird stepmother brings her three comparably weird children to live with them.   The idea behind the book is that Molly spends summer trying to solve problems caused by her new stepsister and stepbrothers, instead of reading books and napping outside. The book consists of four main parts (June, July, August and September) and of thirty-three chapters. In my opinion, it would be more logical if it was written in a form of a diary, not in chapters. I was sometimes confused when the narrator jumped from the present to past tense, all within just one paragraph. The writing could also benefit from some editing: the author uses the the word ""un/enthusiastically"" just a bit too... enthusiastically. In one particular case, the character says/nods unenthusiastically/enthusiastically within one single page.   But the main reason I didn't like this book is not, of course, its stylistic devices. The author appears not able to choose one main topic and stick to it. There simply is too much:   - mother dies and Molly struggles to accept what happened;   - her distant father chooses to marry some flashy woman just one year after the mother's death;   - crazy stepbrothers/sisters make Molly's life miserable;   - new family with cute boy moves just across the street;   - new stepsister Clara is pure evil, but stepmother always takes her side.   But with all this mashed up together, there is not a single conflict, that could arouse a reader's interest. Simply saying, the plot lacks structure. Tedious descriptions were unnecessary and mostly didn't add anything to the text.   The book description says it was based on a short story, and that makes sense. I guess as a short story it would be much more enjoyable, whereas as a book it simply made me yawn."
849.0	2.0	"What can I say? I just don't care for his art style, I guess. Don't know why. Also, if I did, I'd still want more from this book. Too few examples, and no text but ""A * of *"" ... so unsatisfying."
519.0	1.0	Maybe it's time to retire this one, Alan.
952.0	3.0	Meh. Not good. Not good at all.   This odd reboot of the X-men follows the recent X-men cartoon fairly tightly, putting all the core characters as students into a high-end prep school. Professor X and Magneto are two professors competing for mutant students in the school, each building a super-powered team to suit their own personal philosophies. Not bad in concept, but devlivered really poorly. Weak dialogue, even weaker backing narration and some of the character designs are pretty laughable. Magneto as a hipster prig with a Soul Patch? Um, no thank you. The only character who comes across really well is Anna/Rogue, who ends up with powers from this world's version of Juggernaught instead of Ms. Marvel. The art is serviceable, but very uneven and owes a great deal of its look to the cartoon.
512.0	1.0	Pretty pictures
728.0	3.0	"The Hunt vampires are what we mostly saw back in the day when we first read ""Dracula."" These vampires have no hair, they sleep hanging from the ceiling by their feet, and they drool, a lot. The main character, which lives in a world with vampires, is human, but passes for a vampire wouldn't with fake fangs, and pale skin.   I thought the pretending to be a vampire was unrealistic, when thinking about vampires and humans together; it makes no sense to try to hide it. With more sharpen senses, to smell, hear, and see more than an average human, there is no way to sneak around acting like one of them. Especially if humans are primarily hunted for their blood. No way, I am sorry but that is not realistic.   A couple of things about these vampires that I need to explain for are the following: it makes no sense, and nothing can convince me otherwise.   Vampires only eat bloody meat and cannot stomach other foods except for ice cream.   Gene has learned to suppress basic human instincts like smiling, laughing, coughing, squinting, flinching. It's human nature to flinch when around something more human than us, also to cough if we have a cold, something in our throat choking us, etc.   Sex by armpits I laughed at this one, wow, awkward moment...moving on.   In the books, the vampires could not tell Gene was a ""heper"" just because he shaved all his body hair off. When we shave our body hair off, we still smell, if not worse, it was scientifically proved a fact.   The Hunt was not that bad of a book, but I will not be reading the sequel or any other books in the future dealing with this new YA series.   Rating: 2 Stars"
969.0	1.0	What was the point of this book? To make a sequel? Did the author have to do another because of their contract? WHY?!   I ended up skimming most of this. Was horribly bored. Didn't like the premise. This whole thing took too long in the little I ended up even reading. It just went on and on and on.... *sigh* And everytime I thought it was finally ending, it dragged on for another couple of pages
917.0	1.0	audiobook. Abandoned after 4 discs. boring
340.0	1.0	162 pages into this book, and I no longer cared. I never give up on books, but I just did not give a flip about solving the mystery. So it might be a fantastic book. I'll never know. And I am perfectly okay with that.
760.0	1.0	2.5 star-ish   Quite a short story, really not to much to go on.   The story was, well probably enough for me to pick up #2 to give it another try.   The art, sort of ok, not the greatest but I've seen far worse.
123.0	1.0	It was fun, the writing felt a bit clunky in places and the plot's getting repetitive but it was still fun.   I hated the ending though- cliffhanger much?
303.0	2.0	While it has cute art, it's overall vacuous. It only gets a second star for its consistently good drawing.   Puchimon is about a Jr High for prospective monster slayers where all the students live on-site. All the characters are one-dimensional tropes, and end up in the expected plots like a visit to the bathhouse in addition to more-silly-than-serious fight scenes.   I'm not sure who this is supposed to be aimed at. The main characters are 13 years old, but the manga is presented without furigana (pronunciation guides for Chinese characters), so it can't be aimed at 13 year olds. Perhaps it's marketed to the moe (non-explicit fetishist) crowd of adult men.
880.0	5.0	"I struggled with how to rate this one, because the gorgeous block print illustrations are really marvelous. The story, however, leaves much to be desired.   I will say that I enjoyed the subtle allusions to other fables and morality tales (early, the tiger's mate goes off to care for one of her cubs, who is described as ""like his father"" and who has an imaginary thorn stuck in his paw, ala Androclus and the Lion; later there is a fold-out illustration of a battle that is followed by each side articulating that they are fighting for the ""old order"" or the ""new order"").   But the premise on which the moral of the story (which is hamfistedly spelled out at the end) stands is that someone must be in charge-- someone must rule everyone else as the King of Beasts.   My issue with this is not a Marxist one but a Feminist one, because both the Tiger and the Lion (the new and old order respectively) are male, and the subtext of their conflict and the war of jungle beasts that follows is patriarchal. I think it's meant to be funny when the Tiger's mate is like, ""okay, honey, you challenge the Lion all you want"" and then goes off to take care of her cubs, who are her primary concern, but this is an ugly reinforcement of gendered stereotypes.   Similarly, the Lion's mate is probably supposed to be subtly funny when she tells him the King of Beasts (the Tiger) has come to see him, and the Lion gets pissed. She acts like she doesn't know he's the King of Beasts, and while this could be interpreted as an indication that ""no one is actually the king, get over yourself,"" when it is paired with the female tiger's preoccupation with her young and the overarching moral which insists that ""You can't very well be king of beasts if there aren't any"" rather than ""there is no king,"" it points more strongly to the Lion's mate as foolish and uncomprehending of politics, and that lack is a feminine one.   Sloppy, outdated, and unfocused. This book is worth paging through for the illustrations, but I wouldn't read it to a kid; there are other stories that communicate a clearer and more appropriate anti-authoritarian message."
741.0	2.0	Man, I thought this one was terrible--I can handle a ridiculous plot like this one has, but the execution of it is...really not great. It's like the equivalent of all those teen paranormal romances I've quit reading less than halfway through lately--practically zero actual character development, just a bunch of stuff happening for little to no believable reason, and with no transitions between events. And the bonus story about the teacher? Ew! Meh. No thanks.
644.0	1.0	If you have little ones who like skateboarding, this book is great. Otherwise, it's not very exciting.
190.0	4.0	"Oh why did I bother reading it? I came here after reading The Princess Saves Herself in this One, which was a complete disappointment. Many reviewers recommended Milk and Honey instead. I found it even worse.   Maybe I'm too old to enjoy this kind of ""poems"". But then again, I don't think 15 or 20 year-old me would have enjoyed them either. I guess they're just not aimed at me. At least with The princess..., I was able to resonate with a couple of poems about grief. Milk and Honey was just 3edgy5me. I don't even know what annoyed me more. The fact that a lot of serious themes are romanticized and turned into emo confessions. The author's way of viewing sex and relationships - I could not connect with anything at all. The fact that other subjects are taken out of proportion (seriously, how many poems about leg hair can you write? I got it the first time. Why include so many in a single book?!) Oooor...   The bloody style in which these are written.   It's just so   t u m b l r a e s t h e t i c.   Take out the drawings, use caps at the beginning of sentences, eliminate all those useless enters after only 1-2 words, eliminate the page breaks and let this flow like normal prose. You get an angsty girl diary full of platitudes. There's just no subtlety about it. No poem that gives you that ""aha!"" feeling. No poem that makes you think about it once you close the book.   Or maybe it's just me.   Maybe I'm just a cynical asshole.   But I've learned nothing from this book.   And I couldn't help but grit my teeth at how preachy the last part is.   Oh, the wise woman who's suffered offered her free advice to me, stemming from the depth of her pinterest self help posts soul.   Thanks but no thanks."
102.0	1.0	Long and a bit boring in places.   Longer review to come
657.0	2.0	Author is clearly very sharp, and talented. But I had no emotional investment in the character and never felt drawn in, nor did I feel inspired or have any revelations about life in general - which a good novel will do - so I'm just so-so on this.
569.0	3.0	I can honestly say that I am sorely disappointed with this book. I made it over 1/3 of the way in, and I just can't do it anymore. The story is dragging, and I have lost a severe amount of interest in it. At this point, Cassia and Ky's romance and rebellion has gone from seemingly interesting and poignant to just very melodramatic without a cause. Needless to say, I won't be finishing this book or the series. I hope Atlantia is better!
857.0	3.0	It was ok. The subject matter and observations were pretty fascinating. But I LOATHED the artist's tone, and it was distracting. I found him to be disrespectful and xenophobic. Yes, I said disrespectful and I meant it. Sure, the North Korean government is responsible for some of the worst human rights violations in the world, and they deserve to be criticized. But the author chose to go there, chose to do business with them, and chose to allow the money he is getting paid for his work there to enable him to live like royalty while the people around him suffer, brainwashed and starving. Forgetting the FLAT-OUT RACIST comments he casually drops about other asian nations, I don't think he understands the difference between criticizing a tyrannical government and criticizing an ethnic culture.   I am also not a fan of his artistic style, but that's just a matter of opinion.   [note: This was translated from the original French, so while I think a certain je ne sais quois might have been lost in translation, i don't know what it might have been.]
426.0	1.0	"Good quick read with an interesting storyline, read it in a day. However, it seemed to have a lower quality of writing, little character development and ""insta-love"" (which I'm not a fan of)"
961.0	1.0	Lost interest and stopped reading it.
296.0	3.0	"an unfortunate train wreck: might have been an okay story under there somewhere, but it's too long, too convoluted, and too hampered by artwork that is beyond inappropriate for the subject matter (in my opinion). if you don't mind bobble-headed cartoon renditions of superheros the art might not bother you as much, but i didn't turn a single page without wondering whether this would have been one thousand times more interesting and effective if it had been ""played straight"" instead of as if seen through a funhouse mirror.   also, the silly idea of the celia character being bruce's childhood companion just flat out didn't work for me. plenty of others have put forth their specific critcisms, so i won't bother beating this dead horse."
470.0	3.0	Andrew Kolb is a talented illustrator. This book was meant to showcase his skills to publishers. I do get how it does that, but a picture book of Space Oddity sounded dreamy, and could have been so much more in terms of interpretation, adaptation and/or inspiration.   So, yeah, as a means of self-promotion: 5/5. As an actual book, 2/5.
990.0	1.0	I know this book got great reviews and I gave it an effort on a few different occasions. I just couldn't get interested in the story. It was just very tiresome writing. I might pick it up sometime in the future to give it one more shot, since SO many people really loved it.
224.0	2.0	I wanted to love this book, I really did. I was hoping it would give examples of anxiety and instances that I could relate to, or that my children could, but it didn't really turn out that way. I didn't find it all that compelling, and the illustrations were pretty mediocre. Now I feel like I'm being too harsh. It just wasn't my cup of tea.
693.0	4.0	"I won this book through the Goodreads First Read Giveaway on 04/07/2011 and received my copy on 05/17/2011!   First off, I absolutely love the way that Scottoline writes. I've read quite a few of her books and I've never been let down. Save Me just missed the mark in my mind. I can't quite put my finger on as to why. Sometimes it felt like the book moved too fast and didn't delve into the story as I'm so accustomed to with other Scottoline books, but it could also be because this book was really disturbing. I am a mother and I can't imagine being put into that impossible situation and having to read about it was really hard. So the reason I don't like the book may be because it really hit me hard. The characters also didn't seem fully evolved.   This isn't a book that you'll forget about, that is for sure. It will really hit home with a lot of parents, if not every single one. We all have this ""what if"" fear that we hope we will never have to face. I have found myself thinking about the basis for this book quite frequently. It really makes you wonder, what WOULD you do? How could you judge who is more important? Could you put another child ahead of your own?   Part of me wishes that I hadn't won this book just so that these seeds of doubt and worry wouldn't be embedded in my mind, but another part of me is thankful that that I did win, so that I could think about it. I just have such mixed feelings. I'll probably hide this book away for a while and pick it up again in a few months just to see if the read goes any differently next time."
236.0	2.0	I really don't know what rating to give this book. I picked it up at the library in the children's section because I had heard it was a good dystopian novel. I found it very interesting and easy to read at first but then comes the horrible awful thing and I don't even know what to say about it anymore...except to say it is not for children. Like not at all.
353.0	1.0	Not really interested in teenage angst; not even sure why I ordered this book
238.0	5.0	"Definitely not five stars. Perhaps my expectations were set too high by the numerous positive reviews. I am slightly confounded as to why. The last review I wrote contained a quote that went ""Perhaps reading great books really spoils you for reading bad books."" I just didn't love it. I figured out that I didn't love it when someone asked me if I cried when Rue died. I am a sob story for almost anything. I cry at Hallmark Commercials. I did not cry when Rue died. Why? Probably because the plot and character development wasn't there.   I was really into it the first 50 pages or so. I found it thrilling. Then the games started. Overall the plot was extremely predictable. It seems like an original story initially but it pulls from too many classics such as Lord of the Flies, The Most Dangerous Game and 1984. Her story telling is great but her writing his poor. The structure of writing was very choppy with horrible sentence construction. A grammar class would do Collins some good.   The book starts with an intriguing story line and veers off to take an easy out. Call me morbid, but I wanted only one to survive. That was the story I bought into. She constructed the capital to be brutal and unforgiving. They are in command and they teach the lessons. Fast forward to the end of the book and two teenagers completely cheat the capital and show them up? It's not consistent with who Collins developed the capital to be.   The romance was unappealing as were the characters. I found Katniss flimsy and boring towards the end. She was interesting a first. There was no clear theme and no lesson learned at the end of the book. It's violent with no clear means to an end. Collins set up a story line that WAS TRYING to say something about government, or youth or politics. It never said what. Therefore I found it empty.   The reason I believe that so many people fly through the book and find it appealing is the exciting story line that only one could survive. Who would it be? Who would die? We all breathed a sigh of relief when both did. But both shouldn't have. It ruined all of the suspense for me and killed the thrill of the story.   I will shelve this on my ""Books that should have been better"" shelf."
566.0	2.0	As a fan of both poetry and World War I, I was not a little disappointed by this collection. Honestly, most of the poems here are not very good. Never a fan of rhyming poems or strict literalism, I maybe should've known better. These are almost stiflingly thematic and while some good poets are represented here, it's not their best work that's represented here. Plus, it's all British poets, which doesn't seem quite right since there were other countries involved in the war as far as I can recall...I mean, I wasn't there.
991.0	3.0	Take a dash of Tomb Raider, add a sprinkle of Witchblade and a light glaze of Highlander and what do you get? A book that 'rots like bad pulp'. Well maybe not that bad but it is pretty bland and the plot is a bare MacGuffin of the month for bad guys and good girls to chase after. Maybe it would get better but this seems very lazy to me. The art doesn't really lend much of a hand to the production either.
448.0	1.0	Interesting stories, but nothing that really stood out.
995.0	5.0	"Was really disappointed in this book after the amazing Without which was the volume of poems that made me want to know more about the man.   Unfortunately, I mostly read name-dropping of famous people that Hall had met over the course of his life and learned very little about the man at all. His children and his first wife, for instance, were mentioned and glossed over. While I appreciate his unwillingness to drag out every sordid detail of his divorce, making so little mention of his personal life before his second wife died doesn't necessarily lend itself to much of a ""memoir.""   I did enjoy the early chapters about his childhood and how he came to writing initially. I also thought the prose was quite beautiful in the end when dealing with loss and growing old.   My two main problems with the book:   1.) The previously mentioned name-dropping. It gets so thick throughout the middle of the book that it completely overwhelms some chapters. At points, we learn nothing about that section of his life other than who he hobnobbed with. Honestly, it started out boring and just became obnoxious. Even his wife was mentioned by her first and last name repeatedly (as if to shove down our throats that he was married to a famous poet as well). This, frankly, ruined not only the book for me, but my opinion of the poet himself.   2.) The subtitle of the book is A Memoir of a Life in Poetry. Where was the talk of poetry? There is talk of how he became interested in poetry initially, talk of the important poets that he met, talk of his readings... Yet poetry is avoided altogether for much of the book and he at no point goes into much detail of his thoughts on the art.   Overall, just a book that I had to struggle to finish - especially through the middle sections. While I recommend Hall's poetry that I have read, I would not suggest this book as a worthwhile read whatsoever."
227.0	5.0	"WARNING: This review contains spoilers!   I REALLY wanted to like this book. With a topic of reincarnation I thought it would be right up my alley. I rate it a high 2. It was okay, but with some serious flaws. The author had a great concept, but the plot had serious holes, too many characters and characters in disguise to keep straight, and no real ending. Lots of loose threads and unanswered questions. As for suspense, there was too much switching of time, place, and point of view to build any tension. The main character, Josh, is just as clueless at the end of the book as he was at the beginning. The author desperately wants us to believe in reincarnation, but even her main character does not grow or learn anything from his experience. The best part of the book was the portrayal of ancient Rome and the Vestal Virgins. But who is Sabina? We never find out. Every other character seems to have a modern incarnation, but apparently not Sabina. The twist at the end makes no sense. And it just ends. There is no resolution of karma. In my experience, memories of past lives don't just come out of the blue unless there is a reason. We have agreed to have that experience as part of our spiritual growth, to resolve karma, to heal self-karma, or to validate our connections with people we have known in the past. None of that happens here. It seems to me the author is like Malachai - desperate to have that experience for herself, but with no idea what it really means. The ""Memory Stones"" was so gimicky. I wish the author had stuck with historical facts. If someone can tell me the series gets better, I might try another one.   Book Description: A bomb in Rome, a flash of bluish-white, and photojournalist Josh Ryder's world explodes. As Josh recovers, thoughts that have the emotion, the intensity, the intimacy of memories invade him. But they are not his. They are ancient...and violent with an urgency he cannot ignore--pulling him to save Sabina...and the treasures she protects. But who is Sabina?   Desperate for answers, Josh turns to the Phoenix Foundation--a research facility that scientifically documents past-life experiences. He is led to an archaeological dig and to Professor Gabriella Chase, who has discovered an ancient, powerful secret that threatens to merge the past with the present.   Here, the dead call out to the living, and murders of the past become murders of the present.   Series info:   Reincarnationist series   01.

540.0	1.0	I really liked the idea about Hiku's but got disappointed midway through. I just think it could have been a better climax and outcome.
981.0	2.0	On the one hand, this is a very sweet book. On the other hand, I found it very disturbing. The poor baby's parents simply abandon her in a basket, floating down the river -- eek! why couldn't they have been shown taking her to an adoption agency if they loved her so much? I think this book might be rather upsetting to a child who's been adopted.
743.0	2.0	If I could give 0 stars to this book, I would. The worst X-book writer combined with an artist that already drove me off Astonishing, what's not to not like?   Let me spoil it for you. Nothing happens, save you don't have 20bux anymore.   It's not cool to give negative reviews of other creators works. I know this, and I expect some backlash from the current crop of Marvel zombies. My only hope is that this entire plot is some crazed fever dream, like the 4 color , happy 50s version of X-force.   P.S. the freaking Slimer mutant from those awful books is back. So if you were looking for one of Wolverine's 10 titles a month to skip, pick this one.   Or rather, don't.
432.0	3.0	Dear Lonely Book on the Couldn't Finish List--   The time has come for me to give you a friend! While I thoroughly believe you deserve your spot on that list and that you should be in a league of your own, I have finally broken down into another DNF. Maybe one day I will try one of you again. So, book, right now you should feel like this!   Meaghan   Well, basically, if you read my status updates, you know how I feel very early on about this book. I wouldn't say the writing was awful by any stretch. It wasn't great either though. I didn't really care for Annie. I felt like because she swore at her phychiatrist, that meant I was supposed to feel pity for her and think she has been through a lot. But I didn't, not even a little.   I think this book hit a perfect storm with me with being a forensic book of some sorts (I am typically a lot harder on them, and the author using CSI as a reference point did not set a good tone for me) and coming off a book high from a book I was absolutely enamored with! Maybe I will give this one a chance again in the future (sorry 'couldn't finish' book, you may be on your own again someday).   /* UPDATE!!! */   So after looking at books I made it through (50 Shades, I'm looking at you), I told myself, there is no way this is worse than that, I can do this! I am not saying I spent a great ordeal of time soaking in the details, but I did make it through!   While the main thing that was annoying me did go away (no more bad forensics every 5 pages!), I still can't say I was in love with the story. I did not like the Annie after her escape. I also found it hard to believe he would let Annie near an axe when he would barely let her hold a knife for more than 10 seconds, and I found the plot twist a bit far-fetched. I guess it was ok in the end, but I wouldn't say it's rememberable.
221.0	1.0	I enjoyed the art but was disappointed with the overly simple story.
702.0	2.0	Ugh, couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. It's very clear that this is Maas' writing before she matured as a writer , because the heroine is incredibly irritating and unaware of how irritating she is. I loved her most recent book -- so maybe the later ones in this series will be better, but I just could not get into this one. I kept hoping somebody would hit Celaena with a bat for being vapid and vain.
390.0	1.0	there's too much drama going on.
902.0	3.0	The beginning of the book is all about how Det. Hatcher couldn't engage with the case. She wasn't seeing everything that needed to be seen and she couldn't seem to empathize with the survivors. I kinda felt the same way about the book. Couldn't engage. Her lack of care translated into my lack of care about this story. I was never drawn in and fully engaged about a story where the lead character couldn't take the time to do her job.
9.0	4.0	**Thanks to NetGalley for providing a free copy of THE IMPOSSIBLE LIGHT in exchange for my honest review**   If you're expecting anything similar to Laurie Halse Anderson or Ellen Hopkins, you'll be sorely disappointed. Novels in verse need to be more than prose formatted to look like poetry. With verse, every word needs to be meaningful and important to the plot or character, to advance the story or knowledge of the narration.   For the most part, the quality of Lily Myers writing feels bland and unoriginal. While she occasional pens a gem, the surrounding rusty metal turns the skin green. I enjoyed the math and science metaphors, the strongest part of Myer's writing.   Ivy, the unoriginal narrator, quickly develops an eating disorder after her parents divorce and her best friend changes. The same story has been told so many times it has become cliche.   THE IMPOSSIBLE LIGHT is mercifully a very quick read. I can't think of a reason to recommend.
554.0	1.0	"Some folks praise the ""primitive"" style but I call bullshit. The whole thing just seems very half-assed. A high school creative writing project could have done a lot better."
665.0	2.0	Good idea, poor execution. And does the average person really have dreams like the ones her character is always falling into? Yikes.   Not interested enough to read the sequel.
26.0	2.0	Parker does better when he has a decent plot. This time, the plot is there to give the characters a chance to show their depth. Sadly, they do.   Still, any Parker moves along and works to kill time as needed.
22.0	3.0	** spoiler alert **   If I could give this book no stars, I would. I picked it up in Target one day and sat there for about 2 hours and read it in one sitting. The details were extremely gruesome (as they were meant to be) and the plot unfolds in a very unrealistic way. I thought the book was very CSI. The bad guy does his bad deeds, good guys get accused/framed, and in the end the good guy is cleared. The fact that Max is supposedly cured at the end of the book and the family moves on with their lives is very unrealistic. For someone to experience those types of situations, it would take ALOT to move on and start feeling normal again. Another thing that I could not get my mind around was the character Marianne. How is it possible that she killed all those children and no one ever noticed? I think that at some point, people would start suspecting things. All in all, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
31.0	2.0	Really disappointed... (Ps Hated Adam... Screw that guy.)
325.0	2.0	"The language felt bland, and the story itself seemed embellished, but not in a way that added anything ""epic"". I was expecting more lyrical and mystical folklore/myth, but this felt stilted and dull."
923.0	3.0	"I think that maybe the writer heavily focused the plot on the group of travelling Oregonians who narrate this story as a way of saying something like: this is just one of many accounts of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (at some point they mention that their purpose is ""to bear witness""). But the Oregonians are not terribly interesting or effective as narrators (they are rather clueless throughout the narrative), and their moments of reflection as they witness the disaster just end up seeming a little trite. This book would be far more interesting if it focused less on the travelling Oregonians, or on humans even, since the portrayals of southern Louisianians are somewhat hoaky and not terribly revealing."
104.0	3.0	I liked the concept of the book. I definitely get why people are comparing it to Whisper, but I felt that the characters - esp Clary and Jace but the others as well - were underdeveloped. Much of the plot was predictable, and there was much more telling than showing of the action. I definitely wanted to finish it, but I'm not sure I'll read any more of the series.
605.0	3.0	"For a ""classic of English literature"", this crap is barely readable. First off, Chaucer has no understanding of English grammar.. Second, word choice is poor. I don't know what Jeff was smoking but lines like ""Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo, Whan that this child had souked but a throwe"" could be more easily rendered in an understandable manner by merely saying, ""Theraflu, bi people fall, mo, when this kid breast-fed at a baseball game"". The ""plot"" involves a bunch of pilgrims telling each other stories that just aren't funny. ""What neded hym? he drank ynough biforn. And whane he hadde pouped in this horn, etc., etc."" hardly registers as even the basest potty humor. Yvel biset mine harte-bloode, indeed! Lessons learned:   1) Chaucer = terrible speller   2) Even medieval people talked about poop"
234.0	1.0	what a mess, what a boring mess
996.0	2.0	"Okay, I was browsing in the bookstore and saw this on the table. I know that there is a movie coming, based on this story, so I thought I'd check it out.   At first blush, I like the concept. If aliens have been coming to Earth for a long time, they should have come during the 1800's. There have been plenty of films of us fighting aliens with our relatively primitive weapons. Imagine trying to fight aliens with 19th century weapons!   Well, that's all well and good, but the actual execution of the concept in this book fell far short of my imagination.   I can suspend disbelief so far, but this book pushed me beyond my limit. For example, the aliens attack, while riding these flying motorcycle-like vehicles. No one seems surprised, awed or overwhelmed by this. Not the cowboys and not the Indians! Come on! Someone should have said, ""Holy sh*t! They're flying!"" But they didn't. There were other moments that were made for a Disney movie that had me rolling my eyes. I won't ""spoil"" it, if anyone really wants to read this book.   I only give this two stars based on basic concept and artwork. If the movie is anything like this book, I don't know if I'd even watch it on cable."
738.0	2.0	Well to be honest I LOVE the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child. However, this was the weakest of the batch set up as a prequel to the series one would expect a younger, more aggressive, sharper Jack Reacher. Instead what we got was, sorry to say, fairly lame, a decent story line, you should have left the sex out, if you can't write it so its exciting better to omit it.
272.0	3.0	It goes by so fast. I finished it in one day. But the plot gets solved so quickly. The whole book talks about how she's (Lexi) is so misreable and then suddenly in the last few pages everything is solved.
456.0	1.0	It had some good elements to the book. I just didn't care much for how it was put together, the story was just okay to me.
712.0	2.0	I thought that this book was really very cleverly executed. The drawings are surprisingly layered and well thought out, presenting a great deal of action in very small spaces. This seems to make for a better, more expansive feel to the book overall, which provides a richness to the riddle pictures that would not normally be possible.   I enjoyed reading this book, and I'm sure that many other readers have (and will!), too. Which Witch is Which? is a delightfully entertaining find.
2.0	3.0	Meh.   I bought this for Sean Gordon Murphy's art, and that's just great, as usual.   The story, however, is quite unimpressive and the scientific premises are all hogwash. The discredited theory of the acquatic monkeys is the very foundation of the setting, and there are several rather glaring points that show how the writer has a scientific knowledge that is quite ridiculous. And that's bad when you write a scientific story that offers scientific explanations.   Just buy it for the art if you want to but don't expect a great story.
785.0	2.0	Eh, this one's solidly mediocre. I couldn't buy into the plot, even for Shojo. See my review here: http://trebro.livejournal.com/262081....
780.0	1.0	Meh..alright. Not one that I'd read more than once.
622.0	2.0	Wow. This Dora book was actually marginally acceptable. I am in shock. It has a nice, big font for beginning readers. Also, it doesn't do the stupid picture-with-mini-word-under-it-so-kids-can-think-they-are-reading thing.
443.0	1.0	I really struggled with this one. I had to reread poems over and over for them to find some meaning.
399.0	3.0	This book is very well written. The pace was too slow in the beginning but picked up around forty percent. I enjoyed Dangerous Girls, the pace, the plot, the characters. I hated every single character in this story besides Ethan. I liked Chloe in the beginning, understood her struggle, and frustration with the monotony of her town and the people. And then Oliver came and manipulated her, turned her weak and into a killer. She thinks she's smart but not really . She's the one of many easily controlled by charming intelligent men. She's the Charles Manson women, feigning strength when they were just lost little girls bright eyed at the first man that can make them orgasm. I would've liked an ending of her in the kitchen still in small town Haverford with an apron and Ethan watching her despise her surroundings. I would like to add that making her pregnant would finish it off quite nicely but I pity the child to be paired with her. No, she belongs under Ethan's foot with no degree and watching him be appreciated by mistresses because she screwed up. But I also would have been content with an ending of her in jail and him happy with a wife and child never writing a single letter to her. Because the narcissist she became couldn't stand it. I understood the motive in Gone Girl, Dangerous girls, the memory Box. This, well, she essentially became her mother. She's a despicable character passed off as some strong female when she was the weakest of them all. I personally won't recommend this book to anyone. I'm quite pissed I endured that many pages for an ending like that. I want my time back.
855.0	2.0	"It wasn't that bad, but I felt like there was a little too much ""I'm ten-years-old and that's going to completely derail everything I try to do!!!!1!"" I ended up wanting to smack both main characters. And then everything is resolved by a hair-pulling fight in the last five pages? What?"
914.0	4.0	"I feel bad giving this a two star rating because I'm pretty easy to please--it doesn't take much to pull at least three stars, but the poems of Yeshiva Boys did absolutely nothing for me, nothing at all. Usually a rating below three stars implies that there was some sort of incredible glaring problem with either content or form or both, and I don't know that there was a particular flaw in this book so much as I couldn't find any of its good qualities. I found Lehman's verse simultaneously dull and not at all insightful (as if form had superceded content) and insufficiently musical (as if the poetry of the poems had been sacrificed to the message/story/point). This should not be possible. I didn't hate any particular poems, but there were no pieces that I actually enjoyed either. Lehman wants to say something that much is obvious from the title poem, a long piece that deals with the experience of being a student in a yeshiva and intelligence work and the questions of Jewish experience, the Holocaust, identity, and philosophy. If failed (to me at least) to say much of anything about any of these themes or to tell an interesting narrative.   Poetically, I think the closest to making a mark on me was section five of ""Yeshiva Boys"" titled ""Sabbbath Feast"", which opens, ""How beautiful to me are the red fire escapes of my youth. / How goodly to me are the tents of morning housing the tenants of dry seasons in books read and read again until masted in old age by tigers who crouch at the edge of the jungle ready to pounce. / How happy the wife who prepares the Sabbath feast."" That approached the sort of musicality I look for, but didn't quite reach it and the rest of the book fell even flatter--like ""Death, the Theory"", ""The imp of the perverse was deceiving elf. / The headaches came more often / with other blows the pills couldn't soften. / I was a fat girl once myself."" I was particularly disappointed by the number of sestinas that appeared in the book. I have a special affection for the form, and these are the first I have ever read that I did not enjoy reading at all. This very much soured the experience reading the whole book even more than the blandness of the poems would have done anyway.   This was a disappointment of enormous proportions; I will probably never return to Lehman's own works and only encounter him as an editor from here on out."
29.0	2.0	Things about this book:   1. Blue is a whiny bitch.   2. Gansey is an annoying control freak and a selfish bastard.   3. Mr. Grey was incredibly lame and unrealistic.   4. Adam finally told Gansey to back the f*ck off.   5. Ronan is cool with his dream stuff.   6. Drama, drama and more stupid drama.   *sigh* I was very disappointed in this book. After reading the first book I was hoping this one would be better. It wasn't. There are a few parts in this book that are interesting, and have pretty good character development, but not enough for me to give it a higher rating.
499.0	2.0	This book was super underwhelming. I can see it being really entertaining for kids of a certain age, particularly boys who struggle with reading or feelings, but I had a really hard time staying engaged. I finished this but my time would have been better spent elsewhere.
96.0	3.0	Looks like I'm in the minority on this one. I chose this book because I thought the main character sounded interesting and unique: she is. However, the story was too meandering for me. Several times it seemed to really get going, and then it would slow way down. Not my favorite style.
214.0	1.0	This book started out really good but somehow in the middle it all went terribly wrong, things just didn't seem possible or believable about all how these people meshed together in some way. It could of went way better than originally told.
807.0	2.0	lacks cohesiveness?   Plot seems to target toward people who had already watched the TV series hence some backstory there and about, with some lack of plot too (thinking that the reader would fill in the missing gaps from the TV show?). The portrayal method however: character by character seems to target toward people who are new to OB, hence the characters introduction.   Overall, confusing. Who were the intended audiences? :/
388.0	1.0	Couldn't make it thru the first pages. Though I have read authors other novels.
667.0	2.0	Ugh. This is what happens when two men try to write a book for young women--the whole thing becomes about landing a boyfriend. Lame.
483.0	1.0	A bunch of words on a white page.
460.0	1.0	Boring, loutish, unfocused. I know Tank Girl is famous, but why? Curious to read more, but didn't enjoy this.
779.0	2.0	This book tired me and angered me very much. I can't believe that it is actual legal to pass guardianship of the kids you are a guardian to a stranger just like that. I can't believe Mr. Poe is still so stupid. I can't believe so many things in this book.   Grrr...really....
507.0	1.0	We didn't find the story engaging, but did enjoy the bright color combinations in the illustrations.
120.0	3.0	"1400s Florence, Italy: Leonardo DaVinci creates art and tries to fly by himself with only a contraption with wings. He lives in a city surrounded by pretty wenches in long silk dresses.

And then our two young (WAY TOO young!) time travelers attempt to save the Artist Formerly known as Normal from a fate worse than death (or Michaelangelo's ""better"" work, whichever you prefer) when Leo tries to fly on his own power. This, friends, is, to be sci-fi technical for you geeks, is screwing with the boundaries of time. Example B: Michael J. Fox, who totally rearranged the past in his trip back to the future in a DeLorean and almost lost his soul. (Today, he has Parkinsons. Science fiction can't predict EVERYTHING, y'know!) I think I'll use that barf bag for this flight...SIR!"
261.0	2.0	I feel like the X-Men keep retreading old ground. Also, having mutants and inhumans in the same universe seems nonsensical to me. Will not follow up this series.   ** Update - Wasn't planning to follow up, but volume 2 is better, or, at least, so full of running and fighting that the premise doesn't seem so flimsy.
64.0	1.0	Grade: C-   Overly long, premise that didn't come together at the end. Mildly exciting.
782.0	3.0	"Do I trust anything this book has to offer in regards to the history of anything? No.   Did I get annoyed at the failed attempts at humor and wit? Yes.   Did I get passed the repetitive slow thinking of the main characters to get to the conclusion I saw coming 200 hundred pages out? Yes.   Despite all of the bad things, oh so many bad things, about this book, I still wanted to finish it. If I were a youngster, this would be the next step in mysteries after the ""Boxcar Children."" As an adult it falls flat, but not so much that it wasn't at all enjoyable."
821.0	1.0	Totally unconscionable.
867.0	3.0	Love the quiet line drawings. Love the contained poetic form. Intrigued by the hint of narrative. But alas, none of it hangs together. Except for in very few, the voice in the poems does not feel as if it could come from these teens. It has too much distance, sometimes too much sagacity. The rhymes are fun but it is like a limerick tried to squeeze into some haiku pants.
582.0	2.0	I have mixed feelings about this one. Illustration are great and funny, but the story is about pointless quarrel with flawed arguments on both sides.
137.0	2.0	I would have put this down without a thought if not for the first book and my interest in Strike and his assistant. Could have been about publishing, but it was crazy, bizarre genre of literature that I didn't know existed. Just because the first book was successful does not mean that she / and/ or her editor shouldn't have paid attention to her target audience and the subject matter.
