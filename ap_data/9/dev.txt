801.0	4.0	"A good thriller, especially a good ""right man in the wrong place"" thriller, is how your protagonist gets trapped in a situation beyons their control with no way to escape. It's the classic Hitchcock formula and Red As Blood tries to go with the same plot tropes.   A group of teenagers find a bag of blood-soaked money and unwisely decide to keep it. One of the grouo, Elisa, demands that our protagonist Lumikki help discover where the money came from. Everyone is pulled down into the dark and seedy Finnish underworld.   My biggest problem with this book was that any of these characters could have walked away from their troubles at any time. When the teens decided that keeping the money was probably a bad idea, they could have ditched it; no one knew they had it. Lumikki could have called the police at any time or simply walked away; none of these people were really her friends and she didn't actually have any of the bloody money. In fact, Lumikki tells herself over and over during the story that she shouldn't be involved. ""Well, why are you?"" I asked myself. The stakes in the book were really low, there was no true sense of inevitability to force these characters' paths.   Lumikki isn't a terribly original character. She's isolated and has a troubled past and Sumukka seems to think that's enough for the readers to buy into her cold and calculating demeanor and her honed physical and mental skills. Lumikka's past is built up throughout the book and is imploed to be filled with such darkness and pain that by the time everything is revealed, it's laughably mundane. Frankly, she seemed like a normal, outsidery angst-ridden teen to me."

858.0	2.0	Well aren't I the two-star party pooper. I like cats. I like haiku. This book, though, didn't float my boat. I enjoyed the illustrations more than the haiku. I think I'll pass this on to someone who'll appreciate it.

46.0	4.0	Jamie is inadvertently blamed for a substitute teacher being hit in the backside by a tennis ball because her best friend, Isabelle, is trying to frame Yolanda for dismissing her remarks about keeping a kangaroo. After an interview with the assistant principal (and also her new uncle), Jamie is exonerated of the crime, but made to feel bad that there are no extracurricular activities in her permanent record. She and Isabelle sign up for everything under the sun--chess club, gamers' club, and even running club. After one sweaty morning with them, Isabelle steals fancy coffee from the teachers' lounge and the two perfume themselves with it, which gets them positive attention from the staff, who are all strangely addicted to coffee. But why is there expensive coffee in the teachers' lounge, and what does it have to do with the fact that noxious meatloaf is served to the students every week?   Strengths: These are super quick reads, complete with pictures, and get a little snarky with friend drama and students being mean to each other. Very popular with reluctant middle school readers.   Weaknesses: Rather unrealistic, and I'm not a fan of the pictures, which are often sort of gross (Jamie is shown drooling or making zombie faces a lot.) Rather a The Fourth Stall for girls, it's just something I don't understand because I am out of middle school, and know that the only way we have coffee is that the PTO pays for it.
882.0	2.0	Not very exciting. It all takes place in the court room. She said this..... I said that..... Connelly is very clever, no doubt about that. However, the pace of this book is very slow. I can't wait for Bosh to come back. And the ending, give me a break.
283.0	1.0	found it hard to keep the narritive thread
468.0	3.0	Hmmm...this story seemed somewhat disjointed to me. We're thrown right into the murder mystery plot with no real introduction to the characters and it seems to remain pretty true to this form throughout the story. The detective story consumes the entirety of the plot with no character enhancing side business going on. Nothing much seems to come of the murder mystery until the last thirty pages or so, which was kind of annoying. As one other reader said, it seemed they spent a great deal of time talking about the mystery and very little time actually doing anything. For such a short book (134 pages) it still took me four days to read what should have only taken an afternoon as I kept falling asleep. The endless back and forth made my eyes cross and I found myself losing interest in what they were saying on a fairly regular basis. However I've read that this is not the best book in the series so perhaps the others are much more entertaining. Sadly (or not) I will not be reading them to judge for myself. ;)
976.0	3.0	I thought a cool thing about this book was that its setting is right near where I live and I recognized some of the places that were mentioned :) this book was a quick read for me but I didn't find myself loving any of the characters like I usually do in books, which made reading less enjoyable. This book was okay, but I'm slightly disappointed. I love Maureen Johnson and this was the 3rd book I've read from her, the first being The Name of the Star and it's sequel The Madness Underneath and those were really great, so compared to those books this one wasn't great.. I'm not sure what else to say, it was uncomfortable for me at some parts, I was angry with the characters a lot, and I just didnt find anything in this book to be cute.
659.0	2.0	I abandoned this at 60%. Love this author's Coal Harbor books so I thought I'd grab another. What a disappointment.   The characters had no humor and few redeeming qualities. The mysteries did not intrigue me, the plot did not engage me. I dragged myself to the 60% mark because my son liked it, but eventually I couldn't take it anymore and I let him finish it on his own.
577.0	2.0	Unlike say, The Wild Sargasso Sea, which takes place prior to the events depicted in Jane Eyre and is wildly different in tone and style from its sequel, Tom All Alone's or (The Solitary House as it is known in the U.S.) takes place concurrently to the events of Bleak House with many of the same characters and is written in a sort of faux-Dickensian style. The author seemingly took every opportunity to squeeze in any and every reference to the Dickens' original (and a few other fictional works, which I missed, but which are pointed out in the afterword), regardless of whether it served the storyline or not. In some ways, this was fun and Shepard does get in one good twist at the end. But generally I found the constant referencing distracting; I think it would have been a better book without so many Bleak House parallels. As it was, it is a perfunctory Victorian mystery solved not so much by detection as luck.
302.0	2.0	"Another episode in the series about Jeff Fuller, submarine skipper. It's set in the near future, with the US and allies battling Germany and South Africa, but the moral atmosphere recalls 1942 and a desperate struggle against an evil foe. This one begins with a top German computer expert sending a message to Washington that he wants to defect, bringing top secret info with him, but will do so only if Fuller, whom he has long admired from afar, comes to get him. James Bond fans may recognize the set-up and think they're in for a gay version of ""From Russia With Love,"" but they'll just have to pull themselves together. This is a technothriller! It has plenty of advanced weaponry, but it's talked about for a long time before being used. More briefings than battles in this one."

83.0	3.0	"When I was in college, lo, these many years, ago, nearly everyone carried a copy of Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews. At the time, I was reading Dune, the Foundation and Empire books and occasionally cracking one of those expensive things known as textbooks, so I didn't pay too much attention. But the other day in the used book store at the library, I saw this series and thought, Why not see what the fuss was about?   Seems there's a couple of things I was unaware of. First, that Ms. Andrews's typewriter ribbon ran out, according to Wikipedia, in 1986. The books I picked up were all published in 2001. Again, according to Wikipedia, books written under the name V.C. Andrews have since been ghostwritten by one Andrew Neiderman, who has also written The Devil's Advocate. Well, whaddya know.   The present book is the first book in the ""Shooting Stars"" series and relates the story of Cinnamon, a high school senior whose mother has suffered a nervous breakdown following a stillbirth. They live in an old house in upstate New York, one built by a retired Civil War colonel. Pictures of the colonel's family and their spirits still hang around the house, especially in the attic. People at school think Cinnamon's a witch. Cinnamon has a male friend she confides in but no girlfriends. Her closest girlfriend is her mother. Her father is emotionally distant and lurking in their house is domineering, disparaging Grandmother Beverly. In the midst of all this emotional upheaval, Cinnamon wins the lead role in the school play, Death Takes a Holiday.   It's a simplistic, but carefully written."
579.0	3.0	I really am at a loss for what to say here. I gave this my all but it's just not for me. This is targeted at a much different audience although I honestly can't guess who that audience may be.   I entered the giveaway assuming, by the cover, that this was a childrens book. I was wrong and when I figured that out I was okay with it because after all, I am an adult and I do read adult books from time to time. But this is sort of like..... maybe in between?   It's written in verse which was odd to me- it wasn't at all like something you'd find from Ellen Hopkins who I happen to love.   This was sent from out of the country and the way the author wrote was strange to me also. I'm not sure if that was done for the purpose of the book alone or if that's how they talk over in the U.K. Either way it was too strange for me to continue on.   I got to the fourth story and couldn't hang in there anymore. I do appreciate the author sending this to me and GR for allowing the giveaway to happen in the first place. I also appreciate the author signing it- that was cool of him. But I just didn't like it. :(   **I just saw the authors blog and realized this is for children. Which would explain fully why I didn't like it myself I suppose. My daughter is only 4 years old but she's a bit mature for her age so I'm going to run it by her. I have a feeling she's a bit too young to appreciate it- especially with the different writing style that what she's used to but I'm game to try if she is.**
229.0	5.0	"Oh, John Green. I think you're a nice guy who really believes he's delving into some super deep issues with his novels, like depression and isolation and having a terminal illness. But you're not. You're glorifying sadness and you're glorifying illness, and it makes me sick.   Oh, wait, I AM sick. That's right, I have cancer. I was eighteen when my abdomen turned into a puffer fish and I almost died in the course of a week. I underwent several procedures to remove the liquid from my abdomen and began chemo immediately. I've had a picc line, MRI's, CT scans, blood draws, hair loss, mucositis, debilitating nausea, and an endless line of pills to take. The experience is hellish, and I did not see it in The Fault in Our Stars. So I can legitimately say I'm not poo poo-ing cancer because ""I don't understand.""   This is not a book about cancer, not really. It's John Green using cancer as a way to make his relatively vapid characters seem tragic. Hazel is the Mary Sue of Mary Sues. Her name, her attitude, her book - they're all incredibly pretentious, so I can't sympathize with her or identify with her, even though we're both in the cancer boat. Hazel is white, seemingly well-off, and narrates in purple prose. Shockingly, Augustus is all of those things as well. John Green seems incapable of writing about any other types of people. And this is not John Green hating - his Civil War videos helped me pass my IB history test. He just doesn't get what he's doing; at least, I hope he doesn't get it, because whether it's making Alaska's depression irresistibly attractive or making Hazel into a special snowflake, Green glorifies illness. It's gross. Cancer does not mean spouting metaphors, finding your soulmate, and taking vacations to foreign countries. Cancer is having your hair fall out in clumps. Puking at 3 in the morning. Not being able to get out of bed to see your grandparents. Yes, I know Hazel isn't getting chemo anymore, but this is awfully convenient for the plot and for making out.   Frankly, I find it offensive to write about cancer in a way that is so obviously not about cancer. I'll be generous and say that Green is exploring the idea of impermanence and how people deal with death, and that he legitimately thought cancer was a good way to do that. Why didn't he write about the ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THEN? What about writing about being in the hospital, or the wonderful people you meet along the way, or acknowledging how good it feels after the effects of chemo have worn off? It takes a few conversations and a bit of research to figure out the basics. There were no scenes that truly showed common cancer experiences like radiation, surgery, or chemo. You know, the old burn, cut, or poison. You were lazy, Mr. Green, and for the sake of all the children who have cancer, I find this unforgivable.   I could discuss how contrived the romance is, how ungrateful Hazel is towards her parents (I know how taxing it is on mine, so I find her attitude unpleasant, especially since so many people consider her wise), how flat both of the characters are, how silly their dialogue is, how the jibe at the support group probably hurt people who've found a lot of comfort in those, how the track and field jibe about the hurdles really pissed me off, and how the ending is incredibly bothersome. Luckily, many other people have done so incredibly eloquently, and my two cents really has more to do with Green's portrayal of cancer. I've been touched by the cancer stories I've witnessed and by the grace with which people tackle a sad, painful, and difficult disease. So why miss an opportunity to make this real, Green? Why not have Hazel and Augustus struggle with the betrayal of their bodies and the journey it takes to forgive those bodies? In fact, why not take out Augustus entirely, and make it a story about finding yourself in the midst of a confusing and inevitably tragic journey. I would have read that.   Stop making illness so beautifully tragic to advance a theme that doesn't have much substance anyway, because it's been done before. We all contemplate our demise, terminal illness or not, so next time don't use cancer as your crutch. Maybe you'll finally write a book that proves me wrong about you, but I think you'll flaunt your vocabulary and ability to create pretentious quotes for the rest of your writing career, and continue to use illness and sadness as a way to legitimize it."
804.0	3.0	1 - The new Ant-Man saves a woman from a purse snatcher and asks her out for dinner. Then we are treated to a flashback of his origin. Part of it, anyway.   Okay, reading this on the heels of a Hawkeye trade was not a good idea. The pace is slow, the dialogue isn't great, and it's just not Hawkeye. It has potential, though. Too bad the origin story is still going on.   My suspension of disbelief is strained when a fuck-up like Eric O'Grady makes the cut for SHIELD in the first place.   2 - Things pick up when the SHIELD helicarrier is under attack. Meanwhile, in the present, O'Grady is using the Ant-Man suit to try to get laid.   Okay, this issue was a little better. O'Grady is finally in the suit and his douchebaggery continues.   3 - O'Grady makes a move on Chris' girlfriend before he's even in the ground. In the present day, he continues trying to get laid using the Ant-Man suit.   I can see how this is supposed to be funny, and it does have funny moments, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.   4 - An agent is tasked to find the missing Ant-Man suit. Will he find Eric and bring him in?   We can only hope. I think this series would work much better if it was played for laughs instead of played seriously. For laughs, it would be like a teen sex comedy. Played seriously, it's got an ick factor and it really strains my suspension of disbelief that SHIELD agents would be so incompetent.   5 - Agent Carson closes in on O'Grady, both in the past and in the present.   Yeah, I'm glad this trade paperback is short. The sad thing is I know that O'Grady won't get his comeuppance at the end.   6 - Carson and O'Grady have it out in both time periods.   Okay, I didn't hate this issue. The fight between the two Ant-Men in the cafeteria was the highlight of the series so far.   Closing Thoughts: I'm really glad I got this from Marvel Unlimited rather than paying for it. O'Grady is a slimeball and not the kind of slimeball that is fun to read about. I will not be seeing how the series ends. 2 out of 5 stars.
584.0	2.0	I was so disappointed by 'Mockingjay'. The first of the Hunger Games trilogy was absolutely amazing, I was astounded by the writing and the whole story in general. 'Catching Fire' was still pretty good, if somewhat lacking something that the first book had. I was really hoping that 'Mockingjay' would be just as good as the first book, but I honestly couldn't find anything in it that I liked much. The characters didn't develop all that well, the story kept on skipping the scenes that I though would've been important to the overall story. It breaks my heart to give this review to a book that is the sequel to the amazing 'Hunger Games', but I can't honestly say that I liked it.
713.0	2.0	I really wanted to like this story about a girl whose mom used anonymous donor sperm to get pregnant, and the girl's discovery of a sibling through the Donor Sibling Registry. I'm sorry to say that I found the secondary characters to be virtual cardboard cut-outs, the situations mostly unbelievable. Franklin seems to be trying too hard for an interesting plot. Still, I'm glad to see a donor-conceived kid in a book, any book.
739.0	2.0	The Care Bears are symbolic to me of what is wrong with our country; this is the wussification of America. In Care-a-lot everyone is cheery and happy. There's nothing wrong save what to wear for Halloween. Ho hum. I know I am not the target audience, but even with my children I don't expect them to live in a world of perfection. I will forgo Care Bears and especially this book.
910.0	2.0	The writings of Ho Chi Minh helps the reader to understand the man and his political views. These views mired first France and later the United States down in un-winable guerrilla wars for twenty years.
117.0	2.0	Not my thing. The essay on Whitman was very interesting, though.
349.0	1.0	"I feel like the rhythm wouldn't work for storytime, and some of the word choices were peculiar (""the cows can't nap with crusty calves,"" ""you'll witness bovines bow and poultries' prancin' legs"")."
718.0	1.0	In continuation of the last thought....ARGH! This goes too far...seriously! What is the author thinking? And WHY AM I STILL READING THIS?
150.0	3.0	"This graphic novel wasn't really what I was expecting. Attracted by the psychedelic cover, I imagined this would be a surreal, ""Waking Life""-sort of story. It was unusual, but not really in the way that interested me. I did not find the ""meaning of life"" BS very profound, and I got very tired very fast of all of the idealization of parenthood in the story. Like it or not, the average human life follows the same arc of events as the average life of an elk or a sparrow or a bullfrog. It's really not that interesting to anyone but the person living it."
389.0	1.0	2.5   This book was just meh. I liked the plot twist, though.
74.0	2.0	I wanted to like this book so badly! The writing style didn't bother me at all, but I felt like the book was missing so much more with a topic such as this one. I didn't really feel anything for this book while reading it, and with a topic like this, I should have.
416.0	1.0	After years of listening to Baudelaire, Plath, Auden and Harjo read at a whisper, I'd like to imagine that my Moo could top this book of verse with ease. That being said, I enjoyed this for what it was intended to be: An entertaining jaunt through the mind of my favorite four-legged creature.
40.0	3.0	"Hunted down a copy of this after I read an article in which one of my favorite authors gushed about how great it was. Unfortunately, I can't see what all the excitement was about, and I wish I had known it was a kiddie LoTR knock-off. The cover on my copy looks more dark fantasy/Lovecraftian, and despite the ""Weirdstone"" in the title, there really isn't anything ""weird fiction"" about this at all. So I guess my expectations were off and this book was doomed to fail for me from the beginning.   It's a very short book but it took me forever to get through. Not because the prose was dense, not even because of the horrible attempts at dialect, but because it was just boring. Page upon page of the characters moving through the countryside, being hungry and cold. In a book barely 200 pages long, do we really need 15 pages of the characters trying to make their way through dangerous claustrophobic mining tunnels? I admit that I ended up skimming probably the last 50 pages or so of this book, so maybe that's why the ending seemed very quick and sort of non-sensical."
724.0	1.0	Didn't connect with this.
684.0	1.0	Sometimes a Mary Higgins Clark book can keep me on the edge of my seat - but not this book - it was just okay!!

668.0	3.0	There are some beautiful illustrations, and even some touching moments among the piles of cliches. Other than that, it is a rather pointless comicbook, as it neither offers anything new, nor the story is presented particularly well.
500.0	2.0	I do remember reading this as a child. I don't know if my edition is abridged but the ending seems quite abrupt. I much prefer Charlotte's Web...a true American Children's Classic.
618.0	4.0	"""There's a Nightmare in my Closet"" is a children's book from Mercer Mayer, author of the popular ""Little Critter"" books and it is about how a small boy overcomes his fear of a nightmare in his closet. ""There's a Nightmare in my Closet"" may be a cute story about conquering your fears, but the story is a bit dull for some children.   Mercer Mayer's illustrations are creative and colorful as he illustrates the nightmare as being extremely huge but seems to look a bit goofy as it has two big front teeth and has green polka dots against his pinkish skin. Also, Mercer Mayer gives the story a somewhat dreary atmosphere as the colors look a bit washed out and plain. Mercer Mayer does bring out a positive message for children about conquering your fears, which the boy does a great job at conquering his fear of the nightmare. I will not tell you what happens at the end, but the ending (well, let's just say the ending is very similar to the ending of ""Simon's Book"") is extremely cute and will easily reassure children to not be too scared of monsters.   Parents should know that the nightmare might scare smaller children since it is extremely big and ugly and parents should try to reassure their children that there are no nightmares in their closets. Also, the story seems a bit too weak as the characters seem a bit one-dimensional, meaning that you cannot relate to them easily since they do not have any personality that distinguishes them. Even though the nightmare is harmless, he rarely has any personality that can distinguish him, as the same with the boy, even though the audience knows that the boy is brave, but he seems to be lacking any emotion that makes him likeable.   ""There's a Nightmare in my Closet"" may be a cute story about how a boy conquers his fear over a nightmare, but since the story is a bit too weak and the characters do not seem to have much personality, some children might be easily bored with this book. I would strongly recommend Maurice Sendak's classic ""Where the Wild Things Are"" over this book because the characters are much more memorable and the illustrations are much more beautiful than in this book. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since smaller children might be frightened by the huge nightmare in the book."
656.0	1.0	I liked the other two books in this series, but not this one.
298.0	3.0	"I get a perverse pleasure out of the terrible-ness that is Dan Brown. This is an early one, and it shows. He had not yet learned how to use the ""little did he know"" trope, and his characters aren't as smug as the ones in later books. But I still enjoy yelling at him in absentia about the factual errors, and the race to the finish. There is better trashy suspense to be had, though."
765.0	1.0	We listened to this on the way to elko. It was pretty cheesy but it would be great for boys not quite ready for ya books.
348.0	2.0	1.5 stars? i don't wanna say i hated it? but i really really didn't like it. i kind of always knew manga wasn't for me, and this solidified that thought process. i only read it for the Get Graphic readathon. and i'm glad it's over.
346.0	2.0	"I don't understand how so many people got to like this book....   Ok, the plot is really nice, the general idea of the storyline is good and there are a few good moments and you can even find a few good quotes.. but that's it!   It explains too much things that you get to understand easily, and it describes too much things you don't really care about...   I'm used to authors like Stephen King and Maxime Chattam so this book was to ""light"" for me...   The really good point was I didn't spend much to buy it :)"
376.0	5.0	"Here is the winner of the poetry category of the 2016 goodreads awards. In itself a reason why I will never be able to trust the winners voted by our community.   I really tried to like this book.   I think a feminist poem collection aimed at younger women is a wonderful thing. Poems to inspire and empower them, to show them their emotions and thoughts are valid, to promote self-love , to make them feel that other women have shared similar experiences, that they are not alone.   Maybe this is the only saving grace of this collection for me. Sure I think Love Is A Dog From Hell may have a greater ""literary"" value compared to this one - a value that's measured in using the correct words, that has nihilistic notes throughout, that aces all patriarchal tests with Bukowski's thriving misogyny; but; fuck literary value. I am sick of measuring things with a system that was created to exclude them. A system that taught that good poetry is the one that alludes, that talks in metaphors and riddles so as to be all-encompassing and poetic (lol) in it's ambiguity.   So let us not judge this collection in those terms. Because it is above all that, and culturally speaking, even the fact that it exists, that it can exist, is a sociological miracle.   Let us talk about why it sucks.   Firstly I have to admit that it's difficult for me to call this poetry when it's just prose, witty tweets, separated into verses with the ""enter"" key. They read like mini motivational cards, meant to impress quickly, to captivate the new audience of the internet era with sentences where each word creates more tension and surprise, meant to retain our interest and keep us focused. Like a movie trailer. A trailer can be well made, and pleasing to watch, sure, but it's not a movie.   ""how many   funerals can   someone attend   before they turn   nineteen?   - the cursed family.""   What makes these poems bad for me, is the fact that even though they tell of personal situations, they don't feel real. The whole collection reeks of artificiality, like a bad modern imitation of the romantics, through a mall goth lens.   It also reads very young. Young enough that the poet draws analogies from fairytales to describe her life. As a concept I can also support the deconstruction of the tropes fairytales encourage, especially those that are harmful to girls and women; so again I can find some merit to this. However. The use of fairytales in this volume is not there to facilitate younger readers but because the poet truly still sees her life through the lens of fairytales. A toxic mother is a queen, a caring partner is a prince, the young protagonist is a princess. This ends up ruining whatever deconstruction could have ever been, and rather enforces and encourages a more simplistic, black and white, fairytale view of the world.   Another thing that really irks me are the titles of each piece. Printed in italics at the end of each poem, a pompous declaration of severe teen angst. Some really good poems were destroyed by those titles.   She even has a poem about a person who committed suicide in front of her, and the title is ""i never learned your name, but you mattered to me."" Like, really girl? Mattered HOW? Because you wrote a poem and were shaken for a week thinking of your own mortality and place in the world? Because it made you go home and write the brilliant verses of ""it is almost a rite of passage when someone jumps in front of your train""? This is ridiculously self-absorbed in a way they would make fun of in comedy sketches - and many of the poems suffer from the same traits.   Lets look at another gem, a poem that encapsulates all those awesome ""not like other girls because I read books and therefore am special""-memes we used to love as teens:   ""when i die,   do not   waste   a minute   mourning me.   i may go,   but i will   leave behind   all my   thousand & one   lives.   -a bookmad girl never dies.""   A fine thing to write on your personal journal, a nice thing to print on a postcard and send to your niece.   Definitely not the best poem collection of 2016.   ""he is   even better   than books.   -fiction has nothing on you.""   Seriously I think my biggest problem with this one may be all the creative typography of it all. Every time I stumble upon those god-damned titles in italics i want to scream.   ""his smile makes my bones ache.   - a pain i welcome.""   There's a poem printed in the shape of a leaf, a heart and so on. It's all very commercial, very poor, very trite.   ""is   there   such a   thing   as   dead   mother's day?""   They're not all hollow though, that's why I wrote the introduction to this review. There are some poems that are more, truer, that have a naivety that's not calculated.   Of course there's no shame in reading and liking this collection. It's wonderful if people manage to get something out of this, and I believe they have, seeing how it won first place after all.   But,   if   you like it   please   go read   Rupi Kaur,   or   something."

809.0	2.0	sometimes legit funny and charming but also boey often comes across as callous and homophobic
922.0	2.0	A series by the writer of Goosebumps, Mostly Ghostly, follows the adventures of Max as he tries to help two ghosts named Tara and Nicky. I picked up #1-8 at the bookstore this week for the kids at school who love Goosebumps and thought I would try one myself.
274.0	2.0	I love Patricia Polacco, but some of her picture books are really intended for a much older audience and I think this is one of those books. It is a love story that older readers would better understand.
959.0	1.0	Utterly, utterly crazy. But very pretty.
898.0	3.0	I wanted to like this book. I really, really did. I had heard so many good things and I love fantasy, so this book should have been right up my alley. But I couldn't get into it at all. The writing style for some reason bothered me...it was okay but I found she was unnecessarily descriptive in some sections. The plot moved so slowly. Now, normally this is FINE. I am actually a fan of slow moving books. HOWEVER, this only works if the characters are interesting. The characters in this book were not interesting. They were dull and boring and I honestly could not care less about them. Oh well.
170.0	1.0	This type of book just isn't my thing.
173.0	2.0	A little too cute for me. the original drawings are one centimeter square, which makes them very complex, given their size. I plan to give this to my 21 year old daughter for a laugh.
136.0	2.0	I generally like Manga...especially Manga set in Edwardian culture. But this seemed to miss the mark. It jumped into the middle of a fully developed world without any exposition or set up. It was like hearing an inside joke when you are out of the loop.
86.0	2.0	In general I like Neil Gaiman, and I've heard good things about the Sandman series, but this first volume didn't really click for me until the very last section. There's too much gore and general ickiness in a visual style I just don't care for and the story jumps around too much for me to actually like it, but I'm intrigued by Death, so I'll read one more volume before I decide whether to read the series or not.
41.0	2.0	Rating: 2.5 stars   This is the story of a young horse who gets separated from his band. Born wild he will be captured, tame and different people will try to control him. The story tries to tell us how the horse feels and how he interprets the world around him. It's not fantasy, don't worry, it's simple and quite appealing for animal lovers.   The story is well written and it's full of detailed descriptions, I think young readers can enjoy it given the short length and descriptive nature.   *** I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review. ***
66.0	3.0	There were several poems that stood out but I felt pretty so-so with the rest. While Lang Leav has a way with words, I unfortunately wasn't wowed. Don't get me wrong- I think her poetry is good but I had hoped for something more remarkable, something that felt deep and real. While Love & Misadventure makes for a nice, simple read, it doesn't satisfy the way truly exquisite poetry does.
240.0	3.0	For the time being, I'm abandoning this. I've read all but the last two collections, but am just not enjoying most of it. I came at it primarily not expecting 'poetry' per se, but rather insight into Kashmir and dealing with the situation there. There is a lot of that, but Ali's dominant style and approach simply don't appeal to me. I find it too often nebulous.
545.0	1.0	Wtf even was this book I'm actually annoyed at myself for not dnfing
968.0	3.0	"While the manga ""manual"" does give much-needed attention to the satisfaction of female sexual desire, it is still clearly written by a man for men. Makoto does deserve sympathy for his difficulties, but Yura's infinite patience is pretty unbelievable, given that even at the end of the second volume she's yet to experience the fulfillment that Makoto is quick to claim. The other characters are also pretty unbelievable in their almost maniacal focus on all things sexual, but one can put that aside when considering the story's intent. The comedy, just as in the first volume, was entertaining and the honest and predominantly open perspective of sex is refreshing. However, the superficial statistical clips from such 'credible' sources as Cosmopolitan are irritating, a distraction, and littered throughout the volume. Such arbitrary numbers and questions are hardly useful."
547.0	4.0	Thomas & Mercer and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of Orchids and Stone, in exchange for an honest review.   This book starts out with introducing the reader to Daphne Mayfield, a young woman who has faced two major tragedies in her life. Her sister was kidnapped as a child, never to be seen again, and her father committed suicide. Quitting college and becoming a roofer was not originally the plan for her life, but there was a certain kind of peace on top of a roof. Years later, Daphne comes across an elderly woman asking for help. Although those around her think she is making too much of the situation, Daphne feels the pull to get involved. Little does she know that the price of her involvement might be harmful to her health.   The author spent too much time in the beginning of this novel on the process in which Daphne becomes a roofer. As I usually try not to read the synopsis of the book first, as to not influence my interpretation of what I am reading, I was surprised to find that the book was not about a woman construction worker. I just could never get into the story and could not feel a connection to the characters. Orchids and Stone was a miss for me, but readers who like thrillers might enjoy it.
783.0	1.0	Didn't really care much for this book. I totally missed what made it so good. Uninspiring.
560.0	2.0	The whole thing just read like a series of set pieces with no focus on character but a few good quips. And having Natasha and Bobbi played as though they have jealousy for the other over Clint was ridiculous, I don't care how low-level it was played. It was trite and stupid. Also, I don't know who Dominic Fortune is, and this mini gave me no reason to care, so why he was even around, I don't know.
986.0	2.0	"** spoiler alert **   Slightly disappointed in this last book, where was the strong and brilliant Katniss? I understand she went through a LOT of horrible events but up to this book I did not find her weak! The ending was a bit abrupt for me too, I mean can Gale, her childhood friend who went through thick and thin with her, declaring his love for her etc, really abandon her just like that for a job in District 2 after the rebellion ended? Can her mum really just abandon her (again) because she couldn't cope with the deaths of the other members of her family!? Would her mum really abandon the only remaining relative she had?!?!   I thought the ending was rushed, everything being rounded off nicely-yes it was obvious Peeta and Katniss were to end up together but it was seriously downplayed in this book, especially with his brain washing...Collins set some foundations for some interesting developments to happen but then seem to have opted for the ""time heals all"" theory instead."
98.0	3.0	This book is lame. The story is weak, I want to slap the main character, and neither the writing nor the art is anywhere near good enough to make up for them.   But I read the whole thing, in one day.   Partly, this is a case of OCD-style literary masochism; I started this series, so I feel compelled to finish it.   But partly, it's the lure of fan fiction. I have had a crush on Jareth ever since I first saw the movie, lo these many years ago. This series is a way to spend some more time in a universe I adore, and with a character I might have given in to.   I must admit, the book is aimed at a much younger audience. It's entirely possible that it's a great read for a teen, especially a young teen. But I can't really say, because I can't really read it objectively - I'm too wrapped up in lusting after Jareth, trying to revisit how I felt when I first watched the movie. This is probably not very complementary to me, but there it is.
970.0	3.0	I wouldn't've finished this book, but I heard that the 4th book is an even bigger trainwreck and I'm eager to experience the next level of masochism.   It was turgid (and not in the fun way); it was excessively wordy. The characters' motivations made even less sense to me. But, like I said, I want to know what's going to happen in book 4, so I was willing to endure it in the hopes of getting the back-story.
218.0	2.0	"I read the ""Return to Ithaca"" portion in college. I just finished the middle portion that was in my Norton Anthology. Now the only part I've yet to read is the beginning Exposition. In any case, I feel more prepared now to watch ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" again. :)   I'm amazed at how people were people even way back then. Have we changed all that much?"
439.0	4.0	"I first encountered Eliot in 2014 while taking a course in Modernist British Literature. At the time, I only was required to read ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"", and I didn't like it (though the first few lines are pretty good). So I picked up this copy of Eliot's poetry as a way to continue reading outside of my comfort zone (though I would consider my comfort zone to be quite broad to begin with). I set the bar fairly low with this one, and didn't expect to particularly enjoy what I was reading.   And I was right.   Perhaps my preconceived notions of Eliot led me to dislike every single poem in this book. More than that, though, is that I found it nearly impossible to understand anything that I read in here without utilizing some outside source. Short of having encyclopedic knowledge (or literally being inside Eliot's brain), I find it difficult to understand how anyone can read his poetry without getting completely lost. As an example, the title poem ""The Waste Land"", which is considered by many to be Eliot's masterpiece, is completely indecipherable to me. The fact that nearly every line has some footnote connecting it to an outside reference is ridiculous. How can you possibly be expected to read this poem if you have to stop every couple of words in order to try to figure out what the hell Eliot is talking about.   Not only that, but the stream-of-consciousness style of many of these poems, jumping between multiple unnamed narrators and going back and forth with perspective makes just figuring out who is talking, or at what time they are talking, damn near impossible. For every single poem in this book, I had to go on Google and look up a summary or analysis, because most of the time, when I got to the end of even the shortest of the poems, I had no idea what I had just read. Even with reading some of them a few times, I still had a hard time seeing how the literary analysts managed to piece together the nonsensical ramblings of Eliot.   In short, I give this book a solid 0/10. Would not recommend."
347.0	1.0	DNF - The writing just didn't do it for me. The photography, however, was beautiful. I enjoyed the composition and lighting in many of the shots featured.
138.0	3.0	Hmm. This book was a tough one. I mean, haunted dolls possessing children? That is what I am all about. I wasn't looking for anything more than a quick read with maybe some fun spooks, but...meh. It was very uneven and seemed unfocused at times. I could have done without the whole romance subplot as it seemed very tacked on, and would have preferred the focus on her friendship with Megan. The pacing was off, but it was a quick read. 2/5 seems like a good rating from my perspective.
576.0	2.0	I still haven't seen the movie that was based on this, but I've absorbed rather a lot through fannish osmosis. I was surprised at how different the book was on some major points, but rather than go too deeply into that and risk spoiling people on either, I'll just say: this is an interesting, but slight, looked at a bunch of fucked up, dried up, punk rockers. It's written in verse and in other scraps--journal entries, interview bits, photographs--which is cool because it's different, but it does prevent Turner from being able to delve too deeply into any of the characters, their motivations, or even specifically what's happening. By which I don't mean it's confusing--not at all--it's just shallow, a passing glimpse. I think the film must go deeper, and I'm really itching to see it now. Plus, Callum. *eg*
335.0	3.0	I received this book in return for an honest review. This will not effect my opinion.   Recipe for this book:   A package of A Court Of Thorns And Roses   Two teaspoons of Fallen   Three tablespoons of Uprooted   A liter of The Graces   And a pinch of city of bones.   Add some Cinderella for extra if needed.   Leave on the shelf for a few weeks and then you get this book.   I really had to push myself trough this book and somehow I managed to finish it. It is not that I hated the book, but I also didn't like it. Trough out the book I had seconds I really lost my attention to anything else. Specially because I kept feeling like I was reading something I had been reading before.   I also kept losing my attention because while I was reading it felt like there were pieces missing in the book. It felt like the writer wrote pieces and then tried to stick them together somehow, but forgot the pieces between that was missing. The pieces that were complete felt a bit rushed.   In the story it felt like the characters were just going to things and places without a clear explanation. I kept asking myself why they kept leaving and only traveling. Also the characters were a bit predictable here and there.   I wonder what the second book would bring. But I somehow have a feeling I would already know. Is it worth it to pick up the second book? I truly don't know. Maybe one day I could pick up the book again and maybe like it then...   But for now i am going to give it a 2/5 because there were pieces i did enjoy.
940.0	3.0	"So the problem with attempting to write a review of this book is that I really, strongly, actively dislike Brian Wood -- as a writer, as a professional, as a person. I find his comics to be one-note, angsty, dour, and narratively flat -- they're serious without being especially thoughtful, gloomy without being particularly vulnerable or incisive. I feel like Brian Wood has the internet open on one side of his desk and he's reading news articles about bad shit to get himself amped, and on the other side he has journals of ideas leftover from highschool, and that's what you get from him: shrill, vague, condescending mansplainy screeds about life and shit or whatever.   Brian Wood is the guy who's too jaded to be happy about the fact that he's written frigging Star Wars, who decided he was the just the straight-white-male for the job to write an all-girl X-Men comic, and whose creator-owned books seem designed to just kind of make you feel bad about not reading as many news articles on the internet as he does. Brian Wood is a guilt processor; he's channeling the burden of his privilege into comics designed mostly to make himself feel superior, without actually thinking too hard on what the hell he's talking about, on what makes good stories, on what makes believable characters and relatable worlds.   His comics are neither good at being fun nor at being smart, and I feel like you gotta be one of the two, fireals.   I read Demo so people would stop telling me to read Demo. I'm giving it two stars. There were times when Wood captured pretty believable teen dialogue, but none of the stories had enough of a point for that to pay off. It's like he went and read Ghost World and Sleepwalk and Other Stories, and figured out how to duplicate their plot structures but not their atmospheres. It's like he suddenly had this idea that superhero origin stories are really about the difficulty and isolation of growing up, and it didn't occur to him that everyone KNOWS that already because everyone who reads comics is alive, and then he took this incredibly obvious idea and decided to make sad superhero stories in which flatly-rendered characters do little-to-nothing in thinly-constructed worlds, and also a lot of bad monologues about how teenagers and twentysomethings suck at relationships, because duh.   Also the last chapter is written in free-verse poetry and is occasionally in French. Because it's deep and shit, okay? Because OMG I CAN'T EVEN BRIAN WOOD, YOU ARE A FRIGGING ADULT DUDE WHAT THE HELL.   But see? This isn't fair. Because I like sad superhero stories, and plotless superhero stories, and I get a kick out of grand, sweeping creative failures. So this isn't fair, really, because the main point is that I just don't like Brian Wood.   I also don't particularly groove on Becky Cloonan, but that's just because every cool thing I've seen her draw and thought, ""Oh, that's why people dig her!"" has been proven to be a direct swipe from someone else's style. I don't know if Demo is either the most egregious example of this, or if she's purposely working with homage -- all I know is that when JH Williams draws in someone else's style, that person is listed in the credits right alongside him, and nowhere here did I see any mention of Paul Pope, Bryan Lee O'Malley, or the grab bag of manga artists that show up in these pages.   But I don't know much about Becky Cloonan, and she seems like a person that other comics people like, so I'm willing to be wrong in my conception of her abilities. Brian Wood's scumminess is a little better-documented, and while most people let that exist separately from his body of work, I just sort of can't. Not for someone whose ethics are so heavily inscribed into what he writes, and then flagrantly disregarded in real life.   But none of that is the point, really. The point is that I didn't enjoy this book, but it doesn't mean you won't. If you want it, you can take my copy. I don't plan on reading it again."
160.0	2.0	the anime is much better. i think the manga is pretty much a waste of time.
748.0	1.0	the examples on the crossout poets were good but this book gives exercises youre not a gym
288.0	4.0	This is quite possibly the worse edition I've come across in this collection so far. It is simply terrible. I would avoid this completely if you're thinking about giving the poet a try. The Divine Comedy is hard to follow at the best of times and this edition makes it even worse. I've started reading the full work no less than six times over the past year, and each time I've had to go back to the beginning out of confusion. I was due another reattempt, so I thought I'd give this edition a try; it was a big mistake.   In here are, what is quite frankly, some random cantos form the Inferno; thus it is quite difficult to retain any sense of the story. They're random and, when isolated, are difficult to conceptualise. I think this edition is rather pointless. When I do manage to get through the work, it will be the full work. I couldn't imagine that this would be of use to anyone; it is a poor representation of his work, and to make matters worse it sacrifices the beauty of it. Dante uses his own, unique, three line stanzas, which, on their own, are a true feat of poetry. They're quite complex. In this edition the publishers have merely separated the stanzas with a little indent. This, for me, makes for some very poor reading and destroys part of the poem.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If you, like me, want to read some of Dante's writings, then I should suggest trying his full works.   Penguin Little Black Classic- 25   The Little Black Classic Collection by penguin looks like it contains lots of hidden gems. I couldn't help it; they looked so good that I went and bought them all. I shall post a short review after reading each one. No doubt it will take me several months to get through all of them! Hopefully I will find some classic authors, from across the ages, that I may not have come across had I not bought this collection.
411.0	4.0	"Okay huge disclaimer here: I read an advanced reader's copy of I Am Princess X and it did not have any of the illustrations in it (which was pointless, but what can you do?). So, I'm judging this book solely on May's storyline and not on Princess X's storyline since little snippets aren't enough to get a feel for that whole plot point.   Disclaimer number 2: This book is NOTHING like Sarah Dessen's novels...not even if you turn your head and squint. So, if that's the main reason you're picking up I Am Princess X (like it was for me), then you might want to steer clear of this book.   Now, I don't give 1 star ratings lightly. In fact, I always feel incredibly guilty about giving out 1 star ratings that I tend to just up it to two stars. However, I just couldn't find anything to like about I Am Princess X. I found it all to be a big, jumbled mess. But most of all, I found it to be way too inconsistent to find it in any way enjoyable...or rather May was incredibly inconsistent. One thing (and granted, this one is a minor thing), that bothered me was that she's a teenager...and with that mentality, she should be somewhat tech-savvy. Or at least savvy enough to know that if your frigging computer won't turn on and you think your battery is fried, how 'bout you leave it on the charger and see if it, oh I don't know, actually CHARGES? Common sense! I get that the whole point of that was so that May could meet Trick and get the whole Princess X investigation going, but really? She couldn't have gotten an actual computer virus or something more difficult to solve than ""My computer won't turn on because I'm an idiot who hasn't charged it?"" And another thing: Princess X is supposed to be this whole huge phenomenon that's all over the internet and you're telling me that May, who mentions she has numerous social media accounts, has no clue that something this huge exists? Uh, no. I call BS. Again, May wasn't the brightest bulb. Because the one thing you should worry about when you're trying to find your BFF and numerous people are being threatened and being hurt is what your hair looks like when you accidentally get on TV. May, you're shallow...sit down. And the amount of times the word ""dude"" was used in this book aggravated me...I think I now hate that word more than I hate ""bae"" (and I LOATHE bae). Oh, and you can also find news reports of crimes that have happened YEARS ago without having to resort to printing out newspapers in the library. So May's dad, you sit down, too.   I also wasn't enamored by the writing in I Am Princess X. It seemed stilted and forced. I found myself thinking that maybe I would have liked it better had it been told in the first person narrative (especially since May's supposed to be this great writer) or maybe it would've actually made me dislike May (instead of just thinking of her as ridiculous). Princess X (I no longer feel like writing the full title) was also a whole bunch of telling. This wasn't a story that peaked my imagination and made me actually see the events happening in my mind. I don't like flowery, purple prose, but a little descriptive writing doesn't hurt anybody and can be good for the soul. But there were no descriptions here. I was also told every little mind-numbingly boring thing May and Trick did. May walked to get a Coke out of a can...Trick and May walked to get coffee because May likes coffee with chocolate in it because it doesn't taste like coffee...is that coffee going to sprout a human with a katana sword and stab somebody? No? Then, okay, it's not important, so get back to the actual plot. May also didn't pick up one of her father's calls because she knew her voice would sound like mud when she did...what exactly does mud sound like? Really, I want to know. Princess X also had paper-thin development...plot-wise, character-wise, everything-wise.   I'm just going to stop here to avoid giving away any spoilers. I will say that I didn't like I Am Princess X. The mystery behind the whole thing could have been slightly interesting, but it wasn't. I didn't like the writing (but the author's written over a dozen novels so clearly other people do) or the resolution of the plot...or the plot itself (despite the fact that it sounded interesting). I say, skip it. (Or maybe check it out and tell me if the illustrations make the story better)."
626.0	1.0	Hated this one even more than the first. Stunningly terrible.
333.0	3.0	2.5 stars   Very mixed feelings. I knew it was a very hyped book and I am a bit disappointed. I was searching for a book to start reading poetry and for that it was a good place to start because they are really easy to understand and they are short. But that the thing, most of the time they aren't short, it's not even two sentences. And like many already said, I have the feeling that they are more quotes than poetry. Again I'm no expert in poetry, if modern poetry is like this it may not be for me. However the topics were tough and if I consider them as quotes they are nice, and I really liked some of them.
890.0	1.0	The start of a new arc , not much of a plot points but like i said before , i believe in Dan Abnett , i loved his previous arc and i think i will love the new one .
908.0	3.0	This is a very light book about an ancient prehistoric shark. As enjoyable as some of the interactions between the characters are to read, it's not very well written and many of the motifs and set-ups are paper thin because the Author wanted them to be so. I read as far as the surfers and suddenly realised that I didn't view any of the characters as characters but rather set pieces. It's a shame because the elements of the novel that are purely about the shark, I really enjoy. It just doesn't make up for the fact that the characters are flat and are only there to serve a purpose to the author, which is all-too frequently to just make the main character look utterly boss. A quick, light read but not a great example of a scary book or even a thriller.
823.0	3.0	"RAGEY SPOILERS.   I'm going to go ahead and assume this book didn't exist. It's not part of canon. There is literally no reason for it to exist. It did not bring anything to the series except for MAYBE a plot point with the Garatron.   This book was obviously written by a ghost writer who was handed a bullet form list of traits for each character and winged it. I can't imagine how K.A. Applegate EVER approved this to get published. Rachel was the worst (AND I WILL GET TO RACHEL) but EVERYONE felt like a complete caricature of themselves. EVERYONE sounded forced.   BUT RACHEL. WAS. THE. GOD. DAMNED. WORST!   RACHEL is one of the fucking most amazing goddamn characters I have ever read and this book reduced her to a power hungry, reckless, idiotic horrible person who didn't care about her FRIENDS, didn't care about HUMANS didn't care about ANYTHING except POWER and WINNING. I'm sorry but fuuuuck youuuu for reducing Rachel to that because she is so much more than that I can't even begin to describe it.   Jake is out of town and a number of Animorphs opportunities present themselves. I think at this point it's a bit silly for them to have not thought up a game plan for when one of them (especially Jake) is out of town; no one really knew what to do. I agree with Rachel; they should continue carrying out missions when possible even if Jake isn't there, but because they hadn't discussed it, it left everyone in an awkward position.   Rachel obviously wanted control, but not in a responsible way - she wanted control because SHE wanted to be IN CONTROL, and it was completely at the expense of everyone else's ideas and decisions. When Jake is the leader he ultimately makes the decisions but he LISTENS to everyone and ""Rachel"" in this book didn't do that once. She was absolutely obsessed with succeeding at any cost. She was SOOOOO fucking conceited in every mission, assuming everything would be perfect even though, hi, it's been 37 fucking books and you STILL haven't killed the Visser so I don't know where you're going thinking it's going to be a piece of cake to take him out this time.   This whole book Rachel was just portrayed as awful.   ""Yeah, well, we didn't have the mighty Warrior Princess in charge before,"" Marco said.   I heard the tone of sarcasm. But I didn't care. That's right, I thought. I am in charge, and now the Yeerks are going to pay. Jake would be proud of me when he got back. Or maybe a little jealous. Maybe even a lot jealous. That was okay, too. Things changed. People changed. Situations changed. Jake had been the leader for a long time. Maybe it was time he took a well-deserved rest.(p. 50)   WHO IS THIS????? THIS ISN'T RACHEL!!!!!   I was pumped! Psyched! That was my plan and I was in charge, and we were kicking butt in the spectacular way I knew we would. Hard to believe I'd ever doubted myself, even for a moment. Hard to believe that even for a minute I'd questioned my ability to rule, lead, direct. Make tough decisions in the depths of crisis. Exploit my soldiers' particular talents. I was made to be leader! Hero, warrior, king. I'd known that all along. Character is destiny... (p. 46)   THIS IS SERIOUSLY JUST EVIL RACHEL FROM THE SHITTY STARFISH BOOK (+deg#deg)+( +-+   Rachel: [We all go in as polar bears!] [...]   Marco: ""I don't see anything wrong with our battle morphs"" [...]   Cassie: ""He's got a point, Rachel. We know our morphs. They've been working for us all day. We handle them best."" [...]   Rachel: ""We're going for mass here, people,"" I said, pushing down the defensiveness I knew was creeping into my voice. They were still arguing with me! [...] I knew I was right. I knew it. (p. 68-9)   RACHEL WOULD NOT DO THIS. SHE IS NOT A TERRIBLE FRIEND.   this book is dead to me."
925.0	3.0	I am not sure why I wanted to read this. It was a little weird story about guys who make flying wings and risk death and maybe sometimes die? There was some element of mystery to that? The four panel page style with each panel drawn as its own work of art, it felt, left the book without a smooth flow that maybe would have helped me understand it. Alas! The dudes in this book looked cool with their bug eyes and lumpy faces, but I felt like, in the end, they didn't really end up doing too much.
978.0	2.0	"The rating is just for the use of images: I am researching the theory and history of books written with images. (writingwithimages.com)   ""Citizen"" raises different issues. (The review is elsewhere on this site.) In ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely"" the use of images seems mnemonic, evidentiary, decorative, offhanded, generic, unformatted, and therefore almost always uninteresting. In order:   1. Mnemonic: the many images of people Rankine describes, such as Abner Louima, Johnny Cochrane, Amadou Diallo (pp. 56-57), are given as reminders.   2. Evidentiary: those images are also evidentiary, in that they point toward the fact that Rankine's entire narrative is about real politics, real history, and -- by implication -- her real reactions. But ""evidentiary"" might be better applied to photographs that indicate the narrative is telling a true story, for example the mammogram with the lump on p. 8.   (The mismatch between the ferocity of the text and what I think of as the marginalized use of images is echoed, incidentally, in the mismatch between the book's very extensive ""Notes"" section, which describes most of the book's references at length, and the book's very short ""Images"" section, which is less than a full page. The cases of Louima, Diallo, and others are documented in ""Notes,"" but often the ""Images"" file just says ""(c) John Lucas,"" as if there is nothing more to be asked or known about the photographs.)   3. Decorative: this seems an adequate description of some illustrations, such as the still of ""The Wild Bunch"" on p. 25, which doesn't illustrate the points made in the text.   4. Offhanded: for example the drawings of lips speaking on p. 40, which looks tossed-off, as if Rankine had decided she wanted an image, but not what she wanted out of the image.   5. Generic: for example the Google search bar on p. 72: it accompanies a very specific idea of what might be searched, so its generic nature isn't pertinent -- it's not clear why a reader wants to be reminded of the general idea of a Google search.   6. Unformatted: most of the images in this book seem carelessly placed on the page. Why does the text wrap around the image on p. 82, but not on p. 83? Why are the images narrower than the margins in most cases, but not in all? Why not decide those issues, especially if they might be distracting?   This list could easily be extended. But there points are all symptoms: Rankine cares desperately for her subject matter, and for her images are ornaments, additions, extras, and bits of evidence. They are rarely objects of thought. The narrative rarely needs them, rarely knows what might be done with them. They never guide the narrative. They are almost, but not quite, outside the text's imagination.   (Still there are a few interesting uses of images in the book. I especially appreciate the repetition of the chalkboard marked ""THIS IS THE MOST MISERABLE IN MY LIFE,"" repeated four ties on pp. 17-18, accompanying a narrative about a disastrous change in the person who wrote it.)"
681.0	3.0	"It's pure fantasy. A fairytale. So completely unrealistic. The things I would have been up to being a 17 year old in Paris with access to alcohol and no rules. Yes I know stories don't have to be realistic to be enjoyable. When I was a teen I most likely would have liked this book, but I am not a teen anymore. This really is audience targeted because I just don't know how it has such rave reviews. Anna must be the lamest teen girl in the world and stupid to boot. Not once was she likeable or endearing. If I was any of those students I would have grown tired of her fast. Teens are so much smarter than this right? I know some must be because even as a teen I don't think I would be as naive or insecure as Anna. Also WTH, kind of appeal does the St. Clair have because I didn't buy it. It was too superficial and even teen girls would get over that mess fast. It was a small school so the student body must have been pretty intimate.   ""My father is fluent in cliche. Obviously, you've never read one of his novels."" Oh Stephanie. It was an adorable, cute little story which is fine, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone ."
106.0	4.0	I found it really disturbing when I made a choice that resulted in my death the first time through. I mean, even at age 11 I knew that in real life you can sometimes make a choice that results in your own death, but it had never happened to me before, and I preferred not to think about it.   It kind of haunted me even after I went back and made a different choice, because I understood that if this had been real life, I would be dead.   Somehow, the Choose Your Own Adventure books disrupted the protective promise of the novel which is this: no matter what happens in the book, it can't hurt you, you're going to be okay.   Because of this truth, I let novels take me into some scary places, and in this way, novels sheperded me through some pretty traumatic experiences unscathed, which educated me about some truths which thankfully I didn't have to experience - like losing a family member, or being lost in the wilderness, or living in Russia under Lenin (actually, I don't feel this way about Animal Farm, though, since it was based on real life and that sh*t is disturbing).   In a way, this series proves that interactive activities are not always better for learning. Unless you mean learning about scuba diving, because I will always remember not to surface too soon without decompressing. If you do, you die.   Amy

966.0	3.0	This is a cute story about a four-year-old girl who compares how she is now to when she was a baby. I used it for a growing up/big and small-themed program for both Spanish and bilingual story times. I did feel that the pictures were too busy for a story time setting, which is why I rated it as two stars. In general, I'd give it three stars.

Even if we excuse the fact that it is a first time writer and co., still a little much 1940s in this comic, I mean all the crazy ""-isms"" come into play here--I mean damn!

355.0	3.0	"I loved these kinds of books as a kid. I think I even remember where they were on the shelf of the old Cambrian Library that has since been rebuilt. I read it through a few times, changing my choices each time. I got annoyed after finding the second page forwarding error and yet plugged along trying to imagine my 7-10 year old self getting excited with deciding the fate of the characters, weighing the pros and cons of each decision. I was left wanting a more complete story with better illustrations. I just couldn't find enough in this title to justify ordering it for the store. For now I'll be directing customers to their local library even though they would probably still buy any book from the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" series. We'll see if the other one I borrowed from the Los Gatos Library is any better."
205.0	2.0	Beautiful pictures with poetic text which will trip a tongue.
387.0	2.0	The title says it all. It's a quirky, sparse story that's truly more about the journey than anything else. There's some whimsy to enjoy, but otherwise I wasn't enthralled.
703.0	2.0	Even though I'm an adult reading this children's book for the first time I just didn't think it went deep enough into what Elidor was, what was happening there etc   This book has the potential to be brilliant but fails miserably
521.0	2.0	Over the course of several years along the interstate 90 corridor young girls are taken.   This story chronicles the development of a serial killer and his kills and of the investigation into those kills.
637.0	1.0	I feel so bad I really did not care for this book. It had such great reviews but I was not feeling it.
175.0	4.0	"Originally reviewed at http://www.shaelit.com/2015/03/review...   I usually steer clear of suicide books because they're just not for me. However, this one had black holes in the title, so I was sucked in against my will. (Ha! Black hole. Sucked in.) My verdict? -\_(tsu)_/-   On the one hand, this book does a pretty fantastic job of laying out what depression really feels like. I say this as someone who gets the basic idea from reading Hyperbole and a Half, so disclaimers all around, but still. It seemed accurate to me. Aysel is depressed. Detachment, apathy, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, it's all there. She's determined to kill herself and uses the suicide website Smooth Passages to find a partner to help her go through with it. That's where Roman comes in, another depressed kid looking for a way out. Interestingly (accurately), both teens appear to improve as they near their chosen date, as they're buoyed by a sense of purpose. I liked the accuracy.   But OH GOSH, their families. I'll be honest, I didn't care much about Aysel or Roman. They were fine, but I couldn't connect with their struggles. Yes, the actual depression was realistic and well-written, but their reasons? Aysel's dad killed a kid in broad daylight and now she's known as the crazy guy's daughter. Could someone relate? Yeah, I guess? But sometimes people are just depressed because their neurochemistry is out of whack, and that would've been far more relatable. But THEIR FAMILIES. Whether you care about Aysel and Roman or not, their families will get you, especially Aysel's brother Mikey and Roman's mom. Telling a person they need to stick around for another person usually doesn't work, I know, but I wanted to shake those kids. They knew how much their loss would hurt their families, and yet they didn't care.   And... that's about all I've got. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked Tyler Bowen as much as I did. I was less surprised (but wearily disappointed) that the plot drifted toward a ""saved by love"" resolution, even if it didn't go all the way. There were some description quirks that irritated me (""silent"" humming and Aysel hearing a whisper that would be physically impossible to hear), but nothing outlandish. Ho hum, Shae is done.   Favorite Non-Spoilery Quotes:   My teacher, Mrs. Marks, makes this big production out of trying to decode what the poets were trying to say. From my perspective, it's pretty clear what they were saying: I'm depressed and I want to die. It's painful to watch all my classmates tear apart each line, looking for the significance/ There's no significance. Anyone who has actually been that sad can tell you that there's nothing beautiful or literary or mysterious about depression.   ---   With my dad, you always had to tread lightly, like you were walking on icy pavement-it was so fun when you were gliding, but it was very easy to slip.   Points Added For: The acknowledgement of various Southern accents, Tyler Bowen, Mikey, Roman's mom, some genuinely beautiful lines, the acknowledgement that depression is a war instead of one battle.   Points Subtracted For: Aysel's prejudice against cheerleaders, the hint that Aysel and Roman can save each other, failing to make me care, a cover design that doesn't really make sense (Aysel doesn't cross-stitch.)   Good For Fans Of: Depression books, suicide stories.   Notes For Parents: Language, sex (off-page, in the past), death, underage drinking, kissing, suicidal thoughts/acts.   Note: I received a review copy of this title from the publisher for review consideration."
471.0	1.0	Amazing bird photography which I would have loved to see in a book with some of the bird facts at the end of this book rather than the poem which accompanied the photos. If the two year olds I read the book to are any indication, the poem is definitely more appealing to adults than children.
826.0	2.0	All the Stone Barrington novels are the same. Stone's latest lady friend has an obsessive ex husband that is after Stone when he is viewed as her protector. In all these novels it's the same theme, he gets involved with someone, spends tons of money, drinks a lot of bourbon, protects her then the relationship ends. It's getting quite boring.
222.0	2.0	I found the humor and imagination in this less original than that in the Captain Underpants series. More little boy gross out...so of course Jackson really liked it.
604.0	2.0	It's a good lil read over all, like a reunion of sorts, but the same ol' same ol' thing - the love triangle of Joe and Stephanie tempted with Ranger. Crazy bail jumpers, murder to boot and Stephanie caught in the middle. I still enjoyed the story but I'm tired of the character development never really growing or moving forward. Nothing ever completely settled with Joe and Ranger and here we are at book 21? The comedic relief of the family (Love Grandma!) and Lula still abound. I maybe done at this point on the Plum train... oh well.
38.0	3.0	I disliked the negative tone of the poems. Each seemed to dwell on the bad qualities of the presidents, the mistakes they made, even popular presidents like Lincoln and Kennedy weren't given the shining spotlight they usually receive.   As for the content of the poems I feel like readers have to be well read in American history because the poems mention specific legislation or take on a back and forth conversational approach and serves to confuse more than inform the reader. The art in the poetry is dependent on a strong knowledge of history; I believe that using the artform to inform readers who don't know much about the history is a much better approach for a juvenile audience.   Illustrations were decent, though ripe with emotion. The spread for Kennedy/Johnson, for example, is predominately blue which invokes a great sadness in readers.   I was really excited to read this book initially, but the negative take on the presidencies turned me off. In my opinion, The President's Stuck in the Bathtub by Susan Katz much more appropriately achieves its goal to entertain and inform for a juvenile audience.
832.0	4.0	This book is more like a series of stories spanning a year at Oddfellow's Orphanage. Delia is probably as main a character as you're going to get, as she is the newest arrival at the orphanage.   I didn't really like this book. To me, there wasn't much point to the stories. They were cute, but very simple and not tied together that well. At the start, I expected it to be a kids version of Miss Pergrine's Home for Peculiar Children, but it wasn't. There wasn't enough backstory to explain why the children were special. For instance, why is there a talking hedgehog? Why does one boy have an onion for a head? Why can't Delia speak? These questions are pretty obvious, but an answer isn't even hinted at in the pages of the book. It's a quick read, but I found it disapointing.
8.0	2.0	i read HOWL   loved it   there are so many reasons that ginsberg is so incredibly well respected, but the epitome would be the work itself   i make a promise with myself to read more
133.0	3.0	You know what is super dumb? I will tell you: Falling in love with a boy you met at a party last night. Then trusting him blindly. Especially after he repeatedly starts apologizing to you for something that hasn't happened yet. Yep, super dumb.   This was also inexplicably violent. Some douchebro in class is taunting Mia and she smashes his face with a textbook. What is that even?? I scratch my head.
258.0	4.0	I had high hopes for this book, the blurb made it sound interesting, so when I finally decided to read it, I was expecting to be whisked away in to another world filled with crime and murder and a little romance. Instead, I found myself struggling to get through the first couple of chapters, it was almost as if the writer was repeating the same scenes over and over again, just a different day and a different bar.   I must day that I am disappointed in the novel quite a bit, I am sure that others greatly enjoyed it, but for me I never. I found that it had only started to really start becoming enjoyable for me was around chapter twenty two to chapter twenty three, with only twenty seven chapters within the book itself, it was a large disappointment.   The writing wasn't terrible, better than a lot of other books I have read, so it wasn't too hard to get in to it near the end. There was many times at the beginning that I just wanted to put the book down and not pick it up again, but because I'm stubborn and don't like not finishing things, I pushed through it.   Sadly, it's a novel that I won't be keeping on my bookshelves, so I will be passing it on to my local charity store in hopes that someone else will get some enjoyment out of it.

769.0	2.0	If you've watched or read pretty much any amoral-giants-and-the-people-who-fight-them-style Japanese fiction, from Ultraman to Evangelion, there is exactly no reason to read this book. Even the artwork is mediocre, in my opinion.
317.0	3.0	"I was completely underwhelmed by this. I liked the concept and the layout, but it sort of just felt like reading some writings about love on an internet message board. There were a few strong pieces, and the really succint ones often proved most powerful. Ultimately, though, the ""beginning,"" ""middle,"" and ""end"" sections weren't all that different from one another.   The ""end"" section was probably my favorite, only because I think there's something so raw and powerful about heartbreak. There's the pain of the end, and the bittersweet feeling of remembering the things that were good.   This was a quick read, it just didn't come with the emotion I had hoped it would. Not for me, at least."
78.0	1.0	book one - and will not read the next 2. I could have been a good story, but maybe an editor should have been more active here.
833.0	1.0	It was ok but mostly predictable
313.0	2.0	A little too much goes on here for it to be a straightforwardly good Black Stallion book. Farley was not afraid of over-reaching, which is certainly fun but does cause some eye-rollingly bad scenes. Secret passages? We got 'em! Kidnapping? Yup. Unknown location? Sure. Ghostly horses in the middle of the night? Check.   There's some misogynistic stuff in here that seems reflexive rather than thought-out. Not one of my favorites, for sure.
48.0	2.0	Creepy gothic novel, but ultimately unsatisfying.
217.0	3.0	"Rating a Kasie West book 2 stars makes me sad, but   On the Fence   felt incomplete to me. (Or maybe not incomplete, but I can't find a better word right now.) It had good scenes, and I did read this in a couple of hours - just like any other Kasie West book I've read in the past - but this lacked something the other books had. I couldn't find myself anticipating the ending, because the conflict of the book didn't seem important to me. It didn't make me anxious, and it didn't make me giddy, and it also didn't make me go ""aww"". It was well-written, just like Kasie's other books, but the story was just ""eh""."
128.0	3.0	"This starts in the 1930s, then follows Doc (sustained by an anti-aging formula) into the 21st century as he keeps adapting his methods of world-saving, only to find the bad guys adapting just as often. I have no problem with radical takes on Doc (Mike Barr's DC run or Millenium's excellent, short-lived series) but this just doesn't work. It lacks the pulp thrills that both those early efforts had (the bad guys are all colorless), but it never explores its own premise well enough--when people learn about Doc's Crime College (where he uses surgery to ""cure"" and reform criminals) there's a lot of outrage but I'd have liked some serious debate about it (if you're going to do a ""serious"" take, plunge in all the way, guys!). Ultimately unsuccessful."
305.0	1.0	The artwork is very fun and fits the poems, but the poetry is lackluster.
60.0	2.0	A little dissapointing, but still a good read. It started out really slow and I was able to predict the ending by the middle, but the ending was still really well written and entertaining so I'll still be reading the rest of the series.
920.0	3.0	It looks promising, but it turned out different. The pacing was absolutely awful, the characters felt incredibly flat (AUDREY WAS THE WORST ugh), i dont feel a connection with the them, and the plot was blah. This whole book was cringeworthy and I wanted it to end. Please don't get me wrong; I respect the Lang's work, but she could have dealt a little better with the story line and character development. End of story.
646.0	1.0	This was pretty weak for an R.L. Stine book. The main character was totally unlikable, and never redeems himself. You think he's going to at some point, but he really doesn't.
845.0	1.0	If it has one star I liked it a lot   If it has two stars I liked it a lot and would recommend it   If it has three stars I really really liked it a lot   If it has four stars I insist you read it   If it has five stars it was life changing
328.0	2.0	Super fast read!   While the idea of this poetry collection seems special and somewhat audacious, I found most of the twenty-five poems to be rather forced and nonsensical. How is it possible for someone to write something as beautiful as 'I wrote this for you' and still manages to write something as nonsensical as this one! ... Disappointed!   Btw ..NSA means 'No Strings Attached'
589.0	2.0	I was originally excited for a new Bosch novel, but this one needed more. I read through most of the book and the foreshadows were predictable and not very exciting. There was one chapter of action and that was breaking a chain fence. I am beginning to wonder if Bosch has seen his final days and this is just his decline into nothingness. I hoped for better, but all I got was mediocre.
691.0	4.0	So I had to read this for my Modernist Women Writers class and we've already read Three Lives last week and discussed it and now we're going to discuss Tender Buttons so I might change this review if that classroom discussion can somehow save this book for me. I honestly highly doubt that though. Three Lives made me want to jump out of a window. All the repetition, and repetition, repetition, and some more repetition. If you couldn't handle that sentence whatever you do, do not read this book. It was mind numbing. Three Lives definitely made me feel like Stein was saying the only way for women to not suffer is to die. It's the end of the semester, I'm already battling depression like come on. The Good Anna was probably the favorite of the stories. Melanctha and Jeff Campbell's whole relationship was painful to read. Everything is spinning and being repeated and nothing make sense. That brings me to Tender Buttons, I don't even like poetry that means something and I have no clue what even happened with that one. Stein's whole thing reminds me of the idea of women's writing. Cixous is the one that really pushed for it, and she said that women's writing should break all regular literary standards because they're patriarchal. Here's the thing though with oral tradition women told stories that made sense. It's human nature to want a story that makes sense and doesn't feel like your fingernails are being ripped out reading it. You can fight the patriarchy with normal sentences. You don't need to terrorize people with the structure of your writing to get your point across. End rant.
404.0	2.0	I wanted to enjoy this, but couldn't get past the first few pages. Poor editing, dangling participles, and way too much telling (vs. showing). I was so distracted by poor writing that I couldn't get into it. (But thank you, Net galley, for the chance to try.)
962.0	1.0	The good poems were the translations. I have had such an unexpected visceral reaction to this collection. I expected so much more. I felt like I was reading work from a beginner's poetry workshop at the local community center.
664.0	2.0	Didn't like it. Well at the beginning it had something charming. But towards the end it was just a story of a bunch of disturbed little criminals . I struggled hard to finish it just to be sure I did tried to be objective.
536.0	2.0	I hated this book. I think that Frank was just about the most irritating bitchy character I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. TERRIBLE.
228.0	1.0	I am not a fan of her poetry really.
461.0	1.0	Typical Magic Castle Reader.
528.0	3.0	Every time I have to put this book under this category (the bad), I want to cry. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU. It was probably the biggest 2016 disappointment for me yet this year. I'm so sad. I mean, f/f fantasy? How could that have ever possibly gone wrong? The writing was very meh; the characters were likable but not much more than that? The romance could've used more development for me. And dear god, this book was predictable. #soboring   Rating: 2.5 Paw Prints!
711.0	2.0	I loved the premise and I felt the book had lots of potential but the writing was sloppy, nothing happened (apart from ridiculous things to the MS, I mean MC). It was too focused on the romance over the actual, you know, story.   I finished the book with absolutely no desire to read the next one in the series.
645.0	3.0	This was a sad little gn that really portrayed the emotions of a long distance relationship and the fears that can overwhelm the situation. That said, I really really disliked one of the main characters and that my end result inevitable. This isn't fiction. People suck. Boo. :(
225.0	3.0	"The premise that you don't necessary need a character with superpowers or a superhero in order to create a great comic book. Great stories are around you and even the dumbest idea can be a great idea, sounds like an advertising but i've been reading comic books 30 years and still this kind of books still amaze me.   Amazing book   how to get an ""idea"" about the comic book process   the LOTR evil jewelry is priceless   Page 81 worth the book   i enjoyed form page one to that amazing last page.   highly recommended."
557.0	3.0	So, this comic was beautifully illustrated and the color work is some of the best I've ever scene. The story itself was interesting and well thought out but, it left me with a big decision on whether or not to continue reading comics all together. I have a fairly impressive comic collection though I haven't finished about half of them however, what I have read usually leaves me with a disgusting taste in my mouth. Most of the comics I have read, including this one, are extremely sexual and derogatory mainly toward women. Even in scenes completely unrelated to sex you usually see woman in skin hugging outfits, or with only a few scraps of fabric on them with their nipples poking through. It got me thinking if I even want to continue with the comic industry in general with the amount of over sexualization and after thinking about it I have decided to finish reading my remaining comics then selling all but a few favorites and either only read comics made for a young teen audiences or forgo buying comics all together. I've been reading comics since I was 12 and I am just too sick of this industry.
830.0	3.0	Another highly derivative Hunger Games like trilogy. The writing is average, the characterizations are flat, and the plot, as mentioned before, is nothing new.
694.0	1.0	** spoiler alert **   I never had anything personal against Cassnadra Clare. Just against her writing style, her stories and the world of the shadowhunter.   I found them boring, and since she decided to continue writing in that same world I had nothing to do with her books.   So I blacklisted her books just to remember that this is an author that personally I do not wish to read.   Later on I encountered some references about Clare, and I read them- each let to another and the picture in whole wasn't very...well...complimanting.   As a result, I am determined not to read any of her books. The one star rating represent my excitment towards her books- which is low (like the tempratures in ocean the day the Titanic disaster occured)
518.0	1.0	The ending was terrible. Over all didnt care for this book but it had a good idea.
721.0	1.0	This was ok read. I liked certain parts but overall I think the story could've been better. It isn't a book that I'll remember.
971.0	1.0	Read this in my lunch hour at the library. Amusing, with one or two really spot-on. I suspect I'd get more out of this if I'd read all the books it refers to.
164.0	3.0	I borrowed this book from my son-in-law who, as a former Mason, was sorely disappointed. He said the Masonic truths were accurate but the revelation at the end was a big fat zero. I thought the book was a big commercial for the Masons -- nary a contrary word -- and the style much like Ayn Rand books of old: characters and plot exist primarily to advance the author's philosophy. I will give the author high marks, however, for his ability to get you to turn the page. I read it in two days.
736.0	1.0	"book on tape.   i chose it for the reader - tom stechschulte's voice.   story too melodramatic for my taste.   i finished it because of the plot and story but just barely.   not for me.   choosing a book by the reader is an ""ify"" proposition, at best."
36.0	3.0	I liked Hubert's historical fiction series, Miss Don't Touch Me, so saw this and picked it up. It features pastel colored illustrations by Marie Caillou which are digital, sort of pretty but a little cardboardish except the color. The story is a first love story between two boys in a Catholic school, one, Adrian, who is a loner nerd, and one who has a girlfriend. They kiss, they get caught, the priest suggests Adrian get help, cured. His mother freaks out. The other boy freaks out. Adrian is not very likeable or sympathetic, he's arrogant, and he hates where he lives. Will he escape from the provincial Catholic jail of a school? I didn't really care much, frankly. A very conventional story, in many ways, with no surprises. It's all right.
149.0	3.0	"First let me say that having grown up with the original American Girl books, I am beyond thrilled to be reading them to my daughter. This was the first ""new"" series that we started and it's been disappointing. It might not be fair to compare the original stories to these, but I feel that the book in general lacks depth and originality. The characters seem fake and have forced conversations. It just doesn't seem to suck you in or hold your attention."
406.0	1.0	This book was so pathetic, irreverent, lazy, listless and abysmal that if the book series had not already been canceled, I would have unsubscribed.
18.0	2.0	An intriguing concept, but not I wasn't able to get into it -- something about the pacing seemed off, and was distracting too much from the characters and plot.
230.0	3.0	I admit I've never heard of this author. In reading this, I can tell it was written as a young adult book/story. I am not familiar with her world of vampires, witches, werewolves, and whatever. I found it quite a humorous idea that a vampire is a detective paired with a witch partner to solve a werewolf murder.. Silly, but it seems to work for her. I was not particularly impressed by the writing of this story. The two main characters are supposed to be in their early 20s, and established detectives- that is very hard for me to believe. Mid to late 20s would be much more believable, but for YA I suppose it's ok. If you like Twilight, you'll probably enjoy this.
21.0	2.0	I don't remember reading this one when I was younger and I guess that's because it bored the hell out of me. This whole book felt like they had no idea what to write about for a Kristy book and just pulled the first thought remotely possible out of their ass and went with it.
442.0	2.0	I was surprised to find this on the shelf, as Stina was a favorite of mine as a little kid and I'd never heard of a sequel.   It was a disappointment however - cute drawings, of course, but an odd, boring plot. Maybe I'm remembering my older childhood days, but I do recall preferring longer, more detail-rich stories. Not these sort of three-paragraph anecdotes.
620.0	1.0	These are very good books.
984.0	1.0	Reading this year's nominees for Best Poetry Choice Awards and started with this one. What a letdown. Is this what we call poetry now? Just a bunch of line breaks, some indents, words typed with spaces in b e t w e e n. Ugh.
522.0	3.0	So this was terrible!   Bruce is trying to buy an island from another rich guy for reasons. Some French doofus wants to buy the island instead. Two-Face has gathered together some carnival freaks, whom he feels an affinity for because of his deformed face, and wants to put them on a zeppelin to somewhere - maybe the island? Apparently this is a story - and it completely sucks!   The art looks like a bad David Mazzucchelli wannabe's efforts. Even by Matt Wagner's standards - the hack who gave us Monster Men and The Mad Monk - this is an awful Batman book. Don't bother with Batman: Feces.
747.0	1.0	I have liked the previous books but this one was simply booring... Im not quite finished but I dont even care how it will end
259.0	4.0	"COWL is one of a growing list of in the ""realistic take on super heroes"" sub-genera. In this case COWL is a police-like union contracted to the Chicago government to policing super villain activity. Set during the 60's the story opens with COWL catching the last of the major super villains in Chicago then follows on with how the organisation continues without any clear objective.   Unfortunately, while I like the premise, the actual story didn't click at all with me. My biggest issue was that while the art looks excellent, the very lightly colored, almost black and white style, made it very hard to differentiate between characters. In a character driven story that largely focuses on boardroom negotiations and back room meetings this made things very hard to follow in places.   I'm tempted to give this another shot as I felt like the story was starting to pick up towards the end of the volume but with so much else out there to read I don't quite thing this made a good enough first impression."

264.0	2.0	"If this is considered a good preview of Proust as a writer I must say I'm not a fan. I felt like I was on a bad date where someone pulls out their journal and asks ""would you like to hear my poetry?"" No sir, I would not. Some pretty moments but nothing worthy of the hype."
192.0	2.0	Eh. It's okay. I like mine & Lindsay's better.

319.0	4.0	Clementine is gearing up for the worst summer of her life. Her heart is broken, partly because of Ethan, but mostly because her best friend Amanda isn't speaking to her because of what happened with Ethan. And her family is forcing her to spend the summer crammed in a tiny boat with them, sailing down the Mississippi River. But when Clem meets James and she devotes some time to thinking about what went wrong with Amanda, she'll start to put things back together.   I liked the book's unusual setting and details about sailing and living in a boat for an entire summer. That puts a little spin on the typical tale of true love and betrayal of friendship. But I wish Clementine had had a stronger voice. I never really felt like I knew Clementine. Hand this one to fans of Sarah Dessen and Elizabeth Scott's romances who have read everything by their favorite authors.
24.0	2.0	The old children's short is much better, as the message is much more grey. Where in the short, The Once-ler slowly but surely starts racking up the tree bodycount, he also debates the consequences of his actions in the environment, and The Lorax himself says he doesn't have the answer.   Here, he just cares about his business, and that happens a lot for sure, but it's hardly as grey and nuanced as the short.   That being said, the message is still an important one, i just don't particularly like how it was handled.
116.0	3.0	I wanted to love this books - and I probably could have loved this book, were it not for a somewhat seriously annoying habit of the author's (I understand these are children's books, but...) where he had to put an aside next to any word that might even SEEM like a challenge for a child. It bothered me - even at the intended age for these books, I would have happily looked a word up if I didn't understand it, or gleaned its meaning from whatever context it was placed in.   I really enjoyed the book (very quick read) aside from that, but it was so distracting it really frustrated me.
485.0	2.0	The one star is prolly due to my expectations, of which this book has fallen sorely short of. I like fairy tale retellings as much as the next fantasy fan, but i think Cameron Dokey has some of the best retellings out there. What i appreciate most from her writings are her ability to inculcate insight into her stories. However though insight was present in the Wild Orchid, i felt that more depth into Mulan's story was sorely lacking. My main problems with her book invovled the story of Mulan. I know the story of Mulan and her story took place in a war which lasted years and years. Also, i had a hard time visualizing her as this little girl of just 14 years old going into war and training to fight in it. Plus the pacing was off for me -the beginning was pretty dragging but the final chapters took place so fast that i didn't really feel the unfolding of the development of the story. All in all, it was a disappointing read for me.
508.0	3.0	I'm a little shocked at some of the praise this book has been getting. I understand that people are impressed by the subject matter, but it's also been getting praise as being well written, with good dialog, and I thought those were two of the biggest holes in the book. I also thought there were some plot holes and unbelievable characters, but mostly I just thought it was very poorly written.   Update: some more of my thoughts on the writing here: http://crossreferencing.wordpress.com...
329.0	2.0	This book left me disappointed.   It started off so well with its mixture of approaching disaster, religion and psychological misfits and I had high expectations, however, about half way through, it degenerated into a run of mill thriller with a quite ridiculous ending.
891.0	2.0	I got halfway through the book and decided this book was really boring. It moved really slowly for me as a reader. I was not interested in any of the characters, or for a matter of fact the plot. Normally I like works that discuss what could have happened after happily ever after but this story was just so boring. I think this book was just not written for me as an audience member.
465.0	3.0	"Are you sending someone a card? Are you unsure of what to say? Fear no more! With this book, you can add ""an extra special personal touch to an otherwise blank card."" How? Surely not by reading advice on how to find the right words? Nope--just by copying one of these poems verbatim. Yes, that's right. You can make any card personal by including deeply emotional statements that come straight from a book that you pulled off the shelf.   Leaving aside the fact that these poems about love, faith, divorce, births, deaths, holidays, anniversaries (and many other topics) were written by someone else, the poems themselves aren't even that good. Most are sickeningly sweet, even saccharine. Some items lack so much punctuation that they must be read twice in order to be understood. Other poems have rhymes or scansion (or both) that are so forced that they distract from the poem's message. Others just don't scan or rhyme at all. One section had exactly the same poem twice, on two different pages, and typed in different fonts. Another poem was slightly revised so that it would fit in two different sections, even though little was actually changed. Some poems are so syrupy that they don't seem genuine.   It wasn't all terrible. There were a few moments that seemed genuinely sweet, and there were some moments that had just enough humor to be memorable and edgy. In particular, some of her entries for the Father's Day section, in which she addressed step-fathers, foster-fathers, and other non-blood-relative paternal figures, are among the volume's most tactful and loving verses. She gracefully diffuses any negativity from a potentially awkward situation by emphasizing love and gratefulness.   Even so, if you want to send a card to someone, you're probably better off just saying something that you've written yourself. It will be far more personal and more meaningful than something you'd find in a book, and it will probably ring truer."
301.0	3.0	"Yes, another ""lyrical, beautifully illustrated"" book that attempts to deal with death for a young audience. But I am not sure that saying ""the gentle waves took him away,"" won't lead to a lot of 'splaining to very young readers, nor do I believe that this or any other picture book that uses lyricism and nature will help our little ones get what has happened to Grandpa or Fluffy the cat or Barky the Dog. One more to hand parents, and I bought it because I think I will be asked for it, but I hate putting it in the picture books, where someone is going to not realize what's going on till they've begun to read it to their child.   And as always, I recommend you give them the adult book The Grieving Child,and let them learn how children of different ages perceive death and how to talk to them about it. No beautiful art work, no pretty words, but better help for the hard work of being a parent in a sad situation."

279.0	2.0	Just your average Silver Age hero, nothing truly spectacular abut this one. Although it irks me a bit how frequently the Halls destroy the priceless artifacts in the museum they're supposed to be curators for...
672.0	1.0	It was just okay. Not interested enough to read the rest of the series.
861.0	2.0	I just can't do this one. Reid annoyed me from page one, I can't stand how he thinks he is all that, he really isn't. Emma wasn't much better, I want her to stand up to her dad and bitch slap her step-mom. Then there is the movie, the dialogue his horrible, I can't read any more. This one isn't for me.
949.0	3.0	I am really glad I finished this book. As there is a lot to read and rather hard to read and stay in focus. A lot is told in this book, some of it got lost for me as at times it was hard to follow what was going on as there were stories inside a story of a story of a story... A lot of this I have heard or read already, as the gods and their love affairs are given in many places.   And well the stories themselves are rather brutal, one must confess that the gods got away with everything. And a lot of shape shifting going on.   I quite liked the last book about how everything is changing (though the same thought was visible throughout the book).   All in all I doubt that I shall ever pick up this book again.
799.0	2.0	I really want a solo Nightcrawler title to be brilliant and successful. This one is half way there. It LOOKS GREAT. But it's a very tired story. Nauck's turns in terrific art, page after page, so it's a pity the plot brings back one tried and tired Claremont element after another: warwolves, check. Shadow King, check. Bloody Bess, check. Swashbuckling-pirate-Kurt, check. You, know, there was a Kurt before the whole stupid swashbuckling thing over-took the character to death. Ah, well... another solo series and another failure. That's 3 for 3, all dogs.
163.0	3.0	This volume was just really slow and bitty... which is not good for the final installment! I felt that the mangaka was trying to fit too much in, and so it was ultimately underwhelming. Also, it was also not explained whether Hoshina aged at the same rate as Aram, because within 2 1/2 years he is now 17, and she doesn't seem to age :S I think this whole story would have been a lot better if Aram was originally 17, and the spell made him a child, rather than a child becoming a 17 year old. This would make it a lot less.. awkward and immoral.
171.0	2.0	This is one of the simplest versions of Alice in wonderland ever. But it works, mostly.
71.0	2.0	"I needed a book to read at the laundromat, so I grabbed this one. It is a Willa Jansson Mystery, the mystery being--what is going on here? There is a main character who has gone thru any number of metamorpheses, from radical to lawyer, to finally a clerk to a judge. She still smokes pot--at least once in this story, she seems gullible and extemely horny. Perhaps the NY Times book reviewer read a different book than I did when he or she wrote: One of the most articulate and surely the wittiest of women sleuths at large in the genre."" If it were a dot to dot, you wouldn't decipher the solution."
297.0	3.0	"[?][?][?][?][?][?]*Might contain spoilers* [?][?][?][?][?][?]   This book centers around former SIS (Secret Intelligence Service) assassin, Archer Hart (37/late thirties?), aka the 'mercenary who's broken the law beyond all recognition' and Conrad Black (36), aka the 'uptight barrister who is the law'. We have/can met/meet Conrad from the previous book, but as I didn't read the first one, I was on a clean slate.   ""You know we're doomed, right? There's no way this can work. I've broken the law in the worst possible way. You are the law. I'm not some young kid to be manipulated into being what you think you want. I don't play games. What I do is real. I'm dangerous. I'm your worst fucking nightmare.""   Or the guy I've been waiting for. ""Sometimes when I was playing, I wished it was real.""   ""Easy enough from a position of safety.""   Archer is a top. Conrad is a top. How the hell are they suppose to work in bed? Luckily, they both do love a little battling in bed... Also, they are in trouble; people are trying to kill them. Can they stay alive long enough to get to know each other? To have a chance at happiness?   ""You're my anchor,"" Archer whispered in his ear. ""You keep me safe.""   Overall, the story had potential, but to be honest, I struggled to really focus on it. I constantly found my attention elsewhere. Also, I found myself a little bit cheated on; Conrad was supposed to be this top and to be domineering and commanding, however I didn't see that until the very end when he'd gotten his strength back.   ""We're not at the house yet. There's still time for me to have a heart attack and die.""   ""Before I fuck you? That's rather selfish.""   ""You're not going to fuck me.""   ""You'll beg me to fuck you.""   ""Why don't you hold your breath while you're waiting?""   Sure, he's been in a vulnerable situation after his accident, having just learnt to barely walk again and being in pain all the time. But I had expected a little more from him. Archer was, I guess, alright. Together, they completed each other. Mending their hearts and all that. But story-wise, as I said, I struggled. That's not saying that the book was bored or bad, but I couldn't really get into it.   Conrad's legs and back were killing him. He couldn't believe how far they'd walked. He'd been distracted and guessed that was the point. Not just distracted by the conversation, but by the allure of Archer walking next to him, the strength of him, the thought of fucking him, and even though he didn't want to admit it, of being fucked by him. Conrad wanted him, but there was no way he was going to play prey to Archer's predator. This guy would chomp him up and spit him out. Hopefully not literally.   Quick basic facts:   Genre: - (A) Contemporary Romance (M/M)   Series: - Series (Standalone?), Book Two   Love triangle? - No.   Cheating? - No.   HEA? - Yes.   Favorite character? - Conrad Black, I think.   Would I read more by this author/or of series? - Probably not.   Would I recommend this book/series? - Unsure.   Will I read this again in the future? - No.   Rating - 2.5/2 stars."

189.0	4.0	"Meh. This books takes what could be a great premise- what a native speaker teacher learns about their language through teaching non-native students- and executes in a banal and stereotypical way. There were occasional flashes of promise in the beginning, that explored the vagaries of Japanese and the different ways they can impact a non-native speakers life. A wealthy French woman who came to love Japanese through her obsessive viewing of 1960s yakuza movies and thus speaks the language like a mob moll displaced in time. A part-time worker at a ramen shop needs to know the names of many random dishes and types of cookware and finds most native speakers have no idea either. Students study honorific Japanese very carefully only to find it totally misused by native speakers. There were also a few interesting factoids sprinkled throughout about the development of the Japanese language, but it's hard to know whether these are folk etymologies or actual fact. The latter part of the book just rehashes a bunch of ""oh geez these foreigners don't innately understand all the intricacies of social protocol of our beautiful country, how barbaric"" type of anecdotes.   There is a television show made from this book, with the same title, available for viewing on youtube, that is 1000 times better than the source material, with much more information about the quirks of the Japanese language and a much deeper sense of generosity to non-Japanese living in Japan and doing their best to learn the language."
639.0	2.0	felt like this book was written by a teenager or somebody really new to poetry as it was a collection of cliches and overdrawn underdone metaphors. reminded me of poems anybody could write and mostly just be for themselves, not really big on publishing this kind of content

846.0	2.0	So I think there was a message here, and maybe it could be a kind of cute wedding present for a gay couple, but as a kids' book, it's not working for me. If it's ok for anyone to be the bride or the groom, why do they still have to follow all the other dumb traditions? Why can't they have dirt to eat and cowboy hats to wear? Ugh, I hate the wedding industry!
255.0	3.0	Part of the Dogs, Dogs, Dogs series introducing young readers to different dog breeds, this title focuses on the smallest breed, the chihuahua. Youngsters will learn that not all chihuahuas are short-haired; in fact, some have long, fluffy coats, and they come in different colors. Readers learn about some of the responsibilities associated with adopting a little dog, and they are sure to smile at the large photographs of these adorable dogs. There's even a shot of a litter of chihuahuas. Back matter includes a glossary and suggested reading. Before anyone picks a dog as a family pet, it would be a terrific idea to browse books such as this one in order to learn what dog might be best suited to a particular lifestyle.

The themes explored in this novel are extremely deep - perhaps too deep for young children - and include: what it means to be human, greed, and preserving the peace.   The author's style was typical for a more ""mature"" tale, though I found the characterization of Christians a bit insulting.   I suppose this could be a good tale to help promote tolerance among younger children. Overall, I was not impressed with this tale. Do not suggest reading this to younger children."

Don't get me wrong, I was really excited about some of the events that happened, and the end of the book was a cliff-hanger and defiantly had me wanting more. I just, I guess I don't really like the whole ""every guy likes Zoey no matter what she does"" theme. The new guy likes her, Erik is practically forgiving her, shes breaking the heart of Heath... I dunno, it just makes me not like the books as much. But I will start the new one tonight (or maybe tomorrow) and hopefully I will like it more.   Oh, and the book also made a reference to Zoey reading a Melissa Marr book, so that was for sure two thumbs up!"
85.0	3.0	Since I really enjoyed reading the Amulet by Kazu Kibuishi, I was really excited to read Explorer. Unfortunately, my level of enjoyment for this book was not on par with my enjoyment for the Amulet series. This is probably due to the fact that Kibuishi edited it, and did not create the content.   The book consists of seven short stories by seven different artists: Raina Telgemeier, who wrote Smile, Dave Roman (Astronaut Academy), Jason Caffoe, Stuart Livingston, Johane Matte, Rad Sechrist and Emily Carroll. If you are familiar with the Flight series, you will notice that many of these artists from Flight are featured in this book.   This is a very easy read, and is worth skimming if any of the artists are a favourite of yours. I enjoyed the first and last stories, but felt indifferent about the stories in the middle. My guess is that there will be at least one story enjoyed by each reader, as each artist differs quite a bit in style.
72.0	3.0	In the beginning I loved this book, and recommended it to several people. And then I reached the halfway point and it took a strange turn. It was as if a completely different person took over writing this book.   The story, which had been engaging and riveting, seemed to fall apart, as if the author didn't know where to go with it. Much of the second half is summary rather than the action that kept me so interested in the beginning.   So unfortunate.
689.0	3.0	Holy cat-babies, I did not like this! This version of Wonder Woman is NOT GOOD. Okay, I will temper that: I did not like this version of Wonder Woman, although she's still a good character just by virtue of being freaking WONDER WOMAN, and I'm sure there are readers who will enjoy this iteration of her mythology, etc.   I very strongly prefer the Wonder Woman of The Circle or that one Batwoman volume (World's Finest, I think). Azzarello's Wonder Woman just seems... ordinary. And I think that's terrible. I feel like she could have been any generic superhero stuck into this story.   There are Greek gods involved in Blood, and Greek mythology is usually an easy way to get me interested in a story, but I feel they are used badly here. So boring! And what the hell is up with Hades's candle-head?   Honestly, I think most of the gods are drawn weirdly but as a whole, the art is okay. I prefer Chiang's art to Akins's, especially when Diana's face is in profile, although I know that is an oddly specific preference.   I have SIX VOLUMES of this run to get through, since my library had them all sitting together on one shelf, and I was very excited about that until last night, when I finished Blood. I'm probably being too harsh because I was so disappointed -- maybe it will get better.
33.0	1.0	Leave the book, take the cannoli.   Then go watch the movie while eating said cannoli.
993.0	2.0	There's a great start to this book, as our hero is kidnapped to become the prey some sort of hunting game.   However, although the action is fast moving, and all but relentless, there is a lack of backstory that makes it difficult to like any of the characters, even the hero, and does little, or nothing, to explain what is going on and why.   That is understandable during the first third or so of the book when there is only one charactor so he has no one to ask, and no one to explain, but later on, when others join him, no one knows anything, which does create a sense of mystery, but also raises more questions than are answered.   Perhaps more will be explained in further books in the series but, quite frankly, I can't be bothered to continue, especially when the end of this book - more of a stop than an end - is clealry there just to get you to read on. Sorry but that's not going to happen.
