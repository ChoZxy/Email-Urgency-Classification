334364	informative	I love how they come with 3 different types of masks. They all work well, but I use the two black ones depending on what I feel like wearing at night. The pink one is for my cousin and she sleeps good at night with it.
147151	informative	This works great! I bought it to go with my foundation that doesn't come with a bottle pump. I actually bought 3!
298470	somewhat	The minerals that the product has helps with everything I need... digestion,  vitamin supplements.
16922	informative	I have, and will continue to go through the NARS spectrum of blushes.  The first NARS product I tried was the Orgasm blush, which is your somewhatconservative, works-for-everyone color.  It has a good balance between pink and peach and can also be used for general face highlighting.  Not long after, I was at my local beauty counter trying on foundation, and the sales rep used the Oasis color on me.  Oasis is slightly darker than Orgasm and has more purple undertones.  It looked great with my olive skin, so I purchased this and used the Orgasm as more of a cheek highlighter.  Still wanting more, I was talked into trying Outlaw, which is more on the red side.  As I mentioned before, I have olive skin which, naturally, does not appear rosy.  I really enjoy this blush as it gives a much more golden appearance than the Orgasm or Oasis.  In summary, I would recommend this blush to anyone.  They have a large variety of shades, so everyone should be able to find something that works with them.  They are a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way so they last a long time.  I've had to throw out some colors due to expiration before I used even half.
155473	uninformative	Good product
85016	somewhat	Great deal for safety razors.  Saves a lot on money if you want to give it a try.
144159	informative	I ordered two bottles of organic argan oil and am very pleased with the product.  The oil arrived in amber bottles with stoppers to help with dispensing the right amount. Delivery was on-time. I am excited about using this product for cosmetic purposes.
329785	somewhat	There on the top of the buggy. One is facing the rear.
339352	informative	This is so beautiful. This shade 3.5 matches my nc20-25 skin. I have oily skin and this works for me, just don't use too much of it will slip around.  This is holy grail status, it is that good! It doesn't settle into pores which is a big problem I have with foundation. Stick Foundation seems to do this less on me.
141917	somewhat	I love all the colors but they're big. When i put em on it hurts.
113754	uninformative	you get what you pay for...top quality...what a difference using this blush versus the cheaper ones...
216544	informative	This is a typical case of you get what you pay for. I had purchased this as a gift and there is no way I would give it to the person it was intended for. I might hold onto it and give it to a little girl but that would be about it. I'm just glad it was cheap. As for the seller, I can't say that there is anything wrong with them. The item arrived quick and its not their fault that it is poor quality. I would purchase from the seller again if it was something worth buying.
278550	uninformative	Good product. As advertised. Thank you. A+++++
30526	somewhat	Lathers well, great fresh scent, natural oils, long lasting  All of Le Couvent des Minimes products are winners!
66288	uninformative	to small rip off
101933	uninformative	i love it so moisturizing
126948	somewhat	I love this cream! 55 and my face is soft and smooth
9853	informative	People who are familiar with Radox know it is a great bath additive after a long tiresome day at work or toiling. It relaxes you and slowly eases your stress away. The product came quickly from the seller and, it was exactly what I expected. I will purchase again when my current stock runs out.
166692	informative	Tried the recipe for cellulite reduction and after three uses I'm seeing results! Will definitely be purchasing more.
24321	informative	Came with the pink gooey soft wax. HATE it..Had to purchase the hard wax and love that one. Do it right, no pain...the pink stuff sucks!
91621	somewhat	I purchased this several months ago and I love it!  I use very little at a time and still get great results, it will last a long time.
50000	informative	LOVE IT!  The smell is intoxicating - reminds me of my fun time spent in Sicily every time I use it!  Think it would be great for men or women.  The bar soap is also yummy.  Would love some shampoo or perfume if they made it...
247710	uninformative	Fit is too small.
91223	informative	I work for a different high end cosmetic line and after many of my coworkers said to try it I did and I love it! I recommend Exfolikate over everything else! You have to use it in the shower or with steam and it helps activate it! WOW what a clean face afterwards, I mean just takes the dead skin off it's amazing, worth every penny!!
12631	uninformative	Works great!
165208	somewhat	Great moisture for oily skin.
358403	informative	Got mine about a week and a half early and just swatched them and they are beautiful! Creamy but not too creamy, very pigmented. These are my first lip liners I've ever tried and I'm just waiting for my lipsticks to come to try them both out! 4 stars because I haven't seen how they work with lipstick
694	somewhat	Very attractive and shines like a chrome fender. Best of all it is well built for the job. It works great!
97701	somewhat	This nail polish is basically black. The picture is extremely misleading. If you could do one coat, maybe it would look better, but most nail polishes need 2 coats.
42145	informative	I purchased this razor based on Computer Reports evaluation.  It was not as good as the review
317160	uninformative	Didn't know I needed it until I bought it!
284941	somewhat	It keeps falling and does not stick to the skin properly.
253539	uninformative	I love these brushes!
191535	somewhat	Love this soap! Its so nice, lasts along time and the scent is marvelous
127323	informative	Don't waste your money totally worthless haven't found anything it works with. Hard plastic, no give, person with limited hand mobility wouldn't even be able to get it on pants.
234290	informative	I have tried a bunch of different store bought shampoos for my beard.  Some worked and some didnt.  I thought I would give this stuff a try.  And I would say that this stuff works as good or better than the super expensive stuff that I have tried before.  I only have to use a very little bit and it lathers great.  I have only used it for 2 days now but I think its going to end up being my go to for beard shampoo.
204371	somewhat	Do not waste a penny on this product.  No visual difference. Period.
327345	somewhat	I received from shipper very quickly.  Great product to enhance brows.  I use black for lashes which looks very natural.
295996	somewhat	Perfect size!
186600	informative	Its not cheaply made, it is thick and stretchy, I wear a 34 D and it holds in everything it needs to! I wish they would make some more colors! I would buy again.
211494	informative	Love, love, love this! if you enjoy taking baths, this thing is for you. It doesn't slip, holds well to the tub and is so comfortable you won't want to get out! I've had it for over a month now and there is absolutely no mold/mildew growing behind the pillow. It is true to it's label and I'm glad I purchased this!
283513	informative	I bought several of these and within a month they fall apart..pockets become unraveled along the seam..it is poorly made..I've called company to get a replacement but was told I would get a call back once resolved and never got a call.
138139	somewhat	Great product.  Covers my grey roots perfectly.
45096	informative	I have been a fan of Camille Beckman for years. Great for winter dry skin, over exposed summer skin, and softens those pesky calluses on feet, knees, and elbows. It comes in many great flavors, but with the unscented, you can add your own favorite fragrance, if desired, and the men in your life will not have to worry about smelling girly. Yes, my guy uses it, too. Give it a try, you'll love it!
314340	informative	The bars are a bit smaller than I thought they would be but soap has been great in clearing up my face
106638	informative	These tattoo stickers are not what I expected.  You have to cut them out and they are on an odd paper.
25517	somewhat	Great product! Meets my expectations.
103073	informative	I finally found a perfect red! This red has a creamy blue base but also, just enough orange/bronze to warm the red. The result is a beautiful warm, true red that's perfect for the holidays, evening wear, but also toned down enough for everyday wear. For daytime professional wear, I line my lips with an earthy bordeaux or plum liner. For a dressier look, I line with an orangy/red or golden red liner. Various liners give this lipstick many different, distinct looks. This is my new favorite color. After tossing tons of reds, I finally found a sinner!
3640	informative	Well balanced stand and great stand overall. When I received it, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the stand. It looked expensive and that's one of the reasons why I like it so much. Even though it's not that much, it looks like it's something that would cost a lot. Works very well, holds razor and brush in perfectly and I love using this product.
195794	somewhat	Love this leave in conditioner.  It doesn't leave a heavy feeling / presence in your hair and makes it easier to comb through.  I like it very much.
101916	uninformative	its cute!!!
331527	somewhat	It doesn't nums the skin much'
75550	informative	We would give this four-and-a-half stars. Minus half a star because the pump mechanism gets stuck on occasion. It's an easy fix - you just push it up from the bottom, but you end up wasting a little bit of the product. That said, we have a whole lot less waste overall than with a traditional tube that the kids over-squeeze, over-use, or leave the top off and it oozes out. None of those concerns with the self-closing pump that always doles out the perfect amount. And the bathroom looks so much more clean!
216699	somewhat	Nice, a little too big but I like it.
99018	informative	"These no kink crush proof/resistant hoses are a necessity but we keep our house on the cool size during fall/winter/spring and the hoses stiffen a bit and tangle easier.  I wouldn't have thought of this or even noticed but when I first purchased them it was summer and they worked well.  when I say tangle, I don't mean knot up but they don't relax when you gather/loop them up to hang them on a bed post and such.  Incidentally, I put a couple of Command super size hooks up in strategic places around the house to help manage my hose wad.  I think they're robe hooks or something. they are two-tone in color and maybe 3-5"" tall.  works like a charm."
228389	uninformative	Works well with my product. Thanks.
97301	somewhat	I needed something to keep al my items from falling to the bottom of my purse and this works great.
56266	informative	Divine smell, cleaning properties and after-use smell! 5/5 stars.
49149	informative	The product broke immediately before I could even try it.  Don't buy this.
162912	somewhat	Huge, but gracefully done. love it.
136440	informative	These blushes are amazing!! So pigmented, love love love these blushes, I'm so buying these again! Each blush has its own personality! And have a gorgeous tone for every occation Lol never buying a different brand of blush but these! So worth every penny!
199390	somewhat	They worked but very flimsy, and do not last as long as other bands.  For the amount of bands and price they are ok.
241055	informative	"FINALLY! A non aluminum deodorant that actually works!! I was pretty skeptical when I purchased this, as I've tried many ""natural"" deodorants that all failed in the end. I can wear this all day, through a work out and still not stink. I've recommended this to several people and will definitely repurchase. I purchased the original scent and while it reminds me of an incense /hippie shop, it isn't strong or unpleasant."
245534	uninformative	Amazing products!! My skin has never looked better.
108116	uninformative	I love these so much!!! They're awesome.
148566	informative	Really disappointed. Slides all over the place. The magnet is strong but the ring doesn't actually stay in place. Tried it on my lip like a Marilyn Monroe, slide right out after about 2 minutes. Tried it on the upper cartilage of my ear. Couldn't see it and kept sliding down. More of a pain than anything else. Not worth it.
264442	somewhat	What a great product. My metabolic condition keeps me from crowds. Taking Null gave me back the confidence I needed to be more social.  Love it.
249882	informative	I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I absolutely adore it! It seems to shrink my very large pores and even out the skin tone of my face and cleavage area. I am a ginger, but not the really pretty kind with porcelain skin. I am usually kind of pink and sometimes splotchy. This oil seems to even it all out and make my skin more like that creamy white I have always wanted. It does not feel like oil when you put it on. It feels more like a gel and it dries very quickly with out any greasy feeling. I received this at a discount for my honest review but will be ordering it again when I get close to running out. The only thing I noticed that I didn't like was that the dropper doesn't suck up very much at one time. I guess that is so you don't use too much, but I have a lot of cleavage to oil up so I may use a different dropper if I can find one that seals well and hasn't had baby Tylenol in it.
31824	informative	Doesn't work. Has alcohol and dries skin. It burns too. Please don't waste your money! There's a ripoff report about this. This doesn't work like SkinZinc although it's made by same person. Listen to the one star reviews!
205660	uninformative	as expected
294711	uninformative	Amazing
69819	informative	I have used Norelco shavers for 48 years and they have all worked well.  The batteries last for a long long time.  This one also works very well.  A very nice feature is being able to wash out the blade area with running water, eliminating the need to use a brush.
254611	somewhat	Really lasts a long time, and the color is so rich and matte. It has been my favorite waterline eyeliner, yet.
178127	informative	I purchased this cream to help with my psoriasis and it definitely does the trick. This cream is light and soaks into my skin fast. The small bottle makes it easier for travel and the pump doesn't allow much cream to come out at a time. It does not have a strong smell and works great to smooth out my skin.
46313	informative	I love this little station! I have problems with calluses and this tool helps keep them under control. I would recommend this to others.
48430	uninformative	just like the old days!!  :)
199330	somewhat	Works incredibly well and longer than advertised.
163172	somewhat	Two out of three were already open in the box :-(
330158	informative	Love the product but was a little disappointed that when I opened them, one of the products broke immediately. I wasn't to happy about that especially because I bought them to replace a broken one.
11052	informative	No gripes concerning the new cutter heads and am quite satisfied with the performance of the new heads. It is nice to get such a clean cut after using the original parts which have been in use for MANY years. I can't remember what year my old shaver was puchased and the cutter blades were badly worn giving very poor performance. Shaving is much better now.
110610	somewhat	Very effective at healing my irritated skin.
364717	uninformative	Love it!!
258890	informative	I have this and like it. I wish it would make my curls tighter, but that is ok. Otherwise still a really good curling additive and it smells nice too. Would buy again!
326306	informative	This brush does lose bristles as you use it, but the head still remains quite full. I use it wet in the shower and hang it in the shower to dry. The bristles are not as stiff when wet, but definitely stiff enough to get you clean. I have arthritis and do find the handle a bit awkward because it is thin and flat, but it's not impossible to use. It looks quite nice and i would not be embarrassed to give this as a gift.
249690	informative	I didn't realize that this cleanser was black, which dilutes to a lovely cyanotic color when washing your face, but I love it!  I have tried many, many facial cleansers.  I have sensitive combination skin, and most cleansers uncomfortably dry out my face -- this one doesn't. It also smells really nice.  Lavender isn't usually my favorite scent, but I actually love the smell of this cleanser; it reminds me of Seattle Massage School in the 1990's.
48335	informative	I carefully read all of the Amazon reviews because I wanted to get a non-smelling Bringaraj oil.  Vadik's version has a very strong and overpowering smell but it works as in it grows your hair.  This oil damaged my hair, and dried out my scalp.  It does have a very minimal smell that quickly goes away but the product doesn't work.  Its back to Vadik which smells strong but at least I have a head full of healthy hair.  Be careful of the hype I found it to be completely untrue.
297577	informative	you HAVE to soak your feet but I could cut away the sheets peeling off. If you are the type to get embarrassed, don't go to the beach or public pool with friends for the first week. The peeling is just craziness loved it though! felt renewed! and my feet haven't been that soft since I was much younger :)
359617	informative	Not styled as it is in the picture. Not brown or any other normal hair color and took weeks to come from China. The hair falls out if you try to brush it!
353052	somewhat	TERRIBLE CHEAP PRODUCT. APPLICATION IS TERRIBLE AND COLOR IS NOT AS PICTURED
121428	informative	LOVE IT! Freshens breath and doesn't burn like fire like with other brands. I believe it's alcohol free but I'm not sure. It does the job well and my teeth feel a lot better and cleaner with this and I'm happy to be taking extra precaution with my teeth.  *NOTE: You don't get as much as I expected with this. I've been using it for about a week(maybe a bit more) and am already halfway through the bottle, and I definitely haven't been using a large amount each time I swish. It says in the directions to use it twice a day(I've missed doing it twice a day for about 1 or 2 days), so if you're going to do that plan on stocking up. Or you can just do it less.
85878	informative	I found the Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge blades to be superior to Derby and Merkur, but still short of Feather in sharpness and consistency from one blade to another.  I don't get the dug against my beard whiskers I do with Derby, nor do I get the irritation I get from some other blades when shaving my head, but they do not seem as sharp as Feather.  I also find about every third or fourth blade seems to bite, which is what I mean about consistency.  All in all, good blades, but not great. I used these in a Merkur 23C Long Handle and a Merkur 37C HD Slant.
88811	uninformative	Used it to clean my razor... Good stuff.
5577	informative	The razor and cartridges are the best shave I think I have ever gotten with an electric razor, highly recommend both.
223253	informative	Absolutely love the results! Ive received so many compliments and its all thanks to this little secret.
127550	somewhat	Find it very noisy and awkward to use. It does do the job of getting all that food out of crevices.
66937	somewhat	I noticed results from this product immediately!!  The results are not that great every day but there is still an improvement over time as well.
39352	informative	I bought this product because it was advertised as having the stongest water pressure. You can always turn the pressure down if needed. I think the Waterpik was advertised up to 90 psi. It's ok but the old Interplak it was replacing was stronger. I thought about getting another Interplak, but they didn't advertise as having sufficient water pressure. The Interplak  was advertised as having about 70 psi.
314514	informative	I ordered the bien etre eau cologne and it was supposed to be the one as pictured (called Bien Etre Eau de cologne Naturelle 70 and a stamp like on the side with 100%). What I received is not the same: it has a different label which is not as the original also the smell is very different from the original. It seems to be a fake.
134517	informative	While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.  It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.  I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.  This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.
6439	somewhat	Good price.  Good product.
317850	somewhat	works slow, but it does work. I've been using this product for about 3 weeks and I can finally see results
337505	uninformative	The wig was perfect.
297349	informative	My Favorite Scent! I have been wearing Elixir of Love for over 25 years. It is my signature fragrance. I wear it on days that are special to me. I get so many compliments on how fresh and clean I smell. I feel beautiful when I wear this and highly recommend this fragrance. It arrived timely. Amazon delivered this quickly and I am happy that they sell this because it is hard to find in stores and the Amazon price is cheaper than Caswell -Massey sales price.
28995	informative	this is a great inexpensive trimmer...lots of attachments i had my last one for 2 years it broke into 5 peices when i dropped it but i charge this thing once every 2 months....great little trimmer  A+++
78413	somewhat	I received my item today!! I can't stop laughing because it is so small. Very small scalp protector.
96511	informative	This is a great toner! It makes my skin feel fresh,  but not tight at all.  It never breaks me out,  which is amazing,  because my aging skin is pretty picky.  I highly recommend this.
6452	somewhat	Must have for my Braun shaver. Great price. This is my second or third order since getting my Braun.
183525	informative	This is easy to apply and use. It takes a little longer because of the two products you need to apply and the extra steps to achieve the look you want, though. The first step is some sort of mascara gel. You have to use that step before you can use the second step. You have to apply the second tube, which are the fibers immediately after using the first tube. You then can do all the steps over again to get more fibers to stick to your eyelashes. The fiber tube is dry so you must apply it quickly after applying the mascara gel. Do one eye completely before doing the second eye. I wish this came with a dry eyelash brush for when I am completely done with all the steps. My eyelashes started to clump but if you have, an eyelash brush than you can fix that problem and your eyelashes will look beautiful.  I have never tried any sort of fiber mascara before so I was thrilled to buy this at a discount. It comes with good instructions, which I really appreciated. The instructions say you can apply your regular mascara first, if you want too, so I tried that. I liked the results better this way. I also could then see the added length from the fibers. The fibers do seem to fall down onto your face as the day goes on though. You will get little flexes but they are so tiny it really wasn't a big deal to me. I wish the fibers were not so dry though but I guess that is why it comes with a gel that you're supposed to apply first.  I love the packaging and the box this comes in. It's so cute and it feels like the box has a magnet closure, which is really nice. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer's standpoint.
14468	informative	I've been using this for abt 3 months, and I like it. You need to use the Nevea gel/lotion a bit more and it works great. I didn't try it in shower yet but it will be just fine.  The quality of shaving is great, really clean and close. Due to the gel/lotion it feels cool and does not cut or irritate. You need to use it almost everyday, otherwise its bit tough for long beards.  The charger could be better but it works.  Hope it helps!
19140	somewhat	A reliable blade that holds an edge well. Is a sharp but forgiving blade. Great blade for beginners.
65562	uninformative	It was what my 16 year old grandson wanted,because he can not fine it in the stores. Please bring it back to walmart.
168986	uninformative	Have not used it.  Package so small,  miniscule print  for application instructions.  Do not want to ruin my skin by improper application.
176828	uninformative	does not work
39875	informative	I bought this item some time ago (1 yr+) It has held up very well and does exactly what I need.  I like the variable speeds that enable you to work up to the blasting pressure.
293953	uninformative	Works OK
62208	uninformative	good soap
298110	uninformative	LOVE IT!
276059	informative	These fit perfectly in my Inverness piercing gun and look great. The quality is just what all inverness earrings tend to be. I won't use anything but gold to pierce, though I usually recommend 14k instead of 24k plated. However, I used these particular earrings to pierce my own daughter's ears and they are healing very nicely with no reaction as they would with a cheap metal.
75616	somewhat	Smells great.  We use this for homemade laundry detergent
108042	somewhat	Perfect! It looks so pretty and I love the smell of something new. Great condition! I just love the pink tips!! x3 sad that it's gonna mess it up
346748	uninformative	LOVE IT!
369281	informative	This stuff is amazing! It smells SOOOO good and the fragrance lasts all day!! It keeps my son's skin super moisturized. I can't get enough of this lotion!
137197	informative	I love this product.  It sprays on easily and does not make my hair sticky like other similar products I have tried.  I've sprayed it on wet or dry hair.  Works great and covers well in between full color apptmts.  Also the price is half of what I paid at a salon.
359112	uninformative	This smudges on my face
294393	informative	Great tanning product. All natural and it doesn't smell bad when you apply. Smooth and gives you a natural tan sunkissed. I apply it everyday after showering. You just need to wash your hand after applying. Will buy again. I really love that product I have olive skin and I can apply it twice a day without getting a taky looks.it gives you the healthy perfect tan.
51999	uninformative	Perfect!  Too bad it's discontinued.
45625	uninformative	1
363213	informative	Love love love this cream! I started to recognize this brand when I was travelling to NYC. Started with their mask, then I tried their hyaluronic toner - THE BEST TONER I have had for many many years!! Then based on the excellent quality, I purchased this cream to try out. When I apply this cream on my face, I immediately fall in love with it. It is good for all skin type, the quality is so refined. The sellers, I believe is Korean, as many nice Korean cosmetic sellers will do - they throw in not one - but some little surprises in the box! I will recommend this brand to all ladies! Will definitely reorder.
126032	somewhat	Helps with candida. Great taste and this seller is very good.
356363	somewhat	It is okayI know it cleans off your skin because I can see the remains on the pad.
87891	informative	I'm happy with the selection we made, for my XXX size husband.  Comparing this belt, to the ones that were used previously in the hospital, same quality.  I like the color bands that identify ours, rather than the red, white and blue the technicians seem to prefer.
164653	informative	I been using this for years is the best ever, if you want to keep your teeth clean and avoid dentist for cavities and other problems that came when you don't really keep your teeth clean in between ,To me I have no complains with this product ,
63340	somewhat	Love these gloves! They really do a great job exfoliating!
365316	somewhat	TERRIBLE! I wore this hair for about 2 weeks and its nothing but tangles and it is constantly dry! I would not buy from here again.
234331	uninformative	Very good product highly recommended it does what it says
62123	informative	"This is NOT made with ""pure almond oil."" The ingredients list shows only ""natural almond fragrance,"" and it has that fake almond smell. I am very disappointed by the dishonesty of the company's website and their packaging, both of which state ""pure almond oil."" Since I already broke the seal on the item Amazon won't accept a return. Now I am stuck with a product I would never have ordered if I had known the truth."
50515	uninformative	Love it
39319	informative	I purchased this Waterpik because I have periodontal disease and was told by my dentist that I needed to clean better using this device.  He was right!  It works great.  Having 6 tips included in the package is a plus, I use three of them daily.  Never thought I would actually clean my tongue but with the correct attachment it is easy and works well.  My gums had developed pockets of 6+ and were sore but after using this for a week with the pocket tip they felt almost normal.  Works best after flossing.  Not much water runs down your hand/arm; I was surprised that it wasn't very messy.  Brushing is a snap afterwards.  Would definitely recommend this water flosser.
178326	uninformative	Worked well as advertised
78051	somewhat	Fast shipping. Product as advertised.
40713	informative	This waterpik is great--you can get your teeth/gums really clean with this, I still brush and floss too, but if I could only do one it would be the waterpik.  I add a little mouthwash to the water and it really makes your mouth feel fresh.  good for the gums too!  the only thing i would change is where the extra attachments are stored, its a little awkward having them in the compartment on the lid.
20619	somewhat	I got my this  for my wife for Christmas and she like it.
347228	somewhat	My daughter uses this product almost every day and loves it. Doesn't damage the hair. Great product!
238962	somewhat	Drink one before,during,and after yard work you will feel great
265997	uninformative	It's great! just like it sais straight and silky!!
106139	informative	I use this as a dupe for the Beauty Blender solid cleanser... made my gross Beauty Blender look brand new! And used it to clean my other, high-end makeup brushes with great results. Much cheaper than the bb solid cleanser and with good ingredients!
316778	informative	I have very think long hair and these rollers work very well. Love the tight curl I get when I use them. They are also soft and flexible. I put them in damp hair and sleep on them. In the morning I have beautiful dry curly hair.
186246	somewhat	Quieter than the old one but works even better.
67932	somewhat	Good product, but it deteriorates very quickly.
354160	informative	This was my first time using this #3 and it was much more in line with my color, vs. the one they had recommended to me on their website (the #4, it was too dark).  In the attempt to use a hair color that's less toxic than the usual boxed colors, I have switched to this and mixing my own.  Have to put down towels everywhere, though, as it spreads if you get one drop anywhere but your hair, vs. the cream types I was using from the box.  BUT..in the end, if it's a healthier option for me then I will keep using it.  This particular color was the perfect dark brown for me.
150334	informative	Great product! Have bought twice now! Had a problem and they answered me within minutes to help me solve the issue! Really have seen a difference in my face scars very quickly! They have also made the smell much better!
130029	somewhat	Recommend!
239153	somewhat	Nice nail polish organizer. Fits all my nail polishes and some space for more. I use OPI and Chinaglaze polish and fits perfect.
194879	somewhat	It works really well for joint pain
370513	uninformative	Mystical and powerful
183156	informative	Shipping was quicker than I had anticipated and the necklace looks great! I can't wait to wear it with my Halloween costume!
32899	uninformative	Just ok not great
61740	informative	It is suppose to be a rotating barrel.  It doesn't rotate as I expected.  I do like the ability to remove and clean the brush
67314	informative	This is the first item that I have purchased that I actually had to send back.  The item does not stick to anything in my shower.  Very disappointed with this product
73977	uninformative	El producto me llego en tiempo y forma, todo bien, estoy dispuesto a comprar nuevamente,completamente satisfecha, se los recomiendo, gracias
359960	informative	Light weight and I love the tip for hair separation but there is no protection from the razor sharp bristles which hurt badly when they come in contact with the scalp. If the bristles had rubber tipped ends like high end brushes do, it would be perfect.
256636	informative	I just got this razor yesterday, and was skeptical if the elctric razors effectiveness. Along with the good blades and the lotion and gel it includes it will leave you with a very good shave. Suprisingly it is for everybody, People with sensitve skin should use this also b/c i have sensitive skin and it feels great.
193745	informative	This soap is horrible... One of the commenters said that she used it for washing linen and that's exactly what this should be used for. It was so bad that I really hated my showers since i got this one. Very bad smell too.. I ordered a mistral teak wood soap last time at Amazon and just loved it so I thought I would try something different this time and what a horrible mistake I did choosing this one...
10569	uninformative	Ok
56337	somewhat	Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin
87259	informative	Love this product.  I use it almost everyday.  It smooths my skin and also makes it feel moist. I have dry skin,  so I actually have to put on moisturizer before applying,  but other than that,  it have pretty good coverage,  tones down the redness, and gives me a clean smooth and dewy  look. Application is best with a sponge or a stippling brush. it can cake up in one spot and or wash out the whole face, making it look like the color is wrong. Tried to apply it like I do lotion,  bad mistake. I also like the fact that it has spf, and the pump to keep it from contaminating
356538	uninformative	love it
147491	somewhat	Product was damaged
288338	somewhat	Beautiful color
326490	informative	I don't know if this was really a Essie product because the color kept looking streaky and it rubbed/ chipped within that same day! not worth the money. had to put 4 coats on and even with my top coat it just didn't give off the color or look that i wanted
167521	uninformative	Excellent quality
220586	somewhat	My large lab loved this toy.  It was a favorite for a long time ( until he destroyed it ). I am actually surprised it lasted as long as it did because he played with it a lot!
85653	informative	I got into safety razor use a couple years ago and I found these blades to be a perfect complement to the Merkur razor I use and my face. It's really an individual preference/hair type/face type/razor combination that will determine if they're best for you or not, but these are now tied for my favorite.
300924	informative	This is awesome polish. The color changing effect is great. Both hot and cold colors are gorgeous. For sure use a binder with this. I included a picture of both light and dark.
54071	informative	This cleanser is a very good moisturizer and cleanser.  It is very very good to use and to recommend to others.
296415	uninformative	Uhm I don't know why this is showing up on my items bought list because I never bought this....
295300	informative	I wasn't sure what to expect. Got the large because the reviews say XL is too big. They are wide but flat. Works great for covering a tear in the built-in nipple but otherwise useless. (This is why I bought them so 4stars) Glad I got them for only $9 - not worth it at full price. I think I will get the XL if they are still on sale next time I order.
215617	informative	I was so excited to get this....every time I use it I either turn it off or turn the heat up or down because of the location of the on/off/heat adjustment.  It is located right where I hold it to use the brush.  It should be located somewhere else so when you hold the brush handle, you aren't turning it off&on.
97907	uninformative	Great price for an amazing product!
118926	informative	I thought I don't have to floss any more, but...... my dentist said: Yes, you do! Too bad. But, it works.
316135	somewhat	Cute necklace but the quality is not that great...too flimsy.
266609	informative	Words cannot describe how great Jerry's customer service is. He was very concerned about my satisfaction as a customer. I bought the B Men by Thierry Mugler for Men which I have decided to return for either a refund or an exchange. I decided to exchange the first item with Secret Obsession which I really like. Jerry went ahead and mailed it out my way at no extra charge. He definitely deserves 5 stars and another 5 from me! :):):)  Thank you so much, Jerry. From now on, I will definitely consider checking your perfume(s) list for the future for when I want to buy more.
249768	informative	My 14yo son begged me for this training knife for months before I finally gave in due to his high grades; but not without rules that he cannot take it out of the house nor can he use it to try and hurt anyone or any living thing. That said, it is still in excellent condition and he has gotten good at all the flipping around he does with it. It's light, it's not hard to flip, and it's not coming apart - according to him.
136497	informative	These are pretty great! I think the pigmentation could be more extreme. Some of the shades are way to muted for me (there's quite a few that are more skin toned and nude). Most of these shadows have a slight glimmer to them. They also have a light baby powder scent to them, which is quite nice.  Overall, great for the price!
49936	somewhat	Fabulous and cheaper than down in Disney World
220337	informative	I have the other animals also but i don't know why the cow was the first one to break, since it was my dogs favorite I even bought a second one but broke again after a few hours of playing. Won't recommend for dogs that bite hard and are strong, mine isn't but she manage to break two cowns in a few hours. Have the frog and the chicken and those are lasting longer, she loves those too.
252656	informative	Looks great and shines a lot! Super fast shipping also (came earlier than predicted). Only concern is that the first time I ordered this it fell out without me noticing. Hopefully that won't happen again!
86456	informative	I don't normally have large pores, but sometimes in the summer, my pores will look bigger because of all the sweat from the heat and we all know what that leads to: clogged pores.  This summer was no exception.  I picked up this product at my local drugstore with little to no expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I really liked this product because one bottle has lasted me forever, and I use it daily.  Only two pumps, at most, are needed per application.  I use it as directed on the bottle: On clean skin and moisturize afterwards.  However, I feel that sometimes when it is extra hot and humid out, the moisturizing step is not necessary because it feels as though this product does a good enough job of moisturizing.  Still, I do not recommend anyone skip the moisturizing step -- just because your skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized doesn't mean it necessarily is!  It is not a miracle product, but it really does a good job.  I have used this product for about a month now, and my pores look extremely visibly smaller, even though they weren't very noticeable to anyone except myself to begin with.  I have noticed less clogging in my pores, and my skin is overall healthier.  I have also experienced far fewer breakouts during the time of the month when my hormones go nuts.
7786	uninformative	I had it since October. Maybe used it twice. Now it's broken. Changed batteries and still not turning on. Is there a way to fix it?
320476	uninformative	Its awesome
128804	uninformative	Works great so far.  Really helps clean!
109165	informative	This serves its purpose, but the inside sections are flimsy cardboard & break in a short time. This is the second one of these I bought. It's inexpensive enough to replace.
213874	informative	I read the glowing reviews and wanted to like it very very much. It was ok the first couple of wipes, feels nice but no different from other wipes. It tingled a bit, which I decided was fine....but then it stings and I can't finish the last 2 wipes in the package because they burns! For reference, I have combination skin and lives up North so it's sweaty/oily in the summer but dry/wind chapped and cold in the winter. =(  They do feel refreshing and does not leave my skin dry or oily after using, but the wave of burning/stinging sensation every time I use it means I will be seeking other makeup remover wipes.
222829	somewhat	It was as described. I have no complaints.
91336	informative	This product really works.  I have sensitive skin so only keep it on for about a minute.  My skin feels smooth and clean afterward and I like the scent.
363836	uninformative	Great
365921	informative	Honestly I was worried about buying this. There were no reviews which had me like hmmmm. I went for it anyways and this has got to be without a doubt one of the best items ive bought for myself in a long time. ** The picture shows excatly what came. The Bath and Body Works Hello Beautiful smells amazing, A Thousand Wishes smells great and fits perfectly in my small purse and the bag is big enough to use as an over night bag to stay somewhere. The items came well packages plus came 3 days before the said date. The package came with tracking so I knew where it was at anytime. I would do business with them again.
26150	informative	Mind Blowing... Fantastic and awesome... I really liked it very Nice it is smoother than I thought and extremely good
161229	somewhat	I ordered the 30 count pack and only received the 10 count.
370461	informative	I have a love and hate relationship with Biore UV sunscreens. The texture of this sunscreen is amazing, it has a gel-like texture and it's extremely lightweight due to it being a chemical sunscreen. But unfortunately this contains high levels of alcohol that my oily acne prone skin doesn't get along with. I've finished a bottle of the original Biore UV Aqua Rich SPF 50 sunscreen (blue bottle) and broke me out so bad! I never realized this was the cause until I purchased this one and saw the same results (whiteheads and clogged pores) I had with the blue bottle. I would apply this during the day and within hours of having the sunscreen on, my forehead would become extremely irritated and a bunch of whiteheads & clogged pores would appear. Overall, this is a nice sunscreen for people who aren't sensitive to chemical sunscreens and who enjoy the light airy texture. But in my experience, I don't recommend this to people who have oily acne prone skin due to the amount of alcohol this sunscreen has because it can dry you out and potentially create more acne.
