40541	informative	"I bought this to help floss while enjoying braces. I'm giving it 4 stars because it does a good job and I like the different attachments. What I don't like is the go-cart like motor. HOLY COW! Noise aside, this thing is powerful. Should you make this purchase you'll like the attachment that is suppose to go along the gum line. It's great. There are complaints about the button. I think the on/off switch should have been placed on the handle, but that would have brought electricity closer to water and my mouth... the ""pause"" button on the handle is nice because it allows me to move the pik around freely instead of having my hand firmly on the button. The pik does take some getting used to and is generally messy until you've mastered it. I'm happy with the purchase, but think i'll stick to floss when my braces are off, as it's just as time consuming, portable, and in the end, does a better job if done correctly."
298225	informative	My scalp was itchy after washing it so I was happy to find a locking gel that had something to stop itching.  I read the label and compared it to other anti itch treatments for locks.  Half way through twisting my hair I noticed my fingers were blue.  Blue dye or color isn't listed in the ingredients.  I didn't know what color it would be until I got home and really don't know what the natural color should be for the things mixed in this product.  Finding there is some kind of color in here, makes me wonder what else is in the product not listed in the ingredients.  Whatever the dye/color is in here it has turned my fingers, nails, palms and cuticles blue.  I've washed my hands several times, but it's in my skin. And it hasn't washed off. My hair hasn't completely dried, so I don't know how well the locks will hold. I also don't know if it will address the itching.  I wish I'd known it would turn my skin blue, I wouldn't have bought it. I wish I could take it back.  For people looking for natural solutions to itching/flaking scalps, or for a good lock gel, I'd choose something other than this product. I didn't even want to give this product one star. In fact I'd like to give it a negative three.
216324	somewhat	Nothing like advertised...its not even gold looking....misleading
14406	informative	"I keep my hair and goatee very short and I have been trimming my own hair for 10 years.  I am not an expert on hair trimming products but during the past 10 years I have used Wahl, Oster, Conair corded trimmers.  I have also used Braun and Norelco cordless shavers.  I purchased this product because I was looking for a product that could trim my goatee and serve as a travel trimmer for my hair.  Although I intended to order it from Amazon, I needed it more immediately and therefore purchased the T970 from a Target retail store for $39.99 (on sale).  I normally do not write reviews but I was surprised at the disparity of reviews for this product.  Most people either loved it or hated it.  I also became skeptical of some extreme reviews (positive and negative) when I saw the same exact reviews found at places such as Target.com.  I hope the following will be helpful to others:  I recommend visiting a store (e.g., Target) such as I did to see the competing products from Walh and Remington.  Both offer vacuum trimmers that are priced a little less than this product.  In the store, I confirmed my initial decision to buy the Norelco T970 because of the smaller form factor, the 2 year warranty and the no-hassle, 60 day money back guarantee from Norelco (used or not).  The product comes with a cleaning brush, travel bag, thorough instruction pamphlet and heavy (though compact) AC wall adapter.  The unit is reasonably well constructed.  It is likely the lightest trimmer or cordless razor out of any I have used.  The hair trimmings compartment is easy to remove but did not fall out during usage.  The dial to adjust the trim length is easy to use (but does take two hands to turn).  It has 9 settings and #1 is the shortest.  The guard does come off for close-up trimming but did not come off unintentionally during usage.  I charged the unit until the top (of five) LEDs began to blink fast to indicate it was finished charging.  This took 55 minutes.  I turned on the unit and was ready to begin.  It is definitely the loudest trimmer I have used secondary to the vacuum component.  It is probably has about 1.5x to 2x the noise of my current Oster or Conair corded trimmers.  I doubt this will matter to most people.  I was impressed by the precision of the device.  It can cut your facial hair and hair on your head very short and even.  I typically use the ""blending"" guard on the Conair trimmer for my goatee.  The #3 setting on this device left my hair about the same length.  The #1 setting is extremely tight and will give you a 5 o'clock shadow look.  I used the #4 setting on the rest of my head without difficulty.  The vacuum component was definitely not perfect and I needed to take the guard off once to unplug the opening of the vacuum with hair trimmings.  However, the vacuum compartment did get about 75%-85% of the trimmings.  You will still need to wipe the sink (and take a shower if you are doing your entire head) but clean-up is easier.  Summary:  The advantages of this unit:  -60 day money back guarantee (used or not) from Norelco  -Lightweight and decent design  -Easy to use and very precise trimming  -Ability to use corded or cordless  -Quick charging time of about 1 hour for 40 minutes of use  The disadvantages of this unit:  -Ni-Cad battery (therefore battery ""memory"" and shortened battery life if you forget and leave it plugged in or use the cord while trimming)  -The battery is not replaceable  -Relatively noisy compared to other corded trimmers and cordless razors  -No stand or hard case (it does not rest well on a flat surface)  -The vacuum feature does not mean you can stop cleaning the sink.  It just means clean up time will be shorter.  The VERDICT:  For $39.99, I am satisfied with this unit.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I would probably recommend this device to those that need a good, all-around device for trimming their mustache, beard, goatee in addition to something that can pull double-duty and cut short hair (on your head)."
94353	informative	I have PCOS and get my cycle only 2 times a year.  I was on birth control but I gained 15 pounds.  I went off bc hoping the progest cream would help me get regulate my cycles.  I have been using it for 4 months 21 days out of the months 2 times a day and I have had my cycle every month!  It helps me sleep better and my mood is even, I love it!
64245	somewhat	Soft and readily absorbed -
167520	somewhat	Came fast and as described.  I did not have any issues with leaking during transit.  It seams to be a good quality bottle of tea tree oil.
69368	informative	"I tried this product expecting two things--that it would leave a strong manly scent and that it would be ""rough"" on my skin, even with it calling it a hydrator.  Well much to my surprise, it didn't do either of those. Instead Gillette created a subtle smelling, gentle body wash that does seem to actually help relieve mild dry skin.  It lavthers decently but does not create a lot of suds so you will use more actual product them some competing products.  The scent is decently strong during use but does not stay with your at all after your bath--for some folks this will be a plus (as you can let your deodorant and/or cologne not be overpowered but for others they will view this as a loss, requiring another product--further increasing the cost per use.  It seems to clean decently and for me (with very dry skin) it doesn't seem to leave me feeling dirty (nor stripped dry) like some products do. But if you have normal to oily skin, this product is NOT FOR YOU as it will leave a film on your skin. If you doubt this, attempt to use the product for making bubbles in a bath tub. Unlike most body washes like AXE, this product doesn't make many bubbles and instead forms little blue balls that will stick to the edges of the tub. Those balls is what is left on your skin when you use the product normally--something that is good for folks with very dry skin but bad for others that have healthier skin oil production.  Overall a good product for men AND women with dry skin--don't let the brand scare you away, but understand are paying extra for the hydration via more usage and zero remaining scent."
55948	informative	I received my brushes, I opened one, loaded it on to my Rotadent and after 3 times use a bunch of brush came off the tip,now the tip looks much skinnier! So I'm not happy with this product and I think it's because it's not from ZILA. I've always been happy with ZILA brushes in the past. What am I supposed to do with these 3 brushes?I need to replace these with ZILA brushes.
164580	informative	Not as attractive as I thought it would be.  And when I took it off, I found it more complicated to get back on.  Maybe it didn't fit right, but it broke, and that was that.
227588	uninformative	love it
82736	informative	Very nice blades, lasts me 3 shaves min apiece. These blades don't irritate my skin or cause razor burn like some of the others. Read another reviewer that talked about only using 2 passes and maybe 3 for your wedding day, he was spot on. These will change your life.
313348	uninformative	difficult to use
244656	informative	This Stuff Works! It took my body 7-10 days to adjust after a lifetime of anti-perspirant.  After that time period, it really did work...... and it smells just lovely. I live in Bali and it's SWEAT time 365 days a year. What a great way to go natural......... Phiphi
153642	uninformative	Love It!
328377	somewhat	This is one of the prettiest navel rings in my collection and I absolutely love it!
320848	informative	"I had a revlon crackle 1"" hair straightener and this one works better. It is however bulkier feeling but the amazing looks of it makes up for that. It also came with a heat resistant pad which was great.  Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discount or or free in return for my honest opinion. With that said I only request to review products which I feel would get used as often as anyone else purchasing said item. I also only request products that I myself or my immediate family can thoroughly test. If anything changes/breaks I update my reviews. I do not always give 5 stars, quite often I find myself giving 3 or 4 stars but have given many 1 star review as well. If I received a damaged product and they accepted the exchange at no further cost to me including shipping then I review the product based upon the second one I receive."

220379	informative	I received the frog toy as a present for my dog on Christmas.  She loved it so much, but she had played with it so often it no longer croaked. It lasted about a year.  She loved it so much I decided to buy another. I bought the cow and the frog. The second my dog saw the cow toy she started running in excitement all over the room. She loves them so much she can't decide which one to play with, so she trys to carry them both at the same time. The noise is her favorite part. Great price, great toy, and happy puppy. Will buy again.
38158	informative	Bought this for my daughter who takes great care of her teeth. Always flossing. So this seemed like a good gift for her and she loves it.
221524	informative	Does an OK job. But will not replace my actual hair straightener. I don't necessarily think I would recommend either but it's not awful.
162302	informative	"As other reviewers have noted, this product is very light both in coverage and color. I normally wear ""light"" in any foundation but am a ""medium"" in this product. Looks darker from tube than it is when you apply. Blends fine. I love this product specifically for travel. It meets security standards, it's all-in-one coverage, and meets my have to get going FAST mode when traveling and don't have time for a detailed routine. Doesn't cover my sun damage spots much, but at least provides sun protection and evens out skin tones. Just know it will not provide a perfect, flawless, matte finish as a normal separate primer/foundation/powder would. For that reason, 4 stars, because the advertising implies that it will."
300022	informative	"The cleaner gets 5 stars but just be aware this particular product is 2 refill bottles only. There was no box as shown in photo.  I thought I was getting 2 dispenser bottles I could use at various sinks. Both bottles arrived wrapped together in clear plastic and obviously leaked in transit, so it was messy to unpack.  Bottle openings are 1.5"" or so, and not the easiest thing to pour into a smaller refill. Kind of disappointing but dang, this stuff is brilliant at keeping germs from spreading in your house. Highly recommend during every cold/flu season. It's somewhatdrying, so I use lotion after scrubbing, but I like knowing I'm getting seriously clean hands, especially after getting grubby with chores & housework."
113429	somewhat	i was looking for a more matted blush that was still bright and thought this was perfect!
200340	somewhat	Great quality!  Love the bag and the seller was great!  Customer service was excellent!!
247619	informative	I liked it it can serve as a peel off base coat or a skin peel to protect your skin!
260553	informative	Great mirror. The right kind of magnification. You do not have to but your nose to the mirror to diminish the distortion. You can check your teeth to make sure that you got all of the plaque removed. Very good for makeup application. Just what I was looking for.
41933	informative	I've used electric shavers for close to 40 years.  Braun, Remington, Panasonic, Norelco, you name it, I've tried it.  I had a Braun that was doing a decent job but took a long time (4-5 minutes) to complete a good shave and get all the hairs.  I saw the reviews on this shaver and decided to try it.  When I first turned it on boy was I surprised at the volume!  I don't have a dB meter, but it's loud enough that my daughter, upstairs in another part of the house, complains that it wakes her up.  However, if it did a great job in a short time I'd be accepting of the racket. Alas it did not. It consistently left long hairs on my throat that I had to use the trimmer to get and then go over again with the regular foil.  And on top of that, it was no faster than my Braun and shaved no closer - surprising because my Braun's head was 18 months old and the Remington was brand new.  Does hold a charge well and fits well in the hand.  I'm disappointed and going back to the Braun.
98774	uninformative	Fit as expected and long lasting as well
322317	uninformative	great price
295447	uninformative	Thank you
361852	informative	"It doesn't look like the photo. The head is so tiny it would take forever to use on even a ""tweens"" face. Unless you look way back in reviews you don't see there are not replacement heads available.  The head itself is so soft that I don't think it would even clean properly.  It's not even worth the great lightening deal sale price.  Don't waste your time getting as you would likely return it or be disappointed in what it really is."
110832	somewhat	Best stuff I've found for the eczema on my hands and I've tried A LOT of different products. Aquaphor works wonders!!!
128394	informative	I would never be without a Waterpik. Works well, plenty of oral attachments and lots of controls.  It's the best device for oral care.  Our family now has two.  Everyone is satisfied.
118570	somewhat	only came with 2 flowered pet compartment.....
185247	informative	We used this product on our kids in July and August 2009 at Gulf Shores, AL.  I swam in the ocean as well, almost as much as my kids but without this product.  I had no jelly fish stings, and my son's had seven stings between them.  So, I cannot say this product works at all.  Keith Walker
35193	uninformative	Muy bueno
253387	informative	Impossible to get that last two inches of hair flattened with a brush because there is no way to apply pressure when you get to the ends of the hair with a hot brush.
351341	uninformative	Great product.
186508	somewhat	Still using this now over a year.  Last one lasted 8 years!!!
319524	somewhat	Very cute, got lots of compliments on these when I wore them out on a boating trip.
168590	uninformative	Good product, works. Donna
200981	somewhat	Works really good. I thought it wasn't going to work but I was extremely happy with it.
340685	informative	I've used ceramic bits from Beauticom before and haven't had a problem with them. They are a lot easier to use than the traditional drill bits.
159520	informative	I'm using the product and I see some lightening of the dark spots.  I'm pleased with the cream and have had no irritation or redness.  It goes on smoothly and evenly.
270198	uninformative	Just what my arthritic shoulders demanded.  Thank you!!
307921	uninformative	Like product
226045	informative	I have enjoyed changing over from the normal brushes to this large sandalwood comb.  I have hair down to my butt and I try to not use brushes because i have thick wavy hair. This is a greatly constructed product. The solid wood piece makes me feel like I could have this for the next 50 years and nothing could break this comb. I got a discount on this comb in order to leave a review but not for my opinion which is honest and true. My son also has allowed me to comb his hair with this and he always complains but this time he didn't and he loves this comb.  Wide tooth natural high quality wooden comb can be used for detangling and styling. Anti static sandalwood comb is scented with large circular handle for ease of use. Use to distribute oils throughout hair and massage scalp for increased blood circulation. Includes pink toiletry bag.
164617	somewhat	Love these things.  Use to have bleeding gums now no problems .  My dentist said keep using them!!
253161	somewhat	This product really can't replace a flatiron. It is too heavy and bulky to style effectively. It generally takes out some waviness, but ends are left frizzy because you don't have the ability to apply tension to them
274338	informative	This is my go-to color for a nice rose/pink that is not too pink, not too brown, not too anything offensive. I top it with a lighter gloss and it lasts a long time. I have bought many other kinds of lipstick and lip colors and I always come back to this.
160818	informative	This is amazing it works great. My bed is right by windows so it is super bright so when  the sun goes up I wake up. Using this I sleep in till 12. It's amazing but my head is the size of a peanut so It sometime slips off but other than that it's great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1816	informative	No problem with the quality.  Very sturdy with good weight and nice design.  I should have paid closer attention to the width opening for the brush because it does not fit my Art of Shaving badger brush.  No problem though, since my next brush will not be purchased from that company (just too expensive) and I will make sure it fits.
315083	informative	The product itself is really great. I love this line, but I got a bottle that isn't functioning correctly. The base is not moving up as the product is being used, so it's nearly impossible to get the moisturize out.
287627	somewhat	Great quality at a very reasonable price
49218	informative	I've been using Norelco shaving systems for a number of years now.  I love shaving in the shower - saves time, mess and gives me a closer shave.  It had been a few years since I bought a new unit when this item came up for sale.  I decided to go with it as the new floating heads intrigued me.  This is the best version of this shaver yet.  It gives an amazing close shave.  I love the new way they've integrated the saving balm into the heads. Be sure to give it a few days before making final judgements as even though I've been using electric shavers for 20 years now, my skin and facial hair had to get used to this one.
215954	uninformative	nice !
365394	informative	I just got the package today, and wanted to go ahead and rate this. I will update once it's used. I'm currently waiting for my acrylic powder to come in so I can do them.  The customer service is great. They respond in less than a day and even respond to make sure that you aren't unhappy.  The package will take toward the end of the date range. Keep in mind it has to go through customs. Be sure you are home. Mine had to be  redelivered as it needed a signature. The post office makes it easy so no worries in that.  You get a lot for your money!! The bottles of polish are your average sized ones. It comes with all referenced. I was pleased and am super excited to get this new craft rolling. The UV lamp is big, but I have no issues, as long as it gets the job done!!  So far, so good!!
151482	informative	This is the best toothbrush for kids who hate brushing.  In the one minute training mode, it quickly cleans their tiny teeth with precision.  The smaller kid friendly heads last a long time.  For siblings there is a customizable sticker set so you can tell the brushes apart fro one another.  Battery lasts over a year and working great.  Excellent product.  Ages 3 and up.
254949	uninformative	I liked the size and colors but they made my nose irritated and infected so it's a no for me
203683	somewhat	A very light weighted moisturizer...a watery consistency...so it absorbs quickly by the skin. The fragrance is quite strong and it does take a while before it goes away.
235458	informative	I just got this delivered today and immediately unboxed it and tried it out. I'm a black woman and about 5 mo ago I decided to stop using chemicals in my hair (had a body wave). As you can imagine, my hair was getting very hard to comb through as the new growth really started to kick in. I had tried a flat iron (for the first time) a few days ago and it was soooo time-consuming and I did not like the results. My hair is VERY thick and I thought my arm would fall off so I did it kind of half-assed. With that experience I knew I would probably never use the thing again.  Anyway, I plugged up the brush and it heated very quickly, in moments it was ready. I put it on 150C starting out. I increased to 160 since it seemed to work better on a higher setting for my hair.  Now, I have seen bad reviews on here saying how it didn't work at all or not that well. I am wondering if these people had the setting up high enough. Also, if the temperature was high enough, how were you brushing it through your hair? The key is to SLOWLY brush your hair. You also cannot use it like a regular brush, meaning you should do a section at a time and use one hand to hold the hair and give it some tension as you brush through it. That's what I did, anyway. It's no different a concept than using a hot comb (only much safer and much more unlikely you will burn your ear off lol).  So, as far as the actual product goes, it's great. It does what it says it will do, assuming you are using it properly. I honestly don't know how I have lived without this in my life for so long. My only gripe (which, I felt, wasn't reason to lose any stars) is the placement of the on/off and temperature buttons. It is a very inconvenient place and you WILL accidentally hit the buttons while you are brushing your hair. It's just not a good place to put the controls. I feel it should be further down on the handle and perhaps on the under side of it, as opposed to the side of the handle or the back. The user manual also leaves a little bit to be desired. I doubt a native English speaker wrote it. You will get the gist of what's going on though. Even though the controls are in Celsius, you can change it to Fahrenheit. Just don't ask me how this is accomplished because it is not in the manual. The change was triggered by my numerous, accidental, button presses toggling between C and F and I didn't pay attention to what was actually initiating the change. One of the previous reviewers said there is a way to lock the controls by pressing power so many times but left out how many times lol... I may update my review if I play with it to actually unlock this hidden power.  tl;dr  Buy it, learn how to use it, and you will love it!
149005	somewhat	Sets makeup better than any primer i have ever used , thank you Jessi Smiles
306219	somewhat	It arrived on time, but the hair was falling out of it, and was much shorter than described or photographed.
210106	somewhat	I LOVE it! I can't tell the difference honestly and it lasts just as long as the expensive one!
260790	informative	Excellent product. Nice clean smell. Drastically reduces that after tan smell. Great moisturizers. So far, a big fan of all the Squeeze tanning products.
276444	somewhat	The only reason I gave this a poor review is because it doesn't look like the picture, instead of red wings it says Detroit red wings in much smaller print. The quality is also lower than I expected. Honestly I'm a little disappointed.
319375	informative	I love these! I've always used Jamberry (which I do like), but I love the designs of these! I'm on my second set right now.  These are infinitely easier to use than some other brands and much more reasonably priced.  You don't have to use heat, just clean your nails, find size, apply, cut off extra, file, and clear coat.  These last a little over a week on me, which is about the same or better than regular polish.  Tattify customer service is amazing as well :)
68819	somewhat	It does the job and looks good on the counter when not being used.
64016	somewhat	I realy like this cream and it smells wonderful.
193469	somewhat	It was perfect and arrived in a timely manner.
293578	somewhat	This is a piece of crap. I wore it once and it broke before the day was over.
222363	uninformative	I ordered the Pink one and well...
68069	informative	I had to try the Axe detailer tool when it came out because I'm a Axe fanatic. I use Axe body spray, body wash, deoderant, everything they make. While their shower tool was a little weird getting used to in the beginning, I find it hard to not use it now. I love it and anyone who does labor work like myself such as warehouse or construction work, you will really enjoy the rough side of the tool for your feet. I say that anyone who is a little interested in this product just needs to try it. It was worth it for me.
114586	somewhat	great shampoo bar, seems to last a long time.
290852	uninformative	Not as advertised
316502	somewhat	Was using a very expensive (no longer available at my pharmacy) soap for my Rosacea.  This is a wonderful alternative.  Helps me control breakouts without drying my face out.
279120	uninformative	good
340711	informative	This soap's packaging is different from the photo on the vendor's site.. Asquith and Somerset make's the best soaps! Fan since 2010 and they last for more than 38 days.. The bars are very big..The packaging for each soap is so unique..It's well worth the buy..They make a perfect gift too!
186935	somewhat	Works great! Recommend 100%
80614	informative	I've been using Axe Shower Gel for quite some time and love it. It became somewhatdifficult to find this particular fragrance locally, and in the larger size, so I order it from Amazon. The price is a bit lower too. All in all, it's very good. And yes, women like it :)
282767	informative	I bought these for music festivals, not for use on nails. For my purpose they are WONDERFUL! Perfect size and the colors were great! I wish I had gotten more yellow/gold colors but I cannot complain for the price. Will buy again once they run out. They did take about 3 weeks to arrive, so that was a long wait, but well worth it! Would not arrive in time if you bought them last-minute before a show.
165938	informative	I've struggled with sensitive teeth for about 15 years due to a history of brushing too hard. Worn down enamel in 3 quadrants of my mouth has caused pain when eating sweets or anything cold.  Sensitive toothpaste daily takes the edge off -- more so with sweets than cold. I got the opportunity to try crest sensi-strips free thru Bzzagent & really likthe right time since I ran out of sensitive toothpaste and had been using regular toothpaste for a few days. The strips were small so maneuvering them in the back of my mouth was a little tricky at first. I liked that they only needed to be on for 10 min & didn't have much of a taste. I used them before bed so that I wouldn't eat/drink anything for 30min after.  I tested the efficacy the next day and noticed I had no pain at all when eating a candy bar (a first), but slight pain lingered when holding cold water in my mouth near the most sensitive areas. It was less than before, so I considered it a success! Three weeks later the sensitivity is a little more noticeable but still better than sensitive toothpaste alone.
311081	informative	I fit all my earrings in here. Good thing about this storage is that it's visible so I can see everything I have in once glance. I would recommend it.
179551	somewhat	Used it for my wedding day. I  had several compliments. The come was a hit short. Bobby pins did the trick
82508	somewhat	People have different preferences, however for me these Russian blades are the best.
27571	somewhat	too light ... loses charge and the accesories keep breaking now and then ....fragile
3905	somewhat	Solid Stand and nice to look at !
231731	informative	My go-to lotion for the winter.  Have been using this for 15+ years.  Heavy & ready to take down any form of dry skin, but too heavy for summer, at least for me.
78589	informative	"I already own a Gillette Fusion Power Phantom and a Gillette M3Power Razor.  When the initial specs for the Gillette Fusion Power Gamer were announced, we were promised 100% backwards-compatibility.  This was great news, as I already had several cartridges from the previous systems.  Being able to use those old cartridges was a major factor when I decided to upgrade.  Apparently that promise to a back seat to cost-saving measures, as the current compatibility is practically non-existent.  NONE of my GMP3 cartridges would work with the GFPG.  They literally would not fit.  I looked for an expansion slot, but I couldn't find anything.  The GFPP cartridges actually fit, but I had terrible results.  Of the ones I tried, only two actually worked.  Most of them wouldn't boot up at all.  Some of them would work for a minute or two and then just lock up.  Even the ones that ""worked"" had resolution issues.  They produced a very grainy texture and had a ridiculous amount of pop-up.  The end result was unshaveable at best.  And the last cartridge I tried ended up bricking the GFPG.  That's right, the unit will no longer power up.  Totally dead.  WTF am I supposed to do with a razor that won't turn on?  There are rumors of a firmware upgrade in the near future, so hopefully these issues (not GMP3 obviously) will be resolved.  In the meantime, I suggest people avoid this product, or at the very least avoid using GFPP cartridges until backwards compatibility is confirmed."
67151	somewhat	I bought this for my son and it started working immediately. I was absolutely impressed. We had tried everything else before this and nothing worked. A friend told me to try this, sure enough it worked great.
164245	somewhat	Nice, very soft leather. It has two roommy pockets.
2993	informative	Purchased the Perfecto Badge Brush and wanted to make sure that I was drying it properly.  The perfecto stand is high quality and holds my new Perfecto Brush and razor well.  Just took my shaving experience to the next level.
208661	uninformative	Ok
179643	somewhat	This product is the real deal, very concentrated magnesium chloride and I like that it is sourced from nature. It was a little too much for me as just a soothing oil but definitely helped the restless leg syndrome.
173221	informative	"There is a lot of brush kit on the Inet, I mean, A LOT. Chinese coping chinese coping some brand. Is very difficult to pick one, all looks almost the same on picture, but when it arrives you see the super bad quality. This ""brand"" BESTOPE is obviously a cheap chinese brand but is outstanding quality for the price, making them the best on the cheap group. I stopped buying the chineses unbranded (normally pink), there was a lottery the quality. If you are looking for an affordable kit, with VERY acceptable quality, this is the best choice."
306878	informative	So pretty. Wash well. Would definitely recommend !
324226	somewhat	Love the smell and the quality of the product.
99394	informative	IF POSSIBLE I would order Village Naturals bath crystals by the keg,,,, I have bought many of their items and have not gotten one that I didnt enjoy... This time, I bought 3 of everything just  in case they change the scents or quit making..
90556	somewhat	This works great!!! Super silky and dangling.
4851	somewhat	I have always loved Satin Hands.  It feels so good on my skin.  I can tell the difference immediatel after applying it to my hands.
256548	informative	My mom gave me this as a gift from about 10 years ago. It's an amazing device. I originally complained to my mom when I started growing facial hair and before I could start buying disposable razors - she gave me this. Thanks mom - I've never had to spend a dime for facial shaving products.  PROs - good battery life - durable, I've dropped it a few times and actually broke the swivel notch for the trimmer but used crazy glue to repair it - I dropped it again so the notch is loose but seems to be swiveling open/close fine - make and finish is amazing, no signs of wear and tear, the plastic or material used is perfect for hair or water - it's easy to clean even when hair gets inside the cracks, just need to tap it a few times and it comes out - unless you want to open the device with some torx screw driver - easy to take apart for extensive cleaning - you can take it for travelling easily - you can shave while it's charging  CONs - even after over 10 years, nothing comes to mind  So impressed with this brand that I'm looking into their new 3d models. I would recommend this shaver even now competing with the newer models. I think I'm going to rebuild mine and keep it as a back up. It's still available in certain sites even in 2011.
162721	uninformative	THAT IT IS FINE
225985	informative	I love this case. It's really too pretty to use. It fits great and I have no problems using the buttons on my iPhone 6s Plus.
298477	somewhat	Cute but cheap. My daughter broke it in the first hour
171912	somewhat	This smells so good. Better than more expensive rose creams.
80171	uninformative	Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!
132830	informative	I really enjoyed the ease and efficiency of this waterpik and being able to adjust the strength of the flow to get in between tightly spaced teeth but after about 20 uses the hose connecting the water pik to the outflow on the bottom came loose and started leaking.  This caused a mess and a drop in pressure.  I've since had to reinsert the hose every time I use it at least twice.  It's such a hassle and so poorly designed I really regret getting this.  If it weren't for that flaw, I would give 5 stars.
242597	somewhat	The sandalwood kind of smells like bug spray, but the product works and makes sure your pits don't smell all day- which is all you can really ask for in a deodorant.
96519	informative	Alcohol free toner is the way to go, so that your face doesn't get too dried up. I don't understand how some companies can charge so much for toner! I have always liked a lot of L'Oreal's products, so once I saw the price on the HydraFresh toner, I had to purchase two of them right away. So far so good, it certainly does leave my face feeling very fresh. The bottle contains 8.5 fl oz's which is pretty typical for toners, sometimes bottles may come smaller.  I think I skipped this toner a few times prior to my first purchase because the bottle was pink. I just assumed it was for women, which it's not. It's toner, uniform, nothing feminine about it. You should always still moisturize after using toner anyway.
341411	uninformative	Made in Thailand
220639	informative	I recently had an injury that has basically left my right arm pretty useless for the next several months. I'm one of those girls that have naturally wavy hair no matter what I do and the only way to get it nice and straight is with  a flat iron.  Having my right arm out of commission makes this a pretty impossible task. So when I saw that this brush could also help me straighten my hair I was really interested. I can use this with my left hand and get my hair nice and straight the way I like it. It's so simple to use, and the display that shows you the temperature is really easy to read. There are buttons that will allow you to increase or decrease the temperature so you can get it to exactly what you want. At first I was a little concerned that it might burn me but there are tips to the bristles that don't get hot so that you don't have this issue. It's as simple as plugging in, picking the right temperature and then brush your hair! I do recommend that you work on smaller sections at a time like you would with a flat iron. If you try to do too much at one time it will tame it for sure but not get as straight as you want just because it can't reach the hair underneath. I'm really happy with this and it has definitely helped me in my current situation. I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, this is 100% my honest opinion after personally trying this brush :)
343356	informative	I use right after toner, it helps keep the moisture locked in the skin. Highly recommend!
289208	uninformative	Good deal.
91353	informative	Love this product.  Guilty pleasure in light of harmful for enviro microbeads but as a tradeoff I no longer buy other microbead products.  I live in Michigan and when my skin gets dry this is the best.  You only need a little bit in the dry months and this small tube has lasted me a year so well worth the price.
56507	somewhat	Great Product; does wonders for colored treated hair.
179114	informative	I started moisturizing once or twice a day and found out a lot of the products I used previously were full of chemicals, even though they were marketed as very clean. I use SkinResource MD oil-free facial and the body moisturizers and love the light, clean feeling and look of my skin. I used it for my wedding and I have this gorgeous sheen to my skin in the photos, I can't imagine had I not discovered this in advance.
56940	uninformative	Excellent product.
23423	informative	"While this product performed beautifully, making the size curl I needed while keeping my hair from slipping on the bore, it only worked three times. Had it not stopped working, it would have been an unbelievably helpful tool. When I tried to rate  it only two stars, but definer came up as ""Hated It!"" I don't hate it; I hate the fact it stopped working."
326383	somewhat	Sorry for delay .... When I received the ball it was flat on one side .
325887	somewhat	Like this product for my alcohol ink projects.
151626	informative	Our son finally turned 6 and received his first Sonicare. He had been using the disposable themed electric toothbrushes, so this was an easy transition. Make sure you read the instruction with your children so that you both know what the beeps and pauses mean. Other than that, it does the usual excellent job that is expected of a Sonicare toothbrush.  There are two models of this brush, one being green and this being blue. From what I could tell, there is no describable difference in performance, only in head and price. This unit accepts the newer style push on head found on most of the higher line of Sonicares, albeit slightly smaller in size.
66747	uninformative	Good item(;
325328	uninformative	This is the best product!
134961	informative	I was told by the dental technician about this product after she had me in the chair for an eternity cleaning the tartar deposits .I bought this on her recommendation and I am thrilled with the product. The price was right and free shipping was an added bonus. The price at the store I usually shop at was about $10 higher and they had sold out their stock of water picks. All in all I am pleased with the product and so are my teeth. Marv C SE Florida
182653	informative	Love the width.  A little tight but I do have a bigger head than normal.  I love having something that I can throw on over my wet twist or braids when I need to roll or just because.
231920	somewhat	Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used
133166	informative	sturdy and very easy to use.  great water pressure - haven't had a chance to try all the attachments yet.  so far, the water pick works great !  would definitely recommend.
363821	informative	Love love this root comb applicator. It really gets the job done and help distribute oil in places your normal hands couldn't have reached. It's a must have for all those with hair prone to dry quickly.
238395	somewhat	Very Nice Wig ... Love it it fits perfect and is fun to wear .. feels soft  Thank you for sending it fast and effeicient !!
191256	somewhat	My favorite foundation. Great coverage and not too heavy!
304336	informative	"Perfect cream for an aging surfer that the sun exposure has finally caught up to.  Goes on smooth with a robust but not-too-strong smell.  Feels and looks good on contact; gives the skin around my eyes a nice luster, immediately replacing that ""ashen"" look at comes from tired skin.  No chemicals AT ALL.  This is the real deal."
362558	informative	This was a gift for a fellow barber. She loved it, it was just the right size to fit on a barber jacket without getting in the way. She always wears black and gold accessories, so this fit perfectly with her everyday wear. It was a nice quality, especially for the price. I would buy again!
160405	uninformative	Works as advertised!
360123	somewhat	Waste of time and money. Horrible product!
222504	uninformative	Love it
124828	informative	"These are some of the best combs I've used.  They hold very securely and are nice looking without being showy.  My only ""complain"" is that mine were shipped from China and I try to buy from USA sellers only.  I also wish they were available in brown.  No complaints tho."
100083	somewhat	This is a husband tamer! Even he can put the rolls on the holder, and the stash at the bottom is very handy, too. Love these (I bought two).
39095	informative	Excellent product for good dental health!  I use it every night to make sure I have no leftovers around my teeth and in my gums to stave off cavities.  Add a little Listerine to help prevent cavities and bad breath.
209444	informative	I love the way this makes my hair feel. It does not weigh it down, and feels silky and clean. My hair started out baby fine, then when I had to be put on methotrexate to treat 2 autoimmune diseases, it began thinning and changing very quickly. It is horrible to physically feel unwell, but then your ego takes a hit and you feel so unattractive and it hurts to look in a mirror and feel clumps of hair missing. This Elizabeth Parker hair treatment, along with Biotin Shampoo for Hair growth and Boldify thickening spray made such a difference instantly. My hairdresser also got me onto Joico Tint Shot to spray a color of texture to hide the bald spots along the parts. I'm sorry for being superficial, but it did boost my spirits.
370423	somewhat	No good did no thing for my hair its only for straight hair already I have curly hair
326890	somewhat	This is an excellent leave in conditioner. Not sticky and does not weigh down your hair.
358349	somewhat	These are really strong and the perfect length.
132221	informative	I purchased one about 6 months and bought second as a gift for parents.  Does what is suppose to do.  Only thing is, it would be nice to have some information on how to clean it.
60757	somewhat	"I bout this for my mother and she was looking at me and I read in her eyes ""What are you crazy?"" but next morning she was so impressed and still thank me for this little miracle!!! For her it is working and I am happy."
337861	informative	WOW, I'm in love. The foundation powder is incredibly thin, light and silky yet highly effective. I love it so much.....the finishing powder is amazing too, I already bought a larger size.
60743	informative	I bought two bottles of this many years ago at a mall kiosk and still have half a bottle left.  This oil is truly amazing!  I use it for so many different things like spraying in the kid's bath when they are sick, rubbing it on their chests (like Vicks), putting it on sore and/or swollen muscles, rubbing into their temples for headaches and rubbing my daughter's back with it every night at bedtime (soothing).  I love the smell of it and it works really well!  The bottles last forever because you only use a few spritz's.  I also like that it doesn't leave your skin oily.  I recommend this oil for everyone!
256096	somewhat	Very good. Make sure you keep applying everyday or your lips will go back to being dry.
101083	informative	This product is okay, but it leaves a weird residue feel to my hair.  It's not too hard of a hold but yet it still leaves hair crispy.  I just think I don't like gels and will stick with custards and smoothies since my hair is extremely dry.
150221	uninformative	best thing I have found to keep my toes apart!
59979	somewhat	These work better than any other quick drying drops on the market
77426	informative	I has an ingrown pimple in my eyebrow that left the area very red and swollen. A friend suggested I get this product because of its antiseptic qualities. Since this was also very painful, I sent my husband to Walgreens to buy this product. I applied this to the affected area and the pain, redness, and swelling began to dissipate. By Day 3 after using this, everything was gone and I felt fine. This also works on hang nails, sores, and skin infections. Great product but my husband paid about $12 plus tax for this. The price offered here even with shipping is a is far more reasonable.
41840	informative	"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remington-MS2-390-Microscreen-Rechargeable-Corded-Men-s-Shaver/dp/B000H6A02A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver</a>&nbsp;Have had this product for a few years now and it still performs very well.  A comfortable, clean shave without nicks and burning sensation.  Quality product for the price.  Would buy this again."
275455	informative	I ordered this item on June 8th and I received it in the mail on Juen 10th!  Not only that, but what I ordered was out of stock,  so it was replaced with full size orders rather than me having to wait or not recieve it at all. I am a stickler for great customer service and this was excellent. Will be ordering again!!
141677	somewhat	Cheap. Wound up in trash.
263215	informative	This item was sent to me as advertised. It was sent in a timely manner-even earlier than expected. I was very excited because I thought I'd never smell this scent again since the company no longer makes this scent. I'm thinking about ordering another set for my mom as a birhtday gift. I'm so completely satisfied with my order and will definitely order again and again.
637	somewhat	This is a great stand--very easy to keep clean and it looks very nice on the counter...
233132	somewhat	Doesn't work for me, but I will admit I have more problems than most so that could be why.
82545	somewhat	Buy an assortment pack here first. If the Astra works for you, this is the best value purchase!
89533	somewhat	Product cost a lot more in stores. I love this product and now can buy in bulk. Product has a strong hold with little shine.
229719	informative	I think the shampoo works great but the scent is not my favorite. My husband on the other hand loves the smell and thinks it works great. He has tried a lot of different dandruff products and he is so happy to find one he really likes.
347926	uninformative	Great product.
141612	informative	This is the best eyelash glue I have ever used. It is real when you put it on the lashes and turns clear when they are ready - I bought it at a makeup show and been obsessed ever since - also doesn't make your eyes watery since its latex free . Makes lashes Stay on so good
33437	informative	How did I get to be 64 and not know what a great product this is! Impulse purchase in brick & mortar store after reading Amazon reviews. What a difference it makes in both the appearance and feel of my teeth. But one NOW! You will not regret it.
174154	informative	I have to say.... I had higher expectations from this product.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks every night before I go to bed.  I haven't noticed any visible improvement in fine lines, pores, or skin texture.  As a matter of fact, I did notice some drying out underneath the eyes so I stopped using the product in those spots.  One other thing I have noticed is that I do believe it promotes healing on your face.  I get pimples fairly frequently and I have noticed that this product seems to dry them out and shrink them up just about as quickly if not quicker than my normal spot treatment.  I really like that.  But it has not helped out with scar discoloration from those pimples.  All in all, I would like to keep using this product because I feel that its benefits are probably more long-term but for the price... I just don't know if I'm going to because I haven't seen enough of an improvement.
109062	somewhat	Working great for my manicuring needs..thick enough to hold around the nail when stamping or doing gradients
11796	uninformative	ok
200090	uninformative	Very pretty I loooove them
347537	somewhat	A very lovely light hint of pink!  Just remember to blend.  If the light hits your face correctly it can be really bright!
72832	uninformative	Just what I wanted
253612	somewhat	Definitely helps me clean my brushes, not too rough on them either!
63100	informative	Saw the difference within a few days. Two of us have been using this product once a day for about 2 weeks. Only 1 quarter of the tub gone. Definitely recommend
366127	uninformative	Adorable necklace, I love it!!
354044	somewhat	Works great to keep piercings &  re-piercings clean
123569	informative	smells absolutely anazing!!! my children's skin is soft and so clean after using. I have an extremely strong sense of smell and this isn't heavy at all.  I was looking for a bath line without all the harsh chemicals for my children and I have found it!!!
265129	informative	Container was leaking the top when I received it.  Label was placed on the containerl incorrectly making it very difficult to read the content information on the back of the label.  As far as a hair tonic it did not hold hair in place very well.  The Pinaud hair tonic is better, so is Vitalis.
259775	somewhat	Provides good temporary pain relief. It does wash off quickly if you eat something - eating will probably still hurt and you'll need to reapply after. But the best part is it seems to speed healing.
224079	somewhat	Won't shave without it now. Love it!
94324	somewhat	The product arrived in plenty of time for the holidays and the gift was well received! I recommend this product to everyone.
134688	informative	This particular waterpik is great to use, & user frtiendly with several flosser to go with it. You can see all of the food particles fallen out from between your teeth when flossing. I use hot water with adding a little peroxide, this help clean your teeth with a healing for the gums. My teeth looks and feels much better with the use of the Ultra Waterpik. Glad I purchased it.
100242	uninformative	works great and looks nice.
32593	somewhat	your only getting one pair, but your paying for 4
184060	somewhat	I can't breathe, it's too tight. It is a waste of money in time.
203419	uninformative	Great
162578	informative	Love this product! I don't even feel like I am wearing foundation! I highly recommended this. Reasonably priced too! Love
109118	uninformative	Loved it
230925	somewhat	This was absolutely stunning and looked just like the picture! I loved it!!!
300518	uninformative	This is a great product! I have used in moisturizer for my face and in sunscreen.
8183	informative	This little trimmer is EXCELLENT! I like to use it around my bikini area and even with only a few passes through it trimmed almost all my hair. I love that there's 5 different settings so you can get a very close trim without full-on shaving. It's small and fits very nicely in your hand which makes for easy maneuvering. It's a bit loud, but what do you expect with something that has a small motor? Some hair does get stuck/caught on the trimmer and guard but it's easy to clean up with a dry tissue or the small brush that the trimmer came with. Overall I'm really happy with this trimmer, I only wish it was waterproof so I could use it in the shower as well.
349260	informative	I didn't realize how small they were. My fault for not reading the oz. My problem was, one bottle came almost all the empty. Was pretty bummed about that. I'm not entirely pleased with the quality either. Won't be ordering again :(
61095	informative	I like this air brush so far.  Haven't used it enough to see how well it is made.  I dry my hair to damp dry and then use it.  I am sure it is better for my hair than a hot iron I use to use.  My beauty operator recommended this particular hot air brush.
291047	informative	The wallet looks completely different from the one shown on amazon. The one I received is a much darker pink and has a big lounge fly logo on it. It's also not shiny like the picture would have you to believe.
38109	informative	My teeth have never been cleaner.  I highly recommend it.  So I have to say 10 more words so here they are.
65736	informative	Don't just take my word for it, you must try it. A dear friend got me this from Italy 12 years ago and have been using it since, very hard to find it in the US. This shower cream will transform your shower experience, beautiful fragrance living your skin smooth and you will feel completely relax as if you just spent the day at the SPA, I LOVE it it's one luxurious treat for myself! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed but buy it as soon as you find it, like I said, very hard to find it in the US.
35747	informative	IT'S GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I DON'T LIKE. YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS GREAT IN THE MOVIE, BUT WHEN YOU USE IT, IT'S UNDER YOUR EXPECTATION, SO I HAVE TO SAY IT'S JUST OK.
287228	somewhat	Horrible, don't waste your money. They don't even stay filled up for a minute.
177088	informative	I purchased this for my daughter.  He has long, color-treated hair.  The Argan oil brings the color to life and gives is a beautiful soft shine.
301632	informative	My daughter absolutely loves these lace cat ears. She has always been a huge fan of pretending to be a cat and these have helped her creative playing. There is some sparkly black ribbon lace up the sides of the headband to make them look extra fancy. The ears have wire in them and lace stretch over the wire so they are very easily bendable and the lace is thin so they aren't designed to be played hard with but for the price I would definitely order more if need be. These add to any cute kitty lovers and they are look adorable on. The headband is stretchy and doesn't seem like it will easily break and grips the head without being too tight. Vivian has had this on for like a week straight with every outfit and she still look adorable.
