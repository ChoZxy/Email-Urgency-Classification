96	2	Very short downloadable book of short poems interspersed with beautiful illustrations. Even if you don't like poetry you should read this book.
43	1	One of my favorite things to pick up and read for 2 mins or 2 hours...
906	2	A friend gave me this after we found out that I'll be going to Iceland this summer (!!!) It's a very academic text, so it can be a heavy read at times, but I am really enjoying it.
123	3	I've finished the first book of the Faerie Queene, but there is much more to come. I know I won't get back to it until after the new year so this seems a way to mark my progress in this wonderful journey. I'm a bit surprised that no movie has been attempted, at least that I'm aware of. Considering some of the wild attempts over the years to film other allegories, but to be fair, this one is quite long. Well worth the effort however, there is something about the language that just draws you right in the midst of it.
245	2	Oliver is allegedly the finest living poet in the USA. While not exactly a fan of poetry (neutral), I'd read that she uses a lot of references to nature, and that appeals to me. Some poems are very short and some quite long, and yes, she uses a lot of nature symbolism.
727	1	I read this book in high school and then re read it in college. I have since read it again, although it has been years. It is one of my favorite books, it is the model for many many books of the adventure genre. However, the Odyssey does it the best by weaving in fate and patience. I would recommend that anyone who reads this book does so with either a guide to the book or with a group, you miss so much when you don't have someone to discuss this with!
241	2	the book was short   the syllables not counted   nature evoking emotion.
316	3	Thanks to Net Galley for the ARC in exchange for this honest review.   My favorite Kwame book yet.   Blade lost his mother at a young age. Even though he lives a privileged life because his dad is a rock star, that doesn't prevent the rest of his world from falling apart. As Blade looks for love in the right and wrong places, he goes on a quest for truth, wrestles with his demons, finds joy in simplicity, and breathes music back into his soul.   This novel in verse is layered in meaning and beautiful and I am already ready to read it again. It is that good.
36	1	i feel like i just *have* to give this 5 stars..but i have no idea how to talk about it
609	1	Amusing, satirical and obviously poetic description of the meanderings and sojourns of a beloved poet. I really enjoyed it, easily recommended. x
442	1	Perfect in every way. The illustrations are stunning.
712	2	The text for my first semester of senior English.   Mr. Edwards, I know it's been more than twenty years, but you were a brilliant teacher. Wherever you are now, whatever you are doing, I truly hope that life has repaid you generously for the fine work you did with us. I breezed through college English courses in large part because you taught me everything I needed to know. All the rest was just picking good reading lists. Thank you, again. You are part of my brilliant English teacher triumvirate, along with Mr. Rosenberg (6th) and Mr. Schuszler (7th). And how sad is it that all three of you guys stopped teaching?
708	2	Akhmatova seems to be speaking personally to us. Her poetry is so vibrant and individual. Andrey Kneller's translation is seamlessly non-intrusive so I bought his edition of my other favorite Russian poet, Marina Tsvetaeva. I am looking forward to reading his translations of other poets in the future.
5	3	This fun book of children's poetry was a hit with our entire family. Themes of animals, word play, general silliness, imagination verses reality and childhood exploration abound in a sort of modern "Child's Garden of Verses" (Robert Louis Stevenson).   There was one verse that we will skip, Gorilla, which talks about the supposed relationship between man and gorillas, but this problem was confined to the one entry.   We will seek this out many times in the coming years. Highly recommended as a home school essential.
464	3	I have been reading Daniel Mendelsohn's translations of Cavafy: Collected Poems and Unfinished Poems. I have read Rae Dalven's translation of his collected poems, and while I enjoyed them, I continued to migrate my favorite modern Greek poet: Seferis. Mendelsohn's translations are revelatory. I have had several friends tell me that Cavafy's poems read in the original Greek are delicious and beautiful, but, alas, I don't understand Greek. Mendelsohn performs some magic here though.   First and foremost, both books are filled with copious notes providing context, details, and other trivia that illuminate the poems and are, frankly, interesting reading in themselves. His introduction to the Collected Poems states clearly his methodology and discusses important themes in Cavafy's work, which center around two ideas: history and sensuality. With history, Cavafy writes frequently of the collapse and breakdown of the Hellenistic and then Byzantine world. This is not exclusive, but it is a dominate theme. In the sensual area, many of Cavafy's poems are openingly homosexual, though his earlier ones are more closeted and speak powerfully to the consequences of secrets.   Unfinished Poems are the first translations into English of the poems left unfinished at the time of Cavafy's death in 1933. A Greek scholarly edition edited by Renata Lavignini appeared in 1994. Mendelsohn has removed most of the scholarly apparatus and provided these 30 poems and some fragmentary texts. Again copious notes are provided along with relevant variants, but the poems add to the themes of Cavafy's poetry and many are essentially complete.   Cavafy called himself a poet-historian, and that had special implications for him. He sought out truth in his historical settings and obtained multiple sources, but he still wrote poetry, so some of his characters and settings are fictional, though they often discuss actual events and actual people. Years before I had heard of Cavafy, I too had begun writing historically based poems. (None nearly as good as Cavafy's.) Mendelsohn's translations have brought to the fore an affection for Cavafy's historical poems that I had found interesting but not inspiring before. Now I am inspired by his work.   I want to quote a couple of things. The first bears an interesting insight to the rigor Cavafy applied to his poems. Regarding the unfinished poem "The Patriarch" Mendelsohn states: "Lavagnini notes that fully two years elapsed between the first version [a single draft:] and subsequent rewriting." In the press to get items published these days, I wonder how many poets have let an idea percolate for two years?   Finally, I think it only appropriate to quote a short poem. But instead of a historical poem, from the Unfinished Poems, one titled "Birth of a Poem" is pertinent perhaps as an ars poetica:   One night when the beautiful light of the moon   poured into my room...imagination, taking   something from life: some very scanty thing--   a distant scene, a distant pleasure--   brought a vision all its own of flesh,   a vision all its own to a sensual bed...
813	1	GOOD NOVEL FOR ALL AGES!!!
478	1	Witty, wry, great dialog writer. Among my favorite stories are "A Telephone Call", "Big Blonde" and "The Custard Heart".
640	1	always drift back to this around the beginning of summer
554	2	Although the collection as a whole didn't always strike sparks for me, individual lines hammered home and keep reverberating. A few of those that still echo:   "They shredded the moon again she said about the falling snow"--from "Romantic"   "she got the call at ten 'oh' seven / every child in her class began evaporating..."--from the elegy, "Urn like a Whorled Cocoon"   "Pressed to murder for food // you might put your lyre / in a crate and run over it"--from "Not Therapy"
663	1	Review to follow.
781	1	I didn't actually finish this book. I just got kinda bored. I liked little snippets of it but overall it didn't grab me.
732	1	As a "Mad Men" fanatic, I really enjoyed these poems. Instead of predictable, literal re-uses of the characters, Umansky channels the spirit of the show, all that glamour and unfulfilled yearning and TV background chatter. The choppy, surreal style reminds me of the collage of images in the "Mad Men" title credits.
486	1	What a fantastic find. Brilliant.
635	2	I can't remember the last time I started a book and finished it on the same day. The Crossover is an electrifying story written in free verse, poetry, and rap and for this, Kwame Alexander wholeheartedly deserves the Newbery Medal. The reader delves into the lives of twin brothers Josh and Jordan who are young basketball stars dealing with family, school, and coming of age issues. I am impressed that Alexander tackles these heavy themes in verse and that it works as well as it does to convey such a warm and heartfelt story. Any bibliophile or reluctant reader who appreciates basketball will consider The Crossover a memorable book.
77	1	They're all good.
569	2	2009 12 16   If forced to choose, as I was last night, I'd have to say that "Regurgitate" is still my favorite. That's because I was suffering from hyperemisis in my first pregnancy, when my husband gave this to me, and because I've just always loved that word.
280	3	Because Rose is the first collection of poems by Li-Young Lee, it's only natural to assume that Lee's voice and stylistic preferences would undergo changes as he continued traveling the long road toward scholastic recognition; however, since Rose has gained considerable attention and become so frequently anthologized, Lee's sophomore attempt, The City in Which I Love You, is largely overshadowed. In fact, City seems almost pigeonholed by criticism for Rose, which spends much of its time exploring the author's personal history and categorical placement among other contemporary Asian-American poets. I don't think this kind of socio-economic geo-racial profiling is very helpful or essential to City's poems. Interesting but unnecessary.   Reminiscent of Rose perhaps in its rich yet murky symbolism, City's title poem for example is a new and significant development in Lee's technique--the speaker seems to be searching a dream for meaning, and where the old Li-Young might have simply discussed familial or physical love, the new Li-Young seems bent on trading the familiar small pings of sensuality for the larger pangs of longing. Likewise, he exchanges quiet meditation for a darker sort of surrealism. Through this, Lee seems more aware of the dangers of sentimentality and more intent on incorporating a deeper range of emotions to his poems.   By the by, whether a fan or not, read (or better yet, hear him read) "The Cleaving." It is an amazing piece of work.
741	2	This is not my favorite Aeschylean drama, but I found it intriguing that it was, for Aeschylus, a work based on an event his audience would remember...not just a mythological theme. I still prefer the Oresteia trilogy, but this is a must read for Greek drama fans, in general, and specifically for Aeschylus/Sophocles/Euripides fans!!
682	3	When I came across this one in my preparations for Fairy Tale Fortnight, I was immediately struck by the dark and direct tone of the cover, and took it as an indication of the tales found inside. In some ways this is what I got: the retellings are gritty and dark and very pared down, stripped of any residual fairy dust and ball gowns. Koertge plays on the original tales, in all their dark and twisted glory, but he also plays with our Disneyfied modern expectations.   But even though Koertge did sort of give me what I was expecting, it somehow managed to not be quite what I wanted. The book is very brief, tackling 23 different tales in less than 100 pages, including illustrations and title pages for each story. This means each story averages about 2 pages of well-spaced text or free-verse, and this means Koertge only has the space of a few blinks of the eye to make an impression with each story - blink and it's over...   I will say, I think Koertge certainly tried to create memorable, concrete images that would linger with the reader, plunging straight into the heart of each with a wry, jaded style. There's also a really good mix of well-known and little-known tales, and Koertge changes up the narration slightly in each tale. But even the narration at its most different (like Little Red's vapid prattling) still has a sameness to it. Some readers will appreciate this and feel the sardonic tone running throughout is the thread that holds it all together. Other readers - like myself - will feel that what the book really needs is a shake-up. The stories, different as they are originally, blend one into the next in Koertge's hands, and in the end, I would have been hard-pressed to tell you what happened in which, and how - if at all - the narrators differed.   There just weren't any stand-outs. Maybe it's because of my admitted immersion in fairy tales - maybe others who pick this up on a passing fancy, who don't read and breathe fairy tales, will find this fresh - but I felt like I'd seen it all before. This isn't necessarily bad on its own, because these are retellings, after all (so of course I've seen it before), but if you're going to put forth these "little gem" retellings, every effort needs to be made to make each and every one memorable in its own way. And when they're verse on top of that! well, every little bit of space matters. No word should be wasted; they should all serve a purpose. I know I hold things like this to a high standard, but there should be something, some turn of phrase or image or pleasing sound to the language itself that makes each story stand on its own. Instead, these felt (oh god, you have no idea how much it pains me to write this) amateurish. I cringe to write that, I really do, but the stories felt like writing prompts or Creative Writing 101 exercises. And in the end, whether because of their style or brevity, I quickly forgot them.   So maybe others won't feel this way, I don't know. Maybe people who don't eat, sleep and breathe fairy tales, and who haven't read a flipping shit-ton of short story retellings that take very similar tones and tacks to the ones in this book but do so better, will find this collection fresh and entertaining. At the very least, it's easily read in 1 sitting, so I would advise those who are considering picking it up to actually pick it up and flip through a few stories first - they're all pretty much the same, so if you like one, you'll probably like them all.   [And if instead you're looking for short fairy tale retellings with a variety of stories, styles, and twists, I cannot recommend enough the fairy tale anthology series edited by Terri Windling and Ellen Datlow. Especially Silver Birch, Blood Moon, which I adore.]
176	2	It wasn't this amazing poetry as I was expecting it to be it wasn't horrible either though there were some good poems and some good lines but overall it was jus alrite
673	1	Love <3 this! Ultimately my fave of Shakespeare. I like it even more than Romeo and Juliet. Oh, don't u dare compare Romeo with Hamlet. This Prince is so snarky, sarcastic and made me lol a lot. Love how he likes to speak speaches with two meanings! Gosh, I even remember his speeches and use them with my friends. lol Boy, you're so so wicked. He is my Shakespearean book crush now and the end never bother me anyway.
511	2	Text: 4 stars   Illustrations: 5 stars   Entertaining introduction to concrete poems. A brief explanation of concrete poems, which cleverly incorporates a concrete poem, followed by many examples. Kids will relate to the subject matter of the poems, many of which are humorous. Text is hand-lettered into the shapes of the various subjects of the poems, to great effect.
9	2	It was calming to pick up this book every so often and read a poem or two. I really liked some of the descriptions of nature.
777	1	Interesting look at the author's life through poems.
363	1	I don't know how can Gibran be reviewed. One doesn't review Gibran ; he's a whole genre all by himself.
847	3	I especially enjoyed the poems in the first and last sections of the book. They were absurd, surreal, and yet strangely honest in the way they imagined friendships. At times, they even achieved a kind of poignancy, as in "Prison House of the Morning Star":   my friends & I got ourselves trapped in individual-sized   prisons. We could no longer perform our secret handshake,   kept distant from each other by the unique quality of the bars.   The prisons themselves seemed to grow smaller as night   came on & then, with a blink, they were gone. We were ecstatic until,   in daylight, we realized the bars had formed snug to our bodies,   that we'd wear them always & unnoticeably.
473	3	I still remember how I found this book....   I was at Barnes & Nobles/ Poetry section, and my eyes caught the photo on the book cover; for a moment I was not sure if I was looking at a Palestinian woman or a Native American....and I did not think it's a poetry book; I thought it was misplaced in that shelf. I picked it up and it was the last copy which usually means to me "you may not find me again"....so I started reading at the back and looked at some pages and was truly impressed of what I saw....What a great combination; a poet half American half Palestinian!   What I like mostly about Naomi's style is how she presents her thoughts.   1. You don't hear whining even when she's complaining.   2. She uses second and third person which makes it easy for you to relate; for a moment you'd think the poem is about you...and you ask your self...me? when did this happen to me?   3. She doesn't repeat herself and you can't guess the next line or how the poem will end which adds excitement and anticipation to your reading environment.   4. She's very brave in using unusual combination of expressions which many may not understand.   5. She looks at life from unusual corners and makes a story out of each view...and you ask yourself how come I did not see that before.   Some of her poems I did not understand....some I could relate to...some I wanted to read again and again...and some I wished they never ended!   Overall, this is one of the most enjoyable poetry book I read so far!   Here are my favorite poems in this book   Negotiations with a Volcano   Grandfather's Heaven   My Father and the Fig tree   The Art of Disappearing   The words Under the words   Walking Down Blanco Road at Midnight   Famous   The Mother Writes to the Murderer   So Much Happiness   Trying to name what doesn't change   The Use of Fiction   Defining White   Yellow Glove   Brick   Blood   Arabic Coffee   Wednesday, April 16, 2008
761	2	I received access to an online version of this book in exchange for an honest review. (I think. I don't remember asking for it but I got another ARC at the same time which I requested many months ago. So maybe I requested this one then, too.)   The illustrations in this picture book are adorable and although heavily manipulated, will appeal to children and dog-lovers alike.   The poetry is less consistent. Some of the poems are cute and funny, others fall flat. The style of the poetry varies--some rhyme, some don't, some use pattern schemes--which is refreshing.   I was thinking 3.5 stars up until the last two spreads. The credits on the last two pages have the dog's names listed as class superlatives, e.g.,   Most Likely To Time-Travel (page 7)   Albert (shih tsu)   and   Most Likely to Get Lost (In a Good Book) (page 28)   Aggie (beagle)   It's a cute and funny way to present the information.   But the funniest (for me) was the second to last set of pages. After the other dogs have gone home for the day, the last lines of the poem say "Except for Stan, he has to stay." The little dog is sitting in front of a chalkboard where he's written sentences. The sentences on the board are, "I will not eat my homework. I will not eat my homework."   Four stars.
462	2	"The Old Fools" makes me feel RILLY SAD. Also a generally lovely collection, & I think more consistent than Whitsun Weddings, which for me is largely good because of "An Arundel Tomb." Larkin is like your curmudgeonly great uncle who you never call on the phone but sort of enjoy hearing be a bastard at family gatherings.
676	1	One of the best collections of poetry I have read. I just find her so descriptive and emotionally charged. Each poem has its own atmosphere that sucks you in. Moody and brooding done the way I like it.
544	3	I won this through the Goodreads giveaways, so I was super excited about it!   The book came this morning in the mail, I received it at around 7:00am, and I finished the book at roughly 9:30pm(this is only because I had things to attend to during the day), because I just couldn't stop reading the book. After reading the first page, I said "I'm finishing this book today" and that is exactly what I did. I just couldn't stop reading it, I just couldn't help but devour the content and get so into it. The read was so effortless, but at the same time, I was extremely engaged in the novel.   I am someone who just loves reading books that are written in Verse, and include letters or form that goes away from the conventional writing format, and frankly this book does it, and does it extremely well. I was blown away by the quality of the work, and the quality of the diction and how the story was told. The raw emotion, and feeling that came through the writing simply made me feel something I hadn't expected to feel. What drew me to the novel was the title, I just felt like it was something that just made me want to enter the giveaway. I am beyond thrilled that I won this book.   The subject matter of the novel is also one that I am drawn to. Though, I, myself, have never experienced this kind of addiction, I feel that the emotions felt by both the addicts, and those dealing with someone troubled, are feelings that I can relate to. I also believe that drug addiction is super important to address, and this book covers that clearly, and deeply. The book makes you really understand the struggles and the different emotions felt. The book, being from the perspective of a mother, added another layer to the story, and that made the story that much stronger.   Connie D, is a wonderful author, and I am beyond pleased that I was able to win and read her novel.
318	3	"Hyperboreal" is one of my favorite books of 2013. I've revisited and again revisited many of its poems over the past year and a half. Structurally simple yet strangely complex, there's something mystical about Kane's work. She has a way of speaking simultaneously of a specific landscape and all of nature, of a certain group of people enduring their specific hardships and all people. Her plainspoken, worldly images reveal something elusive yet significant about human endurance. I could not more strongly recommend "Hyperboreal" to poetry readers of all tastes, from narrative to abstract, visual and sonic.
810	1	Hard to imagine a more congenial look at poetry than this novel. Fun read.
710	1	This is one of my all time favorites. It's a kid's book, so it can probably be finished in 1 sitting.
270	2	Stone Hotel fits nicely in the prison memoir genre, recounting the tales of prison life from crime to release. Butcher, always the moral convict, recounts the acute morality of our criminal class in short, direct prose placed in poetic format. After years of criminal defense work, I had to stop because the power of the State to crush the will of a human far surpasses most criminals ability to harm the public and it is a painful thing to watch. Butcher's poems are an ode to human resiliency and redemption.
18	1	Full of song, double-backed and double-edged thinking, (re)memory, open and honest bewilderment about the strangeness of art--what it does, where comes from, where goes--and working through narratives of sexual violence. Here's a poetics of the book, coming straight from the work itself:   "as if my name had been erased"   A memory of objects. Reimagined.   A completely new kind   of seeing. All gradations of light.   Trees huge at their base, like houses.   Thousands of miles.   From the roof,   the street. The windows black and lit.   Those slow connections we talked about.   Difficult to speak to the content, though--I see tidbits of a connection between the Tam Lin ballad and a female-driven fairy tale (re-)told for our times, though I'm not sure how to bridge the two yet. Certainly impacted by it beyond understanding, however.
312	3	I just love poetry collections and this is one of my favorites. J. Patrick Lewis selected thirteen of his favorite classic poems and used them as inspiration to write his own "parroty" versions. I like the fact that the writer included the original poems and his own remakes. Also, the introduction is an inspiration to other poets and challenges writers to create their own parodies. The book is also unique by including the thirteenth poem on the back cover. My favorites were Keep a Pocket in Your Poem, Winter Warmth, This is my Tree, and Sleepy Thought.
660	2	Reviewed by Sarah Bean the Green Bean Teen Queen for TeensReadToo.com   Boy and girl meet. Boy and girl become friends. Boy and girl start to wonder if there's something more. Whether or not we've had a more-than-friends relationship, I'm sure most of us have felt like we'd like to be more than friends with someone we know.   What happens when we finally become something more? How do you balance new love and old friendships? Will your love last? If it doesn't, how do you go back to being just friends?   Poets Sarah Holbrook and Allan Wolf decide to try and answer some of these questions through poetry. They each take turns writing poems, first one from him and then one from her. They explore the beginnings of a relationship, crushes, and all the ups and downs that come from falling in love.   The poems are all written in various formats, from free verse to couplet, sonnet, and tanka. Some of the poetry forms were new to me, so I was happy to see that the authors included a glossary in the back explaining how each form worked and then encouraging readers to write their own.   This is a short, quick read, and these beautiful poems are worth checking out.
229	2	The true American Master of Classic Horror, Poe was the Stephen King of the 18th Century (and then some). His prose was gifted, his storytelling sublime, and his descriptive abilities beyond compare. This collection has it all--and makes one wonder what tales he might have spun had he lived a bit longer. This collection belongs on anyone's shelf.
231	2	Brilliant idea, and quite the undertaking. A found long poem crafted of 300 sentences from 300 different autobiographies--the autobiography of the ultimate (famous) everyperson.
529	3	I picked this up because I wrote a collection of poems about "Dead Men" and I am always intrigued by the topic.   I don't want to even think about losing my husband but this collection is just beautiful. It's not really the best poetry I've ever read but going on the journey with Yolen makes up for it.   This collection made me cry (which doesn't happen often) and I think this would be an excellent collection to go with Didion's "Year of Magical Thinking."   Some widows have time to say goodbye, like Yolen, and some don't. It doesn't really matter, like Yolen says, every journey is the same and every journey is different.   I absolutely recommend this to anyone grieving. Or, anyone who wants to read about a writer going through the process of grieving.
762	1	Beyond the Words is an anthology of poetry and short stories collected and compiled by Scripting Change. The theme of this edition is education and literacy.   Some of the authors in this anthology appeared in the previous one titled Seeing Past Sickness. Profits from the sale of both books goes to charity organisations for each theme.   The short collection comprises 13 pieces alternating between poetry and short stories. I have a poem in here called Words.   The anthology opens with Faith Breisblatt's nostalgic poem "Writing Letters".   "To Keep You" by Kristyn F. Brunson, the second piece in this collection and the first short story is a cosy, heart-warming and loving piece about two sisters reading to each other and connecting through reading and writing no matter the hardships of time. I cried reading this five-star piece.   "Poetic Process" by Celena McDonnell is a beautiful poem with smooth and fresh imagery. Five stars to this one as well.   "Snagged in careful fingers,   I release them from their cage,   the poetic words begin to form   as I print them on the page."   "Common Groundless" by Kathy DeFlane is a short story about the difficulties of communication and understanding between languages and species! I felt it stretched out a bit, but it is nonetheless a very suitable piece for this edition and theme.   Aaron Jackson's poem "Undocumented Tutor" is an interesting piece, easily imagined and makes me think of all the 'undocumented tutors', the people you meet in life, learn things from them and take them for granted.   "Immortalised in Ink" by Aria Glazki, a regular contributor, is a short story every reader and bookworm can relate to. I absolutely loved it. A must read.   "Opening Worlds" by Seker Solis, is a poem with several interesting lines. My only comment is that the piece begins with a rhyme then shifts to free verse.   "And each word that is as a rocket rising,   Blends in subtle harmony with one that is as a ribbon falling."   "I Don't Read So Good" by Austin D. Nichols is another five-star beautiful and powerful short story in Beyond the Words. Definitely one of my favourites in this anthology about a man and woman meeting at a reading group. She writes beautifully but stammers in speech and "He knew he could write. He'd done it before, but never got the itch. Had it once, perhaps, a long, long time ago, before everything... The words darted out of his mouth. Succinctly sharp. Perfect in form only. But the meaning was lost."   Meanwhile, when it's the woman's turn to read, she stutters. "The words, metal prongs through a symphony of story, hindered every rhyme in her rhythm."   "Chasing Rainbows" by Margit Sage is strong piece on stopping writers from pursuing their passion. It's also a painful short story, but a must-read. I enjoyed the strong sense of restlessness, which emanated from the piece.   Finally, I'd like to quote a verse from my poem "Words".   "Soon you'll be one   Woman and words,   Strong than a thousand swords"
785	1	I have read this for sometime. My kids like it and laugh. It's good for an uplifting moment. Makes life seem so less stressful.
407	2	Really a 2 1/2.   My edition is different than the ones that are listed. I have a library edition with lovely wood engravings. Geared more towards young readers, there is a mixture of some classic Robert Frost and some poetry with children in mind. Overall, I enjoyed it. I read some poems that I had not read before, some of which I really loved. But I also read other poems that I felt indifferent towards. Which is normal in a poetry collection, but I had assumed I'd love all the poems because well it's Robert Frost. Overall, I enjoyed it. And it was nice to read something familiar, new, and different during the crazy months of midterms, finals and now the holidays.
58	2	"Is there a word for sucker-punching someone in the heart?"   There should be, I think. Then let's use it to describe this poetry. This is another proof that you don't need fancy words to move people; just simply tell them the truth.
620	2	Read it from intro to end in one sitting. Then again. Then read just my favorite moments. Then read the entire book again. Then put it next to the rocking chair to continue in this manner, possibly forever.
39	3	I first discovered Rilke earlier this month when one of my friends posted a snippet of his poetry for National Poetry Month. The lines entranced me, and I decided I wanted to read more. So I found this selection of his poetry and read it from start to finish.   I loved the critical introduction by Robert Haas--it was a fascinating look at Rilke's life and poems, and helped me get a lot more out of my reading, by understanding the context.   My impression of Rilke is that his poems describe the beauty of loneliness, the meaning in emptiness, and the self-discovery in loss. In one of his requiems, Rilke writes:   I have my dead, and I have let them go,   and was amazed to see them so contented,   so soon at home in being dead, so cheerful,   so unlike their reputation. Only you   return....   The brilliantly crafted ten elegies that make up Duino Elegies were incredibly sorrowful, bringing death close, but in some ways transcending death itself. In one of his sonnets to Orpheus, Rilke writes:   Be ahead of all parting, as though it already were   behind you, like the winter that has just gone by.   One of my favorite poems is Rilke's first sonnet to Orpheus:   A tree ascended there. Oh pure transcendence!   Oh Orpheus sings! Oh tall tree in the ear!   And all things hushed. Yet even in that silence   a new beginning, beckoning, change appeared.   Creatures of stillness crowded from the bright   unbound forest, out of their lairs and nests;   and it was not from any dullness, not   from fear, that they were so quiet in themselves,   but from simply listening. Bellow, roar, shriek   seemed small inside their hearts. And where there had been   just a makeshift hut to receive the music,   a shelter nailed up out of their darkest longing,   with an entryway that shuddered in the wind--   you built a temple deep inside their hearing.   Reading Rilke makes me want to look, to see, to experience the world more deeply. It makes me want to stop running from my sorrows, and instead let myself experience them.   Since I've never read Rilke before, I can't comment on this particular translation or edition in comparison to the others. This one does have the original German on the opposite page, for those who happen to read German (I do not).   I need more poetry in my life. Reading Rilke has made that clear to me.
646	3	CREATIVE, MEANINGFUL, AND ASTONISHING POETRY I'VE EVER READ!   The reason why I buy this book is that it's not only a poetry, but also a cassette recorded the feelings from the songs. Though there's no rhyme or music in it, I can find those beats from each words.   There are two sides in this book, just like a tape.   Side A is only a poem inspired by the song. Side B reverses out the poem from Side A, making another new quotes to record other feelings from the songs.   Some poems are short, but really powerful; some poems are long, but really exquisite.   And there are lots of lines touch me so deeply. That's maybe the reason why I put so many post-it notes on pages. LOL   REALLY LOVE THIS POETRY!   HOPE THAT IT WILL HAVE ANOTHER TAPE POETRY!!!
495	1	"I have often misunderstood eternity, I will misunderstand it no more."   "Weigh, judge, and discard while still these things have meaning, for soon they will not, and then where will you be?"   "before the dark meaninglessness of things continues."   "and from the air a chorus on the blind passage of souls bellowed out."
821	2	I have to say, I really like Edgar Allan Poe. Twisted? Maybe, but there you have it. I especially like some of his stuff that is less (or even not) known by the public at large. He has just written some fabulous stuff. This has everything, so even the less well-known are here for your enjoyment. Some of my favorites: The Fall of the House of Usher, The Man that was Used Up, The Balloon Hoax, and I really could go on and on, so I won't.
685	2	I read this book in my 20's, but after so much more life, so many more trials, challenges and love, I am actually learning to REALLY live "The Invitation" in my 40's. I want to give this book to each and everyone that I love, and let them know what I carry in my heart. Beyond soulful!
220	2	I would love to attend a live performance of this drama. The Theater of Cruelty has a special place in my heart just like the Kabuki. Brilliant play!
146	1	This is my very favorite of all of Shakespeare's plays.
668	1	A lovely, sensitive, thought-provoking read. The kind of book that makes you feel warm and happy-hearted.
584	1	There's a lot of good stuff here, though I remember liking more. I'd like to reread all of her stuff eventually.
117	2	These are very plainspoken poems that detail Salzano's joys and struggles in raising a son with autism. I imagine that this would make a lovely gift for other parents who face similar challenges.
500	1	Lovely, with beautiful illustrations.
722	2	The beauty of these poems is in their specificity. Dumesnil has a way of making every image seem real, even when working entirely in metaphor. For instance, I loved these lines from "A Thousand Words for Goodbye": "The person I made you out to be/ and the woman you thought I was// slow dance like holograms projected/ on the gym floor, while you and I// sit on the bleachers, arguing/ about the strangers we've become." Another poem I really loved is "Tampons: A Memoir." It consists of eight sections that show us one woman's life history through the lens of her feminine products. Some are comic and some are tragic, but all are very memorable. All in all, this was a very good collection, and I'm glad I got a chance to read it.
490	3	Oh my - I've read this collection in a single sitting, swallowed it down in one gulp. In the past people have offered me poems by Sharon Olds and I've joined in with the discussions of excellent poems, like Monarchs but without ever really 'feeling' the poems. All that changed last night with her reading of two poems from Stag's Leap at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the T.S.Eliot 2012 Prize reading. Now I understand.   These poems matter and have meaning to anyone who has loved and lost the person - in this case a husband of thirty years. These poems are not just about loss, but are also full of compassion for herself, for him   'And it came to me,/ for moments at a time, moment after moment,/to be glad for him that he is with the one/ he feels is meant for him...'   These poem are about how to live and how to go on living. It is a collection that I shall return to over and over.
236	2	Her writing weaves images tinged with the most gorgeous soft glow.
556	1	Lang Leav is a reminder why I love poetry. [?]
542	1	Philosophy of men mingled with scripture, though Milton had a very eloquent style of writing.
332	3	Writing the Life poetic was published in 2009 although I've only recently come across it. The blurb describes it as 'the inspirational companion you've been looking for to help you build confidence in your poetic voice'. It is organised into eighty short chapters with a discussion and a try this section of exercises. I wish I had found this book when I was starting out writing poetry. It would have been so useful and encouraging.   As I'm now a little further on with my poetry some of the ideas I already knew about. There as a lovely little shock of recognition when I came across the Small Stones chapter - Fiona Robyn's idea which Sage Cohen shares so it can reach a wider audience. So I've already been writing small stones and I was familiar with other suggestions like reading lots and lots of poetry.   But there were still things to learn or be reminded of in this book. Poetry as Tonglen practice being one - 'any time you are confronted with something that feels too difficult to bear, return to the blank page, and write yourself through it'.   Spending more than you save - which takes Annie Dillard's suggestion that 'you should not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book or for another book, give it, give it all, give it now... Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes'.   I liked the reminders in Chapter 55 - the Art of All day. Grace Paley responding to a question about how she managed to fit it all in (being a mother, wife, writer, teacher and activist) said 'Well I have all day'. Sage Cohen suggests you use this for a 'cup is overflowing' day in which instead of worrying about the time you don't have to write, instead you focus on every scrap of time that you do have. The ten minutes in the waiting room, the fifteen minutes on the bus or train. I used to do that every day. How come I'd forgotten? Oh and I must mention that the book is also full of poems as examples.   So for me it was a book to dip into, to remind myself why it was I started writing poetry in the first place and strategies for putting it centre stage
634	2	It's a shame more of Sappho's work did not survive. These fragments offer only a glimpse of the poet's form--like catching the edge of a dress as its owner leaves the room--but it says much about Sappho's talent that even that glimpse is often enough to invoke a specific thought or feeling. All in all, a fine translation.
45	3	Christopher Logue has a lot of guts. He's gotten into the ring with the likes of Fagles, Lattimore, Fitzgerald, and most courageously, Homer himself - and acquitted himself well. Mr. Logue has pulled "The Iliad," into the 21st Century with less a translation than a re-write. It appears there are numerous volumes containing sections of Mr. Logue's work, and it's a little hard to keep track, but two editions offered on Amazon.com's website, "War Music," and the wondrously titled, "All Day Permanent Red," seem to contain it all.   Mr. Logue writes in a robust verse form that retains the epic language while exploring possibilities for a cinematic look on scenes and situations, as well as opening the field to modern metaphor. Unlike Barry Unsworth's interpolations in "The Songs of the Kings," Mr. Logue's don't jar, but rather deepen. A sample line, "Ajax, grim underneath his tan as Rommel after `Alamein..." lifts the story from some mythical past to something that is played out continually. A great device considering "The Iliad" is arguably the blue-print for every war story ever written.   When "War Music," opens outside the actual text of "The Iliad," and introduces us to Achilles - angry, petulant, bent on revenge, summoning his mother and whining about Agamemnon - Mr. Logue provides character depth missing from the original, and immediately lays out his plan to re-write and enrich rather than re-tell. His plan unfolds magnificently through both books.
779	2	After half a year of trying to read it slowly, fast or again and again, I have finally finished it. I had found this poem on Tumblr and loved it! I don't usually like poetry, but I wish I did... So I immediately bought this.   I'm not sure how to criticize poems - does it even make sense? *half an hour of writing and erasing* I guess all I can say is that they didn't really speak to me. It's pretty much exclusively about love and most poems are short and a bit... simple. Her Tumblr is nice! I feel so sorry for not liking it more.
527	1	My first book of poetry I read of Neruda. I love his images and the narrative stories. There is so much history in his poetry.
664	3	WANDERINGS ON DARKER SHORES   Author: Cora Pop   Rating: 5 out of 5 stars   * I received a free electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*   This is a collection of short stories and poems with "dark" themes.   This collection had me hooked from the very first story. The author has done a truly stupendous job and is able to evoke an emotional response from the reader in a very short amount of words.   Most short stories I've read seem to be lacking that essential quality that is required for the reader to fully immerse themselves in the story. In "Wanderings on Darker Shores" the reader becomes not only immersed in the story, but also invested in it.   The small details are included that are necessary to fully flesh out her characters and the stories are wonderfully written.   Her gift for description is just that ... a gift. "She was even more beautiful now than she'd been younger, her skin taut over high cheekbones, her narrow eyes the color of dark chocolate, the streaks of grey in her hair making me think of silver jewelries rather than time." This description is exquisite. It is easy to form a picture in your mind's eye of the woman she is referring to.   If you enjoy reading paranormal fiction, horror and "dark" themed fiction you cannot go wrong by purchasing "WANDERINGS ON DARKER SHORES" by Cora Pop.   I rate this collection as 5 out of 5 stars.

656	2	Thought provoking and mischievous, I enjoyed these poems very much. The ones I especially enjoyed were Breathless, Flock, Building with Its Face Blown Off, The Lanyard, The Revenant, See No Evil, Silence, and The Trouble with Poetry (the title poem).
775	1	Deeply romantic, deeply poetic, profound, and ageless. It doesn't get better than this.
381	2	Khalil Gibran was a beautiful soul and what I most appreciate about this book, in its true simplicity, is that I can come back to it at different times in my life and find something new, something that will address an issue or accentuate a thought or feeling I might be having.
402	1	The words cut you open, shushes at you, then sews you back up, leaving you the same on the outside as the day you picked it up. But inside, you feel so much different.
258	2	I really enjoyed a few of the poems in this book. But it took me a year to get through it. I don't think poetry is for me.
666	1	From Chinese New Year to the next, a recent immigrant grows to love his new country
901	1	Just like Mr. Carver's short stories, this work is first rate. Beautiful.
657	2	While I'm in no way competent to review the poetry itself, I can say that this collection is something that I will pick up again and again, to keep finding different things in the text and different views based on the quick images so expertly flicked into existence.
444	1	i read this years ago in high school English, but i recall really liking these stories a lot!
164	2	Very good book of criticism. Wiman is particularly strong on the subject of the creative process.
394	2	Memoir of Jackie Woodson's childhood in 1960s Ohio, South Carolina and NYC, in verse. I usually avoid things in verse, it's just not my style and I often wonder why verse was chosen. No need to wonder here - it's perfect. I can't imagine this book in any other format. Every word is chosen so perfectly and with such economy and the story is given the space it needs to leap to life as a result. Gorgeous. And distinguished in all ways.
831	2	A verse novel about an 8th grader with mono who has to take a break from sports and begins to get interested in poetry. He writes cute poems about his game and the romances in his life. It is interesting to see him trying the different forms of poetry.
254	2	Whatever the opposite of subtle is, this is it.   I mean, *eye roll*:   everyone i love leaves -----> This is not a poem, this a 13-year-old's msn status from 2004.
133	2	I positively adore William Blake. Wish I could turn a phrase as beautifully as he can. But I can't. {sigh}.
734	2	My grandson picked this book at the library. I think it was the colors. He didn't sit through the story without fidgeting. He did learn that orangutans like monkeys are primates. Even with me doing animated voices and dancing, his attention span was not long. I also learned some fun facts.
558	2	This man is insane but a genius. He visited my poetry class in 2006 and kind of blew my mind. He told this story about how he leaves a dictionary out on his backyard table in brooklyn and he responds to the way the birds peck at words, and watches the way the weather tears at the pages. He went on about this for like 20 minutes.
878	2	Patchen is a really great writer who has always been overlooked. His rage against cruelty, oppression and war and the abstract language that he uses to describe it is fucking brilliant and inspiring. As well, his vision of a different world, where folks don't dehumanize each other. Anybody who lives or takes a stance against this fucked up world could get something out of Patchen if they gave him a chance. Which would, of course, require getting past the fact that it's poetry. Most of it's prose poetry   Meaning every now   and then it goes something like this. But it's still pretty readable and far from cheezy. Read this or Collected Patchen
387	2	This is my first Mary Oliver poetry and I am sure it will not be my last. Her poems in this volume are beautiful, accessible, and tied to an appreciation of nature. I checked out the library e-book, but this is a collection I would like to own. I've been trying to live more meaningfully and with more gratitude for the world around me and Oliver's poems--like the titular one below capture that feeling for me.   We should all start the day in happiness and in kindness.   "Why I Wake Early   Hello, sun in my face.   Hello, you who make the morning   and spread it over the fields   and into the faces of the tulips   and the nodding morning glories,   and into the windows of, even, the   miserable and crotchety-   best preacher that ever was,   dear star, that just happens   to be where you are in the universe   to keep us from ever-darkness,   to ease us with warm touching,   to hold us in the great hands of light-   good morning, good morning, good morning.   Watch, now, how I start the day   in happiness, in kindness."   --Mary Oliver
610	3	These poems suck you in like Buzzfeed lists. They are poppy, political, and sincere.   It's yawpy like if Whitman got really into hip-hop and was okay with being cryptic.   A poetics from the book itself, in "My Factless Autobiography":   My part is basically to hatch   with regard for human dignity and life   In my best foreign automobile   stunting the stupor fronting us[...]   This book is, without a doubt, one of my favorite reads of this year so far.
302	3	A. A. Milne's first book of poetry, published even before Winnie-the-Pooh. It's a great collection of lovely poems for children. He uses all kinds of different rhyming patterns and can evoke the feelings of childhood very well. I love the poem about sitting on the middle stair, and some of the prettier poems about nature.   I will be reading this to Aiden again as he grows up. This edition, by the way, is just lovely - it's part of a boxed set they put out when they released Return to the Hundred Acre Wood, and it has beautiful color versions of Ernest Shepard's illustrations. Just great.
317	3	Indisputably one of the greatest collections of letters and advice on poetry and the artistic life ever compiled, which is even more impressive given its diminutive size (the book is only about 100 pages). The entire book is "quotable," but it also reads like one friend speaking to another on the most important things in life. If you write, or read, or think, or love, or live, or want to do any of those things, I recommend reading this book.
463	3	The lazy tide rolled in like a snail smoking weed.   It's amazing how much discord there is in a book that is more blank space than words. Apparently, I am searching the striking element here-- maybe a wordplay of metaphors or some punchline for a joke? But no, this book that professes sex on its inconsistent flowery prose and poetry is extremely messy; Considering the overuse of a rigid and informal word 'fuck', I was wondering if I read it wrong considering I'm no lover of poetry and purple proses.   I did not find this book loathsome (maybe an uncanny dislike); It's just that there is not much good with it. Maybe a few impressive lines but that's it, that's my one star.
320	1	3.5 neat artwork
731	2	I received a copy of this book for free from Oxford University Press via NetGalley.   This is the only version of The Iliad that I have ever read. (Somehow, I missed that boat in high school.) Therefore, I cannot compare the translation difference, but I can just give you my honest opinion.   The story is a classic. Everyone knows it at least from seeing a movie or reading a synopsis or from history class in high school. I decided it was time to become enlightened and actually read the book. I chose this one because it is a new version. Honestly, I felt like I was reading the equivalent of the King James version of the Bible. The translation is supposed to be one of the most literal translations from a lifelong scholar, Barry Powell. There's a lot to be said for all of his hard work at this literal translation, but it really isn't as easy to follow as I thought it would be. I had to re-read a lot of parts.   But... the introduction that he provides is very lengthy and interesting. It goes into the history of the Greeks and Homer and the Iliad itself - a lot that I have never spent much time learning about. Also, there are footnotes as you are reading that are extremely helpful and insightful.   I would recommend this version of The Iliad to people who are interested in history and who are interested to specifically study the Iliad and the meanings behind the story.
904	1	Great compilation for high school and up!
583	2	The "Now New" in "To a Man," that moment of feeling ending "When You Come to Me," nostalgia from "In a Time," and oh those "Viscous tatters" in "Tears," which made me love the collection from part one, fit right before the reminder of those faces saying no and laughing "Just Before the World Ends" when the space between "our guilt" in "We Saw Beyond Our Seeming" and "My Guilt" in which "sin lies in not screaming loud." A woman who knows how to write what she means, although I'm not sure why part one goes before part two.
306	1	Beautiful, simple and touching
693	2	I don't particularly think that this book is bad. It's just that nothing about it resonated with me. It just fell short in so many ways. I liked the concept. It's what drew me to this book. A retelling of Romeo and Juliet written in verse with an Israeli girl and Palestinian boy as the protagonists sound amazing. They meet each other once, it's love at first sight, and everything escalates from there. The history behind why these two countries are constantly at war with each other needed to be better explained. There are many descriptions about how both groups of people are similar but hardly addresses their differences in religious beliefs. This story is solely about these two teens from opposite sides defying their families to be together. We know what their interests are but we don't really know why they're in love. It could have happened anywhere because the setting is not prominent enough. The language felt flat and repetitive at times. In some parts it was hard to decipher whether it was Ronit or Jamil that was speaking.
893	2	The Devil is the star of the book and its dramatic core. Very enjoyable.
564	1	Tracy K. Smith is imaginative and eloquent. Her poetry is striking, but not a favorite for me, I think. Of this collection, The Good Life was my favorite.   The Good Life   When some people talk about money   They speak as if it were a mysterious lover   Who went out to buy milk and never   Came back, and it makes me nostalgic   For the years I lived on coffee and bread,   Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday   Like a woman journeying for water   From a village without a well, then living   One or two nights like everyone else   On roast chicken and red wine.
296	1	Only thing missing..Funeral Blues
508	3	A special thanks to the publisher for this review copy!   Told in verse, this book has blunt, powerful, poetic prose. This is only the second book I've read that is written in verse, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've read many bad reviews for this book and I'm not sure why. I figure it's because this is one of those books that you either hate or enjoy. You either understand it or you don't.   X is the boy your Mom warns you against, and it's exactly why Samantha falls for him. He's everything she's searching for in her own life--the ability to live, love, and be free. But it's those very things that are her downfall.   I really enjoyed this book, more for the realistic writing than anything else. Well, that is aside from the characters. The characters are realistic, and to the point in a good way. They're not angst-y or whiny even though they have some reasons to be just that.   The writing is so relatable and fluid. I found myself breezing right through the book.   All in all It was a great read that wasn't afraid to tackle gritty topics, and I found it to be done well. With this being Lyons' first book, I have to say I'm very impressed and I can't wait to read more of her stuff.
14	3	Text: 5 stars   Illustrations: 5 stars   Nonfiction picture book about the creatures and plants of the meadow. Poems and pictures provide clues to something found in a meadow, followed by a page spread identifying and explaining what it is. Gorgeous and unusual scratchboard illustrations are colorful and full of textures. Includes a glossary, but no bibliography. Artistic, engaging, and educational.
713	1	3.5 stars. So I liked this, but it didn't stand out like "wow" for me. My favourite was the healing section of this collection.
861	1	Very glad I read this. Her poetry is raw but beautiful
34	1	Mary Oliver's essays, like her poems, are a soothing balm for the soul.
30	1	Breathtaking!
40	2	Frost is so good. He makes uneventful scenes very philosophic. With no elaborate words, only the simplest.
424	2	Memento Mori:   A reminder of mortality.   ORIGIN: Latin.   Translation: Remember that you must die.   -Last page of Dark Sparkler by Amber Tamblyn.   I might sound like a masochist but I love reading depressing books when I am depressed. It must be the 16 year old in me that refuses to die. Oh, well, that's a bad phrase. However, I digress, as I understand it, this Amber Tamblyn's third poetry collection but this is my first collection of hers I've read. Boy, is it a doozy.   Dark Sparkler is a bleak memoria of actresses who died before their time under tragic circumstances. Some of these actresses I've heard of; some of them I have not. These poems are pretty powerful and tear-inducing. Not to mention heartbreaking and brutal.   Although, I enjoyed the poems, I really enjoyed the epilogue which focuses on Tamblyn herself. It was nice to intimately see into her mind and her neuroses. I'm probably going to check out her previous collections.
135	2	One of the strongest anthologies out there. A must have, if not as a reference book, one filled with poems that will awaken you. It's also a tome; good for just sitting on the coffee table to pick up whenever.
783	1	English 221: British Literature I
315	3	I haven't read much poetry since I got out of school over 20 years ago. I loved this book, and I think it would be a great introduction to poetry. The imagery was dark and spooky and it gave me chills. Actually at times it made me chuckle. I will be requesting more of his work from the library system, since this book was the only one they had. I want to own this book when I can, because it would be great reading for Halloween.
359	3	One dependable truth about Hunter S. Jones' writing is that the reader will always be surprised. She is one of the few who can write a series without ever repeating what has happened in a previous book, and I appreciate that. For those fans of her September series, we now have the prequel that centers around the poet Jack O. Savage and his poet lover Indie Shadwick. Indie's verses talk to her, asking to be written, and the details of a poem unfolding are fascinating. Do not think this is fanciful fiction. As a poet, I once needed 22 sonnets for a book I was writing but couldn't get #11. I went outside to the Earth and Sky but they crushed me and I cried, because I talked to my verses but there was no reply. So I understand perfectly Indie's intense relationship with words. Whether bi-polar like Indie or not, anyone involved in the creative process will recognize the consummation of one's personality to the voice of the verse. We also see another facet of Jack O. Savage as described by Indie (so different than Liz Snow's take in previous September books). I highly recommend this heart-breaking novel of mental illness, creativity, and profound love.
594	1	Brief essays. Jewels.
6	2	The cutest couple in history. Also, I kind of want to go back in time and steal her dog, but Flush would probably bite me for separating him from his owner.
804	2	I am a huge Shakespeare lover. I love the language, the absurdity, and the humor, and often the characters...but this is not one of my absolute favorites. It was too heavy in places, a little dry at times (*gasp* I know), and I didn't like most of the characters. Ahh well. I'm more of a comedy girl I think. Review to come.
577	1	It was okay. I've read better poetry books with the same theme. Not really hyped about this one. But I liked it to an extent. Also, important to note that some poems just felt   Like   It was just   Hitting the   Enter button   On random words   Like this
518	1	Truth is I could only handle one of these essays, but it was well written and interesting. More of an assignment, though.
38	2	Let's be honest, the reason I know Warsan Shire is Beyonce's "Lemonade" (which, for the record, is one of the best pop albums I've ever heard, and definitely the best music video that I've seen).   However, regardless of how you feel about Queen B or "Lemonade", Shire deserves to be checked out for her own merits. I definitely plan to pick up more by her.
643	2	Good poetry is usually edifying, but it isn't always fun. I get the sense that this poet had a blast writing these poems, which take full advantage of word play, aggressive rhymes, and playful rhythms. In fact, I've never read another book quite like it.
127	2	When your attempts to force poetry into its original metre destroys all lyricism and even makes much of it impossible to understand, you have to ask yourself if your translation really serves any purpose at all.
288	2	This is probably my favorite Shakespeare play. There are so many references that come from Hamlet that most people probably don't know. I can't say that I've seen a movie version that really captures how great this play is.
506	2	My copy is wonderfully aged, printed in 1922, with uneven pages, now yellowing, brittle, and beginning to crumble, and a cover that's battered, splattered, foxed and dented. Housman was parochial with an apparent death wish. His poetry was overly sentimental, even treacly, but on a few, well-noted occasions, he took flight and soared to heights of genuine beauty. The brevity and lyricism of his best known poems lend themselves to being read aloud, almost demand it. Though untitled, you'll recognize them easily from their first lines: "When I was one and twenty," and "Loveliest of trees, the cherry now." A few, lesser known pieces are worthy of another reading, perhaps even aloud: "Oh, when I was in love with you," and "Is my team ploughing." My own favorite is the longer title-poem, "A Shropshire Lad," broken into three parts each with a distinctive voice. A friend, in the first section, mocks Housman's (Terrence in the poem) for his "moping melancholy mad" verse. In Section Two, the poet concedes "brisker pipes than poetry," especially ale, citing his own revelries when, "the world seemed none so bad / and I myself a sterling lad," finishing with the acknowledgment of his own morbidity while justifying it as a preventive against "the embittered hour." A neutral but strong voice lends a narrative tone to the third section, commenting on the precariousness of a king who "reigned in the East" and who inoculated himself against poisoning by sampling "all that springs to birth / from the many venomed earth." You can read it yourself to learn the ending. I can't read it often enough.
866	3	Delicate time period drawings give this book an ancient Chinese feel. However, because the work is a translation to English (with Chinese characters along the side) and is presented in verse, my student had a little trouble following along. Reading the book jacket summary of the story helped in this regard.   A lovely work, but not our favorite. A strong selection nonetheless, particularly for study of ancient China (or to give historical perspective to the Disney production).
623	2	I first read this poem while at school, and it was love at first sight.   The reasons why I became almost addicted to the Rime are many, among which are its rhytm, its plot and the visionary touch of Coleridge's genious. Whenever reading or re-reading it, images from Kaspar Friedrich's paintings or Durer & Dore's engravings spring in front of my eyes. Reading the Rime is a fulfilling literary experience I never get tired of.
598	1	One of the only books I actually enjoyed reading for class. (high school)
652	1	It's boring Shakespeare, and that's never good.
160	2	One of the best works of literature. It's been a few years since I last read it, but I have studied it in school three times. Each time brought both enjoyment and new knowledge. Shakespeare packs so much into this play about human nature, in my opinion, and you can't help but to be captivated by it.
347	1	Precious small poems for young people. A great introduction to what poetry is or can do, since each poem is about an everyday object like an umbrella.
87	1	Rumi taught me more than I already knew about love.
752	1	it's the poetry, i've been missing, in this 21st century. the voice in its pages compelled me to even write one for her. that's saying something.
181	2	A great collection of Whitman works. This book reminded me why I love Whitman. These works were done at the age of 70, and just proves that the love of poetry still ran through his veins.   I was given this book in exchange for an honest review, via Netgalley.
