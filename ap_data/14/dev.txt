361	1	"You who completed the world: the way that what falls as rain over the earth and on the waters falls heedlessly, falls indifferently, arises again out of everything, more invisible and happy following its law, rises and hovers and forms the sky; so from you rose the ascent of our precipitations and enveloped the world in music. Your music:that it might be about the world, not about us. That a piano might have been built for you in Upper Egypt, and an angel would have led you before the lonely instrument, through the ranges of the desert mountains in which kings rest and hetaeras and anchorites. And the angel would have bounded upwards and away, fearful that you would begin."
683	1	One of the very best. A poet who used words economically and effectively.
234	3	If you are going camping this summer or on a road trip, I highly recommend this book. On the other hand, if you plan on spending your entire summer inside on the couch watching TV, I still recommend Sipping Spiders Through Straws. Your family will enjoy nothing more than you belting out a few spine-chilling tunes during commercials.   Some of my favorites were Home of the Strange, 99 Bottles of Blood on the Wall, If You're Scary and You Know it, Clap Your Paws, My Body Lies Over the Ocean and Take Me Out to the Grave Yard. I will admit there a couple of the 18 songs that I was not familiar with the tune but enjoyed the lyrics anyway. Gris Grimly's illustrations were absolutely sinister through out the book. Over all I found the book eerily entertaining and frightfully fun.
370	3	** spoiler alert **   Wow. Where to begin about how much I hated this book. I can't even think of something nice to say about this.   Usually I love Ellen Hopkins, I loved the Crack series but this book was pure shit.In fact I'm not going to go in details about each one of these stupid bitches in the book because I will flip. But all these women have issues and need to see a doctor, asap.   Holly is a whore. WHORE. She had a wonderful husband but yet she fucked everyone and even had...a threesome and more. What the heck is wrong with her!? And she has kids as well, now they have a whore for a mother.   Than you have Andrea who I kinda like but don't who sleeps with Holly's husband. And Holly and her are friends. What a great friend. Not.   The only person I actually liked was Marissa because she has a child with a mental disorder. Her husband was a piece of shit who cheated on her and left her to do everything for the child. And her son is gay and she has to deal with that as well.So she is the only character who isn't a whore. So, listen to her story because that is the only one WORTH using a brain.   I can't stand cheaters so that is why I hate this book so much.   But if you like to read about whores and cheating be my guest.
828	1	In Blackwater Woods   Look, the trees   are turning   their own bodies   into pillars   of light,   are giving off the rich   fragrance of cinnamon   and fulfillment,   the long tapers   of cattails   are bursting and floating away over   the blue shoulders   of the ponds,   and every pond,   no matter what its   name is, is   nameless now.   Every year   everything   I have ever learned   in my lifetime   leads back to this: the fires   and the black river of loss   whose other side   is salvation,   whose meaning   none of us will ever know.   To live in this world   you must be able   to do three things:   to love what is mortal;   to hold it   against your bones knowing   your own life depends on it;   and, when the time comes to let it go,   to let it go.   What can I say about Mary Oliver's poetry that has not been said a hundred times before?   Read it, read it out loud and read it again.
68	1	Haunting, beautiful, heartbreaking
590	1	Kwasny's prose poetry is nothing short of mesmerizing. Each poem spirals deeper and deeper into the minutia of natural detail while simultaneously reminding us of our humanity...our place in the world. Having read a number of her books, I feel 'Pictograph' definitely stands out as uniquely powerful and layered.
180	2	I feel dreadful only giving three stars to Shakespeare, but this really isn't one of his best in my opinion.
145	2	Who can resist Shel Silverstein's warped little sense of childhood? His books are part of the foundation of my own.
294	3	Hilary Knight's illustrations perfectly fit Edward Lear's poem, as well as providing a splendid framing device for the fanciful story! The reader is drawn into a world that changes with a child's imagination, and so those of any age will find themselves participating in the experiences of the characters! A book children and adults will keep going back to, seeing more and more each time.   Highly recommended for children, as well as those for whom childhood is only a pleasant dream away!
230	2	I enjoyed this. I liked the beginning and ending section most of all. Many were very emotional. When I was in the middle of the book, I felt more 3 stars for it....but the ending pushed it at 3.5 to 4 stars. Many beautiful thoughts.
93	2	This book showed me how much I didn't know about poetry. It caused me to be a more determined student while doing an MFA in Creative Writing at Georgia College and State University.
520	2	A retelling of the beginning of Genesis, with beautiful poetry. Oh, and Satan is kind of the hero. Books can't get much better than this.
379	1	Crazy, experimental, and oozing 1914 edginess. I had to take this one slowly and with humor.   "Chicken. / Alas a dirty word, alas a dirty third alas a dirty /third, alas a dirty bird. / ... / Salad. / It is a winning cake." (p.54-57)
546	2	This book was a good book but had some intense words given that it was meant for children. I recommend this book to anyone who likes interesting poems.
803	1	Excellent. I've almost bought this book at least half a dozen times but hesitated on account of not being certain just what I was getting myself into. I'm glad I finally broke down and bought it. While I'm new to an appreciation of poetry, Smith's mastery is clear. The language in each of these poems is tight and powerful. Through its lyricism and fluidity,Smith's book is in conversation with life on a broad spectrum. From the grit of day-to-day existence to contemplations of our position in relation to the universe.
597	1	section XX and so much good reading
108	1	The first appearance of The Man in Black. Written way back in the 60's.
869	3	WOW. I loved everything about this collection! I felt every line of this so deeply, it gave me goosebumps in many parts. May covers so many different topics, but the thread that keeps them all tied together is Detroit. It's so easy to lose yourself in these poems and May's voice is powerful, like music and heartache tied together. My favorites in here are "The Gun Joke", "To Detroiters I May Have Called by the Wrong Names", and "FBI Questioning During the 2009 Presidential Inauguration".   Man...I actually feel a little speechless right now. I've never really talked about/reviewed a poetry collection before, and I'm not sure I can do this beautiful collection justice. Just please read it!
188	1	"read"
271	3	I read this after watching a filmed version of the production of Coriolanus starring Tom Hiddleston, which lifted this play to fantastic places. Coriolanus is one of the simpler of Shakespeare's plays about a soldier trying to be a politician and failing miserably at it and the harsh realities of politics. No one in this world comes off well, the People of Rome seem fickle, politicians are cruel and ambitious and even the soldiers who are shown at times as heroes have little respect for those who don't fight. In the election season of 2016, this play feels apt and some of the lines about swaying and using mob mentality or what a person has to do to succeed in politics hit the mark. An intriguing play and the Donmar Warehouse production of it was superb.
405	2	Rilke's "prayers to a lowly God" are striking in their beauty and in their surprising imagery. Highly recommended!
219	1	It was too much for me. I'm not a big fan of "adult" books
13	1	Doth I dislike Shakey's style. What a sad day for me...
870	2	Carol Ann Duffy is a true wordsmith. I don't think she'll ever replace my beloved Yeats, but I did enjoy this much more than the usual stuff that is being churned out these days in the name of poetry. I admit that I am something of a traditionalist when it comes to poetry, and I did appreciate her rhymes and repeated words.
343	2	Enjoyable and thought provoking, these poems explore family and work-life candidly and with genuine emotion. Terrific book.
200	1	Unusual. Light yet deep. Funny and sweet and moving.
265	3	That I have read this book is serendipity at its best. I bought this because it is the book being discussed at a retreat that one of my friends plans. She told me about the retreat several months ago and I bought the book in case I could make the retreat. I knew nothing about the author or what she had to say.   When these meditations arrived at my house, I glanced at the cover and filed it away for later. At that point I still didn't know if I was going on the retreat. So, when at the last minute I signed up for the retreat, I had to find the book. I like to be prepared.   I have been blown away by Elkins' poems, essays and meditations about human things. Many of the religious writings I have read about stuff has been geared to getting rid of it. Man cannot worship G-d and mammon. Stuff can get between you and G-d. You know the drill. Elkins looks at stuff and sees stories. And her stories are often about how G-d uses everyday things for holy purposes.   It took me about 24 hours to work my way through this amazing book. I plan to read it one more time before the retreat. I need to hear Elkins' messages about grace and peace and holy stuff again. I may have more to say about this book then. Right now I am awestruck and cannot find the words I need to do justice.
834	2	A wonderful, timeless adventure tale that anyone could enjoy! A bit confusing at times for me, but overall I thought it was a great story! A must read for anyone interested in classic stories and adventure tales.
72	1	Loved the Winnie The Pooh poem, some of the others were a little strange.
337	2	I adored/loved this book. The narrative poems are wonderful narratives and c.s.lewis knowd how to use words so that even what is meant to be tragic is beautiful.
130	3	Snuggle Time Prayers is a sturdy mid-sized board book for little ones. Each page has a lovely inspirational poem with accompanying illustrations that are generously sized, detailed and colorful. There are fifteen poems in all and each is based on Bible scripture.   I absolutely love children's books that reinforce the idea that each of us has the ability to form a close connection with God by simply talking to Him. Bringing up children to recognize that God hears and listens to us when we speak to Him is so important, as it builds a firm foundation for a lifelong relationship with Him. Snuggle Time Prayers supports this concept. Although board books are usually geared towards younger children, this book will remain a useful tool as children grow older, since it can easily be used to expand upon scripture.   The only thing I would have liked to see was a signature (This Book Belongs To) page at the beginning of the book for gift-giving purposes. Even so, Snuggle Time Prayers would make an excellent baby shower or baptism gift for new parents. I would be happy to give this to one of my grandchildren. This is a book that should be well-loved for many years to come.   http://diymomblog.blogspot.com received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
615	2	This classic has endured for good reason. Not only is it a precious treasure chest for ancient Greco-Roman mythology, but it remains, in the hands of the right translator, a pleasure to read.
867	2	Beautiful. Tragic. Important.   That is how I would describe this book. It shows you the importance of self-worth. Grief is a part of life and wounds take time to heal. These are just words that need to be heard. This is a quick read but it leaves you thinking about it when you're done.
654	1	slow to start, but grabbed me by the end
384	2	great to see all the effort and help i put into this book come out so beautifully
137	2	Short read- I did it in one day, two sittings.   Absolutely required reading for all Americans. Thought provoking and beautiful prose.
69	2	Extremely well written and almost good enough for me to consider becoming a catholic to ensure I never see the levels of Hell for myself.
812	1	A solid poetry collection for elementary school by the endlessly creative Jane Yolen, focused on the interesting theme of the world underground. Did you know that corn plants can talk? My favorite poem is "Seeds," but there are many to delight.   Seeds   This dot,   this spot,   this period at the end   of winter's sentence   writes its way up   through the dull slate of soil   into the paragraph of spring.
841	2	I'm not much of a poetry reader, but I felt inspired to read this after a group of incarcerated women included it in a list of books that really impacted or changed their life. The books is divided into three sections, and I really loved the first part, called "Power." The second part, called "Twenty-One Love Poems" was a bit dull to me. The final section, "Not Somewhere Else, But Here" was better than the second, but not quite as good as the first.
257	2	I was consistently charmed and intrigued by these poems' tone of voice. The non sequiturs worked better in some poems than others. Many memorable and peculiar moments.
616	2	I admit it: I'm not a huge fan of poetry, especially long epic poems. But I gotta give credit where credit is due. This was my third attempt at swallowing the whole shebang. I was required to study Inferno in high school. At that time I attempted Purgatorio and Paradiso and couldn't do it. Many years later I revisited them and found Purgatorio fascinating but couldn't do Paradiso. Now, after a similar gap of many years, I found Paradiso the most fascinating of the three; probably because of a relatively new found interest in ancient and medieval cosmologies. I found the Clive James translation very readable but not of much use in studying the specifics of Dante's structure because the translation is, as the translator admits, very free. In order to study the specifics of Dante's cosmology I found it necessary at times to go to the original Italian, which fortunately is available at divinecomedy.org.
345	1	I loved it.
410	2	You know, I know I liked this book (though I found it uneven), but I'm always at a loss as to how to review poetry. Even if I'm supposedly working towards becoming a literary scholar, and one who frequently teaches poetry, I suppose I tend to have a sort of visceral reaction to something or I react not at all. Either way, these are affective and not necessarily intellectual responses. I'll say one critique though: Gunn's rigid formalism seems to be a real double-edged sword for this collection: at times, it manages to retrieve his more emotional portraits of the HIV/AIDS epidemic from maudlin-"Philadelphia" style tearjerkers; at others, his insistence on clear rhyme schemes or metered lines leads the poetry into a kind of facile tone, or one that feels more weightless than it should, if that makes any sense. Not that it's being silly, but that it begins to be a bit like cotton candy; it's there for a moment of pleasure and then dissolves into nothingness, leaving no memory behind it. The first and fourth parts were my personal favorites, though I need to go back and close read some of the specific pieces for my field exam soon. Perhaps an update to this review then.
471	2	this is not only a book but also a CD, and listening to the audio versions of her poems makes me cry. so amazing. you can read a couple of the poems online, including Daddy's Song. this poem on the CD features her father on the track, and it is makes my heart hurt with love and family and mourning. you can see a performance of it on youtube but it's a different version, not with her dad. also you can read the stunning, beautiful, clear-eyed first writing since online, or watch her perform it on youtube. but then you should get the book and read & listen to the whole thing.
892	2	This was the book that made me first recognize the difference between a poet and a poet laureate. Kooser is so incredibly adept with his metaphors, and the ends of his poems often smack you between the eyes with their powerful observations and the way they so accurately capture the essences of things in such a profound way.   On this second read, I particularly loved Biker, A Rainy Morning, and Pearl.

578	1	I love that this book could be used to also encourage drawing, and would work side-by-side as it is read aloud!
747	2	I'd really give it a 3 and a half. I don't think this book is for everybody, and when i was first reading it I was like um...ok...but it's actually pretty good. Toscano's poetic theater is poetic verse meant to be performed in a way. sort of like spoken word mixed with beat poetry...to an extent. What i thought was really interesting is how its as if you are listening to other people's conversaions walking in and out of them. not fully getting everything but getting everything you need to understand or make sense of it. like i said it's not for everybody but it's not that bad at all. and if you are possibly interested on youtube people have performed his work and that may be interesting to view before deciding to read this book.
116	1	So good. Loved it!
750	1	The poetry you read when you don't want to read the poetry you read when you don't want to read poetry.
382	1	Loved this book! It was beautifully written and touching on many levels.
659	1	I read this nostalgic poem in the 1960's.
678	2	Generation Y? Generation Z? Millennials? Not sure what the current label is, but here is one voice of the most recent generation coming of age and wow! (says this Baby Boomer) What a wonderful voice! Savor it, re-read it, and perhaps you will fall back on these powerful words someday, when life demands an answer to the chaos and confusion some of us attempt to navigate...
550	1	http://winterlief.blogspot.nl/2015/04...
393	1	My Nana gave me this book because the author wrote beautiful poems and like me had Rhumatoid Arthritis. Well I love these poems.. Beautiful from a beatiful christian woman who look beyond her pain.
27	3	Another major screw-up from the Newbery committee. Why do I still have faith in these guys? Oh right, I thought they'd get better again after giving Doll Bones an honor. We're a long way from when good books like The Grey King and The Hero and the Crown won because they were the best American books of the year. The Crossover is a variety of things put together to piss me off. It's written in verse, because Ellen Hopkins. Hey, YA books: please stop doing this. It's not good. Oh, and not just in verse, in RAPPING. Oh, and the writing is awful. The word "crunk" is even used ON THE FIRST PAGE. This is a term popularized by hip-hop, meaning "crazy drunk", and popularized by the insult to humanity known as Lil' Jon. Afterwards, I expected someone to yell "TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?!" at some random point. Lil' Wayne and 2 Chainz are name-dropped as well. The switching POV is really, really hard to figure out. Like, harder than The 5th Wave's POV switches. Oh, and my very biggest pet peeve is here, too! Remember "quotation marks"? You know, those things you put around words when somebody says something? No? Call me old-fashioned, but that was a thing in my day! Oh, and Newberry winners are supposed to be modern classics that stand the test of time. The Grey King, The Hero and the Crown, The Graveyard Book, The High King, The Giver and The Tale of Despereaux, among others, are books that will be around for all time. This book will be outdated in five years. This book is massively disappointing and another mark against the Newberys.
568	2	Like most poetry this took time to read. It's brilliance was evident. I then read it again, much slower and with a more focused intent. I look forward to reading it yet again.
807	1	Strange, wildly original, and full of fresh mythical imagery. One of my favorite examples:   *"Pilgrim's Progress"   Hsuan-tsang and his party traveled fourteen days from Ait Aein to   Wansgelt. Look. On the eighth day. Here they come:   His little monkey companion rattles its collar bell;   And the piglet requires more water than they can afford.   The little monkey's bell sounds loudly in the silent heat,   Disharmonious to the company's foot falls;   The piglet requires drink! Oh, the poor foundling piglet   Wants its paddock. Why was it taken from its mama's ninny?   At midday they lunch on tea and cookies;   they nap in wait   For the day's cooler hours. The toothless horse farts, shading   Beneath the locust tree:   How could this nag be a long   Whiskered dragon? And this piglet, drinking all my water--   an immortal?   The monkey jingles its bell, and points its tiny member west.   *Formatting not accurate.
714	3	Seeing Past Sickness is a collection of 17 pieces varying between poetry and short stories on getting over or past illness and sickness. It is worth noting that all proceeds to this collection go to a foundation that provides scholarships for students affected by chronic illness.   Commenting on 17 pieces will make this a lengthy commentary so I'll comment on what I believe are the 'bestest' pieces in this collection.   The opening piece to Seeing Past Sickness is a poem titled 'Bridge' by Seker Salis. It is an enjoyable piece with a nice flow. It is, also, a beautiful opening to this collection.   The first short story is called 'Day by Day' by my favourite writer Aria Glazki. The wording, flow, and characterisation are perfect. It is a 10-star piece.   It is shortly followed by the beautiful and uplifting poem 'Define Us Not' by Alison LeBlanc. Here are a few lines: "Life is full of mystery/and pain and grief and war/but all that I can tell you is/there's plenty more in store".   This is followed by a slightly odd but quite interesting story about overcoming obstacles called 'Uncle Ed' by Kathy DeFlane. The story is told by a fairly funny narrator.   Several pieces in, we get the poem 'Hope', written by Carrie Renee McAlister. It is the eleventh piece in Seeing Past Sickness. It is as the title suggests a hopeful poem that opens with a fresh and creative image: "For so long I lay dormant/like a thousand bulbs/refusing to bloom". I absolutely loved this piece.   The short story "She Loved Tommie" by C. B. Jennings nearly brought me to tears. Meanwhile, "Professor" by Simon Quellen Field is a short story written as one long conversation. I have never read a story written like this before, but I must applaud the author for absolute creativity and ability to piece together such a delicate story in such a form.   "Professor" is followed by "Sacrifice" another piece by Aria Glazki; a poem this time about the painful struggle the chronically-ill endure to merely live and get through their days. It is a slow but heart-wrenching piece. Aria's poetry is as impeccable as her short stories.   Then comes another short story by a writer I've wanted to read for a while now: "The Daily Grind" by Margit Sage. It is slightly similar to Glazki's "Day by Day" piece but it is nonetheless different, with its own struggle and flavour. The protagonist is a writer, therefore, many can relate to this piece in several ways.   Seeing Past Sickness ends with another poem by Alison LeBlanc, called "The Picture of Tolerance", which I wish I could quote whole, but will have to do with these lines: "Chalk in lines of tolerance/So bold and very clear/Paint new hope for all the youth/And shadow every fear". This poem is the perfect conclusion to this collection of healing, strength and rebirth.   I am glad to have got this opportunity to read Seeing Past Sickness, which was already on my to-read list. It also gave me the chance to read pieces by writers I have met online and by others, whose work I look forward to reading more of in the future.
8	2	Dante had an impressive imagination and knowledge of mythology and ancient literature, but his descriptions of what he saw were very brief compared to what we are used to today. I would also have to admit that the constant appearance of the grudges he held against his contemporaries got old.
89	2	When I began my teaching career, I taught 3rd and 4th graders. I used this book and other Shel Silverstein material for Creative Dramatics. Once we did a whole show revolving around staged readngs of these poems. It was so much fun. The kids loved it. The parents loved it. Who couldn't love a book that has so many feel good fuzzies surrounding it?
172	1	Father of the bad sitcom.
380	1	Through the contemporary world's everyday oddities--TSA guidelines, flowers named for TV stars, cell phones blurting classical music, scrolling weather alerts--Greenwald weaves the intimacies of birth, death, longing, and grief. This mixture is startling in its sincerity, and these poems are sonically rich to boot: lovely to read aloud.
287	3	I don't read much poetry, but I have really enjoyed the only two poetry books I've read. Gabriel is the second. Gabriel is brought to life in this book by his father, who is grieving over his death, page by page, one very long poem. It's sad and introspective and beautiful. I'd recommend it to people wanting to get into poetry as it's fairly chronological and easy to follow, but also carries the aspects of what makes poems stick with you.
109	2	In order to enjoy this piece of classic literature, you may have to do some research on how people acted and thought in the Middle Ages, and some research on the pieces of literature that Chaucer "borrowed" to make some of his stories. If you really delve into it and spend some time on it( As I did in my "Chaucer" class for University) then you will get the full experience.
496	1	Great selection of poems! Fun to reread my way through eleventh grade lit with an adult eye now!
644	2	Having read the entire Graywolf 'The Art of...' series, I found Doty's "...Description" the most inspiring and philosophically helpful. Not only are the poetry selections he pulls from balanced (classical through contemporary, male and female, narrative and experimental), but he provides in-depth analyses that resonate with his broader linguistic concerns. Unlike a few other books in this series, 'Description' lays a larger-level philosophical groundwork by which all poems and analyses can be judged. Doty writes confidently yet with humility. He recognizes the subjectivity of his analyses and sees such subjectivity as a reason to celebrate, not as a condemning statement about artistic creation.
795	2	Along with Beowulf, this is one of the earliest heroic epics, as Gilgimesh becomes king, meets his match in another warrior who then becomes his best friend and then sets out to conquer death.
842	1	great for any science concepts in middle school or high school
209	2	Overall, it's not bad. It's an eerie, horroresque poetry book. There are some good lines, a few good poems, and one really great piece. What's interesting is the inspiration for most of these were drawn from a book entitled Newgate Calendar, true crime stories. You can see that in the poems. I don't know if I would've picked it up, had it not been for the really awesome cover. If you like poetry and eerie scary things, I say give it go. Personally, it wasn't bad but nothing that I feel like was earth shattering either.
52	2	Moonrise by @SarahCrossan is incredible. Gritty, lyrical, tender and so human. A magnificent follow up to One. I can't recommend it enough
572	3	The New Death and Others   By James Hutchings   Let me start by saying that I loved this book, but it's hard to describe exactly what it is because it doesn't really fit neatly into your standard fiction genres. But please, don't let that dissuade you from checking it out. I'm mortally afraid that I'll turn potential readers off by reviewing it and my poor attempts at trying to describe exactly what it is. But imagine, if you will, that Saki (H. H. Munro) didn't die in WWI and decided to rewrite Ovid's Metamorphosis and a few Lovecraftian short stories. Many of the stories and poems in this collection had Saki's sly, often acerbic and dark, wit and a definite mythological/phantasmagorical slant. The book is a fascinating collection of short stories, poems, and tiny vignettes, each small fantasy ending with a Saki-esque twist. There is, quite literally, something for everyone, as long as you have a rather mordant and morbid sense of humor.   The author describes it as dark fantasy and it is that. There is definitely a Greek myth feeing to the stories, but they tend to be much more amusing that the typical myths. And it isn't all fantasy. Or rather, I guess it is, but my favorite story in the collection was The Adventure of the Murdered Philanthropist that literally had me laughing out loud. I was reading it in bed and my husband thought I had lost my mind. When I picked up the book the next night to continue, he looked at me, sighed, and said, "You're not reading that again, are you?" I was clearly disturbing his fifth reading of one of his books on the Civil War. Or else he was aggravated that he wasn't having as much fun reading his book as I was reading this one. Get over it.   Anyway, The Adventure of the Murdered Philanthropist was a new Sherlock Holmes-type story, except a lot more fun, complete with murder and a brilliant consulting detective. Just to give you a taste, there is one point in the story where one of the characters is described as the sort who makes large contributions to the RSPCA. Then there was a footnote defining the RSPCA as The Royal Society for the Practice of Cruelty to Atheists. That footnote induced one of the moments that disturbed my husband so much: I broke out laughing. Okay, maybe you had to be there, though I'm glad you weren't because our bed isn't quite that large.   So there were stories like The Adventure of the Murdered Philanthropist (I would have bought the book just to get that story--it was that good) which continues the Sherlock Holmes tradition; Under the Pyramids, based on an H.P. Lovecraft story; The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune, based on a story by Robert E. Howard; The Garden of Adompha, based on a story by Clark Ashton Smith; and many, many others.   As I said, there is quite literally, something for everyone who has a sense of humor. It is difficult to convey just how much I enjoyed the various stories. I'm not much for poetry, but I did enjoy a few pieces just because of the wry humor.   I loved this book. I just wish I could convey a better feel for this collection. If you enjoyed stories like Saki's The Open Door or The Great God Pan, then you will adore The New Death and Others. I hope I've convinced you to give it a try.   Just don't read it in a setting where they're likely to call the men with the long-sleeved, white jackets if you start laughing insanely in public.   Happy Reading!
665	2	I only needed to read the following poems: "Uncle's First Rabbit," "Cannery Town in August," "Beneath the Shadow of the Freeway," "For Virginia Chavez," "Poem for the Young White Man Who Asked Me How I, an Intelligent, Well-Read Person Could Believe in the War Between Races"   I'm not really in to "modern" poetry, but the imagery in these poems is very vivid, which I do like - even if the imagery is violent and negative. I like to read things that make my emotions run high (good and bad) - makes me feel my blood pumping.
206	2	I guess it's more of a 2.5. I liked the creativity put into it, but not so much the poems. Lovely writer, but personally, I'm losing interest in this specific genre of poetry.
687	1	Very fun read, and a gorgeous book!
859	2	I have read "Phaedra" from this collection. In large part, it is a retelling of Euripides' play "Hippolytus" with French neoclassical strings attached.
143	3	I honestly couldn't make up my mind if I liked it or not. While some poems were intricately placed and held me captivated, others seemed pieced together like some cheap word magnet set, unsure of what word goes after the other. Out of the book though I am fond of Young Liberals, and Modern Love. It didn't leave me with a feeling that I want to come back for more.
639	1	Old Turtle tells a young one a legend from a different Native American tribe or nation for each of the thirteen moons in the year, explaining that turtles carry a plate on their backs for each of the 13 moons. Beautful full- page illustrations by Thomas Locker help in using this as a read-aloud. If it is too long for the time available, just read the beginning and the moon legends appropriate to the season you are in.
907	1	I loved this book as a child and still have it. I occassionly pick it up and read it!
201	3	3.5 stars, mainly because of mixed feeling.   In overall, this book was really lovely, emotional and true, you could feel that it was poetry written by a grand-ma. and the illustrations are really good with every poetry are really beautiful.   I only had two minor problems, sometimes I wandered if it was the same "nanny" writing, throughout all the book, she mainly focuses on Amy, but then some twins pops in one of the poetry, and then they're gone, then there's a grandpa in another while clearly she stated that she raised her children on her own. My second problem, was that, at time it made me uncomfortable toward my own grand-mothers, thinking that I sort of neglect them at time.   But in overall, it was really good, and really quick to read, and most of them are very lyrical.   I'd recommend it to any grand-ma and any parents with kids over 18 years old.   this is a review for netgalley, this is a honest review.
493	1	This is truly a classic that rises above all the other classics, sorry Mr. Wilde.
797	2	I first heard of Faith Shearin when our work appeared in the same issue of Poetry East. I really enjoyed the three poems of hers I found there, so I looked at her website and was so blown away that I decided to order this book. Ordinarily I'm disappointed by full-length poetry collections, as it often seems they contain only a few good poems and lots and lots of filler. Maybe it's just that we write the same kind of poetry (narrative poems with an emphasis on family history and the domestic lives of women), but it was harder for me to find poems I didn't like than poems I loved. If I had to choose a favorite, I would probably go with "Sunburns." Shearin finds a way to make even this unattractive, painful subject into something beautiful.
293	2	A fun book with lovely illustrations and a dozen good reminders of why we don't have a dog :)
420	3	The fourth issue of Plenitude is both a little new and what I've come to expect from this high-quality, diverse collection of writing by queer people. What's new, you ask? Plenitude now comes in a print version! I was so excited to get mine in the mail, and then get to parade it around on BC ferries while I was reading it. Look everyone, at this awesome queer literary magazine! Did you know it's your queer literary magazine? There's just something about having a text in tangible, print form that just doesn't compare to electronic versions. Fine, call me a luddite if you want to.   So, what about that what-I've-come-to-expect part? Let's have a look!   The first story that really caught my attention was a cute bisexual first kiss story by Edmonton-based Caitlin Crawshaw. There were a few phrases that really captured the difficulty of not fitting into the homonormative narrative of identity, like "I am trapped in that awkward space between the breeders and the queers."

439	1	This was excellent. Raw, emotional, beautiful, and just excellent!
823	1	pretty fun read. hamlet is emo af and ophelia definitely deserved better
540	1	"yet this my comfort: when your words are done,   My woes end likewise with the evening sun"   So true Shakespeare, so true.
385	3	A charming introduction for kids to meet the poet Robert Frost and his poetry. It includes information about Frost's life that is a good introduction. The collection of his poetry includes some of his well known poems. The poems have been chosen for children ages 8 to 14 years. The illustrator has done an outstanding job of bringing the poems to life with his colors and drawings. The poems have definitions of words on the same page as the poem is on.   This is a fantastic book. I wish I had this book of poetry to read when I was a child. I think it's a great introduction of Frost's poetry for any age. Don't miss out!   Disclaimer: I received an arc of this book free from the author/publisher from Netgalley. I was not obliged to write a favorable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own.
451	2	One of the best books I have ever read and re-read of any genre. Period. My only wish is that there were more of Riley's incandescent writing.
268	3	Kirkus Review: A cycle of 15 poems and vivid, expressive paintings celebrate that most American genre of music: jazz. Myers pere presents readers with poems that sing like their subject, the drumming of African rhythms leading into a celebration of Louis Armstrong, an evocation of stride piano, a recreation of a New Orleans jazz funeral and a three-part improvisation among bass, piano and horn. A script-like display type appears sparingly, guiding readers to the sound of jazz embedded in the poems' syncopated rhythms. Myers fils uses bold colors and lines straight from the muralists of the '30s to create his illustrations, dramatic foreshortening and exaggerated angles a visual complement to the pulsing sounds being celebrated. It's a very different look and treatment from that given to their earlier blues journey (2003), although equally successful at giving readers a visceral sense of its musical subject. A lengthy introduction, glossary and timeline give background to the whole. This offering stands as a welcome addition to the literature of jazz: In a genre all too often done poorly for children, it stands out as one of the few excellent treatments.   https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-re...   Recommendation: I would recommend this book to teachers and students. After reading the book, I went and bought the audio adaptation and it is beautifully done. The soulful jazz music playing in the background as the poems are read aloud and speaks in ways that simply reading the book cannot do. The audio version can be used to help teach the concept of mood and the effects of sound on a story. Each time you turn the page you are presented with bright images and a new poetic style. Teachers could have students analyze each poem of the book, with 16 separate poems there are plenty to choose from. The glossary in the back of the book is full of jazz terms to help students understand the poems better and the Jazz timeline will help them grasp where Jazz comes from.   Recommended Age: 6 and up   Awards/Honors:   * 2007 - Lee Bennett Hopkins Award, Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrator   * 2008 - Odyssey Award for Excellence in Audiobook Production Honor
879	2	This is one of the most original books of poetry I've ever read, and though the flowery style can get repetitive whenever I pick it up I end up getting lost in what feels like a new world...which is the mark of good writing. It can be seen as biographical or historical, or just as artistic, free flowing poetry. Either way it's fun to read.
307	2	I have trouble appreciating poetry even as to whether I like it or not much less whether it is good or not by others' standards. This is contemporary and thoughtful and I did enjoy it in short reading sessions. Much of it involved nature. Mary Oliver has won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.
599	1	Adult cat and literature fans may be the best audience for this quiet, reflective tale based on a retelling of an Irish poem.
303	3	What more is there to say about one of the most famous and eloquent poems in Islamic history? As for this edition, it's equally beautiful. The design of each page makes it look like something straight from Ottoman Turkey, and the added poems are also a bonus. I recommend reading the Burda once or twice, then reading the added poems separately. It helps to remember what the Burda is actually saying before reading added poems that may throw off your concentration. Anyway, definitely recommended for any Muslim, especially those who already have an appreciation for poetry and don't mind turning pages more often than usual. :-)
755	1	"So laugh a little more, care a little more   and love a little more for all we will ever   be is what we become, and in the end we   become what we leave behind."   Such insightful words! Good thing I didn't just judge a book by its blurb.   But what's up with the blurb anyway? It sounded pretentious which is not what this collection of poetry is about at all. It captures basic human truths with quite arresting words -- tugging at my heartstrings and playing dissonant sounds that somehow turn into a soulful melody . Beautiful chaos indeed!
887	1	Not my kind of poetry, I suppose?
216	2	Very nice selection of poetry. I love the overall setup of the book from the Appetizers to the Desserts. I really enjoyed the variety Rie has established here. I will post a selection of my favorites by tomorrow. Nice job Rie!
47	2	If you've never read anything by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, you probably have no idea how much of a real treat you're in for when you pick her latest poetry collection, Bodymap. It's her strongest set of poetry yet. Lyrically these are a tight set of poems, filled with gorgeous, evocative images. They're visceral, tough but soft, just like the hard femmes some of the poems are about, as well as Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha herself. In fact, the poem "my city is a hard femme" was definitely one of my favourites:   When I left Worcester, I took the smirk I learned from the side   walk with me,   the girl gang of wild weed trees busting through every   vacant lot like a bank robbery   kicking down the door with the grin of getting everything for free.   I'm as hard-assed as every pretty broken thing in town,   every donut shop that'll tell you off in a heartbeat,   every dress with just one fucked-up thing   dug out of the Auburn TJ Maxxx quadruple clearance rack.   My city is a lovely tough girl   asking you what the fuck you're looking at,   all fitted up in skintight dirty redbrick & vinyl siding   My city a broken   beautiful bitch   with a necklace of junk trees blooming   from her throat.

198	3	When We Were Very Young (Pooh Original Edition) - A. A. Milne I'm not sure what it says about me that I don't really like any poetry written in the last fifty years. But it is no doubt some kind of meaningful that I have always loved Milne.   ***   Now I read it and think about a soldier coming back from WWI and choosing to immerse himself in domestic life, writing about and for children, and I feel tremendous pity for all those poor bastards, both the ones who made it back and the ones who didn't. I'm totally down with writing poetry and imagining the real lives of stuffed animals, and really looking very closely at a child too young to go to school. Everyone always says to parents "those years fly by so fast" which is true, but not helpful. It doesn't actually clear your life of any of the other things you have to do so that you can really soak in it. It doesn't give you a minute more of sleep in those years when you are chronically deprived. It certainly doesn't buy you an hour out of work to do something pleasant with a child. You go, Milne. I'm sorry that your use of his name and likeness wrecked Christopher Robin's life, but what are you going to do? Everyone's life sucks somehow. At least something good came of it. That's enough.
533	1	So many tall tales I had forgotten. Use this book for paired classroom reading or for you and your own readers at home.
26	1	Favorites:   The Rime of the Ancient Mariner   Christabel   The Raven
310	2	This is a striking collection of poetry, much of it centered around the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. I was surprised at how drawn in I was to this collection, as I'm hesitant about political poetry not written by CD Wright or Claudia Rankine -- but I'm glad I gave this a chance. "Suburban Elegy" is going to haunt me for a while, especially.
29	2	Fitzgerald's translation exceeds the original Ancient Greek where word placement isn't mandated. Instead, his Romantic bent has fun with the language with an eye towards description and humor lost in most high-school forced, tweed-coated editions.
575	1	This Audio CD is just awesome.
898	3	This is one of the most exciting poetry books I have read in a long time. I will study this book, I will re-read it multiple times and I will marvel at the magnificent metaphors and deft shifts in tone from playful to wistful. Heroux writes the kind of poetry that with every other line I catch myself thinking "I wish I had written that!" Wonderful! Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to read the book again.
670	3	Packed with emotions and desires   However it was hard for me to connect with the poems and the pros for they seemed too personal.   I think only those who lived the experience can relate easily to the contents   In general, one could sense how the writer enjoyed making this book
344	1	Stephen Crane's poetry was a balm to my soul at one time. I carried the following poem around with me for years until it finally disintegrated in my wallet:   "Think as I think," said a man,   "Or you are abominably wicked;   You are a toad."   And after I had thought of it,   I said, "I will, then, be a toad."
147	3	The arrow-like words of Raymond Keen tear through the frightfulness of the past 50 years in these poems. He saw it, lived it, felt it and even more thought about it.   Although the collection of poems starts with Vietnam War and closes (but the last) with stanzas about the horrors of World War II, the turbulence in us does not come from war stories. It is created by the truth-seeking of its author, not hiding that our whole current world is "dinky dau". From politics and power to the great personalities of our era, these poems cover it all. Or better to say, uncover.   But do not worry, these poems are not here to frighten you, to remind you of the monstrosities of our age and our everyday disappointments. Humor (Great Man Series), faith ("I Love the Travelling Christ", "Christ Is the Feather in the Wind", "When God Comes To Us In Pieces") and love ("Soul Star") is there to interweave the harshness in other poems: just as life grows in every direction.   Nothing proves better the optimism of Raymond Keen than two facts. The title of the collection (Love Poems for Cannibals) indicates that even self-consuming humans may need poetry. The last poem of the collection ("Inside My Prose Poem Is Glory, Glory For All") reveals its core in bold setting: "WOW! Have a Heart!". A simple solution.   Enjoy this book as I enjoyed.
351	1	This is a lovely edition of Emily Dickinson's poetry. The illustrations are beautiful. If you collect her poetry books, as I do, this edition is a must to have.
256	3	Such an important book. Like Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me, this book may help readers wake up and at least be aware of what millions experience all the time, day in and day out. Whereas Coates is angry, Rankine seems more exhausted by the experience of racial bias. Everyone should read this.   Citizen, by Claudia Rankine
563	2	Once you get through the density of Aeschylus' language, it's really quite lovely. And Agamemnon is a freaking moron, but somehow that makes me like him more. Orestes? A lesser moron, which makes him less likable. But we persevere.
461	1	I'm not one for poetry, or so I thought. Maybe I just need to read more because I found this beautiful.   Favourites include:   - Faith & Despondency   - Remembrance   - A Death-Scene   - Sympathy   - Self-Interrogation   - Number 23 (the blue bell is the sweetest flower)   - and the titular poem
514	3	Honestly, I feel dissappointed while reading the first and the second parts. I can't even accept how the poetry brings me. Those feelings have too much sensation and make me feel like I'm drowning.   However, after I read the breaking and the healing parts, the words just grab my heart. Bring more bright sight into my darkness of shadow. I know why others say they love this poetry.   It's the most powerful and meaningful book I have ever read.
411	3	Sometimes, I believe that Poetry isn't for me. Maybe the avant garde use of literary symbolism is a bit too much for me. Then, I read Whiskey Words and a Shovel part 3. Now, I realized certain poetry is for me. A sporadic use of euphemism and symbolism does wonders.   r.h. Sin knows how to manipulate the heartstrings. It's done in such a realistic and palpable manner. I knew from the second poem, my own stranger, that I found a kindred spirit.   Whiskey Words and a Shovel part 3 is about Love. Toxic love. True Love. I took it as the author finding his true love after being in a terrible relationship. Sin also thanks the person who was with his love before for not knowing what he had until she was gone.   I was surprised on how relatable Whiskey Words and a Shovel part 3 was to me. Honestly, I felt that I could have written it. Or my friends could have written it. The only reason I started with part 3 because it was the one I got first from the library.   Most Notables:   my own stranger   in the dark   life-aches   after life   anger, then nothing   a similar battle
32	3	I love Engle's verse novels of Cuban history and this one is based on her grandmother's experience growing up with "word blindness" or dyslexia as we know it today. A blank book, a gift from her mother, helps the girl have a place to explore language. A wild book. My sixth grade girls keep raving about this at our book club so I had to get to it. They are right. It is lovely.
154	3	An excellent translation of the classic and highly recommended. I've put down my thoughts of the poem elsewhere but here I wanted to illustrate the differences between the three versions I've read in full [unfortunately, I did not follow my Greek studies far enough to ever attempt reading The Iliad in the original language]. Between Alexander, Fagles & Mitchell, I'm leaning toward Alexander as my favorite but it's only by a hair over Fagles. Below are a representative example from each author:   Then god-born Achilles left his spear on the bank / propped against the tamarisks, and leapt in like / someone more than human, / gripping his sword, intent in his heart on dark deeds, / he struck, turning this side and that; abject groaning rose from those / stricken by his sword, and the water was made red with blood. (Alexander, 21.17-21)   And the god-sprung hero left his spear on the bank / propped on tamarisks - in he leapt like a frenzied god, / his heart racing with slaughter, only his sword in hand, / whirling in circles, slashing - hideous groans breaking, / fighters stabbed by the blade, water flushed with blood. (Fagles, 21.20-24)   Achilles left his spear on the riverbank, leaning / against a tamarisk. Then, in a frenzy, he jumped in / with his naked sword, and with butchery in his heart / he laid about him, slashing in all directions, / and hideous screams arose from the men being hacked / and maimed and killed, and the water was / red with blood. (Mitchell, 21.17-22)
626	2	I read this for the Tournament of Books, and thought it sounded super interesting based on the summary. Nope. Some lovely sentences, but no coherent whole - maybe it's better in the context of her performance art? I'm not interested enough to find out. Even the book itself says it - "I feel bad for you, having read this far into the nothing that these notes are." Bad enough for a refund?
653	2	Text: 5 stars   Illustrations: 4 stars   Halloween-themed haiku poems provide clues in a guessing game. Each poem describes a different Halloween-based item that appears on the next page. There are also visual clues provided underneath each poem. Fun way for children to learn about haiku poetry. There is an explanation of the haiku form in the back of the book. It even defines a syllable and teaches you how to count them. Similar in format to Guess Who, Haiku, and by the same team of creators.
429	1	One of our finest living poets. No artifice. Raw and always moving.
605	2	I have a soft spot for poetry, so this one is easily a favorite. Review to come or not, well how can you give this one any justice? Words will surely fail me. So I would just leave it at that. All I have to say is read it because in more ways than one you will see yourself in every poem. [?]
392	1	Might very well turn out to be my favourite read 2016! Recommended to all!
369	1	I think I'll stick to his music...
786	2	A collection of very short poems arranged by the seasons. The illustrations are interesting and bright, but I didn't fall in love with it.
874	2	Dreamy,surreal,magical! I love it!! I'm reading this over and over again!
726	2	People have compared my poetry to Mary Oliver's enough times that I felt I should learn more about her. After reading this book, I'm honored by the comparison. She writes very simple, clean poetry about the natural world, and I can only hope that one day I achieve some measure of the control that she exhibits here.   One oddity about this book: I'd expected the poems to be arranged in chronological order, and it took me some time to realize they were actually arranged in reverse chronological order, with the newest poems first. I suspect this was done for the benefit of her fans who wanted to get to the new stuff first, but it was somewhat confusing for me, as I was reading the book expecting to see the unfolding of her style over time. Once I figured out what was going on, I started reading the book from the back (the way I almost always read magazines), and it made a lot more sense to me.
215	1	Disappointing because it is so very boring.
228	3	I just reread this play for a class I am taking. The Scopes trial took place in 1925. A man was arrested for violating a law that said no one could teach evolution at a state-funded school. Freedom of education, freedom of thought, and freedom of speech is the focus of the trial and subsequent play and movie. I reread it through a new lens, that of the NFL protests and presidential backlash. In my book, Scopes, Rosa Park, and Colin Kaepernick are all patriots. Thanks for the reminder Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee.
95	2	Plath's daughter, Frida, edited together the orignal format of Ariel before Ted Hughes changed it a little. Sheets containing her origmal scriblings that made up her last book of poetry.
388	2	A transcribed b.s. session with two wise old codgers. Interesting, not overwhelming. Some interesting comments from Michael McClure, Joanna Kyger, and a few members of the crew. I bought it for the DVD, but I've yet to watch it.   Except for Turtle Island, I've never been a big Gary Snyder fan, and only an incidental reader of Jim Harrison. I'll probably do a cursory review of their work based on these transcriptions.
769	1	Read Barb Kishimoto's copy
252	2	Lerner's remarks on Rankine, Dickinson, and Whitman are all pretty fascinating and compelling. The rest is fine: it made me think about poetry in a way I hadn't before and gave me a small reading list of works to follow up on, which I suppose is probably the best I could ask for. Of course, unlike others, I think Lerner is a great writer and enjoy reading his stuff no matter the topic, so YMMV.
148	1	Good for anyone to read.
764	1	*Queue angelic choir*
340	1	It was a good play, but I would not pick it up for enjoyment.
378	2	Gorgeous. I'm not a poetry person anymore, but now and then, someone puts the right words together. Great choice not just for mothers and daughters, but for those who have loved and lost a mother (whatever their age).
21	3	Robert Bly, before, after, but not during his Iron John phase has been one of my favorite poets. First contact was with The Tooth Mother Naked at Last, a great poem out of the Vietnam War period. A harrowing poem. His own writing has gotten simpler with time, and he should have much more recognition than he does. I see there's a film coming out - that will help a little. Equally adept as a translator, his work with Nobel Laureate Tomas Transtromer is sublime. A copy of Friends, You Drank Some Darkness should be on everyone's shelf.   Leaping Poetry is a study in writing metaphor. The current crop of American poets seem to have left metaphor behind - they should take a refresher. This would be an excellent place to start.
602	2	Maybe it's the teacher in me, but I adored book. If I taught poetry I would totally use this book as a resource. I love the relationship Jack had with his teacher and the confidence that he built over the course of the book. It was pretty cool that the poems Jack is referring to are included in the back of the book.
25	2	been reading in short bursts to get myself to sleep with inoffensive lines. nothing here to incite much emotion so perfect for the task.
114	2	One of the shortest collections of Bukowski's poems, so this is a great light read or a good collection to suggest to a Bukowski new comer. Nobody can humble you like Charles Bukowski can.
