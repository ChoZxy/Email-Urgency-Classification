565	2	This class is really easy does require access code for hw
94	3	This class is really what you put into it. The Homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class. It was a usual Math class, she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had. The class can be easy if you really do the homework.
186	2	He gets confused doing his own problems he is virtually inaccessable and he is like late to his own classes
599	1	I like her, she forgave me and accepted that a piece of scratch paper really could just be a joke.
564	2	He is the worst teacher at NIU. He doesnt speak english.....he doesnt even write in english. You cant understand a word he says and when he write on the board its just scribbles. If you get him your doomed to fail. Everyone in my class did!
182	2	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Excellent teacher! The lecture is fun, he takes time to make sure everyone is on track, the homework isn\'t overwhelming, and he is pretty hilarious. I really don\'t see how anyone wouldn\'t like Phil unless they fall into the "didn\'t work, got poor grade, must be teacher\'s fault not mine" category...
651	3	Definitely not my favorite prof. Learned more/better on mathlab then in class, because Im not too good at math and her teaching style wasn\'t good to me. if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups. lots of homework online before test, 4 tests and she gives lots of extra credit. STUDY!!!
236	2	Jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of Calculus II concepts. He is extremely funny and always engaging during class. He\'s the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable.
29	2	I had him for business calc and he made everything easy to understand. If you go to class and pay attention there is no way you can fail. He is very nice, cares about his students, and approachable.
615	2	This professor is the best I have seen yet. He cares so much about you passing the class, that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct. He makes mathematics simple and fun. There is no way you can leave this class confused or angry. He ALWAYS puts a smile on your face. Professors should learn his style of teaching.
470	1	The most caring teacher I\'ve had.
340	2	She was very hard to understand in her lectures as far as the lessons were concerned. She read almost everything out of the book. When we asked her questions, she would give us an answer that was never relevant to our questions. Avoid this teacher if you are looking for one that will teach you a lot.
628	2	Has an insulting way of teaching. Makes fun of students for not understanding material. Not reliable out side of class. Never take his class ever.
806	2	I don\'t recommend you take this professor for Business Stats in the summer...he is unclear about the information given in the class. He may be better in a regular quarter!
639	4	Mr. Hu is a great professor and can be quite humorous! I took him for both Math 40 & 60. He takes attendance by use of daily quizzes and these will add up, so come to class! We did massive amounts of homework especially during the summer but it was always out of the book and not online :) ! His exams can be tough so prepare yourself by studying!
554	1	If you want to pass math, under no circumstances take the course with this professor.
552	3	I\'m not a math wiz, but Mr. T makes everything quite easy for his students. Come to class, take notes, take the quizzes (3 points each), then take an almost identical test the next class after a nice review of the quiz. Notes are allowed for all quizzes :)Although he is sometimes hard to understand the textbook and his teaching method make it easy.
2	1	tinas labs are better than trevors
355	2	If you have a hard time with math DO NOT take this class. He doesn\'t help clear up questions and will just move on to the next section. He doesn\'t explain what he is doing, he just works a problem on the board in small writing and then moves on. He\'s always late. Even on test days.
897	2	ms nelson is one of the best teacher. she deal with the problem and visit desk to desk until the student is not clear .she is very helpful and she makes the course very easir so i will not be able to find any teacher better than her.i am planning to take the same teacher in the next calculus class but its my unfortunate that she is not going to tak
366	2	The most boring math lecturer I have ever had to sit through. He is absolutely not helpful in class or outside of it.
497	3	3 tests & 3 quizzes. She teaches very fast, but as long as you go over your notes again you should be fine. I got an A on every quiz and test. You do not need the textbook. The example problems she gives during class are very similar to the ones on the tests and quizzes. You need her notes to do well, so go to class. Class is 500 points total.
424	3	he is mean. does not give extra credit or give any credit for homework. your grade depends on three exams and the final exam. its hard to pass if you arent already fluent in algebra. he doesnt explain much, he gets mad when we ask him to go over problems. many students in my class dropped the course.i wouldn\'t recommend this teache
517	2	His second year after getting his PHD and has no clue how to teach upper division course. If you try to see him in his office hours, he gets pset and keep looking at his watch so you would feel bad and leave. He has no clue to do his own homework that he expect you to do. Avoid him at all cost.
857	3	hes one of those professors that people either hate or love. if youre good at math and hard working then youll do fine. if youre lazy and kinda bad at math dont take him! also math homework is online and its terrible. probably the only really bad thing. but hes super nice and extends homework all the time. curves at end based on overall class grade
568	2	She\'s a good teacher but boring most of the time. Wouldn\'t reccommend her..
584	4	Her class is hard, you must do homework, & show-up for class. But she is very helpful & knows what she\'s talking about. I would say her class is for self-starters who need little guidance. Tests are good if you did H.W. & asked questions when needed. People who fail her class don\'t do the H.W. or ask clarifying questions.
374	2	I spent a year and a half getting to know math again and was just starting to learn it, love it, breathe it. After this class, I almost never want to see another math equation. All love for the subject was nearly obliterated. Great guy, but ruined my confidence in my math abilities completely.
493	2	She was very scatter brained and off topic ALL OF THE TIME! Her tests were easy, but wouldn\'t suggest her to friends.
58	3	Often put students down for asking questions, tests were somewhat dificult, but if you study at all you shoul dbe ok. if you can stand him, its not that bad. He wasnt very helpful inside or out of class. Vague and somewhat awful. Would never take again.
437	2	Very good teacher! If you want to learn math, then look no farther! He was a Steelers\' fan so we got alone. But serious very good teacher, teaches the bigger picture in math. Exams and quizzes can be tricky tho. I would recommend him for any math class if you really want to learn the material!
211	3	I got 100\'s on all assignments, and ended up with a C in the class.He will not change a grade, even when wrong Attendance is MANDATORY. I thought the class was extremely easy. Even if you work 10x harder,turn everything in on time or never miss a class he won\'t use that in your favor. The final had things we never learned or talked about in class.
575	2	IF you want a teacher who is polite and respectful to others, then professor Brown is NOT the teacher for you. Take his class if you want a professor who acts too PUNK ROCK for the whole world, talks to the ladies, believes he is god and we are all his servents, and is a total geek... then take him!
797	2	Todd is the best teacher you could ever want to have if Algebra has always been difficult for you.It doesn\'t matter if everyone in the class is getting it and you aren\'t, he\'ll always take the time to make sure you understand before you leave his class!! He rocks!!!
532	4	She makes a lot of mistakes when she does problems on the board, so you have to correct her a lot. It is also difficult to understand her. The good thing is she does the math problems then posts them on her website, so you can look over them later. Quizzes due every 3 days, even on Saturdays, and homework due every week. Poppers are a big thing.
133	4	Easy IF YOU PAY ATTENTION. She teaches based on application, not content. Expect things you don\'t know to be on the test. She grades easy but it is the tests that will get you. Make a study group - quizlet helps immensely with this class. Sweet lady but not the nicest of people, and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom.
829	2	Get ready to deal with an old moody lady with a bad temper. She can be super sweet and nice! Once you turn around, she is a completely different person. She disrespects students like if they were 5 year olds. Don\'t even think about skipping class!
525	3	He is very knowledgeable and explains the material well, but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class. They are also very long (some with 40 questions) but he gives you normally over a week to complete. I would suggest taking MWF to have shorter lectures or else you\'ll zone out
759	2	Great professor! Very lenient grader.
803	2	I really liked Ms. Jones. I thought she was a great teacher and I would recommend her for people who are afraid of algebra and need extra help.
393	1	Hard to understand!
6	1	what ever the person below said was absolutly right.DO NOT RECOMMEND HER EVER
747	2	He doesn\'t understand English that well, he only has one hour a week office hours to help all of his students, he doesn\'t reply in e-mails and he does not grade fairly... DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER ESPECIALLY IF YOU\'RE NOT STRONG IN MATH SKILLS!!!!
624	2	Very helpful. Will do her best to help you succeed. Best math teacher ever!!
855	3	Mrs. Hays is very sweet. Yes she is old-school where you\'re not allowed to have drinks in the class...BUT she wants you to PASS! She provides MUCH MUCH extra credit if you show you\'re trying. Love her. Good lady. Classes are easy. Tests are hard if you don\'t study.
676	2	I really like her. Shes very helpful and wants you to do well. She will also go out of her way to make a test review so you\'re prepared for the tests and exams. I WOULD take her again.
276	3	Fred is old school, he has corny jokes and uses a pop-up projector but he is an extremely nice teacher. I will admit his lectures are dry, but he is willing to explain and help students (JUST ASK FOR HELP). He lets you make up half points on quizzes and tests. If show up to class you will pass.
938	3	Very sweet lady but beware her exams are kinda hard. You can\'t put things into your own words it has to be exactly what she says or she will count it wrong.
362	2	Mr.Teti is a great teacher. He comes to class ready to teach and will do all he can to make sure you understand the work.
592	3	She is a great professor. I did not have a book in her class and made an A. She uses mymathlab now and homework grades are easy. Take lots of notes and attend class.
353	2	This professor loves teaching and he doesn\'t complicate the class, if you don\'t understand he will teach you again and will consider your difficulties on the test, this is the kind of teachers who cares about your GPA and you learning, I would take another class professor. He earned his salary.
527	2	Close your eyes and you\'d swear Winnie the Pooh was teaching. A very caring and pleasant professor who makes sure you get through with a good grade.
415	3	If you attend class everyday, you do you\'re homework, and come to her with your questions, the class will become alot eaisier. Math isn\'t hard, it\'s just a challenge. Ms. Nelson really knows what she\'s doing and she never gives an excuse for why she can\'t explain problems. Plus, she\'s cheerful (most times) by nature so that helps!!
238	3	Good math teacher; tests are open book, open note; everyone in the class got caught cheating and he just laughed; Russian accent can get hard at times (bunch of kids snickered when he pronounced "theta," "teeta"). Just do the homework
893	2	Amazing teacher! Had her for my online College Alg class, and she is so helpful with any questions you have. I would take one of her classes anytime!
553	2	Horrible teacher. Very unhelpful. She even messed up on my attendance, she said I missed 8 days and my lab instructor backed me up that I didn\'t miss that much...so there ya go. She sucks. Crams too much into each new week of material. In my book, highly NOT recommended.
205	2	Horrible teacher. Nice lady, but not a very good teacher. She tries to teach she just doesnt know how. You end up teaching yourself EVERYTHING from the book. Drop the class or stick with it and drop your GPA, your choice. good luck :-)
790	2	I\'m taking my final class for my math minor, which is online. I\'ve never had a problem understanding the subject matter in math classes but this woman really just DOES NOT teach. She gives videos of her punching in numbers to excel sheets and expects you to understand the bigger picture. Any messages from her are rude and short with no personality
13	2	Do not take math with this teacher! She is very rude. Talks to you like your stupid if you have any questions. Never responds to emails, and really doesnt care if you pass or fail
233	3	A useful course for those who are preparing to find a spot in the marketplace.Students learn to navigate through real world current & relevant scenarios.The course gets a boost with the inclusion of periodic lectures & talks with industry gurus.With so much happening in the cyberspace the course couldn\'t have been introduced at a better time
515	1	I find it ironic that the people criticizing his English skills also happen to have had the most problems posting a coherent comment for this prof. The irony is delicious...that is, if it you get it.
173	3	Best math teacher I have ever had. He taught math is a way I could understand and always available for help. Had office hours before class, I would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes. Helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit. Builds relationships with students, funny and is awesome.
175	1	Really awesome and interesting teacher, and I don\'t even like math.
663	1	He is an awesome professor I ever have
404	1	He\'s the best <3
593	2	Terrible professor. Does not know how to teach. Would not recommend taking her unless math is your strength. If you\'ve taken calculus before its very easy but still rough to sit through.
608	2	she is the best math professor ever!!!If you need to take math take her and you would be fine...
630	2	Jerry is an amazing teacher. He has the passion needed to teach difficult concepts. Jerry is always available for extra help and is very approachable. Everyone should try to take at least one class from Jerry while at Western!
869	2	Great teacher!! Math is one of those subjects I hate the most, but prof. Burns helped me understand it in matters of minutes made it much more simpler. Thanks professor Burns.!! We need more professors like you. :)
721	3	AMAZING. Very clear, easy work. 10/10 would recommend. Very nice, give A LOT of extra credit, take advantage! I would definitely choose her as my professor again. Tests are super easy and you have so much extra credit you\'ll always pass.
316	2	Mrs. Johnson is an all around decent professor. I am not good at math whatsoever, so I have trouble in her class. However, she is understanding. Do not miss her class if you don\'t have to, trust me, you will regret it. She is pretty good at explaining things and will help you further. I don\'t have anything bad to say about her.
45	3	he is hard to understand because of his accent. if you do all of the work, attend recitations, and do the extra credit at the end (which isn\'t hard0 you will get at least a B. I am horrible at math and my tests were horrible in the class and i pulled off a B.
481	3	She\'s a nice lady but she\'s not the best teacher. She gets off track and kind of bounces around in her lessons. Each question on her tests count for a ridiculous amount of points. She also seems like one of those people who let things build up then will explode on you. If I had to do it over again, I wouldn\'t take her.
31	1	The first math teacher who took the time to help me.
751	2	Best Geo teacher! helps you in his office well if you have any questions. He\'s really nice too. If you do all the homework and understand, you shouldn\'t have any problems with the tests. I never really took notes in class and did well on the tests.
502	3	She is great. A little bit boring, but makes sure everyone gets everything. I guarantee after this class you will understand all you didn\'t understand before. Gives a lot of homework, but you don\'t have to turn it in. However, it helps a lot to do homework. Take her if you want to know math
380	3	Lectures are not interesting, and she goes through the textbook word for word and does all of the textbook example problems. She takes homework questions and works out all of the problems you ask her to. The exams are much more difficult than the content she actually teaches.
906	2	MUST TAKE !! do hw , lecture examples, extra problems, and your golden
861	3	She\'s a nice person, gives her time to students who utilizes office hours. Hard coursework and a lot of homework, but doing it really helps with the exam. Pick if you can allot enough time for it
534	2	If you are bad at math just do not take his class at all. He is a nice guy, tries to be funny and joke around. But as a professor he is just horrible. he cannot speak English properly, he knows math, just cant explain it. He does not like confrontation either, if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell.
168	2	Good professor. Took him in the summer class. Exams are based on his reviews.
798	1	WARNING. If you want to keep taking this course over and over again...take her...she is Str8 horrible.
111	2	A+, good teacher, makes u learn and think. Has an accent; uses great vsual help
521	3	Horrible teacher. Sucked really bad.I failed and was only two points away. She crams to much info. in at one time. The test are never the same as the practice test. She had pet students who set right up next to her in class. Even, my lab instructor said I feel sorry for you guys, I wouldn;t have taken her for any classes.
680	3	The class is really boring, and she is no help at all. I went to her office a few times and that was just a waste of time. The final project is kind of interesting. Tests weren\'t too bad if you knew your stuff.
450	2	I thought this class was easy but I am amazing at Math, but even if you aren\'t good at math he makes sure that everyone understands what\'s going on.
89	1	Really fun and interesting!
384	3	She only does the easy problems on the board & when u get the worksheet u don\'t know what to do. The test r harder than anything she teaches. She closes her eyes when she lectures and has an attitude sometimes. She\'s also very impersonal. Don\'t take her class \'cause u will fail. She makes her assistant wait outside till the end of class like a dog.
756	3	This was a very difficult course, but he always took the time to make sure you understood the material. Homework was optional, but I highly recommend it since his quizzes are based off the assignments. Overall, if you work hard and seek help, this class isn\'t going to be too bad
691	3	thick accent but easy. Open Note Open Book take home tests can\'t be much easier to get an A then that. in other words he is the man!!!
795	3	She is a great teacher! She will help you, just as long as you ask her. I hated math, but she made the class interesting. She makes her tests sound hard, but they are easy. Promise. You have homework with no definite deadline and a fun tessalation.. basically easy grades. I highly recommend her!
720	2	She has a sense of humor and moves at a slow pace for the people who don\'t understand.
562	3	Well- the class was SO easy- mostly b/c i took the same class in high school. I never did the homework- just sort of paid a little bit of attention and did fine. The tests are EXACTLY like the online review she puts up- except that the numbers are different. An easy A. Talk to her- she will be more willing to help if she knows your name.
376	2	The worst class I have ever taken. Attend tutoring twice a week in addition to seeking outside help. Very condescending. After asking to go over a homework question during the allotted time he responded by saying "I can\'t believe you asked to go over that". Overall rude and not helpful at all.
178	2	I took her 7 week course, and to be honest, I was scared out of my mind on my first day with her. She\'s tough but she definitely knows what she\'s talking about. This was my second time in the course. The first time I withdrawled because I was failing, and the second time around I got an A! I recommend her for sure.
681	1	Very nice professor teaches the subject well. By far one of the best professors I\'ve had thus far.
425	2	He grades fairly easy. The hardest part of his class is understanding his accent. Once you get past that, class will be a pretty typical math-lecture class.
414	2	This guy was awesome. He would talk to himself at the board and always insult himself for doing something wrong. His class was great and for the first time I understood what the h**l precalc was about.
817	2	mark is great. his only real flaws are that he can be a bit too smart for his own good and his clothes are all too tight.
762	3	She is not a push over. U have to do her HW (She dont play that) but if u do its a recipe for success. Just attend class, do HW, ask ?\'s, and do her reviews and you WILL do very well in her class. U will be spoiled by her ability easily relay the information because once you leave her class u will c other prof. don\'t or won\'t. AWESOME! REALLY CARES
249	3	Nearly everything she does in class appears to be taken right from the textbook. She teaches by simply doing example after example and doesn\'t really explain the concept by talking but rather does lots of examples in order for you to understand which wasn\'t bad. If you study the tests and quizzes can be quite easy.
492	2	Professor Burk is really a great, cheerful guy! He wants all of his students to succeed and is willing to do whatever he can to help each and every student get a good grade. He explains everything well and has very helpful office hours. One of my favorite instructors at Pitt!
36	1	Has a wicked accent and wierd hand witing but he knows the stuff he\'s teaching
874	2	I respect him as an elder and professor. But there is one thing to be aware, Pro. Pan is at his retiring age. For me, it was very difficult to hear what he is saying and in addition to that I could not even see what he writes on the board. He still has the skills, but the problem is in addressing wh
604	3	Funny guy, really smart. If you\'re naturally good at math this class won\'t be too bad. I would avoid skipping as he covers about a section a lecture. Homework is tough, but the quizzes and exams are quite easy.
403	1	AMAZING PROFESSOR
518	4	Dr. Kim Park teaches EXTREMELY fast. She is willing to go over problems multiple times (with a little sass) till you get it. She is available during office hours and is helpful there too. Exams are straight forward and mostly from the notes/homework, no surprises. She\'s also really relatable. 3 exams, 1 final, homework. 500 pts. Provides formulas.
867	3	Fred is one of the best math teachers I have taken. He is always willing to help. I passed this class because of him. However, make sure you show up to class and don\'t miss a test!
512	2	Sarcastic on the verge of being mean. A little too cocky for my taste...couldn\'t concentrate on the lesson without worrying what she was going to say next!
904	2	Her class is an easy A and she is a really nice lady. Sometimes she can be confusing but she is very approachable and will help you with anything you need. I would recommend her to anyone.
602	2	She is extreamly nice, she will help you out as much as you need it. if you are failing the class or falling behind it is because you dont pay attention in class or do the homework. she is a great teacher and i\'m doing well in the class and i\'m not that great at math.
291	2	She was okay teacher, she didn\'t do well in teaching the math. She would get attitudes at times and I got a C in that class, even after to doing good on all my test and homework...Don\'t recommend her.
311	1	She is absolutely the best math teacher i\'ve ever had. I have always struggled with math. And with her help i passed the class.
195	3	One of the easiest teachers on campus. Very lenient & laid back. Very helpful when you go meet him in his office. Has 3 exams & a final but the final is optional so if you do well in the 1st exams & the homeworks you are good. If you did 2 exams bad, he replaces your final grade with 1 so that you can get a better grade. I recommend you take him.
687	1	"The Todd" is the man. I am sure that if I had had him as a math teacher earlier in life, I would be a rocket scientist by now.
850	3	EASY!!! you dont have to go to class, she lets you do hw online and its extra credit, weekly quiz dont count if they hurt your grade, at the end lets you retake or make up a test of your choice.Test are from quizs and she makes copy of quiz with answers on them! No excuse to not have an A!!
520	2	Great guy! really cares about students learning. I have always struggled in math until now. Very funny and easy on the eyes. Great smile. Wish I could take more classes from him.
953	3	Owen is a really fun guy. Just make sure you keep up with your homework and STUDY for the tests and you will be in good shape.
513	3	If you\'re looking to take Hall for Sounding Numbers... AVOID THIS CLASS. Yes, it\'s easy but I\'ve learned absolutely nothing. Longest lectures ever and they make no sense. She gives quizzes every Thursday. I personally hated this class because I had no interest in taking a music class. You HAVE to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework.
729	2	Hard class for the graduate students, even more torturous for the undergraduates. Horrible book-- both book and Gao expected a lot of prior knowledge, but he\'s very helpful as long as you ask. Go to his office or ask him quetsions in class. Good Luck!
970	1	VERY NICE AND AN EASY TEACHER
918	3	I didn\'t dislike Professor Browne as a person, but as a teacher she is very difficult to follow along with. If you have trouble in math, I would not recommend taking her class. Too much lecture, without the in class practice. If for some reason you do take her, talk to her one-on-one, because she is willing to help you.
341	3	She is definitely moody for sure. Her class isn\'t really that difficult. She\'s just very strict, like no food and phones on the table. No talking/ whispering when she\'s talking. Attendance is mandatory. Don\'t be late. The classwork and assignments is pretty easy.
761	3	Sassiest professor I\'ve ever had. No drinks or food other than water. But, over all her class was pretty easy if you show up, do her daily reflections, and follow her syllabus to the dot. Lot of papers to keep up with. I ended up dividing mine by week in a binder.
124	2	It\'s not an easy class, but he definitely helps. The homework problems are very similar to those on the quizzes and tests.
304	3	she is very helpful. if you need help she is willing. you get a 100 on homework as long as you do them.
881	2	this is the best professor to take if math is hard for you. he is very helpful, extremely generous when grading, and truly wants you to understand the material. i would definetely recommend this class to anyone who has a little trouble in math!
742	2	Mrs. O\'Bryan is a good teacher. He tests aren\'t to hard and she is very helpful when needed. Everybody that don\'t like her, don\'t know crap about math and that is why they are failing. If you know anything about math...she is the woman to take
645	3	I will be honest, I am horrible at math. She teaches half lecture and the rest online. You must get them right or you won\'t receive credit. Have a question regarding the homework? She only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only, because that\'s all you\'ll have time for. Get ready for a ton of homework. Tough.
191	1	I love this teacher. I took three semesters with him, if I have any math class I will take with him with pleasure :)
103	2	Phil is awesome. He spoon feeds you. All you need to do is put in the numbers from the problem on the test. is it was 5+6-7 on your homework, itll be like 8+9-6 on the test. you just need to study the process. people who dislike him are EXTREMELY lazy.
658	3	He is a good teacher and the tests are pretty easy because he gives you old exams to study. There is a good amount of homework online, and he takes attendance everyday. He does have an accent but you get used to it, and he writes everything he says in the online notes he gives you and on the board in class.
570	2	Such a great teacher...if your not good in math do her extra credit it helps!!!
858	3	Prof. Ream is one of the nicest professors out there. He\'s a little awkward but super patient and willing to help students. However, his lectures are disorganized and undefined. Math doesn\'t come easily for me so, although I\'m a hard worker and I took lots of notes, I did have to spend a lot of time in the tutoring center to get a better grasp
427	3	Kathy is well aware most people dislike math and as a result makes great efforts to make this class as painless as possible. No textbook purchases are required too which is a huge bonus. Highly recommended.
962	1	she\'s cool
297	3	Mr.Harville is an excellent instructor that will do anything that he can to help. I wouldn\'t say that is class is easy but if you make a good effort you can make an A in his course. If you take this course make sure that you complete all homework assignments and review test; they are important because they are similar to the test.
471	2	I can\'t understand why some people don\'t like him. His lecture is very logic and helpful to understand materials. His test is not bad at all as long as you study.
991	3	make 7 copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful. make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos. in lab do all homework first then your quizzes. Your quizzes are what\'s on the test so practice the unit exam too.
225	2	Great, caring teacher! Always willing to help and actually wants you to learn the material. If people don\'t like her, its because they don\'t want to actually work for a grade (its college... you are going to have to actually try .)
694	3	Took an online class. Pretty easy sinceCollege Algebra is mostly same as high school algebra. Used videos on ConnectMath as review and made easy A\'s. There\'s a lot of homework, but discussions are easy. It was just roll call or saying something like "I understand ______."
237	2	very good teacher for beginning algebra. very helpful and encourageing. i was well prepared for intermediate level.
354	2	I have him for Cal II, his tests are easy and always give 5 extra point for every test. Would take him again.
239	4	He was pretty clear to understand, and WANTED everyone to succeed. He posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review. Even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks. Not even kidding; he built 5 points into each test and was huge on partial credit. Made Calc 3 a breeze.
567	1	I could imagine this class being difficult for those who struggle with math.
992	4	lectures kinda suck, lots of homework, but quizzes every friday right from the homework and easy ass math lab will keep your grades up. she\'s willing to help, even if she is a little weird.
449	2	good for students who have had calc before, if not see him during office hours. do the maple labs right or they will screw you.
996	4	Hands down worst math teacher i have EVER had. Argued with students. Condescending and bizarre. There were four huge \'quizzes\' which more resembled a midterms. no review of material. hwk assignments and class examples do not match quiz/final questions. V RUDE MAN STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. DROP IT. REPEAT AVOID GLENNON.
228	3	You can go never go to this class a day in your life and you\'ll be just the same. she uses my mathlab which i found to be very annoying. i spent 44 hours on homework in the semester which only accounts for 10% of your overall grade. i spent another 11 hours on quizzes which are 20% of your grade so unless you have a ton of time i wouldnt take her.
541	3	His lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class. He only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine. He uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers. he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together
982	2	He is a wonderful professor!! Very helpful and easy to learn from!! If you have a choice take a class with Allen!!
744	3	Best professor ever. Genuinely a nice guy who just wants everyone to do well. Tests are nearly identical to the review problems he assigns. Always willing to clarify concepts in lecture and holds plenty of office hours.
433	2	He\'s a great teacher.He take his time to explain the work..his test are stree free and so i his classs....reconmend u take him.and he give you credit if ur ans is a little bit incorrect
222	2	Super boring, super dull. You really don\'t need to go to class except when there\'s an exam. Everything else is literally straight from the book; she\'s pretty much reading it aloud to us word for word.
703	2	I was having a hard time with math, but she really heped me understand. She dedicates extra time to those students who are having a hard time.
391	2	I took Elementary Algebra in NewSkills and thought that was good. Well, Mr. McDonald teaches the class better than the little CDs on the computer in NewSkills. I have the CDs at home and I learn more from him than I do with the CDs. I have learned and retained more from his teachings.
903	3	Mr. Ream wants all of his students to succeed and pass his class. He\'s very helpful and eager to make sure that students understand. His extra credit really helps out if you\'re struggling. He\'s old school and might seem like a mess with all his papers flying around, but he\'s on top of it. Highly recommend him for your 1330 Math class! :)
10	2	Although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times, he is a pretty good math teacher. I am rather sure I am getting am A in his class and although sometimes I don\'t go for reasons that I just don\'t want to or emergencies, I never feel like I fell too far behind. Rock on Detlef!!
555	2	LOVED Mrs.Everage! If you took AP Calc in high school this will simply be a refresher course. If you\'re struggling though, she\'s always more than willing to help you so go to those help sessions she offers. Use and abuse the online egrade practice quizzes.
666	2	Talk about a professor that cares! She will do whatever it takes to explain it to you! I would for sure take her if you feel you need a kind, rather "meek" teacher that can really teach! Super nice!
27	3	No matter what professor you take on-line, it\'s a self-teaching class. ConnectMath doesn\'t have any mercy on students. Load work is insane. We had About 25 videos to watch, about 80 questions homework and 2 hour quiz each week. It\'s not a multiple choice. Professor Gutliph gave us a great Midterm review. Will take him again.
23	2	Great guy, always willing to meet and help out. Super funny, made class worth going to. Wish he was still at LU.
32	3	Not an excellent teacher. Doesn\'t do a very good job of explaining the material required. Homework and quizzes are all online, his due dates change at random. Things will be due when they haven\'t even been discussed in class. Nice man, but I don\'t recommend him.
326	3	Love Dr. Kim Park she is very straight to the point. There are ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISES in her class. Very nice grader too! Surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment! Doesn\'t use text. Homework is online. Very prompt grader I was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand!
924	2	This teacher really knows what she is talking about. Once you get into the college level classes, she moves rather quickly. Try to get as much as you can out of her lectures. She doesn\'t like repeating herself, but will answer any questions that you have. If you are having any trouble, she is always willing to e-mail her students back. She\'s sweet!
105	2	Ms. Usyk was very difficult to work with. She was arrogant and not helpful. If you take her class, your pretty much on your own. Stay away.
606	2	Love Mrs. McVey. Took her for 2 math classes, she was amazing and caring and helpful. A really great teacher.
235	2	Tulovsky is the best teacher at St. Johns. Teaches really well. Easy A... Take him if you can
997	2	3D explanations are not her thing but over all easy class. If you do the assignements properly, easy A because her final is basicly questions from the book
739	2	Excellent professor. I\'ve had him for Algebra II, Trigonometry, and Calculus. He\'s and excellent professor, cares very much about your understanding, grades fairly, and is always available to help.
273	1	Santa Clause is a awesome teacher........
457	2	He is so hard. You better be well prepared and be very knowledgable of Calculus I because he starts right into Calc II and doesn\'t look back. Confusing and has bad handwriting.
713	3	i would never take her again... the homework was on the computer and the test were on paper and if the clas doesnt understand something and you ask a question she says she has "office hours" most people had stopped coming by the end of the semevery sit was packed at the start if your not good with math on the computer i wouldnt take her
3	1	Great teacher. She\'s willing to help you out.
786	2	She was a very helpful teacher and anyone who wants to pass and graduate, obviously has to do the work, so why not take her and enjoy it! Give her a break, she\'s a math teacher! How easy is it to teach math and still maintain the student\'s attention? Not easy but she does it well.
781	1	THE PERSON THAT RATED ON THE APRIL 21, 2010 NEEDED TO STUDY MORE. STOP GOING OUT TO PARTIES IF YOU ARE GOING BAD IN CLASS.AND STOP CHILLING IN CLASS. FIRST LOOK FOR YOUR STUDY METHOD AND ORGANIZE YOUR TIME. I TOTALLY AGREE THAT PROFESSOR TOWNSEL IS A GREAT PROFESSOR BUT IF YOU DO NOT STUDY IT IS OBVIOUSLY THAT U WON\'T PASS ANY CLASS. SO DON\'T BLAME
623	1	The worst teacher ever. Drop the class, lost my money the worst experience at miami dade.
444	3	Dr. Hardy is HORRIBLE at teaching.. He need to improve in his teaching skills. Attending class everyday is a MUST or you will be left behind. He will give you extra credit to help your grade. He\'s sorta fair when he feels like it. Go to the tutoring lab because they will help you! I won\'t recommend his class to people who have a hard time in math.
400	2	The best math teacher hands down!! I took him for math 1111 and math 1113 and always had the mindset that I was going to fail cause I\'m so bad with math. But he made everything different, very helpful! You would need to make a lot of time for his class but worth taking! Take him! You won\'t regret it!
856	2	I didn\'t like her as a teacher. Her lectures were horrible and you could tell she had no interest in teaching anatomy... As a person though, she\'s hysterical. I loved her dry sense of humor
915	3	I did not like this class! WAY too hard for a basic math class. Lectures were SO boring and confusing, she just did problems the whole time which didn\'t help me. Definitely the worst class and probably worst professor I\'ve had at UW so far. Seems like a nice lady, but tests were SO HARD, and were nothing like her practice tests.
30	2	Holy Cow! This class was insane. But I recommend Godel, Escher, Bach Frontiers because it\'s an incredibly interesting class -- probably only because Mr. McKibben teaches it. Works really hard to help us understand everything. Great comments -- makes you want to do well in his class.
500	2	Excellent teacher in online courses. As long as you asked questions, she would help you out. I made an A after being out of Math for 10 years. I strongly recommend her if Math is not a good subject for you.
97	2	Honestly I hate Bonnie Johnson with a passion. She is the worst teacher I\'ve ever met. She doesnt go over the work you do in your book. What kind of teacher makes you learn the work yourself and do homework on what you think you learned and then go over it in class in a completely different way then the book says. HOMEWORK IS TO REINFORCE BONNIE!!
215	3	Very sweet professor. He knows math analysis like the back of his hand. His tests are not difficult at all. He includes 1 proof ? on his tests which I think is unfair because a lot of non math majors are required to take the class. Smart professor with an accent but it doesnt effect lectures. He cuts slack for the programming quizzes every week
808	3	This is a review for her WINTER MINI SESH STATS 2311 First of all, she\'s very engaging in her live lectures. She cares a lot about her students, often offering to meet w/ us at UH to help. Since this course is only a month long, it\'s reasonable that she goes at fast pace, so pay attention or self study a little. 3 Tests, quizzes, and poppers.
389	1	You will never encounter another math prof with a better personality. He keeps you from drifting off with his random stories about goulash, etc.
668	2	Dr Hardy is extremely rude. He will laugh in your face about questions you ask. At one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore. Also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue. Our online system calculates grades wrong I received a D but if you calculate it it adds up to a B he still wouldn\'t fix it. Saying it wasn\'t his issue
484	1	He\'s not a great prof, but he\'s a damn genius and he\'s really funny.
461	3	doesn\'t really speak english. very hard to concentrate and learn from. weekly quiz on fridays that you cannot make up, no matter what reason, even if a relative dies. major jerk.
780	3	Easy to understand, easy to excel. Gives extra credit questions on tests. If you can pay attention the whole period, you don\'t need to do the homework.
508	3	I would highly recommend Mr. Gutliph. There is a lot of work in connect math, and it can be very time consuming, so be prepared to do the homework. If I have the opportunity to attend one of his classes in the future I will. He is a great professor, and actually cares that you pass his class.
121	2	Harihar Khanal is a nice guy and he knows math rather well. However, due to his accent it is hard to understand him very well and it is hard to learn from it. He does not respond to emails very quickly, and he loses some assignments if you turn them in outside of class. He tries to have a sense of humor but its more dad jokes really..
262	2	Though he is hard to understand sometimes, he really knows his stuff! If you do the homework and take notes in class, you will be able to overcome the confusion most students experience.
65	3	I would not recommend Park for people who struggle with math. She speeds through problems assuming everyone is following along. Tests are whatever.. Still failed the class because your grade is solely based on 3quizes 3exams and final. This prof Is great 4 people who are good at math or have taken stats before.
783	1	Dreadful!
822	2	She tends to be unorganized, messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we, as the students, try to correct her. It was to the point where I actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me. All in all, I got an A by self-study and teaching.
868	2	He is a great teacher. Makes learning fun and is willing to stay late to help you get it. One of my favorite teachers so far.
583	4	She teaches very fast, but if you attend all of her lectures you will be fine. For her stat 108 class, there are 3 quizzes, 3 tests and then a final. Be sure to review your tests/quizzes to make sure they were graded correctly because her TA this year marked several things wrong that were not. Overall, she is very funny and tries to make it fun.
138	2	TAKE THIS CLASS!!! For the people that stated he\'s hard, he grades hard, you cant understand him, yaddy yadda yahhhhh... your the ones that either A) tried to learn in his class and get a passing grade, B) don\'t know anyone from his past classes, or C) both A and B \r \r For me I was neither. find someone from his past classes and use the tests they
