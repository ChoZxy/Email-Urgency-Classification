802	3	I took her course online and although I didn\'t like the online aspect, I truly loved her teaching. She is very funny and caring of her students. She will stay after class hours and help those who need it. I selected lecture heavy because it\'s all online so it is, lol. Watch her lectures, do her work, & the test will be very easy! An A is possible!
793	3	Shes a very friendly woman, but she classifies herself as an "auditory" learner so most of her material is online and her lectures are mostly her speaking. Not a lot of examples. No book no actual homework to turn it. It\'s all online and on very vague notes. Would not recommend her at all if math isn\'t an easy subject for you.
859	3	Had to take College Algebra, havent had any Algebra in 7 years. She makes it interesting and understandable. She is very helpful, takes time out in class to check your work, overall a wonderful professor. She even gives you partial credit on the tests for your work, very fair with grading... just dont miss class or you WILL get lost!
612	3	He is smart as hell, but didn\'t really "teach" - he just wrote on the board without consideration for the existence or uniqueness of any audience. Deciphering missing steps from the board was like solving a puzzle, and there wasn\'t much value in going to class (I went anyway). Lots of independent learning was needed! Nice exam, very challenging!
47	2	This professor is very knowledgeable, but has a very hard time dumbing things down. You have to be able to teach yourself a lot of stuff. This is not an easy class,(a tip: seek out psych profs for help). He\'s always trying to make jokes, they are never seem funny, but it\'s amusing. It\'s required for psych majors so good luck! Don\'t give up!
883	2	i always read comments that say drop this class.. but seriously DROP THIS CLASS. worst teacher ive ever had at fit. sets up the class for you to fail. talks more about her bmw than math..
284	2	Great guy who cares about his students. He will do anything to help you and is very approachable.
469	2	Really good teacher, always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so. Unlike several other teachers, she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial. Would take another class with her if I can. Thank you Ewa Duma!
977	3	Entire class consists of him doing examples. He might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it. Homework is on LonCapa which is the worst! If you bring him the question, he\'ll do it for you though. Tests are alright if you review. He\'s a good person, but not the best teacher. Trig is hard, and he doesn\'t really make it easier. No book needed.
660	3	Moore is a pretty decent teacher, she helps and gives a lot of example during class if you\'re confused. Her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online. She does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you don\'t wait till the last minute. All in all she wasn\'t too bad, I\'m horrible at math and she helped me pass.
578	3	One of the best math 80 teachers!! He assigns homework but it is similar to what will be on the test. He sets you up for success in his class. He may have a thick accent but he writes everything on the board so you have no reason not to understand. He made coming to class enjoyable with his sense of humor and funny personality!
303	2	Owen is fantastic. He is a really nice guy and a great teacher. If you have any trouble, he is always available to his students. I would love to take another one of his classes.
828	3	This was a stupid class! you will not learn anything because he doesn\'t teach and he expects you to teach your classmates. he assigns hw, but never collects it. We only went over 1/2 of the chapters we needed to know for a department final!!! I\'d learn more never going to this class!
274	3	What a guy. Abbas is a German genius mathematician with a slick accent. He\'s always cracking little jokes, bringing a little light to a very dull and stale topic. The class is stone cold. But that\'s not gonna change with a different prof. Plus lectures aren\'t mandatory because he posts his notes online. Go to recitation for the quizzes.
84	3	dr wilson is interesting.. he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy. you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests! the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups.
580	2	I\'m horrible at math. I had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those. Professor Young is the best math teacher I have ever had. Yes, I made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not knowing/remembering a concept. TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY TYPE OF MATH
230	3	Great professor, always has a smile and is willing to help! She does a really good job at breaking up material to make it easier to understand, but it\'s easy to fall behind if you miss class. Do the practice problems from the study sheet before the exam.
805	2	He is insane, who cares if he has issues with himself. He should not take it out on us ! I\'ll bet money he\'s the one who posted those last two comments about himself. Please seek help Glennon and get the hell out of DePaul ........**** !
585	2	Ok so this class was boring and too easy but the teacher complicated it. She takes EVERYTHING from the book even explanations which arent really worth while because they might not make sense to you. SO get yourself a real good tutor for this class
714	1	You will learn a lot from his class
740	2	Dr. Kim Park is my absolute favorite professor. She\'s funny, makes the class super interesting, she\'s very helpful and she makes sure that you\'ll be able to understand the materials and pass the class. Having her as my professor was such an honor. Lectures are fun, make sure you show up on time and don\'t miss class you\'ll do great. no textbook use.
911	2	Awesome instructor. Will NOT hold your hand thru the course and give you easy grade, but very helpful, funny, does all he can to get students up to speed on Trigonometry. Even in 5 week course, he gets to the point so we learn what we need. Would take this instructor again in a heartbeat! The course was fast, he made it fun and understandable.
118	2	She was a really great teacher. I am not good at math and I hate the math lab program, but she taught very well.
350	3	I took his online class during the summer. He was very lenient If i could not get past a section by his due date he would give me some extra time also he would give me options to get help. Section 14 i think was the hardest but just Pass that and it gets easier! Make sure you do the notebook HE DOES collect those.
719	2	Cool teacher, but wack teaching methods
151	2	Sharp guy, expects a lot from his students--sometimes I think he confuses us with his grad students. He doesn\'t always work out solutions to the homework problems before he assigns them, which can turn into long and grueling homework sessions. Homework took roughly ten hours a week, often more. However, it was definitely worth being in his class.
390	1	I like him because I understand him when he teaches me in class.
75	4	Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work.
417	3	Best professor in john jay to teach math! he mad the class so easy and amazing.. gives hwk once a week and dropest the lowest test grade! Amazing!
41	2	Nice man but makes Math extremely confusing. Over half of my class dropped. I got an A but it was from studying the book myself and being decent at math already.
725	3	Long boring lectures and exams that don\'t accurately represent what was taught in the homework, as well as in lecture. However, the exams are heavily curved.
685	2	Terrible teacher. Cannot get a full thought out. Will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct, will tell you that he is correct. Does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it. Makes you buy a book for $150 and doesn\'t let you use it.
801	2	Duma will be a good fit for you if you\'re good at self-teaching. Her midterms/finals are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance. Would recommend.
594	2	Condescending, arrogant..........back off lady, you only have a BA!!! Absolutely NO sense of humour, turned red in the face yelling at me because I made fun of one of her stuipd assignments........good luck if you have her, you\'ll need it!!!
669	2	GREAT .. GREAT. That\'s all I can say. I hate math and did good in her class because she goes step by step in everything. She is fun to look at because she is different so she always has your attention. Her last name isn\'t MaFadden anymore I don\'t know what it is know.
501	3	Very good professor, helpful and funny at the same time. Make sure you take all 4 test and the final, try your best and everything will work out in the end promise. Take Bob!
619	1	LOVED HER. she was my favorite professor EVER
657	3	I took this class online in the fall. It is basically self-teaching, and I fell behind. Everything is on a e-book, homework, quizzes, ect. He doesn\'t teach anything, you teach yourself. LOTTS of hw, you\'ll find yourself behind. I failed the class
299	2	Very comfortable pace for a Calc class. He goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions. Very easy to reach to meet during office hours. If you\'re trying to get into the school of business but struggle with Calc, he\'s the perfect teacher.
766	2	This was the easiest class ever ! she is the sweetest and she is soooooo nice.
349	2	Really enthusiastic, wicked friggen nice, and a good teacher. Her tests can get pretty husky but thats to be expected in Linear Algebra.
347	2	He has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework. Class was very challenging
377	2	Very effusive teaching, clearly loves teaching. Upbeat, very good at answering questions, homework makes you think, puts A LOT of work into the course, excellent at explaining concepts, best math teacher I\'ve ever had.
779	3	I am currently taking her class and she does rush through the material. She is late sometimes. The tests are graded strictly. She doesn\'t review before tests because students do not feel they can ask questions. My advice is to seek tutoring. However you can take the departmental exam to opt out repeating which is what I might due.
741	2	1. He has an accent, most will understand what he is saying, but there will be a lot of times where he says something that sounds like gibberish. 2. Helpful? Not so much 3. Guaranteed A? No, it\'s a math class, you\'re either good at it or not. If you\'re in between.. it all depends on how well you can understand him/the book. 4. Highschool like class
810	2	He\'s incredibly sweet. One of the best teachers at CSUN. He is very helpful and knowledgeable. Keeps the class fun and interesting. I enjoyed Calculus because of him! Take him for sure!!!!
923	2	He is a little confusing, I think. He does things ont he board that doesn\'t even matter. I would recommend going to class, but he is really nice and helpful if you are having problems.
275	1	We\'ll miss you Owen. You were a very caring teacher and a great guy.
960	2	Really bad at explaining things. Rude when you ask for help even during office hours
899	3	she is awesome, lets you retake your lowest grade for the final if you want to, she gives great videos! Im not good at math at all and I understood it with her!
171	2	Not a blow off class. You should probably put 4 to 6 hours a week if you want to understand the material. Definetly a really good professor, one of my fav.
174	2	Dr. Dogru was extremely helpful all semester long. At first, I thought her accent was going to be difficult to understand, but I quickly adapted. She is one of my favorite teachers. It is fairly easy to do well in her class as long as you pay attention. There isnt much homework, and the tests are straight forward.
137	3	Great Prof. Who\'s knowledge is second hand to none so far of those who I\'ve met so far in my life. Grading scale is clear. Will stay as long as you need after class to help you on ANYTHING you need. Even offers to help students with other classes if he can. I\'ve had him for a couple classes, I\'ve learned a lot from him.
87	3	Dr. Hall is a genuinely nice professor. She will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency. Homework and quizzes are assigned bi-monthly without the use of a syllabus calendar. Rachel will say "at any rate" about 5 times per class. Very hard to wake up for this class if its at 8am.
42	2	Don\'t do it unless you are familiar with Mac 1105. I\'m a straight A student & had a difficult time. Test seem to have nothing to do with what you\'ve studied. Don\'t normally rate professors unless necessary Nice person, but has a cocky, show off style of teaching. If you\'re not somewhat familiar with Mac 1105, DON\'T DO IT, YOU\'LL REGRET IT.
67	2	THIS PROFESSOR IS NO JOKE, HE ACTUALLY FAILS PEOPLE WHO CAN\'T PASS THE TESTS,I WENT TO TUTORING EVERYDAY STILL ENDED, up with a C+
241	2	I enjoyed her group assignments. We learned a lot in group. Her tests are very reasonable.
546	2	this teacher sucks so bad- i would RUN away if you are thinking about taking her- she is ****ing retarded- wont help you and grading system is completely unfair- do yourself a favor and dont take her EVER!
969	3	try to stay away from this professor. rarely prepared for class. will often not lecture for a section, gives a handout covering section instead. Gives pop quizzes if a phone rings, does not give enough time for tests.she gave a test that contained a problem that she was unable to solve. gives preferential treatment to students she appears to like
548	3	The guy is smart but can\'t teach for his life. The math is EASY and the book is very good. So if your even decent at math then definitly take this course. Subjects include compounding interest, probability, election theory, etc.
784	2	She is a wonderful teacher, she is so cute and makes the class so much fun. If you can\'t understand her, then your crazy. She is sooo organized! & she has a wonderful smile!!!
561	2	I lover Professor Moore!! Prior to enrolling in Math 80, I had no idea how to do a lot of things, and my pre-cal class I took in HS made my confidence lower about my math skills. She\'s very enthusiastic and not boring at all. I learned sooo much and she gives out a lot of extra credit! I definitely recommend her if you are not lazy!!!!
987	1	she\'s Nice.
99	3	Great teacher! He knew how to push me to reach my potential. He always offered help before and after class for those who wanted it. His tests were easy if you studied for them. I wish he was not limited to just Math! He would be great in other subjects as well. He relates with his students since he has been there before. (3 Example)
971	2	i\'m taking the same math i took in 8th grade and i can\'t understand it cause she\'s new and has no idea how to teach it. get a diff teacher if you can
219	2	This professor is awesome. I\'d love to take him for every math class I have to take at Kettering. His lectures are very clear and he\'s always willing to help.
440	2	Awesome teacher. Really knows his geometry. Very clear. Explains very well , and has always helped me even when I wasn\'t his student.
348	2	Great teacher! If you pay attention and come to class you will do fine! She\'s very understanding and always there to help! She will reward those who try and comes to class. Would defiantly take again!
139	1	Nice Professor.
577	2	Very easy class. She\'s not all that great of a teacher, but for Math111 you really don\'t need one. If you\'re somewhat good at math and just need this class as a requirement, then this is the one for you.
336	2	This class was pretty difficult and Dr. Hall was not much help. The text book is impossible to understand. Dr. Hall is very smart but doesn\'t have any people skills at all. Even with that, if you study hard you can still get a good grade.
941	2	Obviously he knows the material, however does not have a clue on how to teach it. He is very confusing. He does not go over enough examples in class - he just likes to hear himself talk and recite his own notes which he has memorized.Math is all about stimulation and practice and he provides ZERO of any of that. Overall he is terrible at teaching
161	3	He\'s very patient and willing to help his students so much. His quizzes and and tests are not too hard. Tests are based on the quizzes. Highly recommended.
749	4	Took this class for winter mini. I don\'t recommend her in terms of her notes since her notes are disorganize and lectures are pointless to attend. If you plan on taking mini, be prepare to work hard since this class. Test is like the practice exam, so do it! Try your best to do well on the first 2 exams since exams get harder. There was no final.
289	3	She is the worst as a professor! I got a B and that\'s for fail just 1 test cause I was late that day, I got A in all the other test.... She confused the students all the time, and never ask cause she laughs. Btw.. She always give study test that are exactly like the test, sometimes test were even easier. Honestly I pass this class cause my boyf.
412	3	She teaches really good, her exams were based off everything she teaches. I did not understand math and she made it so simple. My only issue is class attendance. I missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though I had an injury. Five points from an "A". SKIP CLASS YOU WON\'T PASS. Also beware of group work.
627	2	I had to take this class because I didn\'t get a good ACT score, so I already knew what I was doing. She is one of the best math teachers I have ever had. She really knows how to break everything down, so you can understand. Although you can not use calculators, she makes everything easy enough to be able to do without one.
334	3	i took lawson for college algebra and i must say that at times his teaching methods can be confusing. hes a little irritated by somethings but only if class gets out of hand a bit. he recommends to only use the website and not the book. i learned more in the math lab.
891	2	You girls need better taste in Men. He was always taking calls from work which intrupted class & made it hard to follow. That CD you got he knew nothing about it. There were DVD\'s in the Library that were easier than he was. I never showed you any short cuts for the work. He was usually Late for Class, up to a half an hour or so. I was notimpressed
909	2	I took professor Usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that I grew and learned a lot during my time in her class. Her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly. She is straightforward with her expectations. Yes, she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort.
824	1	I need this class, how much is the midterm and final worth? Does his study guides prepare for exams. This will be my second attempt. Is he really helpful? Is there book homework or only web-assign work. Does he allow use of electronic help, mathway, and other calculators??
926	2	Mrs. Johnson is one of the most compassionate teachers I have ever had. She takes the time to make sure that you understand the material and she is extremely understanding of the situation of her students. Ive never had a teacher take so much interest in my academic welfare. When you need help she is ALWAYS there. I really lucked out!
979	3	This professor is AWESOME! If you show him that you care, he will help you raise your grade! Make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam, this will guarantee you to get a higher grade! you willl NOT regret taking this course with him, he\'s the best!
682	3	This is a difficult class with a very difficult professor. He tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question. He doesn\'t grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing. You really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a C- or better.
107	3	I\'m not sure but I do think that Shelly Fenton\'s tests are easier. I took this class at the same time that a friend of mine was taking Fenton\'s and her tests seemed easier. Ms. Johnson is awesome though! I took this hybrid; if you ever have a problem and your work is going to be late, just tell her. Homework due every couple of days :(
505	1	horrible horrible
199	2	I am the worst student in the world when it comes to math but he really keeps it simple. He gives plenty of examples in class and helps you understand the material. The class is hard to begin with but I can finally say this is one math class I passed. He has an accent but it\'s not hard to understand him. Tip: Do the homework! It helps.
967	2	He\'s a really good guy who\'s very intelligent. Yeah, he talks like Arnold a bit but it\'s funny. The people who commented bad stuff about him are probably idiots who don\'t know how to pay attention for more than 5 minutes. Really good guy, not a hard class.
978	2	I really loved this class! It was a lot of fun, and Dr. Cawthorne is so sweet. She makes things clear and very easy to understand, even if you aren\'t the best math student. If for some reason you don\'t understand, she will do anything she can to help you .
588	1	Ce prof ne structure aucunement sa matiere, autant au niveau du plan de cours qu\'en classe. En plus avec un receuil de notes incomplet (fait par lui) et vous obtenez un cours extrement facile auquel vous ne comprenez rien... Le livre optionnel est obligatoire avec lui.
832	1	He\'s an awesome teacher. Best math teacher I\'ve ever had.
102	2	This guy does not speak english and is very hard to understand. you have to spend more time trying to understand what he says then what he is actually teaching!!!
356	2	She\'s the worst professor I\'ve ever had at PCC. She basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture. She wasn\'t even able to answer any questions. It really made me wonder why I was in that class. I DO NOT recommend you to take her even if you are good at math. Her class will bore you to death.
206	2	Outstanding teacher! One of the best math teachers I have ever had. 4 tests and online hw/quizzes. If you attend class you will easily pass
388	3	His lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. He likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture, so it\'s best to show up. He grades a bit harder than most, but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class.
704	3	Great teacher! I\'m not very good at math and the material was challenging. Lectures go kinda fast but she always offers her time to help. Go to class because she gives daily points for being there and it really helps to go. Once a week she holds an optional hour long study session which really helps with test and quizzes.
522	2	Good teacher. Helpful, if you are here to learn about stats he can help you understand it by simplifying it. I get his class and it\'s easy to understand though I worry about his health. Don\'t listen to people\'s complain about him because they have no interest in math and does not know any bad teacher. I would recommend him to my friends
638	1	Very difficult class. O bryan teaches in a horrible manner. And what is up with the pica nic basket booboo. 2 points away and I was failed.
176	2	hes the best study his quizzes and midterms for the final and thats it, he bring the same problems
472	2	God Awful teacher! DO NOT TAKE THIS INSTRUCTOR: She does not explain anything well, You are better off reading the book yourself, then even going to lecture. I\'m pissed I even payed for this quality of education, it would not be worth my time if it was free.
827	2	She explains every thing really well and is extremely sweet with her students, makes sure they understand everything before moving on to another subject. The class is interesting but she makes it even more fun (that is, if you like math). She is truly an amazing teacher, she made my first semester much easier.
223	2	awesome teacher, and she goes out of her way to help you out if you have a problem.
605	1	please avoid if you want to learn anything i went to class and hour before class started and taught my classmates through the course since i had already taken it
39	2	he is a funny guy, but thats not what the class should be about! he doesnt teach anything...at all. he just copies problems onto the board straight from the book and then tells a story about his son. he isnt very good at answering questions either.
833	3	Sure he grades really easy but unless if you already taken a calculus class you will be lost every single lecture because he skips steps and doesn\'t explain what he\'s doing. If you can study a lot and learn on your own then take him because of his easy grading. People who say he\'s the "best ever" must already know calculus....
9	1	I don\'t really have a problem with her its just that she teaches in a very weird way, and different from what I\'ve been taught prior. And she treats college algebra like its THE most important class you will ever take. I wouldn\'t take her again..
134	2	Very helpful. Was the key to success for MA240. Would have failed without her.
259	3	Will tell you exactly how to do well in her class, and will never set any traps. The lectures are clear and she gladly answers your questions. She may look stern to some people but she is actually pretty approachable and has great sense of humor. Go to class if you need to, do the homework and her practice exams, and you will do well.
579	1	Its insane to let this man teach.You go back to 155 Dr.Pan.
935	2	She was somewhat intimidating. She threw a girl out of class for having a tiny notebook on her desk,which wasnt her math notebook. She yelled at another student for trying to follow along and looking in his math book. She is hard to follow along. Would not recommend her.
163	2	Mrs. McVey is an excellent instructor. She does keep it moving to stay on schedule but she explains everything step by step. She doesn\'t leave anything out. She is very willing to help you and informs you of all of your resources. She wants you to do good and has a good sense of humor. Will answer any questions. Enjoyed her class!
770	3	Nice, funny & understanding about needing extensions on hw/quiz/test dates. Lectures are useless-Read the book and use online tools instead: He appears to have ADHD & either is redirecting because he doesn\'t understand the material or simply doesn\'t want to teach. He keeps changing what he "meant" to say/write. Talks about friends & cars, not Math.
318	1	very easy, explains things well, easy class
79	3	Great Teacher!!! I found that he was extremely helpful and welcoming to any who came to his office for help. He also helped us to better understand careers in mathematics. Easy grader and offers easy extra credit problems.
834	2	Great teacher! As long as you pay attention and do your homework you\'ll do good in this class. Pennington is a wonderful teacher and highly recommended! One of my favorites at gmc.
314	2	Shes a great and very professional person. Within 4 days i was able to complete all my questions and most important part of her teaching is that she is taking her time to explain and wants every one to understand before she\'ll move on to the next problem. I would highly recommend her . Shes very pleasant . Thanks prof.
49	2	Lets you use "fact sheets" for every quiz or exam including finals! helps a lot!
218	1	Quotes:"COME ON, IT\'S EASY" "PLUG THIS GUY, THIS GUY IN !!"
129	3	He\'s a nice guy, but he is VERY confusing at times. He writes very quickly, causing him to make many mistakes, obvious and not-so-obvious, that will confuse you later. The quizzes are ridiculous but the final for this course is a JOKE.
306	2	Probably one of the nicest teachers I\'ve ever met. VERY helpful and explains material very clearly. I never did well in math, but got an A in her class because she was so thorough in her explanations
61	2	I like this teacher. She really wants her students to understand the math.She is extremely helpful. I dislike math very much but she got me through it. I was very bored most of the time however, but that is not her fault just the math.
921	2	I had professor Fenton for College Algebra. She made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner. She always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material.
647	1	TOTALLY OUT THERE SHES FUNNY SHE SHE WILL CALL YOU STINKY AND RAMBLE IN BUT SHES GREAT
846	4	professor Lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you, gives test but very simple, tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online. i recommend any one to take her. you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code.
329	2	This is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life. Does not explain many things on the tests. Loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself. I highly recommend not taking this class with him. Any other teacher is probably a better option.
590	3	I\'ve had Mr. G for several online math classes. He\'s the best when it comes to online math courses at GPC. His video lectures are clear and he\'s very fashionable. If you have a question, he responds to email promptly. A+ teacher.
692	2	he over explains stuff to the point were even the smart students get confused he also does his math wrong sometimes and does not realize it unless you bring it up. Do not recommend! unless you like to argue with your professor or you are good at math. I got the highest grade in my class only because i taught myself
405	2	He was a great math teacher, and his enthusiasm for math really showed. I woils warn future students his accent makes him hard to understand. It took me about two weeks to be able to understand him.
963	1	Abbas is hilarious!!!
665	2	Dr. Neal was very funny. He is sorta awkward and nerdy, but in a good way. I enjoyed his class, becasue he was funny to be around, but he wasn\'t a very good teacher. I had a very strong calc. backround, and still had no freaking clue what he was ever talking about.
537	2	Best teacher every! Makes sure everyone understands before moving on. He the only math teacher I have had that made math seem fun.
229	2	He is also listed AS LUKE BROWN. Listen to these raters. This guy is a time bomb waiting to explode - on you, the class. Give imm. quiz when he hears a cell phone. Won\'t explain projects, marks absent if tardy, belittle\'s you when you speak incorrect mathematical grammar. ALL BUT 10 PEOPLE DROPPED CLASS BY WITHDRAWAL DATE. 8/10 LEFT FAILED CLASS
462	2	Horrible, he just reads off the slides and talks to the board. He has a thick accent so you can barely understand him.
529	1	Horrible
712	1	awful. lowered by GPA so much. do not take.
646	2	Worst class I ever took at FIT. I HATED BONNIE absolutely hated her. DROP THIS CLASS the minute you see her name. It will bring your GPA down and you will learn nothing as a result.
226	2	Shes super sweet and wants to help but shes a bit scatterbrained. Did not let me make up a test when i missed for illness so be careful about that and make sure you talk to her when you have to miss.
558	2	very fun teacher. while teaching the math, he relates the stuff to interesting subjects. he is very intellegent, and almost seems overqualified. very easy to work with
831	3	He can teach the material. Alright teacher over all. Attendance is optional, h/w is not graded nor collected, and grade comes from best grade of 3 out of 4 tests for 50%, and final for 50%.
695	2	Absolutely dread this class. Wasn\'t the most appealing topic, but it gets really bad when the professor is terrible. She\'s really nice and all, but very very boring. She has no control over her class. Hopefully she\'s only like this with this class, but judging from the other comments made by other students, unfortunately not.
519	4	Professor Hu lectures in an understanding matter; writes all the steps to the problem. Daily homework that is optional. It is to your benefit to do the homework. Three quizzes per week and the problems are from the homework. Fair and easy grading system. Recommended to do the homework. Tells you what is on the test and is similar to the homework
722	3	This is the most horrible teacher I have ever had. She wont allow you to make up tests. She makes your final counts double or triple.Even though I had a doctors note and a field trip for another class. Recently she has been behind and has taught around 9 lessons in 2 class periods.At this point only around 3 people are passing her class.
972	4	Very great and helpful professor. Take him for the summer. Knows his work and has excellent teaching skills. Goes over work until you understand it. Gives 1 to 2 HW assignments per wk (200 problems total drops 100 and is 15% of your grade an easy boost)& gives 4 exams dropping the lowest. COME TO CLASS & DO YOUR HW & WILL DO GREAT! TAKE HIM!
165	2	Tries her best to make calculus as comprehensible as possible. She\'s nice.
737	4	She is a wonderful teacher. She makes everything crystal clear and always returns email. I am taking her online.I see her once a week with any questions I have a she has helped me. All you have to do is cc and 4 tests. At the end of the semester you can retake the lowest test so you make a better grade and do the extra credit that she gives.
37	3	Homework isn\'t mandatory, which is nice. Does a lot of examples on the board, but makes a lot of mistakes. Is NOT a fair grader, taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes (especially considering how often he messes up on the board). Overall, he is a nice guy, though, and i would definitely take a class with him again.
150	2	Don\'t take her unless you want to fail the class. She is not a good math professor at all. I wouldn\'t even give her 1 point but the website doesn\'t allow me to give her 0 point. DON\'T TAKE HER.
407	2	what can i say about him! he is annoying when he snaps his fingers or goes "euuuhhh"..he comes to class disorganized..posts our hwk like 4 days before a test and expect us to do good when we have a million other things to do...although he makes me laugh a lot which is good compared to most teachers
19	2	Great teacher, sometimes hard to understsand. Loves teaching, extremely helpful if you go in his office hours and ask.
231	2	Made Statistics easy and understandable. If you are not math literate I would suggest you take him.
22	2	Took this class as winter mini. Lectures were all over the place which made it difficult to follow. Overall do not take her an online class.
443	2	I hated this class even before taking it but she\'s made it so clear and easy that I can honestly say I like the class now. I thank God I got her as my professor in this class. I hope I get to have her as my professor in the next level of Math
621	1	she is wonderful
985	3	Hes a nice guy, willing to do whatever it takes for you to learn the material. I took it in the summer and It wasn\'t easy by no means. I spent alot of extra time in the Math lab so I could understand it. I would have LOVED to take him in a longer semester! And yeah...he\'s not too bad looking for an older man!
523	3	This is one of the best teachers I\'ve had since coming to GPC. She is patient and gives so many chances to make a better grade. She has bonuses coming out her ears. He demenor is pleseant she will only get mad when most the clas fails the test. If you DON\'T LIKE Math you SHOULD TAKE HER, yes SHOULD she will get you through it. Oh and NO homework
748	4	This class is not easy. So much work in ConnectMath, it\'s insane! But! Professor Gutliph is great! He knows you have lots of work to do, and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can. For example, his discussions are easy, and he gives a great review for your Midterm and Final exam! Definitely recommend!
260	1	Very interactive
112	2	Very straightforward. Easy class, no homework required. Stay up on homework to get a good grad though. 4 tests throughout the class. Tests include the midterm and final.
265	3	He was a horrible teacher. He never helps you. Also, all his tests are do it yourself... no fill in the blank or multiple choice... its all on you own. He always relies on attendance and he has other students grade his work for him because he does not have the time to do it himself. I would not recommend anyone to take him as an instructor!!!!!
193	2	I\'ve had worse math teachers in the past. I really don\'t understand all of the bad ratings here. If you do your homework EVERY DAY, ask questions, and do well on the tests, you should be fine. His tests aren\'t particularly hard, if you know what you are doing.
432	3	You have to GIVE UP to not pass.She is very willing to help you unless you are always absent & act like you could care less.She WILL answer your Q\'s & sometimes right before the tests students could write a problem on the board from the study guide. I got a B b/c I never did word problems.Also,HW isn\'t too important,it\'s more about your test grade.
352	2	I took calculus in high school and his class was great for more in depth understanding. However, I would not recommend his class for students who have never had calculus before, it\'s just too many picky things to remember when just learning the basics for the first time.
396	2	doesn\'t assign too much homework but tests are fairly hard ( of course )
320	2	If you at least attempt all of the homework, you\'ll do fine in Dr. Sowell\'s class. The start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place IMO. As a teacher she was fair, respectful, and very accessible to all of us. My only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush.
25	3	She\'s an absolute sweetheart, and very clear. She will help you if you get stuck on homework. She\'s actually a dog trainer which is pretty rad. Her homework is mostly online with some paperwork sometimes. Print out the book (It will help, believe me). don\'t be afraid to ask a lot of questions.
117	4	I took Professor Burns for Calc II. This professor really knows his stuff. He is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material. He give practice test before exam and it goes over. if you study the practice test you will pass the exam. Recorded his lecture, posted on YouTube any time you could access and review.
486	3	Very good teacher. He\'s soft spoken but takes amazing notes. He is the best drawer ever for a math instructor. His test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test!
509	3	attendance isn\'t mandatory just necessary to to understand and pass. he explains things better than the book and he doesn\'t put notes on blackboard
330	2	the best damn teacher ever!!!She makes algebra so understandable!!
892	1	His lectures are awful, take for an easy A not if you want to learn anything.
466	3	She is a great teacher, have to do the work in order to maintain a C or higher, the test are not that difficult because you can use a cheat sheet. Make sure you keep all your notes and papers she hands back because she does a binder check that is worth 50 points which can help your grade a lot.
302	2	ken was the best math teacher i have ever had. he makes math so much easier and makes learning fun! thanks ken!
920	2	i recommend prof. yarmish. she was always there to help me if i needed extra help. shes available to answer your questions and she teaches in a clear articulate way. take her if you need math.
664	3	Excellent Professor! I think his thick accent might be discouraging on the first day, but you\'ll pick up on it. Tests are easy, and he\'s a nice grader. The class was very interesting, and he clearly cares about his students! In the end, a pleasant experience overall! Would definitely take him again!
280	3	She is a nice lady.. but she\'s sort of hard to understand.. and really scatterbrained... I truly think she wants her students to pass... but she isn\'t exactly easy to understand.. and her tests are difficult. Especially since she teaches the new lesson right before the test on the last chapter.. it makes it confusing..
673	3	She is so funny. Easy class if you show up and pay attention. The homework isn\'t really necessary. The quizzes and exams are more similar to the format of her in class examples and same quizzes.
862	2	Ms. Nelson is an excellent teacher. I am taking her for an online and her teaching and instructions are very comprehensive. I would have her as a math teacher over anyone else. She has great character and that says alot about a person.
950	2	was the absolute greatest math teacher ive ever had. She was a sexy woman and could make a 3hr math class very entertaining. I am absolutely crushed she is retired.
800	2	He was a jerk. Had favorites, which he chose the first day of class and if you are not in that group he occasionally pokes fun at you for not knowing an answer and humiliates you in front of everyone. Says you are making up stuff too, and humiliates you in that manner also. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS, he can HURT you if you are sensitive!
164	2	He\'s hard to understand when you first start the class, but then it gets easier. His tests are exactly the same questions he did in class and on the review day. You don\'t need the textbook.
172	4	She was a hard grader but she always explained what was deficient clearly. The homework was not extremely long, except on a few instances. She had trouble with a new book this quarter, but she graded us less harshly where she knew we would have troubles. Her lecture often differed from the book, but her lectures were in-depth and explanatory.
72	2	hard class. quizes once a week. she is super smart when it comes to math but doesn\'t always know how to teach it well. wouldn\'t recommend if you did not have calc before
298	2	Spoke directly from the book, didn\'t prepare her own notes, was surprised by the answers to the problems she was reading out loud from the book.
851	2	He teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on Christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging. I had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up.
190	2	It was much easier paying attention in class Jay. He keeps things entertaining. His tests are VERY STANDARD. He is more worried about understanding concepts than memorizing equations.
640	3	3rd time taking this, others I made D\'s if you don\'t understand she takes time & patiently walks you through it. HW/quizzes can be retaken until you get a grade you\'re happy with. At the end of the semester if you aren\'t happy with one of your test grades, retake it, if you are happy with all grades you don\'t have to go to class the last few days.
113	2	She doesn\'t have a lot of experience and it is hard to hear her even if you\'re sitting infront.I had a hard time in her class, but she gives some extra credit. Students should ask many questions about each problem.
847	3	this guy will bend over backwords to make sure you understand the material and that you pass the class. and the fact that he gives you photocopies of the notes is key.
256	2	this guy was horrible...point blank...i would ask him a question..he would answer a different question..WACK!!!!!!!
288	3	He\'s a wonderful, sweet man but he can be hard to understand at times. His test are hard because the proofs are VERY specific, but if you take detailed notes, complete the homework, and read the examples in the text book, it\'s manageable.
774	3	How to describe this prof? He is always late for class there is no tutorial because he uses it to teach, needs help from student when he makes mistakes, tests were rediculously long and the class was never prepared, should not be teaching
773	2	Terrible Teacher! As a person he is pretty nice, but hes teaching style is so confuseing and tests are really hard. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND HIM!
15	2	Ok, this teacher was extremely not helpful at all. His powerpoint lectures provided would always have mistakes in them confusing the students on how to work the problem correctly. Teacher was easy to get a hold of but if you got a problem wrong because of his error. Tough Luck...
464	2	Good professor, there to help, clear and fair.
18	2	Mr. Lawson is a good teacher. Sometimes he allows himself to get distracted (and he does lecture on his personal beliefs occasionally), but he\'s usually very helpful. I had a very easy time with his class, but, admittedly, I already knew the material and was simply getting an easy Math credit. Still, I would reluctantly recommend him.
86	2	He is an awesome instructor. He explained things well and through in a few jokes here and there to make it interesting. I would definitely consider taking in Algebra class.
73	2	You will not regret taking this teacher. Math is my worst subject and I was able to maintain a B the entire semester. She is very helpful and will explain thesame thing a million times until she is sure that everyone understands
690	1	Very helpful.
34	4	Very thick Russian accent, sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great professor. Explains in detail and will gladly re-explain anything you\'re not sure on. Attendance is not mandatory, nor is doing homework. 3 tests make up your grade and they are all open book, open notes plus he usually gives a take-home test after to help boost your grade.
994	2	text sucked for this course.but the professor is extremely helpful.he is not the best lecturer but if you go upto him he explains really well.He is a very nice guy
