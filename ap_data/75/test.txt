225764	2	[Stoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning) is a lawful punishment in several countries. By your reasoning, that's OK too - because the government says it is.    You're playing semantics to attempt to justify a barbaric practice. Instead of weaselling around to try and win the argument, spend some time thinking about it. Think about if you were falsely convicted of some crime that brought with it the death penalty.    EDIT - "the motivation is carrying out a punishment, not personal malice." No, it's lynch mob malice.

43784	2	October 10, 2001: Two Israelis Are Detained in Mexican Legislature Building after Behaving Suspiciously and Found To Be Carrying Arms Two Israelis, Salvador Gersson Smike, 34, and Sar Ben Zui, 27, are arrested in the Mexican Congress Building in Mexico City. Smike is carrying a plastic 9 mm sophisticated Glock 9 mm pistol tucked into his underwear in his lower back. Glock pistols are made with a special plastic material and are very easy to smuggle. [Correo, 10/11/2001; El Heraldo de Mexico (Mexico City), 10/11/2001; Cronica de Hoy (Mexico City), 10/12/2001] He also has with him a briefcase reported to contain 58 bullets, bomb-making materials, three detonators, and nine grenades. [El Heraldo de Mexico (Mexico City), 10/11/2001] The two were apprehended after ex-sugarcane workers, who were waiting for a congressional hearing, saw the two Israelis behaving strangely at around 4:00 p.m. They were reportedly photographing the workers below the belt. When the workers demanded that the two men identify themselves, the Israelis said they were press photographers. The workers dismissed their claims, overcame them, and then discovered they were armed with pistols and other high caliber arms. The two men had apparently also been seen the day before taking pictures. [Cronica de Hoy (Mexico City), 10/12/2001] Security guards soon arrived, disarmed the men, and took them to the security office. At around 6:00 p.m., it is learned that the two men are Israelis and that one of them, Salvador Gersson, is a former colonel of the Israeli Special Forces. [Correo, 10/11/2001; Diario de Mexico (Mexico City), 10/11/2001 ] Soon after, a man claiming to be a supervisor from the company, Desarrollo de Sistemas de Seguridad Privada (Private Security Systems Development), says the two men are employees at the firm and that they were taking pictures because they are â€œvacationing.â€ The journalists who are present scoff at the claim. [Correo, 10/11/2001; El Heraldo de Mexico (Mexico City), 10/11/2001] After October 13, no additional information is reported about the incident.

670369	1	&gt; Drawings of children in sexual situations are illegal, even though their production did not actually involve children at all.    This is a common viewpoint here but I have yet to see any real evidence of this within the US.    In the 2002 case Ashcroft v. The Free Speech Coalition, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government may **not** criminalize "virtual child" pornography because it does not sexually abuse an actual child.

"Guys, their wearing purity rings is cool." :)    Obviously, mynoduesp meant "they're" but Poromenos just wanted to be annoying.

447757	1	Description of Burden of Proof    Burden of Proof is a fallacy in which the burden of proof is placed on the wrong side. Another version occurs when a lack of evidence for side A is taken to be evidence for side B in cases in which the burden of proof actually rests on side B. A common name for this is an Appeal to Ignorance. This sort of reasoning typically has the following form:     1. Claim X is presented by side A and the burden of proof actually rests on side B.   2. Side B claims that X is false because there is no proof for X.     In many situations, one side has the burden of proof resting on it. This side is obligated to provide evidence for its position. The claim of the other side, the one that does not bear the burden of proof, is assumed to be true unless proven otherwise. The difficulty in such cases is determining which side, if any, the burden of proof rests on. In many cases, settling this issue can be a matter of significant debate. In some cases the burden of proof is set by the situation. For example, in American law a person is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty (hence the burden of proof is on the prosecution). As another example, in debate the burden of proof is placed on the affirmative team. As a final example, in most cases the burden of proof rests on those who claim something exists (such as Bigfoot, psychic powers, universals, and sense data).  Examples of Burden of Proof     1. Bill: "I think that we should invest more money in expanding the interstate system."   Jill: "I think that would be a bad idea, considering the state of the treasury."   Bill: "How can anyone be against highway improvements?"     2. Bill: "I think that some people have psychic powers."   Jill: "What is your proof?"   Bill: "No one has been able to prove that people do not have psychic powers."     3. "You cannot prove that God does not exist, so He does."

79061	2	"Credit has diverse applications in capitalism. Its two most important functions are to extend production and to facilitate exchange. When the inner tendency of capitalist production to extend boundlessly strikes against the restricted dimensions of private property, credit appears as a means of surmounting these limits in a particular capitalist manner. Credit, through shareholding, combines in one magnitude of capital a large number of individual capitals. It makes available to each capitalist the use of other capitalistsâ€™ money â€“ in the form of industrial credit. As commercial credit it accelerates the exchange of commodities and therefore the return of capital into production, and thus aids the entire cycle of the process of production. The manner in which these two principle functions of credit influence the formation of crises is quite obvious. If it is true that crises appear as a result of the contradiction existing between the capacity of extension, the tendency of production to increase, and the restricted consumption capacity of the market, credit is precisely, in view of what was stated above, the specific means that makes this contradiction break out as often as possible. To begin with, it increases disproportionately the capacity of the extension of production and thus constitutes an inner motive force that is constantly pushing production to exceed the limits of the market. But credit strikes from two sides. After having (as a factor of the process of production) provoked overproduction, credit (as a factor of exchange) destroys, during the crisis, the very productive forces it itself created. At the first symptom of the crisis, credit melts away. It abandons exchange where it would still be found indispensable, and appearing instead, ineffective and useless, there where some exchange still continues, it reduces to a minimum the consumption capacity of the market.    Besides having these two principal results, credit also influences the formation of crises in the following ways. It constitutes the technical means of making available to an entrepreneur the capital of other owners. It stimulates at the same time the bold and unscrupulous utilisation of the property of others. That is, it leads to speculation. Credit not only aggravates the crisis in its capacity as a dissembled means of exchange, it also helps to bring and extend the crisis by transforming all exchange into an extremely complex and artificial mechanism that, having a minimum of metallic money as a real base, is easily disarranged at the slightest occasion."
387733	3	A regular day indeed. When I read the headline specifying that its a dark day for America my first thought was when did they turn on the lights? We've been getting it from israel for decades and still most American are ignorant about it.

707929	4	Okay if this so named "God" actually is all powerful, then we go back all the old dawkinsesque crap and apply it here. If Head Six and Head Baltar's purpose was to guide Hera to safety, why not just divinely make Hera safe? why all this complicated bullshit with having Baltar con a nuke out of Adama, or any number of other ridiculous crap that now makes no sense? At the very least Athena should have a Head character to guide her, since she's in a better position to protect Hera. Its not the God as explanation that I'm upset about, its that it doesn't fit. The more you think about it, the more it doesn't make sense. Just like real religion.

566131	3	I should get a grip? Why do you think money exists? People gravitate to a standardized and agreed upon unit of wealth. This has ALWAYS been the case. Before gold and silver, it was salt, or shells, or units of rare dye, the Aztecs used the Cocoa bean as a their base currency. No matter what system you try to create in your little utopia people will create something to trade with. It's so much easier to carry currency than a herd of cows to trade. You can call money evil all you want and delude yourself, but it's the people who manipulate the system for their own gains who are evil. A system that has safeguards against abuse is all you can hope for.

The stimulus bill has 1/8th of its spending going to actual stimulus. The other 7/8ths is the exact same stuff that got us where we are. Crowing about the little tiny minority that is being canceled out by the rest of it 7 times over doesn't make it a good thing. Nor does stepping in and making it worse prevent the "social and economic structure" from collapsing in on itself. Sorry, but the only choices still aren't do something bad or do nothing.
87169	2	I don't know, the existence of an electric car?    Not a $100k Tesla, or a shade-tree Geo conversion, but a real car available between $15k and $25k. Its range and performance don't even have to rival gasoline cars as long as it's functional and workable (i.e. 150-mile range is fine for a commuter vehicle if it charges relatively quickly).    MAKE IT ALREADY.

249571	1	Science is fundamentally social, to the core. This the reason for comparative studies, peer reviewed journals and the need for free speech in order to have collective agreement on items under consideration before they are considered "accepted." This part is just as important as forming hypotheses, controlled studies, and codified units of measurement. So many people forget that a fundamental tenet of science is the social-comparative stage of analysis; especially the so-called extreme conservatives (a.k.a. anti-socials/socio-phobes).         And humans, btw, are the most social creatures on earth, so the human construct vs. societal construct argument is no-worky from the get-go.

1021891	5	You write pretty well, but the accusatory tone seems off of your message.    Yes, people who choose not to think exist in all groups. This is unfortunate but true. It is hyppocritical of an athiest to question another's belief when they do not question their own.     &gt;An intelligent species which abandons or rejects the search for ...    So would you say that most in this world have abandoned or rejected the search for spirituality? Because from what I gather of current world events and of history this is exactly the conclusion of your premise.    &gt;That experience which past teachers of wisdom and enlightenment have called...    Of course belief is not the enemy, these names and meanings are all facets of a many sided jewel. But the little things added on to belief and god all differ and I always wonder why do you need this? What is the purpose of this? The little rituals, usually fruitless, have been passed from culture to culture, religion to religion, mutating along the way so that they are recognizable but changed. And it seems these changes are enough to start wars over. Unfortunately most do not believe as you do, in that the Christian god is different than the Islamic one. The Jewish god is different than the Hindu gods. And they do so with good reason. Many of these gods and beliefs are mutually exclusive. Though if everyone did see as you do, would they have a specific religion? Wouldnt they just believe and see that all those little rituals and rules are little and meaningless? Wouldnt they just believe? You say we are progressing to a harmony with our surroundings but why cant this be done without religion? Many religions do not profess a harmony with our world at all. Indeed, most religions seem to reward veiled egotism over anything else, e.g. rewards or damnation in an after life.    &gt;I can only point in its general direction,...   &gt;It is something which finds you only when you begin to observe the world and...    Perhaps you are the one that has obstructions in your view of it. How do you know I have not already found it? Am finding it? And you are the one lost.    &gt;...your sense of self is the compass by which you navigate your voyage through it...    Why am I necessarily lost? Why is navigating by your sense of self a bad thing? I know direction. I know purpose. Just because I want things for myself doesnt mean I ignore others. It doesnt mean I am lost.    &gt;You'll be unsure of what way points true north...    Your use of 'you' bothers me. Your many assumptions are blind at best and offensive at worst.    &gt; So you give up heading in any one direction;     I never intended to head in any one direction but many.     &gt;you set sail this way or that because the winds are favorable or the currents do not oppose.    I dont always take the easy path, but I admit I do, sometimes.    &gt;But you are unsure of your orientation...    I am not unsure of my course. I know where I am going and I am not only going there but experiencing every thing between here and there.     With your metaphor are you saying that my selfishness leads others astray and to drift "aimlessly in the fog"? If so it is an example of the thing I find most offensive when people discuss beliefs. Who are **you** to determine which way is *the* way? Who are you to determine I am lost? What gives you the right? Your god? I laugh at your god. And more importantly I laugh at your hypocrisy. And you should too. I understand if you are merely saying this is *a* way but the tone of your writing says to me your way is *the* way. To use your analogy I see you in the fog, just as lost as I, only you dont know you are lost. And correct me if I am mistaken but you seem comforted by the fact you 'know' the way. Personally I am more comforted knowing I do not know the way.    &gt;Stripped down to its bare essence, being human is...    Stripped down, being human is two things. First survival, this needs no explanation. In this we are no different than the lowliest microbe. Second I point you to the things our survival brings, generates. Put simply: human nature. Driven by that primordial instinct to survive we humans have produced wonders, are producing wonders. I point to the works of Shakespeare, Picasso, van Gogh, Turing, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Plato, Archimedes, Pythagoras, Buddha, Locke, and on and on. We also have committed atrocities beyond reckoning but this too is a part of human nature, albeit dark. The bare essence of what it means to be human is not learning relationships. It is to survive, to flourish, to excel. What we do with that survival is up to us, the individual. Learning relationships of cause and effect, action and reaction is a subset of the whole of what if means to be human.    &gt;Spirituality is a process wherein...    What other? Other people? Or as in the rest of the universe? I would have to say I agree with you. Spirituality is being in tune with your universe. Satori, becoming part of the flow, being in the zone. I truly believe this. And I have this to say: Isnt science as much as a spiritual pursuit as any other? Perhaps even more pure. It is not one based on faith, to be sure, but rather on experimentation and observation. Science seeks the harmony of the universe only in a more tangible, more methodical way. Just because scientists wish to define things, measure things, and quantify things, does not mean they are blind to the beauty of what they are attempting to classify. I know the physics behind a sunset. I find one no less beautiful.     &gt;You realize that to benefit others is to benefit yourself,... hysteria    Do I really realize that? No. Is it true? Somewhat, but nowhere near entirely. It might benefit the species but benefiting others does not always benefit yourself.     &gt;for neither our egos nor those causes really exist except in our primitive, deluded minds.    Well if you think like that then nothing really exists except in our minds. The benefits you alluded to would be only in the mind. Everything would only really exist in our minds. Why is it that only ego and our causes exist in our minds? What about everything else? Is everything else more tangible for some reason?    &gt;We will always be "causally challenged"...    And to what else would you have those energies devoted to? I dont see anything much more productive. Strive to do the impossible and eventually we *will* grasp those "dizzying spirals of complexity. We *will* have a better understanding of the universe. Perhaps not in our lifetime or our children's, children's lifetime but eventually. Eventually we will understand more. Extinction or progress, these are our options, the only ones we have. Progress, move ever forward, on and on, look back only to see how far you have come and the path we made along the way.    &gt;The universe is infinitely smarter than we are,...    This is backwards logic. Smarter? The universe is no smarter than the sky is humble. You talk of the universe as if we are not a part of it. A cell in our body would not claim to be dumber than the whole. Not because it is dumb but because the two are incomparable. The universe did not create a home for us, we, as a part of it, were already home. Belonging on the other hand is an entirely different matter.     Correct me if I am wrong but you seem to be professing the values of selflessness. But I say to you there is no such thing as selflessness. We all have our needs and wants and all our actions are driven by them. It is what we covet that should be judged not that we covet.

696759	1	Epic post-rock band, the first name that springs to mind when I think of post-rock. Incredible emotion in a lot of their stuff as well. If this is your first time listening to them, I'd suggest trying the song "Sleep" next.
480203	1	The former part of that sentence is obvious. I mean, you can talk to a wall if you want. You can talk to you imaginary friend.    The latter part means that you're hearing voices in your head. So ... it's schizophrenia.
505493	1	As soon as I saw the windmills I thought this was going to be World of Goo related.
290162	1	Funny???
629258	2	I think our military situation now is a little different than in 1943. (Although I'm not an expert on the matter.) There is NATO for a start, and of course the UN and EU. Plus weapons with excellent targetting to lay to waste areas from the size of a house to an entire country.    I am not convinced that [new developments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System) and [excursions](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.audit/) have really helped America in any way.
201176	1	1555 Wabash sounds like a great place to live if you're thinking about Chicago living, in the trendy South Loop.
191610	3	&gt;We cannot afford to have the global economy fail periodically like it is currently doing.        markets are cyclical.. they boom and they bust, and the goal of governments should be to moderate both the boom *and* the bust.        &gt;Thank you for acknowledging the eloquent breadth of that last paragraph. I wasn't sure you'd appreciate it.        you might've been aroused reading it (as i know you read it over as a pat on the back for yourself), but it really has no relevance to anything at all.
1030639	1	"not" was a fun one. You could use that in almost every sentence

421585	2	Oh it is definitely a curious thing. I agree. I am just was hoping that this doesn't turn into a "Cramer is a dumbass/fucker/doop/liar" - a personal attack type of thread (not that that is what you were doing) instead of a thread about the actual problem of today's news organizations and journalists. I'm not saying he isn't part of the problem, he is.     .....If that makes sense (It's 2:30am here and i can't find the right words)    He just shouldn't be a scapegoat.

974359	2	Next time if you're going to be a smug asshole, you should probably put enough words in your sentences so they make grammatical sense. Thanks.
598473	2	hey-O!
880687	3	Wow I can't believe you got any upvotes from these tight assed pot heads. Never seen a subReddit who can't take a joke so badly.
838249	2	Ha! I like you already.
1026165	1	Sorry, I confused Explorer with Internet Explorer.  When I bought my Vista machine, it only had 512 megabytes of RAM and ran horrible, always requiring restarts.

912462	2	It takes mere seconds to think up an inflammatory remark, and even less to post it. So it's not exactly a time-taxing hobby. Leaves plenty of time for other, more pressing, things.    And I'm fully aware of how much of a "dick" I'm being. That's where the fun is, seeing how hilariously seriously people take things on the internet.
886909	1	*You aren't her*. You weren't there.

687376	3	I started to think about that, and I ended up in an endless loop.
82738	1	Especially comedies. They basically show you all of the funny parts completely out of context.

746663	3	There is something important that Americans don't understand about Europe. Yes, bigger government on one hand, that's true. On the other hand, a generally more conservative, more cautious, older-fashioned approach.    If you think a bit deeper, the reason is that Socialism arrived to America as an offshot of Liberalism: big-government policies in American are basically supposed to "level the playing field" for a distinctly individualist pursuit of pleasure and gratification.    In Europe Socialist policies are more directly rooted in Marxism - especially in France, the most popular intellectuals f.e. Badiou are still very Marxist. Now I hate Marxism as much as the next guy - even more, given that I was born in a Communist country - but there is one thing you can say in favour of it: it's not liberal, it's not focusing on an individual pursuit of pleasure, it generally has more restrictive, communitarian and conservative tendencies.     Thus, the end result is that in Sweden or Germany f.e. you get a generous unemployment insurance but the state will really try to pressure you hard back to the job again. It's not Liberal Socialism, it's a kinda a conservative Socialism, nut just a nurturing mother, but a stict father too.    Now, in Britain or California the unemployment money may be less generous, but they are basically just shoveling money out the door. They are not really trying to force people to work again because they have this sort of "Liberal Socialist" view, of just helping people but not controlling them.    So this Europe may be more statist but on the other hand it's not as liberal. This is an important difference to remember.

766466	2	I like Alan, but.... how do I say this? He doesn't seem to fit in with all the other dolls... um... physically.
247616	4	Hysterical.    All government successes have to be denounced as failures to fit into the conservative world view.    Regardless of the *reason* we have a national highway system it *did* get us to Grandma's for Thanksgiving AND allowed for the movement of goods to market, which was a *good* thing - sorry it didn't have as much of a militaristic value as you had hoped for.    Damn those civilians and their civilian government.
169263	2	You know it's bad when life starts imitating SNL sketches.
393087	1	Because it turns you into an Atheist. But if believers already know this, then they are intentionally ignorant. Why is it that when believers ask for balance, they really want more weight on their side which is already dominant? This is the same reason why they can't they be straightforward or honest. If their policy is to annoy unbelievers and Christian evolutionists, then they don't want to win us over.
447198	1	This has got to be the first article this long I (having ADHD \o/) read from start to finish in one go without checking other tabs. Great find, thanks for sharing.
716944	3	Wow, that's the best they could come up with? I almost feel bad.
383430	1	Or in the much less-fun New York Times explanation: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html?hp    Video of children singing "Fuck your mother" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3tPA_Z_MT0    lyrics: http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/02/music-video-the-song-of-the-grass-dirt-horse/
622565	1	Thats gotta hurt.
956308	2	I've got a box out the back with a 10 year old solaris unix distro on it. Just use that. It's unix, FFS. Hardly any difference between that and linux on the command line.. or a mac.
700183	2	Yes. High-five for Toronto. I think it's a compliment. Actors are rich.
427449	3	Hard for me to choose:    * The entire Bible is a collection of subversive political writings, tribalist propaganda, ancient civil ordinances, spiritual writings, and cult dogma that only makes sense in the context of the time each part of it was written but that hasn't stop hordes of believers from contorting it into a dogma to push a flock of believers into their own agenda.  * The madness of crowds  * Wall Street is Las Vegas in a business suit, only less regulated more blatantly rigged against the players  * The bottomless ruthlessness of autocrats  * Stealing $300 is a crime. Stealing $3billion is an "accounting irregularity".   * Borrowing $500k on a $25k income is irresponsible. Borrowing $50billion with $50million collateral is called "gaining levergage" and losing that $50billion bet is called "being over leveraged"
15744	3	Ended up watching this while slightly intoxicated with some friends, how we laughed when the dinosaur exploded.
520244	1	This poses an interesting paradox: if the summary on the side is sufficient to convey all information, then what is the full TOS for? And if it is not sufficient, then it means you should read the full TOS.
280031	3	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vz1TVpwme0    Here is the video of the young man's address to the CPAC. I don't think they portrayed it well in the article. I didn't find it a terribly "electrifying delivery."
100705	2	I hope no Grammar Strict-Police and complains about "your" tax dollars.
60676	3	That is disgusting. Police routinely use tazers to get people to do what they say. It was never supposed to be used as a cattle-prod to herd humans.
105551	3	That made me smile on the inside :-).
797414	1	Why ?
382490	3	Although we love to demonize the opposition, I don't think most people are willfully hypocritical. I have to wonder if people are aware of this practice of fertility clinics. It makes sense, but I don't think most people really think about it. I can't say that I ever thought about it. More people may very well begin opposing fertility clinics if she wants to bring attention to them.
311474	3	Now that is one chunky monkey.
177870	2	A bunch of us did that once. I was the only one who at a Carl's Star Burger (well, 2 of them) and I was the only one who got food poisoning.
921878	3	Money is taboo.     There seems to be a common knowledge that resides just below the surface of the subconscious that by having more than you need to be comfortable, you are potentially depriving others of comfort.    Some however, e.g. bankers, consciously know that they are doing this, and apparently don't care.    I've gotten a little money from family and I am so glad that I haven't spent my time, like many I know, running through the rat race maze. I have had time to develop my mind in a relatively unstressed way. I guess it's a good thing I never plan on visiting the Socialism subreddit ;).
462168	2	I know a girl in california who illegally crossed the border with her father. They hired a cayote and were packed in a truck with 20 other people. As soon as they passed the border, the truck stopped and the vayotes told the illegals that all the women had to follow them and get raped, or else they would be left there in the desert to die.   She was only 11 at the time.   There was no mention of a bra being left in a tree, but at that age I doubt she even wore one.   There's a lot of bigger battles out there, fellow redditors. Choose wisely.
774998	3	I laughed. I cried. And finally found a satisfactory definition for the word 'love', and that was all just after I watched the first 2 1/2 minutes.    In short I fucking love this guy and now know what I'll be doing for the next hour or so.

989005	2	&gt;"Is the Bible fiction?" and "is the Bible categorised as fiction" is exactly the same question. The answer to both questions is "no", and I have provided proof.    What was your proof again? That librarians don't put it in the fiction section? That's your proof that its not fiction? Are you trying to say that because librarians put the bible in the religion section, its true?

681297	2	Depends on the article. In some comment threads I've seen worthwhile, rational discussion about things Apple-related, but far more frequently any comment that casts Apple or Macs in a positive light, no matter how well-founded or reasonable, gets downmodded into oblivion and insulting responses about being a "fanboy".
320343	1	Yeah lol sorry for the mistake
475370	4	You know twitter is overkill when Martha Stewert and Ellen Degeneres are raving about it. Twitter is an odd "meme" for older people too. Many of them feel "not with it" in matters concerning teh internets. They see younger people all around them, tapping away on keyboards everywhere.        For some reason, Twitter has been adopted by them as their "hipster-in-tune-with-the-times" internet place. It's like, I tweet therefore I'm automatically cool. A modern day Cartesian cogito of sorts. It also gets hyped mercilessly by every talking head on TV, though one fails to find a reason why. Beneath the smoke and froth lies a gizmodic chat room.        Nothing to see here...move on.
