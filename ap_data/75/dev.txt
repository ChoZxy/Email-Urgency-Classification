You where setting yourself up there...    &gt; Look at you, don't you think the world would be a better place without these senseless browser wars?    Negative - Competition = better product.    I actually use four browsers...Firefox for development / debugging / whatever, Opera on the phone, Chrome for webkit testing (I hate the awful apple UI / product packaging), and IE for testing since most people still use it. Firefox is the best all-around IMO so I use it most, but that doesn't mean it works for you.

In this case there is a new technology of RAM which costs more and apple uses in their iMacs.    I really commend apple for their accomplishments in making computer purchasing and everyday use easier on the customer, but for the user looking to get the best bang for their buck for their specific needs, PC is still the best. The price you pay is the time you spend researching. With apple you pay their engineers to do that for you.

112543	2	The price is high, but I can kind of see it. Bear in mind that we're talking about putting 8GB of RAM into a consumer desktop. Most regular users are doing fine with 1 or 2 gigs these days, so it doesn't make sense for them to buy more than 4 for some room to grow.    I imagine the people who want/need 8GB fall into two categories: power users and businesses wanting a low-cost workstation.    Businesses have to weigh the costs of everything. Where I work, the programmers do double-duty as the IT staff. So, every hour I spend setting up someone's new computer is an hour I don't bill. A couple people pointed out that Apple charges $200 more than the cost of the RAM itself, which means I have maybe 2 hours to learn how to open the iMac case (read a few web pages &amp; watch a few YouTube demos), get the thing open, swap the RAM, get everything back together, and test it to make sure it isn't going to flake out when the new designer starts using it. If I can't get all that done in a few hours, then it's cheaper for us to just pay the extra $200 to get the machine upgraded at the factory. Remember, this is a consumer machine. They want people who do their own RAM upgrades to buy a Pro.    Now, power users aren't afraid of rolling up their sleeves and mucking around inside a computer that was never supposed to be opened by the end user. I've had my Mac Minis at home open a couple of times, and I've been dying to know what it's like inside an iMac. Apple knows we're just going to hop on NewEgg and buy our RAM there no matter what they charge, so we don't really figure into their pricing.

706518	2	Economists disagree:    'Why Should We Save Big Banks?'    Name: Nelson Goodell  City &amp; State: Burgaw, N.C.    Question/Comment: I am a traditional liberal democrat who is in favor of a large stimulus package that focuses on job creation and helping out states. I can not understand the need for further bank bailouts. I do not understand the concept of too big to fail. If there are 10,000 financial institutions in this country and 2,000 are insolvent; why not let the other 8,000 that were more prudent take over the business of the 2,000 that are insolvent? Can you explain to me the argument for saving the big banks, their executives and their shareholders at taxpayers expense instead of allowing successful banks to take over their business?    Paul Solman: The argument saving the banks is that without them, the whole system freezes. See our story on the domino effect for one account. Look at what happened when Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail for a real-life example.    In retrospect, Lehman seemed "too big to fail" because when it DID fail, the consequences appear to have been catastrophic. "Too big" means the institution has too many promises out there that, if reneged upon, would bring down too many other institutions with whom they did business.    As to the argument for saving executives, it's that we need the best and brightest (and most knowledgeable) to run banks. I would venture to say this argument isn't playing well in Peoria at the moment, or perhaps anywhere outside a psychiatric ward.    As to the shareholders, the argument is that if you wipe them out, you won't get MORE investors to come in to help the government foot the bill, and revive the system. They'll be afraid of getting wiped out too.    http://www.pbs.org/newshour/businessdesk/2009/02/why-should-we-save-big-banks.html    More detailed analysis:  http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jcTB9MbkEV5rd9YvlN-Fd92Ov6UwD970MPB05

151256	1	&gt;That having been said, none of it was "stolen Muslim land."    None was stolen up to that point, but that wasn't the case after the partition plan (and the subsequent wars).    I'm just point out that you're exaggerating the amount of land bought, as it was significantly smaller than what Israel would receive after.    &gt;I realize that the Palestinian Christians are Arabs - I wrote just as much. I admit my ignorance about any Aramaic descent for the Muslims, though. Where did you get this information?    You can start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Arabic    There's some reference material on the bottom. If you ever visit the area you'd realize the difference once you step out of Ramallah or Jerusalem. Their vocabulary is quite different and they ommit some standard arabic letters in their speech while infusing non-arab ones (either from aramaic or ancient hebrew).    The Rurals tend to be muslim (vast majority) whereas Christians are usually centered in Cities like ramallah (a christian city originally) and Jerusalem.

I mean, that goes back to the Bible at least. "Put away childish things" and all that. More likely, though, he thought his observation was unique, an idea that he should be disabused of in the interest of education.

Which is not to disparage them at all, it's just a very difficult mission for an organized monolithic entity.    The "big guns" they have available are not as effective when they have to worry about collateral damage. They would be particularly worried about collateral damage when the non-combatants are American citizens.

358432	1	No source citation here, but I recall seeing someone tear apart the 74% speed increase before. IIRC, these were people who had no typing training before, and after being trained (incidentally, on Dvorak) they were 74% faster.    I have found no speed increase, you'll get ridiculously fast on any layout, if you're willing to train on it. Dvorak is definitely more comfortable, but a small pain is programs that assume you're on qwerty, as mentioned earlier with vi (or stupid flash games that want you to use WASD).    I've kept speed up with both, because I use Dvorak at home, qwerty at school/work/borrowed computers. It's not hard to do, just funny when I don't pay attention and accidently start hitting Dvorak keys on a qwerty layout.
313325	2	Great distances in regards to commuting (at least in my mind) considers the amount of miles one could travel in a reasonable time period, which would allow one to consider a specific mode of transit viable for commuting to and from work/etc on a daily basis. In Japan people commute large distances to work, and while Japan itself might not be comparable in size to other countries, the distance/time calculation of commuting is a relative calculation...(again, at least in my mind)...Therefore commuters in Japan are going farther/faster than commuters in Los Angeles.

206931	1	Yes, the standard permits function arguments to be evaluated in any order. But what most people don't realize is that there does not even need to be any order at all on the function arguments. For example:     foo( (a, b), (c, d) )    Here we have a function `foo` that takes two arguments, and both are comma expressions.    The comma guarantees that `a` is evaluated before `b` and `c` is evaluated before `d`. But it does not guarantee anything else. Crazy orders like this are allowed:     c, a, b, d    Get that? The evaluation of the expressions can be interleaved! This despite the fact that the comma operator generates a sequence point.

Heap leaching has taken gold mining as far as we can go. We currently have declining mines throughout the world, and a growing population. Going back to the gold standard would surely cause governments the world over to throw needless resources after mines which are already depleted.     I agree we spent way too much in Vietnam. We wasted a great deal of money (not to mention the lives of our brave soldiers and the Vietnamese/Chinese we killed)  I agree that the gold standard was not a failure, but I contend that it would be now.

I mean, it fluctuates from insanity (back to when the Vatican was a bordello) to extremely helpful rationality (when Pope John Paul II helped democratize Eastern Europe).    I mean, by the logic you're holding, the United State's government is racist (now) because of slavery (over a century ago). Not to say that the United States/Church isn't racist/insane, but it's not because of what they did over a century/half a century ago.

1039899	1	Sorry, my reply had nothing about government expansion in it. Austrian economics isn't about the size of government, it's more about the manipulation of the business cycle. Government or banks could be the cause of manipulation and it doesn't matter about the size of these entities either.    Therefore, I've never conceded the point that an increase in government spending will fix the problem. According to Austrian theory, it was the government spending that caused the problem and therefore more spending only makes the problem worse, not better. So when you say:    &gt; Austrians around here would concede that's possible    the "that's possible" part is that government manipulation can solve a problem. That is impossible according to Austrian theory.

I have a desktop app I wrote in Java, and if I had it to do over again I'd use C++. Many users balk at the idea of installing/running a JVM to use it.
129579	2	Just to make my definition of rational clear:    Rationality is only intelligible when in the context of a goal (whether that goal be rational or irrational). Now, if one acts rationally, given their information set, will chose the best plan-of-action towards succeeding their goal. Part of being rational is knowing which goals will maximize their utility function.    According to discovery.com, â€œ61 percent reported at least a moderate behavior change in what they considered positive ways.â€ Assuming you wonâ€™t get a bad trip, is it rational to take the drug? Depends on whether the drug changes your utility function and whether it conflicts with the older version. I doubt a psychedelic experience can help me optimize my current utility function better than my sober self. How can I be more rational from a drug? Therefore, I conclude that it must, in fact, change my preference ordering; make me care about things more than I would have otherwise. I would rather keep my preferences the way they are now, of course.    What you guys think?

459867	2	Oh wow Kanye, sitting down during their performance! That showed 'em not to talk to you! Self proclaimed "Voice of this generation" or not, that was very, very douchey and immature.    And Miley "ruining" Radiohead, a band who's been around longer then she's been alive is quite funny. Don't give her the "she's only 15 years old" excuses. Once a 11 year old can be charged with murder and put into an adult prison that doesn't hold much water. She's old enough to know that when your a public image, you can act like you have some sense.

567448	2	The problem is that applications should not destroy the metadata I attach to files without a very good reason. What applications are typically trying to do is update the contents of a file. If I change the permissions, ownership, or any other file metadata this should not be affected by an update to the content. Likewise if I have hardlinks to a file those links should be preserved when an application updates the content.      I realize there are a large number of applications that aren't so respectful of my metadata, but that doesn't make them right.

519230	3	Ever notice that there are a large number of women who seem to think they have the supernatural power to know the sex of any baby? I've seen many women who were otherwise well grounded in reason and logic suddently act like mystics, claiming that they "have a feeling" that someone's baby will be a boy. What's funny is that they exhibit the same kinds of denial that crazier people have when confronted with being wrong about this. They claim there were circumstances that changed things out of their control, like "oh, another friend of mine had a boy at the same time, I must have been thinking of her." Or they'll say "well, i was wrong this time, but most of the time I'm right."

There's a handful of people in my hometown on food stamps that are driving SUVs. :(    EDIT: It's because I'm single, if you were wondering why I don't qualify. The more dependents you have the higher the limit for income level is.

341824	3	Yes... like 8 years ago Levi had this commercial set to the song "I'm coming out" with shots of men and women walking down a street. All of the shots only showed their well sculpted tummies with their jeans on. You didn't see anything but that. What really fucked with my head was all of their belly buttons were singing. Their belly buttons were like lips singing and dancing and shit. It mortified me. I hate that commercial (it sticks in my head now) and I've never bought anything from Levi Strauss since then.

I tried Suncorp for a while, but they wanted me to fill out heaps of paperwork to "apply" for a visa DEBIT card. WTF Suncorp? it isn't even credit. Then they took ages to email me my net banking password. Then I had to fill out a form and request an "external transfer" password (which is of course, mailed out) just so I could transfer money.        Suncorp are the most retarded bank I have ever seen.
11267	4	Maybe I've misrepresented my personal position on Rush. I don't like the guy at all. That doesn't mean that he can't play liberal sensitivities and biases like a fiddle. That's what he is doing now. I hate seeing him succeed in that, and it makes me disappointed to see ignorant people on the left and the right buy into it so easily.    As for wanting an opponent to fail, people usually do it because they think they'd do a better job, and the world would be a better place for it. Republicans wouldn't wish Obama to fail if they thought America would be worse off in the long run for it. But then they would be called Democrats.

975719	3	Decriminalization means that you can't be arrested for possessing small amounts of pot (you get a civil citation normally, in other words a ticket), while legalization means that the growing and selling is completely legal. Pot is already decriminalized in a handful of states. If Obama nationally decriminalized pot and left it up to the states to set legality or not I would jack the man off, take that Reagen.

122260	1	Your logic doesn't work out. Not believing in something is not the same as believing something doesn't exist. I don't believe in world completely covered by oceans, but I wouldn't say it doesn't exist. I just don't see any particular reason to believe that it does.    Likewise, if you ask a person who was raised without ever having been introduced to the concept of God, and you ask them whether or not they believe in God, their honest answer will have to be no. Ask them if their position is that God doesn't exist, and they'll have to admit that they don't have a position.    An atheist agnostic is the same way. Agnosticism is the position that we can't know whether or not gods exist, so while an atheist agnostic may not honestly be able to believe in god, it's explicitly their not their position that gods don't exist.    &gt; What makes me think that atheists strive for consistency and rational thought? Because they demonstrate at least in one facet of critical thinking, with regards to an idea that in many places is the norm.    You don't know that they arrived at their atheism by critical thinking, though. Maybe they're atheist because they were raised atheist and never bothered to question it. Maybe they're atheist for some emotional reason. Atheists are atheist for all sorts of reasons, including but no means limited to rational thought. You seem to have some idealized view of what it means to be an atheist, when ultimately all it means in itself is lack of belief in god.
638527	2	Given that there are *no* arguments *for* using grades in the article, it seems like any bias is toward the critical side. The article is mostly simply stating details of grading systems in various countries.    I agree that the article could benefit from a summary (with citations) of the different viewpoints on grading. But it's Wikipedia; it's not something to rant about - it's something to spur you to write.
