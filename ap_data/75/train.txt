Give me a saint, and some people can produce Satan. Agree or not, people find fault with any viewpoint.    Lennon was a communist.

The idea of a "new world order" has been circulating for years. Whether it'll ever happen or not is another matter, because as humans we're too addicted to war and to splitting up into groups (countries, states, nations, political factions).    I imagine the world will simply become increasingly chaotic over time, as opposed to collectively conforming to a global order.

Also, sounds like your parents are very childish themselves and use you to gang up on him.    The solution is group therapy but you are going to get some answers you don't like.. that you three (or more) are probably the real assholes.

Ray tracers are "free" in geometric complexity if the implementation uses a good spatial index to help find intersections without having to check too many possibilities for each ray. Since Caustic's solution is part hardware, implementing a good octree or kd-tree in hardware and keeping it up to date with objects in motion is a non-trivial task.    3) Shaders are not merely what NVidia and ATI build right now. The term somes from Pixar's Renderman. You very much do need shaders for realistic looking details on surfaces. If you don't, you end up using texture mapping instead, which although popular in Quake and kin, has a sort of inherent cheesiness to it. Running shaders costs CPU cycles and the reason it's a good requirements is to make sure that Caustic is not taking shortcuts.    4) Global illumination is NOT free. Maybe the raytracers you use pre-process each frame render with a radiosity or photon mapping pass. Without Global Illumination you do not get the same quality of color bleeding, soft shadows etc. The raytracer I use, POVRay, does offer these options. However, just like shaders, the additional realism comes at a cost of processing power.     5) It does matter to require Caustic's demo to have everything in motion. This ensures that they have taken no short cuts in their illumination and spatial indexing implementation.    6) Raytracers do oversample to implement anti-aliasing. To get a nice-looking picture, you must have a minimum of 4 rays per pixel, usually more.
913010	2	Does anyone notice whether women usually hold the door for other people? I'm a woman and I always do that. My point is, if women hold the door just as much as men, then what is the problem. I do notice that some men (usually older than me) do tend to put on a show and act very ceremonious about it, but I just think that's cute. I think that some women are more likely to worry about men taking advantage of them if they feel powerless inside.
687545	2	My cat, who passed away at the ripe old age of 22.7 years old, was like that. She always was the center of attention - if you were playing the Wii with friends, she'd be right there in the middle, watching. If you were watching TV, she'd be in your lap. Whenever I had a party, she could be found on someone's lap.    Every night, I'd come home from work (tired and miserable), and there she'd be, waiting by the door. She'd come up, meowing, welcoming me home.    And every night, before we'd go to bed (we'd sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time, usually), she'd demand a nice long hug before bed.    I miss her. http://trypu.com

369171	3	See, I live in VA, and I'm exposed to said "rednecks" everyday. Saying that you're a "Redneck" to southerners and/or rural people, and as it appears Alaskans, is basically like saying that you live a southern/rural lifestyle. You like to go out on the 4-wheeler, drive trucks, hunt, fish, enjoy sports, know how to fix or repair mechanical stuff, and just overall feel at home living outside a city or urban area.     And there's nothing WRONG with that. I was brought up in a family that many would associate with most of those stereotypes. My brother is about the most redneck person I know. I went down a more liberal path in life and although I fit in best living a city-life, I still enjoy fishing, hunting, using firearms, 4-wheeling, and other rural-based things; not to mention an unexplainable fondness for camouflage.    Now there's that lifestyle, and then there's white trash. White trash is what many urban and city people think about when you mention 'redneck', and it's unfair. People like Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy tend to exaggerate white-trash stereotypes for comedic reasons, which unfortunately make many non-rural folks think that all rural/southern people are stupid, barbaric, and simple-minded. It's just not true, we just use the land and things that we have available (like the woods and cars) to have fun with instead of computers and technology. Just a different lifestyle, which, again, there's nothing wrong with.

101508	2	&gt; the article assumes that the people being laid off are not worth the money. If a company is laying off good employees because of a bad business cycle, then they deserve to perish.    I don't believe the article makes a distinction if the people are worthwhile employees or not. The point was that we're better because good people were fired and went on to build better things.     GM may very well have fired the next CEO to a startup electric car company that will put GM into it's grave. If the government steps in and stops GM layoffs, then this new company will never exist. Therefore layoffs can be good.

Of course no doctors are allowed to do research on cannabis, so how can they know what it is and isn't good for?

276291	2	John Kekes. His best book is The Morality of Pluralism: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=73tGF0NHTJQC&amp;dq=the+morality+of+pluralism&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uTW1Sb3XIpC0jAeVw-zbBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result    It is a take on what's called conservatism in the philosophical sense (meaning not necessary having any relationship with politicians who happen tocall themselves conservative): common sense, anti-ideology, practicalism, wisdom, moderation, temperance, relying on experience rather than ideology.    However, Kekes manages to turn it into a clear rational ideology. It's an extreme intellectual feat. Most conservative philosophers are just critics, Kekes actually builds a rational, logical system.    He earns two bonus points for    1) being 100% secular, no religious arguments  2) being able to express even the most complicated ideas in a clear, simple, easy to understand manner    Highly recommended.
517655	1	Does Geithner have aides too?
334129	2	trying to think along those lines, i think one key aspect is that modularity is about allowing for constrained change -- things have to be sufficiently close enough to sensibly inter-operate, yet they have to allow for things to be sufficiently different for there to be benefit.    this ties in with the Liskov Substitutability Principle, methinks. i think that LSP has been shown (C. Date, A. Cockburn, Oleg) to more show that things *can't* be substituted, more than that they can. and a big part of it wrt software is that it involves *behaviour* and not just data.    maybe REST is an approach that manages to tame / address / resolve the tension in a productive way.

597681	4	&gt; What I am most interested in is why you think the four noble truths are "quite silly".     I touched on the reasons in my previous comment. I'll respond to your points by way of further explanation:    &gt; To explain, there is such a thing as suffering (we can all agree on this, I hope).     There is also such a thing as joy. There are many other identifiable emotions and experiences, good and bad. Why does suffering come in for such special attention?    &gt; This suffering has an origin -- there is no effect without cause.     This is a platitude, true of everything.    &gt; Suffer can be eliminated. There is a way to end suffering.     That's an assertion which is highly questionable. Which people are living suffering-free lives? Are you thinking of monks, who live in monasteries? Or people who simply accept their circumstances, no matter what? Or people who momentarily attain nirvana or satori?    This ignores everything that science has learned about human psychology. Suffering is natural, we use it as a feedback mechanism. Obviously people try to minimize suffering in their lives - that's the point of suffering. No-one needs a religion to tell them that. "Ending" suffering may not even be a good idea, depending on exactly what is meant by that.    The ways that Buddhism teaches to minimize suffering are just a small subset of the possibilities. Why is it a particularly important subset? It's not. It's arbitrary. And again, this is why I don't have much use for "structured belief systems". They tend to take arbitrary sets of axioms and build entire belief systems around them. If the axioms are not well chosen, it brings the entire system into question.    &gt; I'm not entirely sure what you find silly about this; it seems to be something that is fairly agreeable to even non-Buddhists.    As with a theistic religion, the burden is really on you to explain why the Buddhist tenets make *rational* sense, and might be worth treating as any more important than any other set of observations.    One thing I find silly is that an arbitrary set of axioms that some charismatic person came up with millennia ago should be granted such importance. One doesn't find this sort of thing in rational thought - for example, there are many ancient Greeks who wrote many very insightful things, but no single one of them is raised up along with his principles as being the core of all rational thought. Other than the apparent nature of the human religious bias, there's no substantive reason that spiritual tradition should be any different.     Those differences in approach correspond closely to the reasons that such belief systems make little sense to me. They're essentially long-running fads. You accept it mainly for the reasons you've stated above: because other people do. You use the fact that some non-Buddhists find the principles agreeable as evidence in favor of those principles. It is not evidence, any more than beliefs in Thor or Xenu are evidence of their existence. But because of that social influence, you believe that there must be something in it, so you have found ways to make it make sense to you. You might as well be telling me about the sublime importance of the central tenets of Pokemon characters.    L. Ron Hubbard (and others) have actually proved this, to some extent, by inventing a religion from whole cloth, and gaining a significant following.    None of this is to say there's nothing of value in Buddhism, or any other religious tradition for that matter. But what actually explains their unusual characteristics is that they serve a societal purpose related to intra-group bonding and inter-group relations. I find it disappointing that we as a species can't be more rational about such things.

473067	1	It's not a government program, it's a government requirement. Automakers would build it into new cars, you'd buy it. Like, say, seat belts are required.    Presumably the $450 stated cost is from automaker data, so is accurate.    I have a car with stability control. It's useful at speed, but actually somewhat un-useful when trying to get unstuck from snow and ice. If the wheels spin, the car cuts power to them, and sometimes when you're trying to get unstuck, you want to spin the wheels.    So my prediction: fewer crashes, more calls to tow trucks to get cars unstuck from icy parking spots.

106163	2	Ok, here's one for you.    Are you aware that FEMA does not share your opinion about jet planes bringing down the Twin Towers?    Here are some relevant quotes from ["World Trade Center Building Performance Study"](http://www.fema.gov/rebuild/mat/wtcstudy.shtm) published september 2002 by FEMA.    Chapter 2 page 16 : section 2.2.1.1: Building Response; WTC1 **Initial Damage From Aircraft Impact**    "The exact extent of this damage will likely never be known with certainty. It is evident that, despite this damage, the structure retained sufficient integrity and strength to remain globally stable for a period of approximately 1 hour 43 minutes."    You see? The impact itself did not bring down the towers.    Later in the document, page 22, section 2.2.1.2 Building Response; WTC1; **Fire Development**, it goes on to say "... Accounting for all these factors, it is believed that almost all of the jet fuel that remained on the impact floors, was consumed in the first few minutes of the fire.    As the jet fuel burned, the resulting heat ignited office contents throughout a major portion of several impact floors, as well as combustible material within the aircraft itself."    This is what FEMA says brought down WTC1 &amp; WTC2, burning office materials, not impact or fuel.

When someone is killed young and in mysterious and surprising circumstance it's just a more interesting story and will always sell better. It also helps that she is rich, pretty and white (in that order).

186626	2	&gt;Anybody who bases their decision to use drugs on whether they are legal or not is using or has already use alcohol and tobacco, simply because they are legal.    I disagree. I have never used tobacco. I have tried alcohol, but don't commonly drink. I suspect I would try pot (or more likely other drugs - pot isn't that attractive to me - I'd be interested in trying LSD or E though) if legal and easily available. If I found the cost/benefit ratio positive, I might continue using it.    All drugs are not equally tempting - the effects of niccotine are fairly mild, at the cost of an addictive and costly practice. If the effects of pot look more appealing, there may be an incentive to try them - this is no different from any other product.    I agree with Magephil - you *are* making stupid assumptions in this thread. Note that you were *wrong* about enigma66 smoking and drinking *now* - you just seem to have amended this to having *ever* tried smoking and drinking which is rather pointless. 95% of the population have probably *tried* smoking or drinking - people trying pot have also probably tried caffeine, or eating bread at some point in their lives too - but what exactly is the point behind it?    Also, how it was it "drug warrior bait"? It seems a totally believable and uncontroversial statement - you seem to be imagining attacks that just *aren't there*. (I'm tempted towards drug warrior baiting myself, given the obvious paranoia/pot comment that can be made at this point, but I'll pass, save paralypsically)

351663	2	An extra 56% sales tax on everything would be a pretty ugly "solution" to whatever problem you claim exists with the current system.    (56% is the rate needed to replace the government's current income tax revenues - so if you buy a $1 item, it will cost you $1.56 with sales tax, assuming you live in a STATE that doesn't have a sales tax. The 56% rate also assumes no black marketeering, which is a very very large assumption, so probably the rate would need to be 80% or more.)

1018621	2	&gt;Prohibition laws negate self-ownership and are an absolute affront to the principles of freedom.    No they don't.    As the owner of my body, I have the natural right to smoke meth. But perhaps I think that meth leads to an increase in crime and broken families, and I would prefer to live in a community in which as few people as possible smoke meth.    Therefore, I offer the following deal: I will waive my right to smoke meth, and in return I get the promise that everyone else will waive the same right. If everyone agrees, then meth becomes illegal, and hopefully less accessible.    Ron Paul apparently believes that I should not be _allowed_ to make such a deal - that I should _not_ have the freedom to participate in a democracy that creates the laws that govern me.    If we cannot create our own laws, then we lack self-ownership.

In order to survive in the midst of wolves, you need to wear your wolf furs. It's critical to act "normal" no matter how much more powerful your brain is. Out of all evils in the world, smoking is probably one of the smallest sacrifices you can make if circumstances require it. Comes along with disguise is another important subject, and that is self discipline -- you don't want to forget who you truly are.     ... k, so much for smoking.
429161	4	You got turned down for a job you would probably not have liked because management are dumbasses.    2 years of dreamweaver experience? That's just stupid. Anyone looking for 2 years of experience with a particular editor that isn't complex enough to need more than 2 weeks to figure out the nuances of doesn't have a full understanding of what they're looking for. They're not looking for the right people.    Dreamweaver is an editor. That's it. Don't get me wrong - it's an editor on crack that does a lot of things for you (and in the opinion of many, against you) - but it's just a glorified editor.    Saying you must have Dreamweaver experience is like saying you must have Wordperfect experience and turning you down for having 10 years experience using Microsoft Word instead. It's flat out stupid.    A good HR person would be looking for a web developer with a great body of work/examples, and strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript (ideally AJAX, probably).... If appropriate, they'd be looking for someone with PHP / whatever-language knowledge as well .. not sure what that position entails.

Programmers who underperform will be taken out back, put down and sold as cheap meat to Columbians.

Mess with it, tweak it, get involved with the shell and not just the GUI. Do day-to-day tasks in the shell, for example use the yum cli rather than the crappy package management GUIs. You'll learn a ton more this way.    If you can afford it then study for (and gain the required experience for) RHCT and RHCE exams.

There is a huge difference between Anonymous and anonymous. What you morons fail to realize is 'anonymous' by its very definition is just that: it could be anyone and everyone. You constantly make the mistake of confusing 'anonymous' with 'Anons', hoping to reveal some level of organization where there is none, just so you can find someone to point a finger at. Good luck with that.

461553	3	This thread is turning into a letters to Penthouse column, but here goes:    After a particularly long day of school my girlfriend called and told me to come over.    When I arrived there was a note on the door that said "Follow the Trail". Shirt, Pants, Bra, Panties up the stairs to her parents bedroom, who were away. Shes naked in her hottub, and I immediately follow suit.     A few minutes later, her father(who was supposed to be out of town on business) comes home early, sees the note and the clothes, and, thinking they are from his wife, coming into his bathroom in a halfway state of undress. He then gets to witness his 16 year old daughter and some dirtbag making out in their hottub. He makes the most uncomfortable face I ever seen, and runs out of the room.    I try to jimmy the window open, which doesnt work, while my gf runs downstairs to do damage control. About half an hour later I am told to come downstairs, where her father hands me a beer and says "Drink this beer, and help me unload a pallet of wood from my truck and we will never talk about this again." I chug the beer, help move the wood without making eye contact, and then run home to tell my Everquest guild what had happened.    A few days later the local radio station has a Christmas Naughty or Nice contest, which I, of course, call in to say what had happened. I win, and they play the story on the radio at my gf's dads work.     He is not impressed at all, and on top of that the prize is a romantic weekend for two out of town, on which I take his still very underage daughter.    She, now my wife, like to bring this up every once and a while for shits and giggles in front of him. He is only slightly less scary then he was back then though.      Bonus - I asked for permission to marry his daughter at a strip club

22501	3	My take - stop making it so big deal of a problem and that's it.    I think one of the core issues here is that thanks to all this propaganda everywhere you are *supposed* to crave for these things. So, you constantly think about it and check yourself - "do I want it? am I addicted?" etc. And guess what happens when you constantly think about it?    Really - mental issues aside, I don't think that quitting smoking is any more of a problem to an average person than, I dunno, quitting some soda if suddenly you decide so.

462968	1	http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-ipod-shuffle-third-generation/P6    There is, however, something that many users will care about: the new shuffle doesnâ€™t fully work with any headphones except Appleâ€™s. Because of what Apple has done hereâ€”something sneaky and arguably terrible for consumers, especially if it continues with other iPod and iPhone products in 2009â€”if you plug your old third-party headphones of any sort into the new shuffle, youâ€™ll find that you canâ€™t do anything with the device other than have it continuously play music, without volume controls or interruption, unless of course of you turn it off. Surprise: the only third-party headphones that will work are ones that havenâ€™t even entered manufacturing yet, because theyâ€™ll need to contain yet another new Apple authentication chip, which will add to their price. Your only alternatives will be third-party remote control adaptersâ€”also not yet available, as Appleâ€™s not even making oneâ€”and using Appleâ€™s earphones. The prices for the third-party adapters will be no less than $19, and quite possibly more like $29; compatible headphones announced thus far start at $49.

First you say that getting rid of NAT is bad because we will run out of IPv4 addresses, then you say that IPv6 addresses will run out some day too and now you call me shortsighted for endorsing IPv6?    Are you trying to say that NAT is useful even in IPv6? In which case the answer clearly is no. When IPv6 addresses start to run out, we should migrate to IPv7 (or whatever protocol succeeds IPv6).

352291	4	I am truly sorry for your loss.   As for advice, I stand along with many other voices here that feel you might be choosing the wrong venue. The grief you and your wife feel is truly deeper than any other persons can be at this time. But I feel a sense of loss as well, after reading this. Many people will need this ceremony to come to terms with their own sense of loss, for whatever reasons that they are feeling it.   When my uncle died, he had been a part of the catholic church. The funeral ceremony was catholic, and I still have not been able to come to terms with the sense of alienation that I had - feeling as an outcast within that religious ceremony. My beliefs were challenged by a priest and congregation who had a narrow vision of their faith, and allowed it to drive all aspects of a ceremony that I needed in order to come to terms with my loss. A loss that was different from his children's, from his brothers and sisters, and from his congregations loss.   Please do not alienate other people at a time when they need to come to terms with this tragic situation. Please use this occasion to help all of those who take part come to terms with the loss in their own way.   I wish you all of the best.

751199	4	I'm glad to see you expanded on your opinion and just didn't leave the question hanging, but I disagree that it's enslaving us. Yes, countries put up firewalls and spy on us, but even with the technology, the internet still serves as a platform to at least attempt to give every person an equal voice. They may attempt to enslave us, but the internet has become very adept at adapting around such problems, and sees the majority of such proposals as worrying nuisances. Sites like Wikileaks help to keep the "Big Brother" aspect in check, and (decent yet sadly rare) bloggers can use the internet as means to voice their opinion in countries where they cannot do so publicly without fearing for their lives. Big Brother may loom, but you give the individual far too little credit for his ability to work around him.        I know this doesn't address every issue in your post, but that's the part that really stuck out at me. It seems that you have a pessimistic view of technology, and are somewhat missing (not intentionally) the positives that have also come with (and in response) the negatives.

786756	1	Because the rhetoric of "communism" is a good ideal. The Soviet Union wasn't communist, however - nor is China today. These are oligarchies which use the idea of "communism" as a propaganda term to pacify their citizenry.         It's like how Iran and Israel use the names of religions as propaganda to make their government's policies seem more palatable to the citizens.

656652	4	I think defragging and coalescing is a bit more accurate. I think sleep and dreaming strengthens the links between stimulus and response events, and compacts and streamlines our internal knowledge representation of how our environment works. Without it, our brains start to hold too much experience in short term storage, reducing our overall efficiency in responding to real stimuli, almost as if you accumulate a soft representation of the events of your waking cycle, and then convert it to a more efficient long term kind of storage overnight, after running through various reimaging simulations of the event stream to ensure that our final, long term, learned responses are more accurate.    That said, I have fucking insomnia, and I have to get up in 2 hours.    FUCK.

I find it distasteful because musicians that come from country "A" are being disrupted, because people are upset with the actions of country "A".      People also happily ignore the fact that several other countries are involved in shitty things (like say, Iran), but *those* countries don't get picketed.       No, Israel is a beautiful place. I doubt you've ever been there.       I'm not going to disrupt a concert because, say, the players are chinese and China has been a prominent weapons supplier to Sudan.      You see...I'm not a simplistic, reactionary douchebag who likes to ruin events for people by *making them political*.    This was an "Artists without borders" concert. How sad.      &gt;Sure they do.    Prove it. Next.      Yes, your depiction of Israel is *completely* accurate.        You know, if you completely ignore the hostility of it's neighbours and the reasons for any of the wars it's waged.      Oh, yes, though, an authoritarian state like Iran is miles ahead of a country that allows Arabs to become citizens and set up Arab-interest political parties.        Oh and everyone in Israel HATES palestinians. There are no peace movements in Israel. No protests against treatment of Palestinians. No working with Palestinian-Israeli NGO's.      Keep you views nice and polarized, eh.

689268	1	I thought it was kenny throughout the whole episode, especially when Mysterion 'died' and then suddenly revived, now that's the kinda thing Kenny would do.    However, I don't believe all of those town people would recognize Kenny as he reveals half of his face, it's not quite likely all the bystanders had seen kenny's face before, so my guess is Stan, because he's the only kid who could easily obtain illegal fireworks (because of his uncle Jimbo).

Obama is to much of a pussy to bomb villages in Pakistan so he orders air strikes to have children killed.     Those DEA agents raided medical marijuana dispensaries during Obama's administration. He is at fault. If he wants to give back the money and marijuana that the DEA stole and fire the DEA agents that violated the 10th amendment I would accept his apology.     If he was not ready to take over the office of the presidency when that idiot Bush stepped down then he should not have run for office.     You can say give him time, but being president is not an easy job. It might be too much for Obama to handle.    I held Bush and Clinton to the same standard. I protested in the streets against both, that may happen with Obama as well, if he kills any more children with his military in a country that has not attacked us first.     I am strongly bias towards government not hurting people. I guess that is showing.

People do not make enough money to afford the ridiculous LA rent, you pay everything you have for a tiny house in a garbage neighborhood with a shitty school system. Why is this so hard for you to understand, I'm sure you went to college, that's probably why you moved here in 03, so you should be having an easier time understanding why this is a serious social issue and the effect that gentrification has on people. This isn't about black and brown. When a bunch of financially secure people regardless of race move into a city like LA because they like the "diversity" the "diversity" will eventually be gone. when all the "diversity" is gone because rent for that retail store they ran is just too high now the city reaches a crossroads. either everyone will leave because it's no longer "diverse" and they're tired of paying 10 dollars for a cafe mocacinno or because now they are in their 30s and have grown up and realized they don't want to live in the city anymore and all of a sudden we are back to square one.     what gentrification does more than anything is drive up real estate prices, that does not necessarily equate to economic growth.

Exactly the same reason the Sri Lankan cricket team's bus was [attacked by terrorists](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/03/2506261.htm) in Pakistan, apparently.     And the bombings in Madrid too. American foreign policy! Or perhaps it might have something to do with Osama's rhetoric of how Andalusia needs to be regained by Muslims. The very same Osama who encourages violence against a wide range of targets.

44918	2	&gt; Hospitals will do everything in their power to nickel and dime you    It's more ... complicated ... than that. Our medical system is jacked up pretty much everywhere and the net result is that everything is more expensive than you might think.    If you look at equipment, the economics pretty much guarantee high prices. The material cost of, say, an MRI machine is pretty high to begin with. But then, demand for new machines is almost certainly not high enough for economies of scale to really kick in, so there's no decent mechanism for manufacturers to get costs - and, thus, prices - down. The lack of transparency in the medical finance system further reduces any motive to even try, so the system is in permanent stasis in its current configuration.    Medical personnel training is similarly fucked. Your typical medical student racks up as much debt in one _year_ of med school as most non-medical students accumulate in their entire academic career. And this is _after_ they've completed an undergraduate degree. And if they decide to go into a specialty field, things get even more fucked up than that, and it's even longer before they enter the workforce. Either way, they enter the workforce with far, far more debt than your average American, and because of the longer training time, have fewer productive years to actually make a living. They must either work until they're dead, or charge enough to make up the difference more quickly.    Those are just the two most obvious things that have to be fixed before we can even talk about reducing our medical expenses in this country. But, as a small business owner myself, there's something else I'll point out that we all have to remember to keep ourselves sane. It's quaint to think that the cost of your visit is just the hourly rate of the doctor who saw you plus whatever it cost to snap the x-ray. The reality, however, is that any sufficiently large organization will have to have a staff of non-billable employees that are essential to operating the facilities. Janitors, administrators, concierges, receptionists, and other people without whom the hospital simply cannot function... but yet, these people also don't do anything that a customer can be billed for. These people's wages and salaries have to be factored into prices charged by the hospital somehow, else they'll never get paid.    I don't say this to defend the medical industry at all. I'm just directing the ire where it belongs: further upstream from where we have our direct exposure.

726505	1	don't you know? I stand corrected.
979072	1	Absolutely... Below is a guide on how to get it working, together with the weather scripts, and more.      Alright. Replace the file .conkyrc in your home folder with [this.](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?kjnnonyi2aj)        Now, for the weather. [You are going to need the Perl Script that I use.](http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=3e8dbec0bf06f51be62ea590dc5e5dbbe04e75f6e8ebb871) **GRAB ONLY the weather script, the conkyrc is above, the one there is obsolete.** Place this script wherever you want, but make sure wherever you place it, you cd to the path and run sudo chmod 777 weather.pl         ${execi 3600 perl ~/scripts/weather.pl 11021 f w} is in the .conkyrc file. Use either sudo gedit ~/.conkyrc or sudo nano ~/.conkyrc to change the path (~/scripts/weather.pl) to your file's path. Also, change the 11021 to your zipcode.        Next, we must install the fonts. [One](http://www.dafont.com/pizzadude-bullets.font) and [two](http://www.dafont.com/style-bats.font) and [three](http://www.fontspace.com/curtis-clark/pie-charts-for-maps). To install a font, cd to its path, and use the following commands:      (From WikiHow) :  *Move all your fonts to the ~/ Directory. The ~/ Directory is your home folder. So if you were logged in as cruddpuppet, the directory would be /home/cruddpuppet/ .  Open up the terminal. I'm assuming you've already extracted the font to the ~/ directory. Type: "cd /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype" without the quotes (the path is "/usr/share/fonts/truetype" on some distros). What this does is changes the directory to the truetype fonts directory.  Type in "sudo mkdir myfonts" also without quotes. Assuming you're not logged in as root, this will ask you for your password. Anything you type will not be seen, but it is there. Just type in your password, press enter, and the directory 'myfonts' will be created.  Type in "cd myfonts" . Then type in "sudo cp ~/fontname.ttf ." . These will get your font in the /myfonts directory.  In order to install the font, ownership has to belong to root, so type in "sudo chown root.root fontname.ttf" and after that "sudo mkfontdir" which makes a directory for your font.  Now your font is installed, but it will disappear the next time ubuntu starts up, so you just need to type "cd .." and after that "fc-cache" .*      **Do this with all three fonts.**        Now you should be able to killall conky in the terminal, relaunch conky, and voila!        If you need any help, my MSN is ipimp@urtmail.net, my AIM is Yahoos the Best, my Yahoo is hac_king, and I hang out on the Linux Mint IRC as kingnerd. Please don't hesitate to contact me... It might sound nerdy, but I help people for fun.       Good luck, and enjoy your new and improved conky!

Although really I should have known that was a resistor because I studied Electronics, just we never used that symbol.

It's technical enough to keep you interested, but simple enough to understand.     Other than that, buy the Equipment, read the directions and enjoy brewing. It's addicting as hell and tons of fun to boot.     Also try to find a local Homebrew shop if you can and buy a kit from them. Make sure that everything is fresh (i.e. the can don't look like they've been sitting on the shelf since the 70's). I'm sure they'd be very helpful in setting you up with a kit and the equipment.

Look this is weed, sure we can compare it to cigarettes and alcohol but it will HAVE to be dispensed out of a special store. You have security reasons and not opening it up for the public to see. You can't just sell it in a CVS or a Rite-Aid. So it will be up to the local facilitates to find their products for their customer base. And just like everything else some people will pay extra for better quality (or from a specific grower) vs some generic brand. (from the Pharm Companies)The choice is left up to the consumer.     Unless they get wise and simply look through the criminal records and find a dozen or so former growers that got busted and offer them a job working for their corporate funded grow house. So they might take over the market, but if we tax the shit out of it...who cares?! People can still grow their own but even that you would still have people not wanting to bother with going through that whole process/hassle (Which it is *cough*) and just want to get high. They`ll come to the shops to sit down and smoke up.

521960	2	I have two qualms with this article. First men can take charge of their own birth control by providing and using their own condoms.     Second, the leap from women taking risks with more attractive men to the women wanting pregnancies with those men. We take risks to sleep with attractive partners for emotional as well as sexual reasons. We are not slaves to our instincts like newts or even dogs. We are largely cognitive creatures. We make decisions for an array of complex reasons. A man or a woman may take a risk to sleep with an attractive person while knowing that the consequences of pregnancy would be devastating for any number of complex, emotional and logical reasons that have nothing to do with the drive to reproduce.

You can safely assume sports have been around at least half that time.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sport   &gt; The history of sport probably extends as far back as the existence of people as purposive beings.     You can imagine people training in a game or a sport to hunt better.

By "believers" I mean uneducated, underemployed men who without religious fundamentalism would have to listen to their wives nag at them to go out and get a job.

184873	2	Diving isn't limited to soccer though, as you point out, and really doesn't happen all that often in soccer (maybe one or two incidents tops per match).    It is definitely something that taints the game, though, and of course not everyone has to like the game. It seems though that soccer brings feelings of animosity out of the average American as opposed to, say, feelings of disinterest.

625321	5	&gt;Barely a month before the 9/11 terror attacks, two Pakistani nuclear scientists, said to be close to disgraced Abdul Qadeer Khan, met up with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and offered to supply him with atomic weapons.    [citation needed]    &gt;haudiri Abdul Majeed and Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, who held a series of senior posts in Pakistani nuke programme, went to Taliban headquarters in Kandahar in mid-August 2001 and spent three days with bin Laden who was keen on acquiring weapons of mass destruction. In fact, Mahmood was said to be more close to Khan, the 'Father of the Islamic bomb' and the mastermind behind a vast clandestine enterprise which sold nuclear secrets to rogue states like Iran, North Korea and Libya.    [multiple citations needed]    &gt;He also set up the pilot plant for Pakistan's uranium-enrichment programme. However, the so-called deal did not materialise as the meeting between the Pakistani nuclear scientists and bin Laden ended inconclusively when the al-Qaeda leader, along with some of his senior associates, had abruptly left for the mountains of northwestern Afghanistan.    [citation needed]    &gt;The Man From Pakistan -- the true story of the world's most dangerous nuclear smuggler AQ Khan -- before leaving, bin Laden had told his followers that "SOMETHING GREAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, and Muslims around the world were going to join them in the holy war".    [citation needed]    &gt;What's more revealing is that a year before they met bin Laden in Kandahar, the two Pakistani nuke scientists had set up a non-profit organisation, Ummah Tameer-e-Nau, to carry out relief work in Afghanistan, including advising the Taliban on scientific matters. And, on the board of the organisation were several Pakistani Army generals sympathetic to the Taliban cause, and it was one of the few non-government groups that the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, had allowed to operate in Afghanistan.    [multiple citations needed]    &gt;not long after opening their office in a house in Kabul, the scientists met with Mullah Omar and bin Laden, and the conversation had shifted from relief work to weapons development.    [citation needed]    &gt;At one point, during his visits to Afghanistan, Mahmood provided Osama bin Laden's associates in Kabul with information about the construction of a nuclear weapon.    [citation needed]    &gt;Khan, who had subsequently admitted to passing on nuke secrets to other countries    [citation needed]    &gt;However, Khan's loose-knit organisation was and still may be a nuclear Wal-Mart, selling weapons blueprints, parts, and the expertise to assemble the works into a do-it-yourself bomb kit.

I only say this because looking through Ben Goertzel's publications, most of them from the last couple years come from a new conference specifically about "General Artificial Intelligence" and other less traditional venues. The sort of traditional generic AI research venues for publication are AAAI and IJCAI, and they have some publications from workshops / symposiums associated with these conferences, but I didn't see any main conference articles. This is of course not to say they don't know what they're talking about, just their work is being presented somewhat separate from the usual AI research.

Leaving me dumfounded, looking around helplessly and finally running towards an alleyway and stopping to find myself in the south-west side of Paris. Where they can mug you and rape you simultaneously and none would be the wiser.
433486	1	Java is easy. It may be a bit annoying to get used to just writing "public static void main(String[] args)", but that's pretty much everything you need to be able to write by heart. You don't really need to understand why you write it.        Object Orientation is a bit more difficult, but you can program in Java without using it if you want to.        I personally learned Java as the first language at my university and it was a learning process, of course. I didn't pick everything up at once, but I remembered enough. The same thing happened when I later was taught C.        I originally began programming a bit when I was younger (about 5-10 years before I began on the university). At that time I used GW Basic. Now that was a terrible language to learn programming in (it was simple, but gave you some seriously weird ideas of how to program).        Java is fine. It may not be a great teaching language. But it's fine.         To be honest, it sounds more like you didn't get a proper and basic introduction to Java.        And for those that call Java a language for code monkeys: Bite me. I probably know more programming languages than you do, and *I* prefer Java.

726936	2	The CDS market was indeed Wall Street getting drunk. But who gave them all the cheap-credit liquor? As I wrote elsewhere:    &gt;The last two bubbles, like all bubbles, were caused by monetary expansion. In the 90s the Fed created so much extra money out of thin air that it drove interest rates extremely, artificially, and temporarily low. Investors responded by putting their money in dot-com stocks whose business models only involved profits in the far distant future. Only when credit is extremely cheap do such extremely-long-term profit models seem viable.    &gt;But central banks can't expand the money supply without pause forever without causing hyperinflation (or as establishment economists say, without "overheating"), so they slowed the expansion. This brought interest rates to a lower level, under which the extremely-long-term profit models of the dot-com stocks were no longer viable, so the value of those stocks crashed.    &gt;What was needed then was a recession during which assets were taken out of the hands of failing enterprises and revalued according to the more-realistic interest rate. Instead, so as to avoid any pain whatsoever, Bush-Greenspan turned on the money spigot, slashing interest rates to 1%. This time the extremely, artificially, and temporarily cheap credit was funneled by Wall Street, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac into housing, driving up home prices. Again, investors (including this time regular home buyers, commercial banks, and "conservative" investment banks), lulled into a false sense of security by the "Greenspan put" (the notion that expert central bank management had, as shown by the handling of the dot-com and 9-11 dips, mastered the business cycle) assumed the cheapness of credit (and resultant rise in house prices) was natural and somewhat permanent.    &gt;Of course it wasn't, and once the money spigot was turned down, interest rates went back up, mortgage holders went bust, home prices crashed, and this time the whole over-levereged American economy crashed too.    &gt;What is the government's answer to the current crisis which was caused by monetary expansion? More monetary expansion of course. A trillion here, a trillion there. Interest rates down to zero. This will only cause yet more misallocation of the tiny amount of wealth we haven't destroyed yet, and will likely result in a flight from a soon-to-be rapidly devaluing dollar. This flight will spiral into hyperinflation. The government will probably respond to THAT with price controls, which will only strangle production and lead to massive unemployment and poverty.
745916	1	In my experience on corporate consulting... i always insist that every new-bought batches of rigs *should include an installation of Drive Image XML* (aka: DiX; FREE for private use) *&amp; set aside an empty partition on the last portion of the drive for backup purpose* (usually 60% equivalent capacity of drive C: on the same target rig).    Then do a fresh version of a custom-install, includes all winUpdates &amp; everything *except AV/AM installations*. Thereafter, deploy DiX &amp; use its backup features (*use 'Image Only' instead of 'Raw' mode*). When nasty infections immobilized the HDD, all you need to do is have your bootable PortaApps version of Dix bootup (may need to change your BIOS though) and use it to do a Dix-Restore of your backup image in your last partition into dir C: without deleting/formatting C's previous content (DiX would auto-do it for you).    Once restored, do a reboot (&amp; take off your bootable drive) and do the "sfc-scannow" procedure (using the original OS cd) *ASAP*. Thereafter, use the command line for a checkdisk procs (with -f -r variables) and subsequently reboot again.    The last step is to *check if your winUpdates were intact* (using qfeCheck util) &amp; update if hotfixes were missing.    For a C partition of 13Gb size that has been initially populated at 40%... the Dix procedures took &gt;15mins to complete. If checkDisk &amp; qfeChecks were done, add an additional 20mins. Your resulting recovery is exactly the same (sans AV/AM install, don't forget to re-install) as your initial fresh install!

Having said that, my point of view is that cutting edge math is rarely required for most scientific study. If any stream of math becomes important enough for other people to know about, people write readable books about it. For example, this is happening with statistical inference, machine learning and data mining now.

Chevrie, it's a workhorse cheese. Mix with toasted almond slivers and chopped dried fruit, it makes a gorgeous dessert. (Or put it in a slice of bread almost completely cut through and then make french toast with it.) Mix with chopped fresh chili pepper and roll in chili powder. Top a ball or log of it in chutney or jalapeno jelly.     Try that Danish Blue with some fresh roasted nuts- I like blue with still-warm almonds, but pecans and walnuts are good too.    Wrap your Brie in phyllo or puff pastry, bake it and drizzle in honey. Add sliced strawberries on top and serve with bread/crackers. This is good underwear remover, where I'm from.
