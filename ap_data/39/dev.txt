sing to you loud and i can't no i wont hush i'll say the words that make you blush i'm gonna sing this now see i'm true my songs are where my heart is i'm like glue i stick to other artists i'm not you now that would be disastrous let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures see i'm real i do it all it's all me i'm not fake don't ever call me lazy i won't stay put give me the chance to be free suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me   cause you need me i don't need you you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you at all you need me man i don't need you

didn't go to brit school i came fast with the way i act right i can't last if i'm smoking on a crack pipe and i won't be a product of my genre my mind will always be stronger than my songs are never

when some fella filmed me a young singerwriter like a gabriella cilmi   cause you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you at all you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you at all you need me   all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it not to abuse it and get affected infected with the who's who of music who did it who is it who's in it or what the hell does it matter chitter chatter don't matter what a yidder yidder yadder it don't matter to me all i want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely to be me in this seedy needy world can you hear me hey so i keep singing that when i first started this rapping shit i

motive moves i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine cause real recognise real is what my father says and i'll be sticking to this phrase until i pass away overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow but i'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close  you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need
