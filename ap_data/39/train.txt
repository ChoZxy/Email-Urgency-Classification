plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signs of a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paper weight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i

your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryin' act like jack black when i bring it to school i make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song since they are claiming i handled it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i have it

putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinth can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take

907	3	spoken monologue when i was younger i was at some point born i grew in both iq and eq and as that happened i discovered that i was living in two realities at once they fought all the time and yet i made space for both of them for a reason i can't explain one reality i experienced was my earth reality the day today painting of what i was taught was my natural state in life at the time i also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my earth reality at all times a vision where i perform my thoughts for the world a world where i mattered in a different way a world where i was valued for different things and in this world i was kind and that kindness spread through people through sound this was the birth of chromatica  love is an element on chromatica like earth wind fire water it's a natural force and it's the only way that i can organize this super organism that is the earth it's by making it one whole thing where time and linear structure don't matter they don't exist we are all love i am love so it's everything around us it's how we work it's the thing we both initiate and respond to it's why everything happens both good and bad it's the only way that i can make things simple and why shouldn't it be simple i breathe in and out love i don't believe it to be a choice other than i choose to breathe that is chromatica it is how i do hard things it's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life no one thing is greater than another kindness rules all things it simply is and it's mine you can have it too though my best friend says sharing is caring but we both know that i don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care  the manifesto of chromatica it's neverending i cannot finish it here it would be declaring i would never make music or be lady gaga again which would mean i would stop being myself this manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life one where i acknowledge that sound is my life force and that lady gaga is the mystery that carries it chromatica can't end it's how i make sense of things that's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is and for what is worth i think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd

360	3	drake talking yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen   drake i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this i'm kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right uh ya man it's what it is   drake and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on 'em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i'm still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  4 drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face the breast the bras the toes i'm still  and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  voice strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and

I've had too much to drink tonight and I know it's sad, but this is what I think about And I wake up in the middle of the night it's like I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?
