564	real	I secretly want to die so I don't have to be in pain every day and possibly having the chance to be reborn as a human in my next life. [End Title]: I'm a disgusting mutant. I have something that's really rare, about 1 in 400,000, called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome or EDS. It's the reason most of my life has been in hospital. I've now got worsening joint pain and CSF leak symptoms and because of EDS, there's a chance my CSF leak symptoms will not be able to be repaired because my connective tissue holding my brain fluid in is completely fucked, and I'm already having signs of brainstem inflammation like muscle jerks and spasms all day every day, very loud hissing noise coming from my head, stabbing head pains, and I can't even fucking think straight anymore. The muscle twitches feel like I'm having electric shocks all over my body, they aren't exactly painless. They happen everywhere including my tongue, eyelids, butt, everything. My CSF leak symptoms are becoming more chronic which means the ONLY thing that makes me feel better (lying down), no longer helps as much. So I have no break anymore. My heart rate is haywire, some days I literally cannot get up out of bed because my heart will go so fast I pass out and throw up.   I can't remember how to pay bills, how to use a washing machine, I can't learn anything new because my memory is gone, I'm not sleeping I have to take the strongest legal sedatives to get to sleep and I'm becoming highly tolerant to them, my symptoms just keep getting worse, my parents say my mental ability is like someone with dementia now because I'm getting confused at simple things like making a cup of tea, and I'm waking up with aching joints all over and walking with a limp right now because the joint in my hip and knee are fucked. I'm only 26 years old I don't think I want another 60 odd years of this shit. Nothing feels real to me anymore, it feels like a bad dream.  A common cause of death in EDS is when your aorta suddenly without warning, tears open. I already had a stroke when I was 13 due to EDS but I hope while I'm asleep my aorta busts open and I peacefully bleed to death. Or I get killed in a drive by shooting while I try to walk to the store 10 minutes away so I can get some comfort food to try and make me feel less like shit and like I'm being tortured every literal second. Food and drugs are literally the only thing that makes me temporarily feel better.  I'm tired of being a fucking burden to my family, they've already literally disowned me because they think I'm useless and because of my disability, my family hates me except for my mother, my dad and my brother. I feel disgusting because I can't physically do much at all, I'm in bed most of the day, I have no job but I would love to work. I believe in reincarnation and hope next time I won't be born as some genetic freak who can't even reproduce.  I'm so jealous of humans with your normal collagen, you all take being able to relax and not going to the ER every year because you feel like losing it for granted, for fucks sake I know it sounds awful but if you gave me a plate of human collagen I'd eat that shit like a starving person if it even made me have a 1% chance of feeling better.  If I were a dog or cat I would of been put down out of sympathy a long time ago. Why can't I sign myself up to be executed?
93	real	what am i supossed to feel? [End Title]: how am i supossed to act? am i supposed to be sad?   my grandmother passed away a little while ago so me and my brother went to stay with our dad for a little while. Ever since i got back i've been so confused.   i often don't feel anything besides pain, guilt, and regret. i'm happy sometimes, but not often  lately i've been thinking about my grandmother, how she was always happy, how she really enjoyed doing puzzles and she would get annoyed with me when i was younger because i always wanted to help her.  me and my brother would stay with her for weeks while we waited for our dad to come home from work, she would always take care of us.  as we got older we stopped visiting as much, we didn't really keep in touch much either  i missed out on 2 weeks of school to see her when she was in the hospital, she kinda just layed there sleeping all day and all night.  i would cuddle up next to her sometimes when i got tired, she was so warm and she would move her hands sometimes to let us know that she was still with us  me and my step moms daughter slept at my dads aunts house while my brother and step moms other daughter stayed with my aunt that lived in the next town  my dad and step mom stayed in the hospital with her one night, i didn't think anything of it until i woke up the next morning and my dad was curled up in bed next to me and my step mom was standing over me  i knew something was up so i kept asking "whats going on". that's when they told me she had passed.  it felt like i had gotten hit by a bus, i couldn't cry, i couldn't move, all i could do was sit there and pretend i didn't hear them.  &amp;#x200B;  for a while it felt like everything was fine, until now.  it's been a couple weeks and everything's settling in again  it's finally hitting me that she's actually gone and i feel absolutely shattered  i've been trying to keep my mind of it but whatever i do kinda makes it worse  what the fuck am i supossed to feel now?  why'd you have to leave us so early nan?  i miss you so much please come home. i miss you so much, and pops hurting really bad  please come back nan, i need you
185	fake	I missed my fucking cake day [End Title]: I literally go on reddit basically every day but the one day I shouldve been on and posted somewhere so somebody could be like "happy cake day!!" and I could say "thanks! 😊" I was watching some softcore porn ass anime and playing leauge..   ..god damn it
598	real	scared for the future [End Title]: I'm 20 and I feel really behind in life I don't have my drivers license or permit and no job no friends and I stay in the house most of the time having nothing to do on top of that I feel like I'm just immature and want to be better but I don't know where to start and I don't think the future is gonna look better for me I'm scared I'm gonna be the same person forever and end up trapped in this house I want to see the outside world I just don't know what to do.
563	real	Even Though We Live Together, I Miss My Fiance [End Title]: We both work nights, at the same place, but on different keys. I work his days off and visa versa. We've blown through a lot of our sick time just so we could spend time together. We've begged out job to put us on the same key. Nothing has happened.  I miss going on dates. I miss seeing him for more than a couple hours before we go to bed. I miss having sex, because we are typically too exhausted after our 12-16 hour shifts to have sex.  I want to go places with him. I want to have movie and tv show nights. I want to cook together and lay in bed together without having to go to sleep.  I just.... miss him so fucking much. Even though we live together.
181	real	Don't stay in school kids, learn a trade after highschool or go to tech school [End Title]: I have a master's degree and I make $11.50/hr part time, no benefits. This is all I could get after a 2 1/2 year unemployment with no benefits.   I regularly pick up trash outside and do janitorial services as a part of my duties.  Meanwhile my husband with a high school diploma is likely to make six figures in the next couple years.   Learn a trade kids, teach yourself a skill or learn a trade. School is for fools.
650	real	I'm scared of roaches and today I've never felt more calm [End Title]: Let me begin with saying even some of my friends often find it weird I fear roaches, since when I was little I used to play with giant ones all the time. But I just don't remember how or why I started to fear them. I always used to have a fear of spiders but roaches? I'm not exactly sure why I fear them. Is it because they look gross and creepy crawly?   No I actually love those types of things and I don't really detest other bugs for sharing similar qualities, so why just roaches?  I myself found it weird and still do. But why am I using past tense?  I grew not out but away from that fear when I thought of it maybe a little differently. Will they harm me? Are they often known to hide in places I find safe? Just how much do I hate them? What do they look like again?  Then it happened, one day I looked in horror as a giant roach landed upon my pillow. It stayed there for a while and I just watched. Frozen in my tracks. But as I watched, I closely studied it. It looked like a less efficient beetle by that I mean, it looked defenseless. It was and odd sight to see my own reflection in the mirror close to my bed. It showed me, and something I'd been afraid of since I was little.  And all I felt was relaxed. I never felt more calm. But why? Well seeing it closely made me realize.  THAT FUCKERS ALIVE.  I had forgotten after all this time it's just a living being. It also lives it dies and it moves around. It's just like a beetle I love beetles so why do I hate roaches? Then it clicked, I just didn't fear them anymore. I just treat it how everything breathing should be treated? Like it's also alive and I guess that stopped me from fearing them.  So thanks for reading this I feel a lot better sharing this. And I hope you have a lovely existence stranger.
235	real	I don't know how to set boundaries [End Title]: These boundaries that I have to set are only to please my family and not disappoint them.  It's even more exhausting because when I plan things with new people, I get excited. I forget about family and that they wouldn't allow it. It's worse after promising the other person that I will be going out with them, I don't know how to cancel or how to tell them know.  I basically live according to my family's rules. It's harder when even my ONLY friend doesn't have the same mentality as me, I don't know who to go to. It's so exhausting.
28	real	I am finally deactivating and quitting Twitter for good. [End Title]: Probably some of you wouldn’t care but this decision is huge for me.   Twitter is really toxic. I used to be in the stan side of it. I can’t deny that I’ve met amazing people there that made my days. But at the same time, I couldn’t express my opinions nor ask *embarrassing* questions without fearing that I would get "cancelled".   Twitter has been a really toxic app for me. Everytime I wake up I always fear that someone unfollowed me or blocked me or even hates me which made me really uncomfortable and worried alot. It made me get opssessed with numbers so much.   I always got sad when my tweets don’t get enough likes or replies even tho it says that people saw it... I feel ignored which I hate that feeling the most.   I always told myself that once I get 1000 followers, I would be the happiest person alive, that I wouldn’t care about numbers anymore but nope... I still cared.   And lets not start about the drama and why Twitter is in my opinion a toxic place. Of course, we see now alot of people canceling people and even FICTIONAL CHARACTERS for a joke of a reason. **a minor spoiler for The Mandalorian season 2** THEY CANCELED BABY MF YODA FOR EATING THE DAMN FROG EGGS. A DAMN FICTIONAL CHILD.    If you read the whole thing.. from the bottom of my heart thank you so much for not ignoring me. Reddit is now my home and I am not scared to share my opinions fearing for people coming at me instead of correcting me and educating me like actual mature people.    In conclusion; Twitter was toxic for me mentally and I am happy and proud of myself to take this decision of deactivating which leads to deleting the account.
614	real	Struggling with pregnancy and relationships [End Title]: My best friend is talking to me about her friends pregnancy because my best friend had a miscarriage a few days ago and doesn’t want to speak negatively about pregnancy to her friend.   i desperately want kids. i want a family. but i didn’t have a period from age 12-20 so it’s uncertain if i’ll have any issues/if i will be able to conceive. it’s hard to speak about them to her because her issues with fertility are due to a medical condition, mine was anorexia so my issues are self inflicted.   my boyfriend has children his ex will not let him see. we are saving to go to court. i am unsure if he wants any more kids and i can’t speak to him about this because he doesn’t know if he’ll get to ever even see his children, let alone be even in the same room as them again. how can i ask again if in the future we will have them when his children can’t hug him right now and we don’t know when we’ll have the money to start fighting.   i am tired of having to be the offload station for everyone’s baby issues when i have no one, when it feels like i have no one, of hearing about everybody else’s experiences when i’ll never get to have my own
469	real	I have a love/hate relationship with my sister [End Title]: I love my sister, I really do. We’ve had a rough relationship growing up, her being the tormenting big sister and me eating up the torment she fed me. But I know that she loves me and I know that’s not ever gonna change, but she’s a hard one to love. She’s diagnosed with anorexia-bulimia, paranoid schizophrenic disorder and BPD. She went through and might still be going through an opioid addiction problem, has tried to kill herself a few times now, by drinking a bottle of vodka, slitting her wrists and ODing with pills. She’s in counseling and has been for a while now but obviously she’s not being completely open with her therapist which I sort of understand from her point. She gets very aggressive with me and my mom when we try to help, she constantly threatens to kill herself again and at this point we don’t know if she’s just crying wolf so it’s frustrating and hard to deal with. We both love her and support her to get help just about everyday but it’s in one ear and out the other. I’ve lost my temper out of sadness on her before and it makes me feel like a piece of shit but I don’t know how else to deal with all of this, especially since it’s been going on since I was a little kid and couldn’t even comprehend what was going on. It hurts to sit back and watch her killing herself but I’m lost. My mom is lost. She’s lost. I love her with my whole being but the love gets lost with the frustration. Please understand I don’t hate her for anything she does, really. I’m sorry for her and I’m sorry I can barely put a dent in helping her. I’m frustrated and sad.
339	real	batchelorette party anxieties [End Title]: So this is kinda stupid, but my sister is getting married, and we're doing a bachelorette party. Originally we were going to do a Disney trip, which- I don't like roller coasters but whatever, it's Disney. I could hang out in most of the line, then go shopping while they do the actual ride or something. Due to Covid however, we are doing more of a traditional party and a spa weekend. I am so awkward at parties. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't want to take care of drunk people. On top of that part of the reason I was looking forward to the Disney thing *because* there would be no or any of that stuff I also hate. The worst was going to be having to wear a shirt that said, "bridesmaid b-words" or something similarly stupid. Still not my taste, but whatever, I'm not the bride. I'm just here to make her happy.  Now I'm feeling more and more anxiety as this thing draws near: worrying about the fact I have diet restrictions and the food everyone wants are not things I can eat. Worrying that I'll be unable to hide my discomfort during the party games and make everyone else feel awkward. Wondering if there's a polite way to get out of certain parts of it. Example: the other girls want to buy the bride skimpy lingerie for a laugh. I will not buy my little sister lingerie. I can't. I physically can't.  Now I'm worried about being a wet blanket at the party by setting boundaries/being honest about how I feel here or just being uncomfortable and not enjoying myself at all because the weekend isn't about me, an I don't want to make it so. UUUUUrgh.  If I ever get in a relationship and make it to the point of marriage this whole thing has just convinced me even more to forgo all the traditional wedding stuff for myself and just have a small party with some friends and immediate family.
627	real	Just graduated college and depressed because it seems all of my colleagues are doing well except me [End Title]: I just graduated this year, studied bio pharmaceutical chemist, was gonna work on a thesis and projects but because of the pandemic I couldn't go through. When I see my colleagues fb pictures they already have a job or currently working at a hospital or clinic. And I still work at my parent's store. Makes me feel like a failure since they also compare me with other graduates. Sometimes I don't even know what to do and feel stuck. Anyways thanks for reading me.
805	real	I am 20 years old and I feel like there is no hope for my future [End Title]: This is surprisingly hard to articulate and I have a feeling it will turn out way longer than intended but here we go.   Despite the fact that I am 20, have multiple jobs, and will graduate college next year, I feel like my future is doomed. My entire life has been and continues to be a constant struggle to follow my parents' rules and stay sane. My dad's always been quite laid back and relatively easier to communicate with, unlike my mom. He usually just listens to her and sides with her on everything because he loves her.   My relationship with my mother is basically the catalyst of my rapidly deteriorating mental health and will to live. She is a thoroughly depressed woman with an incredibly strong personality. She's the main provider of the family because my father cannot find a permanent well-paying job (we live in a relatively poor country with a fucked up economy). Her burden is big and she's carrying it as gracefully as one can. I also want to mention that she loves me. She's proud of my achievements and supportive of my failures.   I'm really sad all the time. My parents have always treated me like the girl in a conservative country that I am. I'm not allowed to be outside for more than 3 hours and need to be home by 10 pm, always. I get 20 calls every day, verifying where I am and who I'm with. I've never been to a sleepover or a party or a concert before. I'm always the first to leave for home whenever I'm hanging out with friends. I've been hiding the tattoo behind my ear for over a year now (successfully, thank god). I can't travel to a really close neighboring country with a friend for the summer, with the money that I have collected from my jobs. I can't wear certain things and I can't go to certain places and I can't do certain things and I just can't be me.   I've tried telling my parents how I feel about this but it always turns into an argument. "You're selfish," "you're the worst daughter a mother could have," "you're young and stupid," "you're ungrateful," "what did I ever do to you," "why are you punishing me," "why can't you just listen to me," and my personal favorite "I don't care what you want. you do what I say. life isn't about the things you want, get used to it."   I don't have any social skills. I used to be really outgoing and had many friends and loved writing and reading and had so many dreams. Now that I'm older I'm none of those things. I wasn't allowed to choose my own major so I'm studying what my mom wanted me to. I never write anymore and rarely read. I've isolated myself from all my friends. I feel incredibly lonely and sad all the time. The only person I can go to is my boyfriend who's my guardian angel. He's helping me stay sane. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere to a point where I didn't develop any social skills and got terrible anxiety. I was so scared of arguments and confrontation and mean words that I stopped asking my parents for permission to go to places. Instead, I just stopped wanting to go. I have no motivation to do anything or be anyone. My only desire in life is to move out but I'm scared of it. My parents won't accept it unless I get married to my boyfriend. But I don't want to get married. I just don't. But I'll have to do it just to get away from this place, just to stop pretending to be happy so they don't get pissed at me for being sad and stop trying to predict their mood and be yelled at all the time for existing. I will, once again, be forced to make a very important decision (marriage) just because my parents want it, to be able to get away and get a life. I'm 20. I've wasted away half of my youth. I feel so hopeless.   &amp;#x200B;  tl;dr I'm from a conservative country where I'm basically not allowed to have a life as a girl. I've grown into an antisocial, sad person who wants nothing but to die. I won't be allowed to move out on my own conditions. I'll probably have to marry my boyfriend just to please my parents even though I don't believe in marriage. I'll always have to live the way my parents want me to and I'll always be sad.
638	real	I (22F) just found out my ex (23M) lied to me. And suddenly whatever little bit of positive feelings I had towards him are officially gone. [End Title]: I don’t know why I’m surprised! I value honesty and loyalty when it comes to my everyday life and relationships. When my ex broke up with me (after a whirlwind of BS he put me through) he told me that he was sorry gaming got in the way of our relationship and he told me he sold his computer. FUNNY ENOUGH, I was going through Discord and found out he never sold his computer. SO, now that I know he lied to my face (LOOOOVE THAT) I feel nothing but sadness for him. Because he lied to the person who never lied to him and wanted him to have everything. So, thank you for showing me who you truly are. I can’t get caught up in “what else did he lie to me about” because at this point, I really don’t care. I ended up meeting a guy who I really like (33M) who treats me so well it shocks me. Good Luck to my ex, who walked out on true love! I’ll make sure the door doesn’t hit you on the way out! 😘
553	real	Fast food work is so shitty. [End Title]: The title pretty much sums it up. I’m (18M) a carhop at sonic, and the only reasons why I haven’t quit are because my boyfriend doesn’t want me to and I know once college comes I’ll be happy I saved up some summer money.  It’s a fuck ton of work. Not brain work, but I have to keep up with a bunch of orders, take out food, make sure all the orders are correct, deal with taking orders, fix orders, I’m walking back and forth from stalls (which is a good thing losing weight wise except for when someone from stall 9 sends me back and forth 4 times and doesn’t give me a tip).  Not to mention shitty customers and coworkers/bosses.  And the time it take as well sucks. I want to study. I fucking *love* to learn. Over here I’m working, I’m not testing my brain, I’m just getting my patience tested.  I’m miserable every minute until I get my tips at the end of the day (I average 50 a night, but sometimes it’s more or less).  Christ I wish money didn’t matter. I’m so ready to go to college like damn someone save me.
551	real	My old girlfriend killed someone for me [End Title]: Yep... you read that right. And no, I didn't ask her to do it.  I don't call her my ex girlfriend because we never truly broke up, and both of us are polyamorous, so I just say "old girlfriend" or "girlfriend" just very loosely. Anyways, last fall was a very weird time for me - had some mental health troubles, and just some weird things happened to me, none of these having to do with my girlfriend. We hung out on Halloween at a party, and me being the over-protective, slightly paranoid person that I was that night, I kept trying to get her to sober up and not act crazy, because she was VERY drunk and tripping acid when I saw her at the party. Anyways, she ended up getting mad at me trying to control her, and asked me to take her home. I did, and we ended up chatting and catching up, since it had been a bit since I had seen her.  She ended up going on a rant saying how much she had done for me and my old roommate. I remembered a few months before she had called me and told me that my roommate had relapsed on meth, which is why he was sleeping so much at the time and couldn't keep a job/pay rent. She told me that she blacklisted him from some dealers she knew, telling them to not sell to him to help get him clean. A little after this, my roommate and I saw evidence of someone trying to break into our cars in our driveway, because the doors looked like they had been attempted to be pried open, with no luck. Whoever it was also keyed my car. Got some footage from a neighbor's surveillance camera, and saw a car that looked like one of my roommate's old friends. I told her what had happened a while ago, and she brought this up and talked about how she "took care of them." I asked her what the fuck she meant.  She then tells me that she had killed my roommates old friend, we'll call him Dylan, because he was going to do something to me to hurt me. She didn't tell me what Dylan was going to do, just that it was bad and that she wanted to protect me. I was so stunned, and didn't really know what to say. I had never asked her to kill him, and was confused as to why and how she did it. She then went on to say that she loved me and wanted to protect me. I was honestly in a weird headspace that night, so I didn't ask too many questions, and tried to forget about it. I remember seeing something a few weeks after that basically said that Dylan had been missing for \_\_ days and if anyone knew anything, to call the hotline. I didn't do that, of course, because I had promised my girlfriend that I would not tell anyone. I also didn't want to get involved with the feds or police. The only other things that I know about his murder is that his body (or pieces of his body) are out of state and haven't been found by authorities. I now live in a different town away from her and hardly keep up, but the only other person that knows about this is my old roommate who knew him. All I knew about Dylan is that he was good at cars, was possibly in the middle of moving to the area when everything happened, and was a dealer.  I needed to get this story off of my chest, because only one other person knows what happened. I've never had someone try and kill someone for me or even hurt someone for me, so dealing with the guilt has been a little difficult. To this day I haven't told anyone else, and I refuse to go to the cops about it. I still have no idea how she killed him or how she even got away with it. I've never hurt anyone, or even gotten in a fight with anyone, so all of this is super jarring to me. I barely even knew Dylan - he had been in my house maybe 2 times.  Anyways, thanks for reading. There's some messed up people in this world, and just remember no one around you is immune to doing bad things.
1	real	I hate myself so much it’s destroying me [End Title]: I hate myself in every way. I make mistakes all the time and I always beat myself up over them (sometimes physically). I mess up everything. I look so long to complete a task at work that they sent another worker to help hurry me along. I was messaging a girl I met on a dating app and suggested that we meet somewhere to eat and she’s ignored me all day. When I told my team lead at work how long it would take me to complete a task he said “Is it seriously going to take you an HOUR so just put up three boxes?” I almost killed myself today. I beat myself over the head and pulled my hair out. I’m not ok. I am God’s mistake.
354	real	I'm expected to know when my husband's meetings are but he does not reciprocate [End Title]: This is kind of petty but I'm frustrated.  My husband and I have been working from home for the past 6 weeks, for obvious reasons. Unfortunately we're stuck in a 1 bedroom condo until the end of May so working separately and taking meetings has been a bit challenging, but manageable.  We both have a daily standup meeting at the same time every day - his is at 9:30 and mine is at 12:45. I know and remember when his meeting is, and I take care to not interrupt him. Heaven forbid I fucking interrupt him!  But he does not ever remember when mine is. I tend to be out working in the kitchen and he'll be in the bedroom, and he'll decide it's the perfect time to come and get some lunch. It's at noon hour which is annoying I'll give him that, but seriously it's been 6 weeks!  Just right now he was hanging out in the living room on lunch break before my standup for a change. I told him I had my standup soon and another meeting right at 1, so I asked him if he minded I take over the bedroom since he was in my usual working space.  He responded by saying he also has a meeting at 1. I was like.. OK? Take it out here then? I tried reiterating that I had standup and then another meeting at 1, and if he was out here for those 15 minutes before his 1 o'clock meeting, I didn't want to take my calls if he was right there so I should go to the bedroom. He _still_ didn't get it and said he had a meeting at 1 anyway so what was _my_ problem?  Finally I spelled it out for him saying my standup was at 12:45, like it is every day, _then_ I have another meeting at 1.  It would just be nice to not have always remind him of this, especially when I feel like I'm walking on eggshells to avoid his.
896	real	A girl I was sort of dating said I was the worst person she ever met and I just felt relieved? [End Title]: Basically, I had asked if she wanted to do something over the weekend. See a movie or something, it wasn't really established as she was taking a really long time to reply, but eh, we've all been there so its fine. Anyway the next morning I wake up feeling just terrible, like I felt like I was dying, people said I looked pale n stuff even. (I got some stomach bug and was out for like 2 days, still sort of recovering.) After getting some more sleep I text her saying sorry I cant do anything after all I woke up feeling crappy, and after several more hours of no reply she just texts me back saying that "Ur the worst person I've ever met" and I'm just like wow. That's pretty rough. I responded back that it was a hurtful thing to say and I'm sorry you think that but I'm literally in bed like dying, so, sorry? Haven't heard back since.  But like I said I'm honestly just relieved, I only dated her for a little while and there were a few little red flags already sprouting up, seeing such a big reaction to what I thought was just a slight inconvenience really made it easy to just let her go. I mean, maybe there was something more to it I might have been missing, I'm not entirely sure. But I at least thought that was a pretty big accusation to make so early on. Oh well, my single life goes on, I guess.
365	real	I think my mother abused me [End Title]: My mother in general is a miserable person but after a large argument with my boyfriend I think I realize how much abuse I've been through. Growing up was total hell since day one and it hasn't gotten any easier. What do I do? If I move out then I'm betraying the family and will excommunicated. Sorry for causing people to worry but I'm terrified if she or any other adult in the house finding this post  Edit: like a moron I forgot to say it's nothing physical but her attitude and actions towards me. I do believe I'm one of the reasons why she's miserable but I'm not sure anymore.
496	real	I'm being used and I'm sick of it [End Title]: I've been working well over 40 hours per week since we got married 22 years ago and she's refused to get a job nearly the entire time. Now our 5 boys are 18-21 and live at home playing video games all day every day. She tells everybody she's a writer, but all she does is sleep all day and all night on the couch. I'm out of work on disability after my MS doctor said my MS symptoms are actually anxiety and depression. My bipolar disorder is getting out of control. I love her. I feel like I shouldn't but I can't help myself. I know I'm being used, she refuses all emotional and physical intimacy. Hugs make her uncomfortable, we haven't kissed in 15 years. She won't talk to me but she'll complain to her friends about me.  I've been nothing but loving and supportive and encouraging to her our entire marriage. But every time I express an emotion, she says I'm giving her a panic attack. There's never been any abuse at all by me toward her, just pleading. But she claims I caused her PTSD. Not her abusive father or the sexual abuse she suffered as a child. No, it's me. Because I value rational thinking and she says being rational is my style of thinking but it's wrong of me to expect her to be rational. She says making decisions based on how you feel is actually the normal way to live. 22 years of marriage, sole income earner, 5 special needs adult children, mortgage, one car - I can't be the asshole and leave, I can't kick her out, and she's so manipulative she makes it so nobody believes me whenever I try to explain she's basically abusing me.

516	real	Honestly? I love making pornographic content. [End Title]: Not sure why sex or porn is a taboo. Honestly loved making porn the other night because it made me feel more empowered. It's like... business. Knowing you have that control over yourself and also the ability to help others feel more accepted with any kind of sexuality. Being an open and free spirit does help, but let's just say I would rather be doing this all my life than what I'm actually going to school for.
856	real	Acid pizza bonk [End Title]: I remembered this incident ever so clearly as me and my girlfriend were eating pizza. A while back we had gotten our hands on some acid and we were about to take our first half a tab. Everything was going really swell and then the drop came. It was confusing as shit and I couldn’t tell right from reason and I had SO MUCH ENERGY. I usually cannot stop moving around and this was just amplified while I was tripping. We were chilling and then we decided to order some pizza. Everything was going fine until the pizza guy came. Well actually for some reason there were two pizza guys that came to the door, I swear it wasn’t me tripping. I’m 1000% sure they knew we were fucked up because our eyes were huge and I was struggling so hard to keep it together. So as we’re paying I go to grab the box while my girlfriend is signing the receipt. This was a fatal error on my part as I decided on my acid brain the best way to maneuver this pizza is overhead. From the pizza men’s perspective they watched a really fucked guy try to hoist this pizza overhead and whack his girlfriend straight in the dome with the box. We just stare at each other after and she shuts the door super quick and tells me never to speak of it again. I could not hold this story in however as it makes me laugh.   TL;DR Tried to get pizza inside while on acid which lead to girlfriend with a bopped noggin
567	real	I finally passed my math class! [End Title]: I know this isn't a huge deal or anything. Its just a math class that I need to pass to transfer but I've tried taking it twice before and failed both times. I'm not even bad at math, it's just tedious work that I never had the motivation to do. And this year has obviously been a shit show because of *gestures broadly* so it just feels great that I finally did it and got past whatever mental block I had, even with the added struggles of this year. I passed that shit. I got a mothafuckin B and now I can take the last 2 classes I need to get my AA and transfer. Just had to get that off my chest. I'm gonna roll myself a celebratory blunt and get a good night's sleep now.

I purposefully got into healthcare admin because most healthcare places have no-perfume policies. Everyone f***ing slathers themselves in their favorite ho-stank all around me anyway. I am SO GD sick of tattling to HR. I am so GD tired of being in pain.  Fuck you and your personal favorite reek.
373	real	HELP! In love with my best guy friend of 8 years [End Title]: I desperately need advice. Warning long post ahead.  Backstory:  Met this boy freshman year of highschool and we dated for 3 months. My first relationship and first kiss. We stayed friends on Facebook throughout the next few years even though we both got into serious relationships. Fast forward about 6 years. We are both in college and I have just made really close friends with a girl who just happens to be close friends with him. I’m now newly single but he isn’t. I still have feeling for him but I always respected boundaries and I really thought he and his now ex would get married. Now we are all in the same best friends group and we are super close. We talk daily, we go to dinner, he comes to my family events. I’m currently dating a new guy who cheats on me but that’s a different story. And he breaks up with his long time girl friend. I dated the new boy for almost a year and a half. Anyways the whole time this guy friend is confiding in my best friend about the feelings he has for me and how much better he would be for me than my current bf. He take me to dinner and drinks and confesses later via text how he wants me and that was that. I broke off my relationship that weekend. I then tell my guy friend my reasons as to why I broke off my relationship and it’s because I have really serious feelings for him. And his response is essentially that I just got out of a relationship and being a rebound would bite us both in the ass. Which I can respect but don’t act like for literal months you haven’t been saying you wanted me to be happy. Fast forward not even a month after saying how he didn’t want to jump into a relationship. We are now going on dates. Then dates in the coming weeks leads to us having sex multiple times. We still talk every single day. We still sleep together. We are currently on a trip and he’s laying in bed 2 feet from me. I love this stupid boy with my entire heart even though everyone doesn’t see why I still put up with him. I’m just at a loss. I don’t want to be with anyone else. The second I saw him in the 9th grade I knew there was going to be more to this story and he still gives me the most intense butterflies almost 8 years later. Before you say “just tell him how you feel” please understand that he is the type to shut down. It happened the last time I tried back at the beginning. I can’t bear to lose him but it is killing me to see him out with other girls while still having a “close” relationship with me. What do I do?
492	real	I’ve relapsed with my anorexia and I don’t want to get better [End Title]: I realize that this is part of the eating disorder. I’ve been in recovery for 8 years now but I’m in the worst relapse I’ve ever had. The problem is that I like the changes I see in my body.  I know this is how my ED started when I was 17. I know it’s a problem. But I don’t care.
57	real	I’m slowly losing my ability to walk due to my condition [End Title]: And idk how to deal with it, going on walks used to be my favourite thing to do to escape, and now I can’t even do that. I feel like I can’t do anything anymore and I’m just  existing
436	real	Don't leave without saying goodbye [End Title]: I feel so terrible. I wish you would text me at least once before you leave, but maybe you left already. The thought of leaving on such a bad note, hurts me.  I didn't want to talk anymore because after what happened, you just left me feeling like I was no longer anyone to you. But then you told me to stop messaging you too.  Maybe I  should tell you how I feel but I feel like you don't care. I am afraid to tell you anything because you overreact and get more emotional than I do. What would be the point of dragging you into this.  You deserve to be happy and I don't want to take that from you.  I hope you don't leave without saying goodbye
210	real	I am not crazy [End Title]: I will deactivate this account and delete this post a few days/weeks after this, because i do not want many people to see it nor get people ask me many stuff about what is happening. I do not feel like i need to explain more than what i'l write     Just a quick backstory:  Almost a year ago, around when the first wave in greece came and led us to a lockdown happened, i started being afraid of what was happening. I locked myself in my room, since i still was living with my parents back then. My mother and younger sibling were illegaly going outsdie with friends, and i was afraid they would catch the flu and infect me too. I was getting out when they were gone to make myself food or to go at the toilet and also refill my water bottles.  A few days after what happened, i started seeing black things/shadows at the corner of my eye. I thought it was maybe my eyebrow, or these green things at the corner of your eye that you have when you wake up from sleeping. Sometimes they were, i admit, but sometimes even if i was "brushing" my eyes i still had them again sometimes. Around 3 weeks has pasted, and now i feel more paranoid/afraid. Everytime i am at the computer or lay at my bed, i always have a feeling like something's behind me. Something like the sixth sense feeling when you know someone is too close at you. I tried ignoring it even though i was unconfortable with it. When i was talking with someone or was focusing on something else it was gone, so i assumed my brain was doing some mind games with me.   What i do not get is that these last weeks i see them moving when i try to look at them, and rarely i see figures. Sometimes i even hear random distorted sounds like screaming or someone calling for help. I was not believing in paranormal activity until now. I got scared enough i got outside of my room and called my parents for help. I never felt that scared ever in my life. When i tried showing them they were gone the moment we got inside the room. My parents told me to stop messing around and stop it. It happened again the night after that and they still refused to believe me. The dark things stopped happening for a few days, and when they came back they were either closer to me or bigger. I literally cried for help and shed tear of how scared i was. I even peed my pants from that. I runned to the apartment's balcony and hid in a locker we have at, but my parents found me. My mother screamed at me for waking them up and started screaming at me. I got back in my room and laid in my bed crying from what happened, and just close my eyes. My father woke me up after a few hours and asked me what really happened. I explained him what was happening, and even mentioned the things i saw when  i first encountered them and told him a few months ago. He acted like he cared or tried to feel me, but i knew he was thinking i was lying from his face. It was just not convining enough that felt like he didn't care or something and did it because he is my dad. My little brother was just calling me crazy and mocking me from what  was happening.  This is still happening at my new apartment. Now that greece has a mini-lockdown my dad tries to visit me at the house i moved at and still tries to convince me they are not real. He is buffling about random shit that it's my mind. He does not know what i see so he cannot believe me either. I just want some help from him to help me get rid of them but he just doesn't even try. I feel like there is no hope of someone helping me anymore. I just feel even more scared these things are gonna do something with me that i live alone. I am considering moving back with my parents just to feel a bit more safe.     I think i gave enough detail from what is happening, and i am not planning to post anything more with this account. I hope someone else has the same problem with me, so i can at least feel better knowing someone feels me
574	real	1 month clean of SH after 2 years [End Title]: 1 month is the longest I haven’t been SH, for the last two years — it has been on and off, maximum of a week and it is because i took pills to sleep, or I was out to distract myself.  Flashbacks, nightmares still happen now but resisted SH. But no pills taken recently. T taught me coping mechanism for quite a while and I only used them recently, T also constantly reminded me how SH is self sabotaging, and if I keep doing so, I will never get better. My T is suspicious that I haven’t been SH too, first few times in 2 years.   I WANT TO get better, I’m so tired of this. Either I get better or I leave this place, why not give a try before I choose the latter?  There is no place I can say this but I needed to get this off my chest
796	real	I'm so tired of my lower class (western) friends needing to bring up how poor they are [End Title]: I'm middle class American and I have friends who have grown up in poverty. It feels like at every moment they can, they need to squeeze in that they were on welfare as a kid and that they have $15 in their checking account. I don't care that you had to be on food stamps, or that you're so poor you can't afford clothes from the goodwill, and I don't get why you need to tell me this. Are you trying to make sure I don't take my average life for granted? Do you want my pity?   They seem to force their poverty into conversation constantly, almost as if they are bragging. They also have excuses for why they can't work. I just don't get it. It's even more annoying to me because while yes, I have grown up better off, they have never been homeless and have access to modern technology (all these friends in mind have consoles, PCs, and smart phones). Call me an asshole, but it's really getting on my nerves. Is this common or do I just have obnoxious friends?
531	real	My kittens death was my fault [End Title]: I haven't posted anything before, but I felt like I need to get this off of my chest (refer to the title lol). Earlier today I came home from a weekend trip with my family to take a tour of a nearby college, and came home to one of my 2 cats (they were brothers), lying behind the couch, dead. It was very sudden and unexpected,.  He was a gorgeous pure grey cat, with beautiful green eyes and just an amazing sassy personality. He hadn't even turned one yet. Their birthday was in around a month.   In the previous couple of weeks we noticed that Doodle (his name), was walking as little as possible, was a lot weaker, didn't come downstairs to eat or drink, didn't use the litterbox, etc... and we thought that he might have hurt himself while we were sleeping. My mom eventually decided to wait a couple of days before taking him to the vet because the fees near our area seemed unnecessary. A couple of days passed and he was doing a bit better, walking (albeit very slowly), eating, using the litterbox, etc. We thought that he was just healing on his own and decided to not take him to the vet.   A couple of weeks passed and he was doing okay, he was still walking pretty slowly, and didn't play and slept a bit more, but other than that he was eating and drinking fine and we thought he would recover with a little more time (me and my sister thought that we should take him in just incase, but our parents disagreed and were insistent on waiting it out more). That weekend we left for a trip to a college so my sister could look around (our friend in the neighborhood was caring for them once in the morning and the afternoon). When we came back, a few minutes passed before I heard my sister panicking, and lo and behold...he was dead. No-one around but my unknowing dog and his brother, his only goodbye being a goodbye pat before we left. (We suspect that it was kidney failure, since we had a couple of plants that are known to be poisonous to animals around the house, and we got rid of them a couple days before he got sick).  I've never been more devastated. This is the first time I've lost a pet, and the fact that this could have been prevented is killing me. I couldn't even tell him goodbye or that I loved him. He was so young. I wasn't there, and that's the thing that's killing me the most. Was he lonely? Was he scared? Was he disappointed or sad or angry or looking for us? Did he want us there? Was he comfortable? I'll never know, and now his brother is all alone. Has anyone else been through something similar? The guilt is crushing me. I loved that cat so darn much.
132	real	have your fun I am done [End Title]: This is the last straw. I feel so stupid for staying this long. After you I will need some serious therapy long term. Your friend sexually assaulted me, you stand by him. That’s disgusting, now I know your true feelings. You don’t care, you never have. It is just convenient for you to have me around since you are so lonely. You’re wrong, I am not disposable. Have your stupid life but I am going my own way. We can’t even have a proper conversation anymore, I’m going to give you all the space you need to purge from me. I hope the next one is worse to you than I. I bless you with uncommitted partners ahead, if that I hope you both get knocked up since I know that’s what you don’t want. Continue to be your sociopathic self. Your selfish self and see how far that takes you. I hope you never find the thing that you desperately crave for to fill your void. I have had enough of spreading myself thin for you. I am no longer licking your wounds for you, I’ll treat you like you treat me. How does that sound?
828	real	I nearly died very unexpectedly (otherwise healthy 36m) in May last year and none of my friends or family have really acted or supported me how I expected/hoped them to (or perhaps how I would treat them?) [End Title]: TLDR: When you nearly die, people act in unexpected/weird ways.  I had a first tonic-clonic/grand-mal seizure whilst taking a shower (over the bath). One moment I’m showering the next I’m on the bathroom floor where I landed with two Paramedics standing over me looking really worried and my poor mum in a blind panic.  I had been unconscious for 20 minutes. The paramedic said it was a literal miracle that I hadn’t broken any bones or suffered a concussion. By my logic the physics of the fall were that I kind of twisted sideward, was chopped at the legs by the side of the bath and landed squarely on my shoulder/triceps (narrowly avoiding an exercise bike and a lethal set of glass bathroom shelves). Apart from a couple of chipped wisdom teeth, a sore tongue and a huge bruise on my shoulder - no other major injuries.  It was a pretty complex set of circumstances as me and my SO had just signed a lease on a house for ourselves - she had gone ahead the day before as she wanted to start getting our stuff moved in, this is the first night we’d spent apart in ages so I was quite anxious. So she gets a call from my mum that I’m in hospital and my SO comes to visit me after I’d spent the night there. My honest feeling is that she didn’t really know what to do. I’m trying to establish if she was overwhelmed? Disappointed? Stressed? Already pissed off with me about something? I wonder if she thought it was my fault in some way as I had been using Xanax for anxiety which she was getting annoyed with.  My mum was just holding it together but later told me she was really traumatised for a while after.  Meanwhile the pressure was on to get all my stuff moved to the new place; SO would only stay at my mums for a couple of nights (despite having lived there together for months prior). I felt I had to meet her needs and expectations, though on reflection I was in no fit state to do so. I did express that but honestly felt pressured (by myself as much as anyone else).  Once we arrived at the new place it was kind of as if the whole thing was to be forgotten and brushed under the rug. I was to fulfil all the duties of moving and organising which I did to the best of my ability in the circumstances. Retrospectively I did a crippled job on the move; not bringing the right stuff, memory problems, emotional distress. This just seemed to further disappoint my SO as I guess we had a dream together and this was not resembling it.  As for other people in my life, who knows!? It seems like there’s a lack of understanding of the seriousness of what happened to me. Perhaps I minimised it, it’s not unheard of for myself or my family to be like that around illness and injury. People’s response has been really surface level, not asking many questions - they seem quite timid about it.  One thing really hurt though, which is the real ‘off my chest’ as I haven’t told anyone this yet. A while after we moved in my SO invited two of her friends over, a couple. I prepared us all a nice barbecue and things were going ok. Naturally my main topic of conversation was my near death experience and how I was feeling quite vulnerable (just soft nice boundaries and letting them know I was quite raw and sensitive emotionally and physically, and to excuse any memory lapses or SNAFU type situations). This is where the ouch came in. It was perceived, it seems, that I was playing the victim, had such a nice house, what was there to worry about? The BF of the couple engaged in a couple of ‘drug shaming’ comments and his attitude was pretty unkind quite a few times. Had I been stronger and not previously had some respect for the guy I wouldn’t have tolerated it, I let them slide the first few times. I expected my SO to have my back when these things came up but she just sort of melted into the conversation.  I then became the ‘problem’, the one who needed attention and reassurance, ‘putting a downer on things’. Well yeah I nearly died a couple weeks ago, I didn’t want mollycoddling, or even to talk about it much other than explain what happened. Just acknowledgment of potential limitations, that my mood was a bit low and to try to cushion us from any more stress. These were people I’d met a few times and sort of considered friends too which just meant my guard was even lower. To add to the whole mess it seems he has his GF under his thumb and is subtlety flirting with my SO while all this is going on. SO is looking at me as if to say ‘take the lead’ but honesty I’m pissed with her at this point, that she isn’t setting her own boundaries or having my back, and I’m weak, so I observed for a while. I had nothing concrete to go on anyway or would have confronted it. It was sly, social exclusion on the premise that I was ‘attention seeking’! It’s clear now he just has a major thing for my SO, his GF hasn’t got the balls to confront him about it, my SO is expecting me to ward him off. I did actually set a firm boundary the next day (they were planning to stay for a few days and I literally had to direct them to the correct bench at the train station in order to have it enforced). Pretty sure they hated the boundary, have not heard from the BF in the situation since. However this has presumably caused a bit of a rift but I think I acted fairly. I think my SO resents me for it, and her GF in this situation is at the whim of the other guy so there’s some manipulation at work.  Meanwhile I’m recovering from a near-death experience and not actually getting much support. My SO has been good in many ways, and I understand her disappointment and frustration. But as for not setting boundaries with her friends and not having my back I’m quite hurt and surprised by that. I assume she has her reasons - again she’s probably angry with me about something. That isn’t an excuse though, if that’s the case she needs to talk it out or make a decision/boundary.   As for everyone else, as a survivor of a near death experience, I encourage people to ask lots of questions, be inquisitive, supportive and kind as you can (unless you get the impression the person really doesn’t want to talk).  I’m pretty much back to full functionality - slight memory impairment, some slight post traumatic symptoms (anxiety/depression) but otherwise in good health!
524	real	Covid Crazy or am I? [End Title]: I have been watching my roomie (since Covid started) keep randomly hooking up with various people on sites like Tinder and Grinder.. I have tried to be very diplomatic about the risks he takes in meeting and sleeping with randoms., and how I want him to be careful coz we live together... I live by the rule "Live and let live" However, he doesn't seem to care that he is taking a huge chance on bringing it home. I suggested that maybe just keeping one FWB for now or until vaccinated? It seems like he just shrugs it off. I am not paranoid and I do take all necessary precautions. If he continues this hit and quit life style he will end up with something bad! I almost hope he gets a good scare! Stop being so nonchalant ... Taking Prep, washing your hands, wearing a mask and social distancing is just the beginning of being safe.I wish he would be SMARTER and less SELFISH in his choices! After all we are in the middle of a F******* WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC! Grow up! You are almost 40..Start making better choices. AND FU for making me feel like your GD MAMA.
758	real	Breakup [End Title]: I just broke up with my now ex boyfriend because I'm too fucking insecure about myself. I had really bad relationship anxiety with him the whole time and he did absolutely nothing wrong. I was always scared of him leaving so I started to sabotage our relationship. Now I'm here crying because it really is over and I fucked up.
802	real	"Share/Spread the love" is great, but not really [End Title]: I am a strong believer in "spread the love." Not that I explicitly say it, but, even as a guy, I tend to care about people and the choices they make, the lifestyle, etc.. But... when you feel like nobody loves you back, that nobody *actually* cares about you, it feels more like a burden than anything.   When you feel like you've never felt love, when your parents yell at you because they think you're a fuck up that does not do any work, because he is very busy doing "college homework" (I mean, I do have a lot of college work, but I try and work my schedule so as to make it better, but the fact that they give me chores out of nowhere, thus messing up my schedule, does not help), when you've been bullied for a lot of your life, never been in love with another person, and people on the internet make jabs at you for "not knowing how people work," when you show one flicker of hope at finding love, offering no help or opposing views to mend your state of being, making you think that you will be alone, forever, unloved, and die alone...   It just makes "spreading the love" feel like a burden that constantly scars oneself. What's the point of "spreading the love," if you have no hope of ever getting some back?
392	real	Thank you [End Title]: I just wanted to say thank you to you. You’ve been my best friend since forever and I want to say thank you. You’ve been there since The dawn of time and I wanted to say that you mean the world to me. I’m drunk rn and you being there for me and supporting me through all the tight times really means a lot, so thank you. I love you man and if it wasn’t for you idk what I’d do. You were there when my gf left me for someone else and when I got bullied in school  you you were there defending me. I love you man,  thank you.
5	real	Breaking up is hard [End Title]: I just broke up with my girlfriend of two years, and I feel awful. It’s only gotten harder with age, I’m 24 and this is the hardest break-up I’ve ever had. She didn’t deserve it, she deserved better. I am so sorry. I’ve broken up with her before and she’s never deserved it. But this time it’s final because I need to work on myself before I can give any part of myself to another person. It was a very difficult relationship in the beginning, we moved in together within weeks of meeting. She was still dealing with trauma and I had not learned how to deal with my emotions or communicating effectively. I wish I could have been everything she needed me to be because she’s a great person, I hope she finds a person who can give her all of it.   I hear her music in the other room and that’s heartbreaking, we live together and she’s grown to love my dogs as her own. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be what you needed me to be. I’m going to work on it to figure it out exactly, Sometimes you miss opportunities to better yourself because you’re worried about someone else. It’s hard coming to a decision that will change your life from that moment moving forward. It’s scary to be honest, like leaving a job, or moving to a different state. I hope we will both be okay, and maybe even one day we can be friends. I know it’s hard when you’re not the one who makes the decision.
746	real	"paint pouring" [End Title]: I'm sorry but Paint pouring is a poor excuse for art.  If anything it's a glorified craft, it's creative sure I'll give it that but it takes zero skills or talent to POUR PAINT.  It kinda upsets me when I spend 30+ hours on a piece and sell it for less than $100 or nothing, and the paint pouring goons are over here wasting paint and selling their junk for $100s more than a real artist actually using their brain to create something.  I know this is a shitty opinion, I know I'll get hate on this but really just grinds my gears.  I'm not sorry I had to get that out somewhere.i pray someone fucking agrees with me on this
623	real	I Hope One Day I Change the World [End Title]: I hope little by little, person by person, I can bring peace and happiness to everyone I interact with. I hope my kindest words touch the hearts of anyone I meet, that feels any kind of pain. I hope every ignorant comment I hear, is responded to with understanding. I hope I spread awareness when people make mistakes, instead of encouraging hatred.  I hope every stranger I meet remembers even a few words I say, I hope I touch their heart.   I hope, in becoming a better person, that I make other people better with me.  I hope to immortalize myself, by bringing light to dark places.  Someone depressed will always have a shoulder to lean on in me, someone anxious will always have someone to confess their fears.   I hope I'm the light I desperately needed someone to be for me in my darkest moments.  I hope I make the world better.

275	real	The only reason I throw a birthday party for myself is so my mom will get outside the house. [End Title]: I'm 22 about to be 23 years old. Every year I throw a birthday party for myself and invite my family and I always try to do it at somewhere that isn't my mom's house. The reason is because I can never get my Mom to go anywhere. Not on her birthday, not for Christmas, Thanksgiving, anything. She always just likes to stay home and read books on the kindle I got her for mothers day. I love her to pieces and she raised me by herself and always was good to me but I was a real piece of shit sometimes. Shes my absolute favorite person in the world and I worry about her a lot. Shes been in and out of therapy and mental help facilities. She has seizures sometimes. The only time she ever leaves and mingles is on my birthday she will come out to wherever we throw the party so I always invite her and anyone else in my immediate family or friends. I know the day is all about me but for me it's all about her. Shes the reason I'm alive and the person I am today and I want nothing more for her to be happy and healthy. I love you Mom, see you in August.
937	real	I’m tired man [End Title]: So I 14m am 1 or 3 kids in a divorced household. I would consider  myself a helpful person and all that. But I am the only one is ever asked to do chores. It’s always “Op do the dishes” “ Op grab my phone and put the dog out and lock up the house “ And honestly I’m done. This even caused a breakdown for myself and my dad said he’d work on it but as always he didn’t stay true to his word. I love my family but damn.
361	real	what kind of mental gymnastics are people going through to convince themselves that avocado is good in desserts? [End Title]: don’t get me wrong. avocado is objectively amazing. but i retch every time i taste or even conceptualize avocado as an ingredient in sweet food items.  as an asian, i have had to consume culturally popular foods such as avocado smoothies, and a sort ice cream variant with avocado chunks. it’s horrendous.  this is a bit of a silly post but avocado in desserts is one of the foods that i consider *objectively* bad. it’s a bit frustrating when people get mad at me for not being “culturally accepting” because of it
591	real	I'm terrified of falling in love, and yet it seems to be happening. . . Recent trauma (rape) makes me second-guess myself [End Title]: I've (31F) had some really bad experiences lately. The last two people I was seriously interested in betrayed me - first a rapist, then a liar.  Then *he* entered the picture a week ago (we'll call him C, 31M), an old friendly acquaintance from high school that I always thought was cool but never really knew. I had a little crush, but nothing like this. . . It feels like I've been shot by Cupid. It wasn't like this with the last two. I liked them, but sometimes with C it's so overwhelming that I can't breathe.   But what if I'm wrong? I haven't felt like this in years! Am I hormonal from my period? Am I just desperate for affection? Or am I crazy? It feels like an immature infatuation. I feel like I'm too old for that feeling, like I should have left it behind in high school, but I can stop feeling it. Is it cause we knew each other when we were teenagers?  I know C wants me. We've both said as much. I don't know if it's just sexually or romantically, but the way we've been looking at each other. . . I believe "moon-eyed" is an accurate descriptor.   But I'm worried that we want different things in life (kids vs no kids, where to live, etc.). My best friend keeps telling me to enjoy it and not to sabotage it.  Is this normal, though? Do other people over 30 feel this way?
352	real	What do i do ? Cat vs Dog dilemma [End Title]: I always wanted to have a pet - either cat or dog. When i was a child my parents did not want to have pets so we did not. Now that i have grown up i am debating if i should get a cat or dog. Help me out to choose... What do you think i should get and why ?
526	real	I feel so alone, yet there’s so many people around me [End Title]: I have such an amazing group of friends and I have such a brilliant boyfriend, and I love them all so so much, but occasionally over the past few months or so I’ve been feeling extremely alone.  Sometimes I just feel like no one genuinely likes me, or that they’re just pretending to like me. I suppose I know it’s stupid of me to think like this, but I can’t stop it. I’d just be sitting at home (mainly in bed at around 1am) and I just think, “maybe my friends don’t really like me”.  But I have no idea why I think this, I mean they’re so supportive, they always say that they’re there for me if I need to talk about any of my problems, but I feel like I’m being annoying if I tell them or that I’m a burden.  My grandad was 100% my best friend without a doubt. He lived in a different country then I do, so I’d only get to see him about twice a year if I was lucky, but I’d ring him everyday from home. He was the kindest person I’ve ever met in my entire life.  Yesterday I got the worst news I’ve ever gotten: he had passed on. Look, I suppose the man was in his eighties and had cancer, but I just didn’t expect it. I felt like as if he’d never go and he’d be there through everything. I feel like there’s a hole in my stomach and it can’t be filled.   My friends have been texting such kind messages to me and saying that they’d help with anything, but I don’t want to be an annoyance. All the same though, I’d love to just talk about it. I just want to get everything out about it, but I don’t know how. I just don’t want to be an annoyance.
414	real	I am sick of hearing about people on low salaries after university [End Title]: I am currently in my first year of university studying to gain a double major in Law and Computing. People, especially family friends, ask me how my studies are going, then proceed to tell me about their friend who "studied for 'x' years and collected 'x' dollars of debt and are now on a salary of just (insert low salary here)". Generally they then spout about how university is a waste of time etc etc.   Sure, I know it happens, and I know some people are wasting their time going to university, but at this point it almost feels like people are trying to discourage or psyc me out for whatever reason.  To clarify, my family are extremely supportive and I love them for that, but having moved back in with them during the holidays, I am seeing a number of their friends who are doing this, more often that not, and it's getting tiresome.
237	real	Posts about mental health are mostly attention seeking [End Title]: I mostly mean on this sub. I have nothing against people dealing with mental health issues, but the way a lot the the posts here are written is irritating. It's just a bunch of "look at me look at me". Which, to be fair, is the case for most posts online. The difference is when these people post for attention they aren't even bringing anything to the table. Come up with something interesting or funny to say. Instead they just fake cry over a keyboard to get people to say "hang in there, your special".  To anyone actually dealing with problems, this isn't for you. It's just that I think many posters are fake af.
892	real	depression teeth [End Title]: i’ve always been the worst when it comes to brushing my teeth. it’s nearly impossible for me to brush my teeth because my depression makes it seem like an impossible task. it’s gotten to the point where i’ve already had 4+ root canals, and now i have a hole forming on one of my canines. i’m ashamed of it
552	real	Grappling with being cheated while coping with my dad having cancer. [End Title]: I got a call from my dad in September about a week after heading back to college for my junior year. "I have cancer," he said, and I nodded calmly as he explained that it was probably nothing, the doctors didn't know how bad it was, and everything would be fine. The first person I wanted to tell this horrible news was my boyfriend, who had just transferred away from me to a new university. "My dad has cancer," I texted. "Lol," he responded.  I sat there looking at those three letters and broke down sobbing. Then a stream of texts came in: "Wait, you're not joking? This is for real?" I just cried and cried, unable to forget that my boyfriend had just responded "lol" to the news that my father has cancer.  We met at the college I'm currently studying at, and it was a wonderful first year together, but he wanted to study economics, and despite applying 3 times to the program at my college, he never got in. He didn't study for the exams, and when I offered to help him and invited him to the library, he stayed home playing video games instead. He transferred to a place closer to his house, told me that he had to do what was best for him, and now he lives at his parents' house, about 40 minutes away from me.   Over the next few months, I found out that my dad has colon cancer, that half his liver was a malignant tumor, that it had metastasized into his lungs, then that he has a blood clot and could have a stroke at nay time. I watched my dad break down sobbing over winter break when I was at home and he thought I couldn't see him. He'd just opened his CT scan results and found out that his tumors had more than doubled in size. We had Christmas Eve early because he was getting a port for chemo put in his heart artery on Christmas Eve, and on Christmas he could only stay awake for an hour to watch us open presents with tears in his eyes before he went back to bed to sleep off the pain.   My boyfriend told me that I wasn't putting enough effort into us. He refused to drive 40 minutes to see me, telling me that it was too far to come just to see me for the day. He told me to stay at his parents' house, and I did when I could, but other times I had to be home with my family. He said it was selfish of me to go home so often. I called him sobbing, telling him I was so heartbroken. "Why?" he asked. "Because my dad could die," I said. "Oh, that sucks," he said.  He abruptly stopped texting or calling me. He said we needed a break, so I gave one to him. Then finally, last week, he texted me saying that he can't live through this "hell" with me anymore, that it's not feasible for us to not see each other for "years" and that hopefully I understood. I didn't understand, but I didn't get a chance to ask for him to explain because he promptly blocked my phone number and blocked me on Snapchat.  I went to block him on Facebook last night and saw that he removed me as his girlfriend and had added someone else named "Hope" as his girlfriend. Ironic, because I feel I have absolutely no hope left in my life. He took mine from me.    There's no way he met her the day he blocked me and officially broke up with me. So he probably met her a while ago at his new college. That's probably why he was so absent. And that means he was cheating on me. I wasn't enough.  Today would have been our two-year anniversary.
204	real	Being a better me is hard [End Title]: Just like the title says, trying to be a better me is hard. I want to better the entirety of myself. Lose weight, build some muscle, quit smoking and drinking, slow down on my tv and gaming time. Just so much I need to manage, but I lack the mentality. I enjoy drinking beer and eating junk food way too much. I want to change everything, but I value the time I spend playing video games and junk food too much. The one time I actually excercised was walking on a treadmill while playing gta v. Changing every unhealthy aspect of my life just sucks. I do good for a week, then I start falling into my old habits. Smoking is the only thing I never had a problem with. But I smoke when I'm bored, and it isn't a healthy alternative. I don't know where to begin. I'm 6'5", and clinically obese. I got an extended dad bod, and I want to get rid of it. I don't want washboard abs, I just want to get rid of the gut, bulk up, and live a healthier lifestyle. At 30 years old, I definitely should be way more aware of my health, but I just lack that drive.
789	real	Stupid old wives tales that people don't even use logic to dispute. [End Title]: Specifically (although there are many), the "If you're too hot, drink a hot beverage and you will sweat and cool down."  WTF?   So, like,  how about I run a marathon?   Will that cool me down too?   And by the same token, if I am cold, should I drink a Slurpee, so that I will shiver and warm up?  Should I just roll in the snow?  Who TF makes this stuff up?  And I hear crap like this all the time.  People just mindlessly regurgitating shit they heard 100 years ago.
12	real	NETFLIX, PLEASE DON'T RUIN YU YU HAKUSHO!!! [End Title]: I have a mixed feeling when I heard of this news. Yu Yu Hakusho (or locally, Ghost Fighter) is part of my childhood, so of course, I'm excited to see this live action. But knowing how Netflix ruined Death Note, my expection is pretty low.
232	real	My Ego ruined my life [End Title]: I'm an Egotist. My Ego had really ruined my life and my family is affected as well.   I'll always like to be on top of my friends, I couldn't afford the feeling of losing.   I enrolled my daughter into International school which I know I couldn't really afford, I bought an old tiny condo apartment and a 3rd hand luxury car that I can barely afford. I have since sold my car after owning it for 6 months, I couldn't afford the loan and the maintenance.   I always like to show the people around me that I am super-wealthy, and even tell lots of lies in front of them. Things like I own lots of houses and cars etc, which I know I have none.  Deep in my heart, I knew who I am, I'm just an average person with an average income, now I am full of debt.
514	real	My girlfriend left me, then sent nudes to my best friend [End Title]: She broke up with me, then one of my best friends of 5 years asked her for nudes. She sent them   My self esteem is broken. I know I'm a baby, I know we weren't together, but I'm fucked up from this. I attempted suicide once this year already, and these feeling of worthlessness are pushing me to try again.   My friends thought I was gonna kill myself when all this happened, they saw how I was and they constantly checked on me. I love those guys, they might be one of the only reasons I haven't done it yet.   This is long and pointless. I don't care though, I need to vent somehow.   I'm trying to find happiness, but school is starting up soon and the stress from that is gonna destroy me.   I just feel worthless, so goddamn worthless
172	real	I helped my friend get a room in my Mom’s house to get back on his feet. Five years later (after asking for the room for just one year), is now acting entitled, stating he is too poor to move out. [End Title]: I understand what she can do legally, and things are headed in the right direction, but my friend is still acting rude towards my Mother, after she gave him an additional FOUR YEARS to find a new place to live (teo of those years giving him almost 50% off rent compared to other apartments in the area). My friend squandered an opportunity to save money, find a new job, find a new apartment, and finally get his life back together. Instead, he continues to smoke weed daily, purchases comic books, video games, go to concerts, and see the same movies in theaters five or more times. I certainly don’t care if he just works, come home and does nothing, he certainly earned that by working full time imo, but he has not done one thing to use the time he has been given to progress his situation. While I don’t care what he does with his off time, to have asked to be there for a year (and severely reduced rent), has been him taking advantage of my family’s generosity every single day he us there over the one year mark. Now it’s going on five years, and my Mom is at the point where she has to play the bad guy, which she really didn’t want to do- she trusted him to be a mature adult, and take this opportunity to make something better for himself. He didn’t, and now my Mother is suffering because of it.  I feel really bad, because of several things. 1- I was the one who talked my Mom into helping him. I knew he was in a bad spot, so I trusted that with some help, he’d get on his feet. 2- My Mom keeps coming to me for advice/to ask me to talk to him... I don’t even live there anymore, and even when I tell her what she needs to do, she usually ignores my advice, and just keeps hoping my friend will do the right thing. 3- this isn’t the first time my Mom rented a room to a friend of mine, and each time, something like this happened where she had to force them to move, and it ended up ruining the friendship. I see that going this direction too, and while this guy hasn’t been a good friend to me, he’s one of only a couple friends who ever reach out to me anymore (or simply replies when I reach out), and I feel like this is yet again going to be a lost friendship.  I don’t know what to say to my Mom, outside of “leave me out of this”, but I’m already upset... this guy is taking advantage of my family, my mother is not taking the proper steps to deal with it, and I don’t feel anything I can say or do will prevent the events that are about to transpire. I also have a friend who my family and I have been helping for YEARS, who keeps taking advantage of my family and is acting entitled as hell, being disrespectful towards those who are helping him, and refuses to put any effort into his progression. I get that he probably has depression/self worth issues, so do I, which is why I wanted to help him... but at what point can I draw the line and say “you’re taking advantage”, and not lose the friendship? I suppose it’s just one of those “you cannot control what other people think or do”, I just wish he would take the help he’s been given as the facts, rather than “this person is kicking me out,so I’m going to treat them like shit”.  It just makes me hesitant to be helpful anymore, or to even have friends...
174	real	A close friend of mine said she didn't want to hang out with me because my father died. It's been bothering me ever since but I haven't confronted her about it yet. [End Title]: 3 weeks ago, I tragically lost my dad. I'm only 23 years old. He just dropped dead one morning, completely out of the blue. I woke up to the phone call nobody ever wants to hear. "Dad died suddenly this morning".  After nearly 5 months of being locked down with my parents, I had only just got back to work when I got this call. It meant I had to stop everything again and come back home for a few more months.  My friend has some anxiety problems, and often has this belief that if I don't answer her texts for a while it's because I don't care about her. She may send me 30 messages about her awful day at work or how much her life sucks, and I just don't have time to read them, but I'll respond to them later. If she sees I left her on read, I get lots of messages essentially saying "you just don't care about me, do you?"  What nobody tells you about losing a family member is the paperwork you have to do. You will have forms and paperwork and phone calls for MONTHS, on top of all the funeral arrangements. I reckon some 50-100 hours of admin or maybe more, follows the death of a loved one.  But what's even better, is when you lose someone in a pandemic, and nobody can help you with it all. So it's literally just me and mom doing it all by ourselves. Nobody can come round our place and help due to covid.  This means my days at the moment are mostly taken up with paperwork, admin, phone calls and all the chores dad used to do.  Twelve days after my dad passed, my friend had a very awful anxiety attack. I was busy all day with all of the above and more, I didn't have a chance to read her string of messages and reply to them. I checked my phone to make sure she was okay, and sent a few messages about a game we both play. But no direct reply to her string of messages yet. I didn't have the emotional bandwidth to read and reply. One typically doesn't less than 2 weeks after their dad has died, they've had to drop everything and come home for lots of paperwork.  When I did come online, she ripped me a new ASSHOLE (she does ths often, I'm used to it), because I wasn't there for her and didn't reply to her messages. I tried to explain to her that I was busy all day with paperwork and didn't have the emotional bandwidth as I did in fact, just lose my father.  That's when she said it. The most deplorable thing a friend has ever said to me since a friend of mine tried to fuck me then called me a massive disappointment.  She said "I'll just go hang out with my other friend who didn't just lose a father then".  I actually could not BELIEVE that a FRIEND could say that to someone. I would not say that to my WORST ENEMY!!!  I actually recoiled like... did she ACTUALLY just say that?! HOW could someone say something that awful to a friend who has just had a father die???  She basically said I'm damaged goods and essentially used the death of my father against me in a fight, less than 2 weeks after his passing. She basically said that me losing my father made me less of a friend somehow. Because a friend not having just lost their father makes them more desirable.  At the time, I said "HOW could you say that?!"  She tried to worm her way out of it, by saying I was misinterpreting what she was saying. But there's only really one way to interpret that.. right? You just lost your father, you can't be the fun friend I need, therefore I'm going to hang out with someone else now who hasn't lost their father"  It was the biggest middle finger I've EVER had from a friend.   The thing is, I'm still mad at her about that. I need to confront her about it, but I can't yet. I'm still really upset with her for saying that to me, it was just such a nasty and spiteful thing to say, and she said it with no qualms or anything.  Also, 3 days before my dad died, my girlfriend dumped me (yes, seriously... it's been a pretty hellish time for me). That night she also used my gf dumping me against me, so it seems to be a bit of an emerging pattern.  When I called her out for what she said about my dad, she basically she's going through her own stuff and it's not all about me losing my dad. Okay, but that doesn't excuse the HORRIBLE thing she said to me. I NEVER use her anxiety/panic attacks against her like that. When she is having a panic attack, I am USUALLY there for her, I would NEVER say "I'm going through my own stuff right now, I'm going to hang out with a friend who isn't having a panic attack".  I needed to get this off my chest, as I can't confront her about it yet. I can't. I don't have the bandwidth to have a big confrontation.
662	real	I don't care to do anything with my life [End Title]: I've just come to the realization that I have no desire to do anything with my life. There are things I find interesting, but the amount of time and work I would have to put into it, I would just rather live comfortably, maybe even slightly beyond my means, and do that everyday until I die. Just eat, sleep, and have the occasional fun when I want. I don't feel guilty either. I've tried different hobbies, different things, and nothing sticks. I can barely get a job, therapy is way out of my budget, and I honestly have to just focus on surviving. I just find doing extra things don't make life meaningful, just tiresome and annoying. Maybe things would be different if I were rich and had access to a different life but I'm tired. I don't even wanna finish my degree because it's just annoying to me at this point, but I find other majors to be equally exhausting and I hate being in school. Idk, I'm just tired.
403	real	I miss him [End Title]: I really miss talking to him. Its been exactly a week since we talked face to face on zoom meeting. Either he or I would find an “excuse” to talk to each other. But this time, its different. He is having a difficult time out there and I do not want to bother him with my menial problems. I am just so amazed how he manages to help others even at such time! I would not have given a damn care (Yeah, I know I am selfish, I don’t mind though). I miss his silly jokes; I miss that therapy session. I miss his warmth, whenever I get stuck on something or a concept is too difficult for me, he is there, so patient with me, teaching me stuff without any arrogance. Why is he so humble!?  To be honest, he is way out of my league, well almost everyone is (that’s a topic to discuss on a different day). Plus, he is my mentor, he is my senior, I REALLY should not fantasize about him. But I can’t help it. The other day, I was missing him so much and I don’t have any of his photos. So, I decided to stalk him xD. I like stalking people and I am good at it 😊. I had already finished stalking him on Facebook (he doesn’t post much there), Instagram (0 posts, ☹) and had already followed him on twitter. I needed more information about him, what is he like, what are his interests, how was he as a child, basically something new. A simple google search of his name, and there, his pictures pop up, sites related to him, and in there I see his Quora profile! What more would I need then. I read all his answers and questions posted in there. The conclusion being, he is REALLY SMART. At a very young age, he is answering questions, in a very logical way and requesting to some great personalities from big universities to answer his questions. Pretty impressive! That’s why he is in THE USA right now you see.   I feel that I get attached to people way too much and way too soon and they don’t. I am scared that the same would happen with him. I am consciously trying to maintain distance with him for that reason. He is very helpful and humble person, so I guess he has a lot of people to talk to, but I don’t. I start relying on him, and that, I don’t like. Also, the question arises, all I am doing is, taking from him. In return, what can I give him? Nothing. The other day, he asked if I could suggest him some place to crash in for 2-3 days while he would be in KTM, I had nothing. I say (just to myself) that I would be more than happy to help him on any venture that I can. But I know myself, I don’t like to be tied like that. And that’s just me being selfish, selfish as hell. I need to work on that, I really do. Just like how he brings the best out of me, I wish I could contribute in some way. That I definitely will, if he ever asks me to speak in one of his lectures. I know I am super scared to talk publicly, or give presentations, but I WILL DO IT.  06232021
592	real	I despise my life [End Title]: I was born with a mental illness that made me depressed, I went to seek help and got it. I had a year of therapy and ever since I’m ‘better’ I feel almost nothing. I just dragged on the couple of years after that but now I’m at a point in my life I just don’t know what to do anymore.  I’m fucking everything up, I’m doing nothing in college and will probaly be kicked off in the next month, I started doing drugs and have begone drinking way to often. I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore I lay on my bed most of my time and have absolutely no motivation to do otherwise.  I know I’m not going to harm myself but in all honesty I have no idea how my life is going to go on like this.  Sorry for bad English just felt like I had to tell someone and because I don’t wanna bother anyone IRL it’s gotta be u guys.
607	real	I can’t seem to shake off whatever it is that makes me unlikable or uncool. [End Title]: Before starting college, I’d written in my notes app fake stories that I’d be able to tell during conversation so that I’d come off more interesting (“Haha that’s hilarious, I had a friend like that back in high school who’d xyz”).  I’d listened to podcasts so I could get a better sense of how a conversation is supposed to flow.   I’d try to walk my dog everyday and correct my walking posture.  I’d tried to match my clothes better.  I’d tried working on my smile, working on being able to control my facial expressions better.  And to my surprise, I finally was able to enter a kind of area with people I’d never been in before.  I was actually interacting with them normally, and they seemed to really enjoy my company!  But it seems there’s just something about me that inevitably, after a few months, puts people off.  Is it the clothes?  The eye contact that I’m not relaying smoothly?  Is it my tendency to mumble if I don’t concentrate on my voice?  Do I ask too many questions?  Everyone else in the group, who’ve all known each other as long as I’ve known them, doesn’t seem to have a problem getting along with each other, so what am I doing wrong?    I’m getting jaded and real sour.  I’m starting to resent my mom and all her worry-wart tendencies that I’ve more or less inherited over the years.  I can’t hate my dad for being gone 6 days a week when he was breaking his back supporting his family, but I’m starting to hate myself for deciding to go to such an expensive school and delaying his retirement by god knows how many years.  I wish there wasn’t a language barrier between me and my parents.  I wish my mom wasn’t such a loser that she hardly has friends of her own and wants me to be her best friend.  I wish she understood that whenever I left the house during my junior and senior years to hang out with my friends at the time, I wasn’t “betraying” her and that I was just trying to fit in with people my age.  I wish she would’ve given me practical advice instead of just treating me like her little Forrest Gump as I was growing up and telling me to “be confident” (what does that even mean?).  I wish she wasn't a weirdo who'd asked to see my penis in the third grade or made subtle gestures and comments that were borderline incestuous.  I wish I hadn’t moved schools in the middle of elementary school so that I wouldn’t have had that three year period where I’d walk to school and back home without uttering a word.  I wish my mother saw me not as her emotional support puppy but instead an adult.  I wish had an older brother instead of a sister.  I wish I wasn’t me.  I wish I had a stiff upper lip.  At 22 years old, I’ve got nothing to show for it.  I’m already out of touch.  I don’t watch shows, play video games, do discord, or social media.  I learned what “pog” meant two weeks ago.  I just walk my dog, pace my room in circles, try to exercise, and listen to my music.  I’m aware of the arrogance in saying something like this, but I feel the years are moving too fast and that there’s no future for me aside from becoming the angry old creep.
629	real	I hate my life [End Title]: I hate my life but I don't have a choice. I want to commit suicide but I am too scared. I want to talk to someone but I am too shy.
868	real	I down voted somebody last weekend. [End Title]: I just joined last week and I wasn’t quite sure how Reddit worked. I assumed the arrows were similar to the like button on Facebook. I can’t remember completely what the post was about because I was high. All I remember was that I liked the post but didn’t like how somebody treated the OP. So I hit the down arrow because I disliked the treatment. Again, totally high. Fast forward to tonight. I’m scrolling through posts on r/anxiety and a user posted about the fear of down voting. I had no idea what it was or how it affected people. I feel like a major asshole now. If I had anyway of finding the post, I’d change my vote.

315	real	Widowed mom ready to date but I'm sad about it. [End Title]: Over Thanksgiving I helped my mom set up an eHarmony account. My dad died a few years ago and she is starting to be open to the idea of meeting someone. I was happy to set it up for her because she is terrible at technology and I really do want her to have a second act. That being said, I cannot help but be sad and cry about it when I am alone. I just keep thinking "but what about my dad". It's odd to truly want it for her but also not be done grieving myself. I even had a dream that I was telling my friends about my mom dating and saw my dad walk by. I'm sure it's just my brain trying to process everything but it threw me. I wouldn't dare let her know this because I don't want to discourage her finding love and joy.
44	real	I got stood up on my birthday [End Title]: So two major shitty things happened.  1. I had an argument with my only friend, causing her to say she won't be around for the weekend (which is also when my birthday would be), so in fear of being alone on that day I scheduled a lot of things to keep me busy. Then it turned out that me and her made up, but I couldn't cancel everything else and it made my friend stay up to hang out with me and eventually we just gave up on most of our plans so she could get some sleep.   2. I invited my siblings (most of them married and some with kids) over for some homemade cake to celebrate. Everyone was gathered except for the one I'm closest to and her family. Everyone's been waiting for a while at this point so I decide to text them. When I ask what happened they text me saying that they're upset with me and I belittled this relationship (long story, but it was an issue that we had talked about and thought was cleared up)  and that of course they're not coming. Basically they brought up an old reason for being upset with me, something that I thought we worked through, and they stood me up and started giving me shit while I was trying to entertain my other guests and look happy for my birthday.   🎉
480	real	When did everything get so offensive? [End Title]: We need to stop getting offended by every little thing and then giving into everyone who’s offended. It’s creating an atmosphere of everyone being no nasty and negative. If you don’t like something stfu and stop being around it but stop trying to force it onto everyone else. Learn to let thing roll off and move forward. Stop getting pissed off when you can easily move on. We can’t have a future if we hold onto the past.
30	real	my family isn't what fulfills me [End Title]: Everyone says relationships are what fulfills you and that you are supposed to be so happy with your family.  I'm not.   I have a toddler and while my kiddo is adorable I do have love, I just. . . am not sure I can do anymore staying home.  I can't be the only one.  And my mom is like a toddler-any remote suggestion at social distancing is met with screams.  I just. . . want to be where I can feel like myself, not people that need me.
750	real	Nobody enjoys what I enjoy. [End Title]: As dumb as this may sound (it is dumb), I am sad because I am the only one in my family and group of friends who enjoys certain things, i.e Star Wars: I tried getting my mother to like Star Wars by convincing her to watch the films with me, and she is completely unimpressed and sick of it. Nobody in my friend group except me likes  Star Wars either, except for one friend who has only seen The Rise of Skywalker, but he never talks about it.  More examples of this can be found in video games: For example, I love the Mafia series, Half Life, and more.   It really doesn't sound like much, but expressing all of your ideas, thoughts and jokes about everything that you enjoy only to yourself hurts a little bit.
501	real	I cried for a mouse today and I feel ridiculous. [End Title]: Several months ago I moved to the other side of the US, away from friends and family for my fiancé new job. Things have been going well in that regard but I'm we use to be in a situation where we worked together with the same hours and days off. Needless to say now that is no longer the case and I'm away from everyone I know it's been more than a little lonely. About a week ago I found a baby mouse in our driveway. Poor little thing's eyes weren't opened yet and was just baking out there in the sun, barely breathing. Dumb as it was, I picked it up not caring that it could be sick, helped cooled it down and eventually got it to drink some milk from a syringe. ( I got it some proper formula later but milk was all I had at the time ) Eventually it started coming around and got a lot of energy back, had more color to its hands and ears. I really thought it would be okay so I got the mouse a little tank and little plastic house to hide in (which I lined with faux fur and cotton to help keep them warm as well as a little heating pad.) For the first few days it was doing really well, eyes eventually opened up and it was really energetic. Decided to name the little fella (not sure if it was a boy or girl yet) Pokito. And all they wanted was nothing more than to be held. The mouse was an absolute little cuddle bug. Never even had to lift the tiny house to get them out. Just would stick my finger in and it would latch on. As silly as it was it brought a great amount of joy and made me feel a lot less lonely. Probably the happiest I'd been since I got here. However, last night there was a power outage due to a tree collapsing on a line and the heating pad stopped. When I got up around 3am to feed Pokito the entire house was cold and the poor little thing probably froze to death, alone in it's cage. What an awful way to go. It's around 7am here now and I've just been crying off and on. I know it's just a mouse, and not even one I knew for very long but I miss it so much.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Picture of Pokito :( [https://imgur.com/gallery/Eri8F1y](https://imgur.com/gallery/Eri8F1y)  &amp;#x200B;  Edit 2: Thank you everyone. Your words have made me feel a little better. I hope the poor little thing had a happy life even if it was a short one.
379	real	Online school should be normalized after we settle in [End Title]: I know, the title seems a bit ridiculous but hear me out. I know online school is already a popular thing, but I feel like after this virus public schools should create a day system. So one day you’ll come to school on this special day, and the next day you can have online school which is the option of viewing the class or just doing your work and having the rest of the day off. Even on these online school days you should have the choice to go to school. It would be very cool if we had options like this after this entire thing is over. During teenagers lives school takes up so much time, and after a long week of work we only have 2 days for a break. I think this option should only be available for kids who maintain decent grades to reward them. I would definitely like to hear you all thoughts on this idea. We should definitely make this thing if its reasonable.
905	real	I sometimes wish my family would die [End Title]: Ok, so a little bit of context. My mother verbally and physically abuses me just about everyday. Like for example she calls me a pig just about everyday because I can eat more than everyone in my house. And physically she has hit me with a belt all over my body 22 times. good thing I had a blanket nearby because I covered up with it. My brother said to me right after that he should of ripped the blanket off of me. I have already told them I am going (hopefully) to Reno, Nevada and I don’t want to see them again. and the truly funny thing is I get survivors benefits because my dad died when I was 10 (I’m 15 now). but my dad wasn’t good either. And I help pay rent and bills and I don’t even get a thanks. But yeah my mom deserves the worst pain imaginable besides child birth because she would torture that baby too. Another thing is that she treats all of my brothers except one good but that brother betrayed my brother I live with. And the only reason I stay with these psychopaths is I do not wanna live in a foster home. also if I stay I get like 5000-25000 because of my mom’s disability (she said I get a check because I am her only child under 18) but yeah I have had thoughts of ending her miserable life. I would never do it though. Mainly because of she already has a miserable life and ending it would be a relief to her. And before you ask no my mom’s disability is not mental it is arthritis all through her body. More on my brother now. He also calls me names like bastard,pig,little shit,etc. and he also hits me with a belt. But he is way less bad then my mom and me and him do stuff together just to hang out. I just feel so much hate all the time, so I needed to get this off my chest.
860	real	I don't know how to go on [End Title]: I'm supposed to start school in September and I'm getting money from the government to pay for my school and rent. It's not a lot and I will have about 130€ a month left for everything else I need.  Now...the problem is, that I asked my mum over a year ago and on multiple occasions, if she was willing to give me the money from child support and she said yes. It would be an additional 219€ a month which would help me a lot. However, a week ago we had a conversation and she acted, as if I never mentioned to her, that I want the money. She told me, that I was a horrible child because I want to take away her money, that I was selfish because she needed it for the expenses at home, that I don't even know how to handle that much money and how terrible I am, for taking away her only way of helping me in the future when I need it.  I honestly don't know, how I'm supposed to live off of 130€ a month. I already need half of that to get to Therapy, that I desperately need. I'm not even allowed to go to work because then I wouldn't get support from the government anymore and I already have school till 5pm, almost every day.   I wouldn't have applied to the school, if my mum hadn't make it sound like I could afford to go there.  I could make her force to give me the money and go to court over it, but then I can't ever go home again and god knows what she will do to my stuff that will stay here and my dad. She's always been agressive and manipulative and it's worse, if she doesn't get what she wants.  This was supposed to be my step towards independence but it's become a nightmare
533	real	I’m tired of smelling meth [End Title]: My parents don’t even hide their meth use anymore with the exception of my youngest nephew. Every time my mother smokes upstairs all throughout the house I smell it. It gets to the point where I’m smelling it everywhere in the house and I hate it. Fucks sake, this has been a constant issue for years.
167	real	I run a fake restaurant on a delivery app. [End Title]: I registered a company, bought all the take-away boxes from Amazon, signed up for a few delivery apps, made a few social media acounts and printed leaflets that I drop in mailboxes. I re-sell microwave meals...On some meals I add something to make them look better, like cheese. So far it’s at around £200 a day in revenue.   Nobody suspects a thing, soon someone will come for higene inspection, but I’ll pass that check without any problems. It’s not illegal to operate out of your own kitchen.  Should I feel bad? I feel kind of proud to be fair and free as a bird from the 9-5 life.  Edit: Please stop commenting on the legality of this. I’m doing everything by the law. I’m in the UK, so yes, I can work out of a non-commercial kitchen, yes I am registered and will pay taxes in Jan, yes I have my certificates and yes I have insurance (though there is something I might need to add to the policy, doing that next week)   This shouldn’t be your concern, I’m legal. This is a confession sub, not legal advice. Not breaking any laws, just ruining my karma irl for selling people heated up food from a microwave at home.
797	real	Is this enmeshment? [End Title]: I'm a 24 year old university student currently living in dorm. I'm an only child, I was brought up kind of a sheltered kid, didn't really have any friends and spend most of my time with my mom, when I wasn't in school. My mom was a stay-at-home mom for all of my childhood. She says my dad wanted to provide for the family and didn't want her to work. As a kid I didn't want her to work either, as I wasn't independent at all. I always got what I wanted. I don't believe I had a rebellious phase as a teenager either.  I spent last year with my parents due to covid but now I'm back to dorm. Here's the trick though: this summer my parents have moved to the same city where I study. It's a long and complicated story, but they were planning this move for several years now. I know that at least partly they did it to be closer to me.  I have tried to tell my mom both indirectly and directly that I'm doing good on my own and that they shouldn't move if for my sake. When I told her directly she would usually either say that they just love the city or she would get upset and tell me that we're a family and should stick together.  I know that my mom never really lived on her own. She lived with her parents, then married my dad and moved in with him next block to where her parents lived, and then her mother, my grandma, even moved into the same building where we lived. I believe she was also a little controlling, constantly visiting my mom's job before my mom got married. I remember when I was little, me and my parents were on a late night car ride once (like post 10pm or something). When we got home my grandma met us at the door, and her and my mom had an argument about how late we came home and my grandma started crying.  When my parents were moving here earlier this summer they would excitedly tell me how nice it would be that we will live in the same city, how they would worry less and how I would be able to visit them when I want. Now we meet up every week. They ask me several times a week when I will drop by. What's more, apparently they're expecting I will stay for a sleepover each time I come visit them, and maybe even for a few days. I've done that a couple of times this summer already, as I don't want to upset them.   My mom texts me good morning and good night daily. I think she also kinda expects me to tell her whenever I go for a walk or whatever, and if I do go for a walk she would probably want meet up. I don't believe she texts my dad good morning every day. She also calls almost daily and tells me everything that's going on in their lives. Dad never does, he mostly asks everything through her, we're not that close.  Yesterday I went for a walk to the city center by myself for the first time this summer. When I told my mom later that day she seemed to get upset that I didn't tell our invite her. I told her I just wanted to have a walk by myself and "didn't ask even my bestie to meet up, who was already in the city center at the time", to which she replied: "Even?! What do you mean "I didn't tell even her", I should be your #1 priority!".  So I'm wondering, is it normal that I don't want to be as in contact with my parents, specifically my mom? That I don't want to spend every weekend at their place, let alone sleeping over? I feel guilty about it, because my parents are having a tough time with the move right now and I should be supportive. All they ever did in their life was for my sake. And with them paying for my uni I feel like I have no right to not be compliant with them at the moment, it's the least i could do. They literally have no one else to turn to, as neither of them got any friends and all of our relatives are spread around the globe. But I'm seriously worried I will never be free. I feel a little trapped but I also think it's unfair of me to feel that way, because my parents are not bad people and they love me.
110	fake	I think women are bad at videogames [End Title]: I think this because fighting is a masculine thing and a masculine principle that men hold. Most men are biologically wired to know how to fight at a decent enough level from birth. Since women were made to have children and pick berries for the tribe their biology isn’t conditioned to fight which means they won’t know how to react to certain things which is important in videogames. They won’t be able to pick up the fighting techniques and patterns in the videogames which is why most girls you know play on easy mode.
520	real	Stepped on another girls Ray-Bans [End Title]: This was about 7 1/2 years ago. I was on study abroad in Australia. I signed up to go on a trip that takes other students that are studying abroad to a bunch of places to party and see stuff. I think we got assigned cabins one night and was put in a cabin with some other girls and one guy. Kind of aquainted, but still getting to know them.  One night everyone was drinking. I went back to our cabin pretty drunk to see if they were going to come hang out. Walked over and stepped on this one girls Ray-Bans that she left on the floor. Cracked one of the lenses. I felt bad. Offered to pay for some of the cost for her to get new ones. Gave her $50. She hinted that it might cost more, but I felt that what I gave her was pretty fair considering she was partly to blame. After the trip ended, never talked to her again.
679	real	just need to say this so I can stop thinking about it [End Title]: Long story short I recently sent a inappropriate picture of myself to someone online who did the same. I instantly regretted it but unfortunately the platform doesn’t allow someone to unsend something so I just blocked the person cleared my account and deleted it. The picture is literally just a part of my body and nothing else besides the background and I know that the person or anyone would never be able to track it back to me but i still regret it although I know it will  get lost in the ocean of millions of other pictures like it. I just feel so stupid because I knew I shouldn’t do it and I would regret it but I did it anyways and I feel a bad knowing that the picture will be on the internet forever. If I can say just one thing never send inappropriate pictures of yourself to anyone. Ok sorry for rambling bye
449	real	Obssessed? [End Title]: I cant get over her and its killing me. She’s all I think about. I cant sleep. I think I love her.
88	real	I upvote funny stuff and anyone who's taken the time to comment/upvote on my posts/comments. [End Title]: I just feel its right, you know? Some people just forget about the karma system. I also enjoy thanking people on my post/comment for the upvotes, because I enjoy admiring the small things from people.
383	real	Roommate stopped taking Pandemic seriously [End Title]: I was living with my cousin and his GF in March when the pandemic hit. We took things seriously, didn't go out, and wiped down all our groceries for months. GF had to move out for a year because of school, and it seems like since then my roommate (and his gf) have been getting less and less serious about taking precautions.   I will admit I think we all slid into it a little bit, going out to eat outdoors every once in a while, letting a few close friends come by, etc. These were all risks I thought were calculated and reasonable given that we're all young and healthy.  However recently it seems like he has thrown all caution to the wind. He invited his old roommate, who lives in Florida of all places, to stay at our house for a week while he's visiting. He "asked" me, as in he said "hey I invited so and so to stay with us, is that okay?" Easier to ask forgiveness than permission, right? I brushed it off at first, but it's really started to bother me as other things build. At first I was thinking, "well damn I can't blow up their plans", now I'm thinking how inconsiderate is it that he just decided he was okay with it and I should be too.   On top of that, he recently got a gym membership without letting me know, had been going for a full week while he visited his girlfriend, and went tonight without any warning. I get that it's weird to ask your roommate permission about this kind of stuff, but given the current circumstances I know that I would let him know if I was thinking about doing anything that could increase my exposure. I mean I have a mom that I would like to go see for the holidays, and if I can't trust that he's being reasonable with himself, I can't trust that I won't get her sick. Maybe I would have a different perspective if we were out in the world anyway, but we have both been fortunate enough to be able to work remotely during all this, and deciding to take all of these unnecessary risks just seems like tempting fate.   It just seems so insanely inconsiderate, not only to me but to the public at large, to just decide that because I probably won't get seriously sick, I have a free pass to do whatever I want. What's more frustrating is this is someone who is otherwise a generally pretty good, considerate, reasonable person.   I just don't know what to do. I confronted him about it tonight but it wasn't very re-assuring. I made it clear that I felt like we weren't on the same page anymore and I wasn't okay with how he was approaching quarantine, but that I wasn't going to tell him what to do. The most he said is that he didn't realize I was worried about getting sick and he wouldn't go to the gym while he was here, but would probably still go while he's visiting his girlfriend.    I'm torn between giving in and letting chance dictate my life from this point, or making a radical change like moving out/moving back home but each of those decisions presents a problem within itself. If I pack up and head home, I have no buffer time to ensure I'm not currently carrying the virus since we live together. I could get my mom sick doing that. And for moving out, I'm honestly not in love with the city we're in, especially now that going out is off the table, so signing a lease for my own place while simultaneously alienating myself from the few people I do allow myself to hang out with seems like a horrible idea. And of course if we can't agree on me leaving, I could be stuck paying two rents. I'm making enough to live comfortably, but not that much.  It really feels like my options right now are cut ties, go home and endanger my mom, or give in to stupidity. On the other hand, maybe I am just making a mountain out of a molehill. I don't know.
755	real	I lied about getting a full ride scholarship to college and my anxiety is through the roof. [End Title]: I just graduated from high school and I’m heading to Texas for undergrad. I was in a group of friends and friends of friends and people were talking about their lofty plans post-graduation. I wasn’t a stellar student in high school but I did well enough to get into pretty good college.   I cracked under pressure and told the group that I earned a full ride scholarship but I didn’t. Now my anxiety is through the roof and I think that I’m going to be called out. People talk and I don’t want to become a topic of conversation especially with parents around (of course my parents know that I didn’t get a full ride).  Should I come clean or leave things the way that they are?  I feel like an idiot.
690	real	And yet somehow I thought she would tell the truth. [End Title]: My STBXW lied to the kids yesterday. I know she did it before and she will do it again and again. But somehow I thought it would stop, or before I thought, "Well, it's only a onetime thing." But she's literally bragged about planting false memories in my son.  I'm not sure why I was surprised. Like I said: it's happened several times I know of. Every time I dismissed it until yesterday when the pattern became clear. This is exactly what abusive people do. But I still didn't realize what she was doing.  I felt sick to my stomach. I still feel sick.
794	fake	My big top fantasy confession [End Title]: My first orgasm came about when I pulled my pants Pockets inside out, pulled my cock out of my zipper and stomped around the house making elephant noises as my mother cheered me on  banging on a drum and threw peanuts at me all the while my little sister followed me around with a shovel like we were in a real circus parade . I imagined the Roar of the crowd, Spotlight on my penis and I exploded on my cousins popcorn and that's what I knew I wanted to be in Show Business
719	real	I might be polyamorous, I'm ruining my relationship and I'm scared. [End Title]: okay so right now I am in a relationship for almost 2,5 years.  I do like him but we had more and more fights lately. my mental health is at -26% right now and he always drags me down because of his own mental state. He has no future plans etc while I'm all about future. He also is very clingy and pushy about the sexual sides of the relationship (I'm asexual). I tried to break up with him last night but couldn't do it because I still enjoy being around him. But now I'm also really into this other dude and I kinda want to date him but too afraid to leave my current boyfriend (he is almost suicidal and doesn't want professional help).  I already tried making a whole list of what to do but nothing works except create dents in the relationship. I didn't even want all of this to happen and now I feel like I'm in deep trouble. everybody around me says now I got to break up with him but I still love him too much and don't love the other enough to do it. I really just want to date both, I've been thinking about multiple partners since I was like 13 but always too anxious because its seen as abnormal and cheating.  I'm sorry I'm terrible at chronologically speaking and formatting
561	real	Since my mothers passing I no longer have someone to share my life updates with [End Title]: Hello anyone. Unfortunately during this pandemic my mother passed away, she had been sick for years. She was the person I was closest too. I used to call her every week and give her little life updates. Since she passed I do not really have anyone to tell, or at least talk to the way I could with her. So I wrote this instead:  What you have missed  It has been six months, and I have never missed you more. I think about you every day and wish I could just tell you I will be fine. I worry that you can see how sad I am. But I hope you see the happy moments too.   I finished my basic training, I wish you could have been there I know how proud you would have been. It was rough at the end without you there knowing you would not be around to see my finish. But I knew I had to, hope you watched. There was once a time I thought when I lost you, I would lose myself too. But now I know I have the strength to carry on, thank you.   I got a tattoo for you. Something nice and clean, I know it would have been your favourite. It looks just like a page out of a story book, just like the ones you used to read me every night before bed.   I got my first puppy, I know you would have loved him. he is super playful and friendly and the nicest little pup. Anytime I play with him I just know how much you would have laughed at the silly things he does.
375	real	I finally went to a therapist and got prescribed antidepressants for anxiety and depression. [End Title]: I feel odd about it and like I'm betraying my own strength and how far I've come on my own, regardless of suffering. I've had so many problems with family, having a father that is mentally ill, my mother and I don't get along much, my brother and I are on bad terms. My grandparents (father's parents) make me feel guilty about not having a relationship with my dad for 10 years. My friends with benefits is great but not great. He can be toxic and I know it but I am scared to be alone. I miss love but am terrified of love again. I am mentally exhausted and physically drained. I don't have the energy to exercise and let myself gain weight and wish I didn't. I feel crappy about myself and hate the way I look. I don't trust counselors normally due to my father sitting in on my sessions when I was younger, and feeling like I couldn't express myself. And now I'm finally trying to do something for myself to make things easier and better but I still feel crappy about it. I hope these meds work .....
177	real	Thoughts are getting dark again. [End Title]: To preface, I’ve (25 yo female) been dealing with anxiety and depression for years, but this year has really made it worse. It doesn’t help that my dark thoughts get exacerbated during my time of PMS. It’s a tortuous ride that I really struggle to get through.   I’ve been coping ok, started going to therapy, and getting by these past few months... but I broke yesterday. Christmas Eve, my family wanted to go out to a restaurant, which was fine with me bc most restaurants are pretty spaced out and social distancing is strictly followed. However, I hadn’t been to the restaurant we ended up at before, and it was at 100% capacity, no social distancing, and it was a fucking buffet style where they also bring cuts of meat to each table and slice it for you.   I couldn’t stop thinking about all the exposure that was going on during the dinner. It took everything in me to not have an anxiety attack or scream at my family for being so so so irresponsible for putting us in that situation. I feel like I’m always labeled as uptight, too sensitive, so I didn’t want to be the grinch who ruined the family Christmas Eve dinner.   Last night, my siblings started watching a movie that I had said I wanted to watch. They were about 20 minutes in, and I asked my older brother (31 yo) to start it over. He did but kept calling me a crybaby and spoiling literally every 5 seconds of the movie. I couldn’t take it anymore and didn’t want to regret saying something out of anger, so I just went to my room. I ended up having a panic attack and crying alone in my room in a house full of family on Christmas Day.   No one checked up on me for the rest of the evening, and I ended up going to sleep early. That’s when the dark thoughts returned. “I hate myself”, “the world would be better of without you”, “no one cares”   I thought I had been doing so well since I started going to therapy a few months ago. I was seeing real progress. Right now, I feel really alone and unloved.   Anyway, if you read this, thanks for hearing me out. I don’t feel like I have an outlet in my personal life right now.

And if nobody is there to let you know that,I’m here to tell you.  I sometimes feel like I’m sinking, and it’s hard to get up.  But we all struggling with something will get up together.   I’m currently struggling with my weight, even though I am healthy AF. and I’ve had people tell me if I eat salads and what not why am I not skinnier, and I am here to say everybody’s body is absolutely different and we all have to find out what’s right for us.   you will find what’s right for you. you will be okay. love yourself so much you’re all you have

I used my personal crystal collection to make them!!

413	real	I got caught stealing from the grocery store [End Title]: This happened today.  Money has been tight lately and with bills and debt stacking up. Affording food starts getting difficult. I have credit cards to afford stuff yes but I'm trying to not make the debt worse. So lately I've been stealing snacks and some drinks from the grocery store. It started out small with a drink and some ready made snacks. Then started to get more and more until today when I got too cocky and greedy by taking more than I should of bargained for. I started to see hints of some employees watching me and then talking on their radio. Didn't think about it as I tried to sneak out but was then called out by them. I tried to make a fake BS excuse but I couldn't keep it up and ended up confessing. And of course the store owner was there out of all days and made me pay for them or have the police arrest me. So I spent 100$ on stuff and went home.  Learned my lesson the hard way but deserved it
816	real	I watched two kids get molested [End Title]: When I was in second grade, my friend invited me over to play. At one point, when we were finally away from the adults, she asked if I wanted to see something funny.   She then brought me to her niece &amp; nephew’s room, where she proceeded to make her niece (2) suck her nephew’s (3) penis.  I didn’t exactly understand what was happening, but I knew that it was wrong because I went home shortly after, saying I didn’t feel well. And I  never accepted an invite to this girl’s house again.  Sometimes I think about it, even though it’s kind of blurry in my head now, and I feel so ashamed of myself for letting something like that happen, for not telling someone. And then I think about how those two kids are today, if they somehow know what happened to them &amp; if it’s fucked them up.
761	real	CAS lies and abuse [End Title]: When I was 14 I was put into foster care due to issues at home and school. However instead of being placed in a home right away they put me in a detention center saying " There's no houses available at the moment ". The reason was to find a home in a different city that provided "better care" and provide testing I couldn't get in other cities.  Weeks turned to months and months turned to years as nothing got done. They later then said I had to be crown ward to get the help that I needed. After they contacted my dad which I never met they lied to him and his lawyer saying that I was too dangerous for him and my brother that lives with him. After awhile they eventually got the signatures granting my dad to have over night visits. Even his Lawyer found it suspicious after they tried to frame me as a danger to society.  During the year I was 16 they kept saying that I need these assessments. Turns out that on the day I had my appointment which I was never told about, my foster parents decided to go to a theme park instead.  Afterwards those foster parents went under investigation due to neglect, drug abuse, sexual exploitation (taking us to strip clubs cause we looked older due to facial hair and body mass)   After being with new foster parents after most quit, got fired and went under investigation I lived with a Jamaican foster mom who helped clarify to me what was really going on. CAS would take kids and turn profits from them and try to get as many kids in one house as possible. They lied to parents about the kids well beings and down played they responsiblity saying "it's his appointment he should have gone on his own" which absolutely I would have if not for information being hidden.  At the end of the day foster care never provided the support I needed that they put me into care in the first place. They lied and tried to dehumanize and criminalize me and other kids even to the faces of Lawyers. This was other 10 years ago and I feel that they unjustifiably ruined my life and others cause to them kids are their company not there priority.
248	real	I regret losing my virginity to casual sex... [End Title]: Maybe this is less about virginity and more about my sex life in general. But Im a 25 year old woman &amp; I regret having only casual partners.  I’ve only had sex with two people, neither of them were significant others or dedicated partners. Both were/are a friends with benefits situation. There is definitely nothing wrong with that or casual sex. But I feel like I have these really vulnerable moments... and the guys just leave when they’re done. It sounds cliche but no one holds me after or anything like that. The first time, even though I was on birth control, I was so scared I could get pregnant. It was an unreasonable fear but still, no one was really there to ease the anxiety or at least worry with me. Sex is also still physical painful for me at times too. So after most casual sexual encounters, I’m still left alone with both physical soreness and loneliness. I don’t even know if my partners like me...   I just wish I had started my sex life with someone who’d feel obligated to care about me. I do genuinely love my friend with benefits...as a friend. But when it comes to sex, I regret having intimate and vulnerable moments without people who could guarantee intimacy and vulnerability in return. I’m probably taking sex way too seriously, but I let people inside of me then end up just as alone as I was before
491	real	I’m so fucking angry and lost [End Title]: I’m a junior in college and have no idea how. I hate doing anything related to class and schoolwork. I skipped classes in the past because of social anxiety and now i’m skipping ONLINE classes because of the same thing, that &amp; I just literally don’t want to attend. All my friends and people around me agree that they “hate school” yet they still have the capability to get everything done and pass their classes. I don’t. Maybe I would if I cared about it at ALL. I failed two classes when everything switched to online in the spring &amp; now i’m failing two more, even with a lighter class-load. Today I realized college probably isn’t for me, so drop out right?    Well my parents have paid for my schooling and I’m extremely grateful for that, so if I dropped out I would feel terrible because they wasted thousands &amp; thousands of dollars on a shithead like me just to throw it down the drain.  My dads always said “the most important thing about college is that you finish”. I can NOT imagine going to them and saying i can’t do it. Well now i’m two and a half years in and i can’t take a minute fucking more. My grades are shit, they ask to see them and i say “it’s goin okay” because I can’t tell them I’m failing or I’ll breakdown in front of them. I don’t want to drop out and start working 40 hours a week yet. I can barely clean my room, i’m not ready for a full time job i’ll drive myself crazy. Why can’t I do school well, why can’t I wake up and get my things done like everyone around me, I can’t even get myself to do my laundry some days. I’m probably depressed but I don’t feel like it. I fucking hate myself because I’m going to let the people closest to me down, i’m going to embarrass myself. I’m about to throw my life in the trash because i can’t fucking do assignments and go to class and do SIMPLE FUCKING SHIT. I’m so mad. I could keep going but what’s the point. sorry for length. hate venting bc there’s no point besides making yourself feel better, doesn’t solve anything, this is my first and last post on this sub
35	real	finally have confidence [End Title]: At 18, I finally have confidence. Not a lot, and rarely in public, but it’s a huge difference from before. I didn’t wear short sleeve t-shirts till high school. I never wore shorts until this year. I still feel awkward in shorts, and still fear dresses and skirts, but I feel so much better about myself in general. I no longer fear having my picture taken, I no longer criticize my appearance so harshly in photos, and I feel happy when I look in the mirror. Looking back on pictures of younger me, I don’t see what I used to see. I see a beautiful young girl who’s a little bit unsure of herself. I hated myself so much. I never smiled. I felt so ugly all the time always comparing myself to others. I still have a ways to go, and I still get down on myself, but it’s nothing like before. This change only came about a month ago and it couldn’t have come at a better time. I don’t need validation to know that I’m beautiful, even if I’m not conventional. I no longer see a stranger in the mirror, I see me.
873	real	My dog got out of my yard today [End Title]: My dog got out of my yard today and down the street into the neighbords yard. I grabbed her leashe and chased after her and saw she took a massive dump in there yard. It looks like human poop because my foot prints are in the snow by it from chasing my dog. I'm going to leave it there because one time the guy who lives there yelled at me once for pulling into his driveway to turn around, and another time tried to run over my cat.

402	real	What do you do when a small part of media triggers you but it feels like it has spoiled the whole series? [End Title]: I used to be a big fan of a certain series, but I remember reading an interview where the creator talked about death and the end of the world and it was such a backlash I have a hard time focusing on anything else from then on.   Some other times series have had triggering things in them that are very small, but once they happen I can't stop thinking about it. Has this happened to any of you? What can you do to fix it?
517	real	A little help? [End Title]: Hi. This is kind of my second cry for help on this app, or, in my current case, website.   &amp;#x200B;  Sorry. If you don't care to know any backstory, skip down to the dashes.   &amp;#x200B;   I'm fourteen, fifteen in October, heading towards ninth grade. I'm pretty smart, I guess, Im taking honors classes and in a math class 2 years ahead of my grade. I'm adopted by my grandparents, I have a sister and brother, no contact with my bio parents. My life is okay, but I've been depressed for six years. In sixth grade, I started self harming, I cut constantly. In seventh grade, I wanted to kill myself for the first time, and came very, very close before I received a literally life saving call from my at the time boyfriend (who I lost my virginity to, at 13. That matters later.). We broke up in October of last year, and in December I was baker-acted for the first time. It was the most terrifying thing to ever happen to me. During this time, my grandparents went through my entire room and my cell phone, found out about the teenage stupid shit I do/did: Sex, nudes, cursing. Nothing too bad; I don't go out and drink (I have only had a maximum of 2 shots with my adult sister who supervised and cut me off), have never touched any illegal drugs (not even pot). I don't even sneak out or lie about who I'm with. I'm a pretty good kid. Anyway, during my baker act, my grandma was so angry that I curse and enjoy sex that she didn't talk to me for the entire week and a half. While my granddad did, it was frustrating. He would guilt me and make me feel like shit-whether it was accidental or on purpose is unclear. After that, I was ok for a little while. The only person who actually visited me to show love and support is my sister who has gone through the exact things I have. She is my world. Now, it's all back to hell. I still go to therapy, still on meds. I have the most supportive, though clueless, boyfriend.   \---------------------------------------------------  The current issue? I'm suicidal again. And I have been for a while, but especially since quarantine and having to stay with my family. And it's gotten worse and worse. A few days ago, maybe a week (?) or so, my boyfriend's psycho mom went through his messages, and did NOT like what she found. No nudes, but mostly innuendos and jokes. What can you expect from two teenagers in a world that refuses to sexually educate us?? She lost her shit, annnnnd called the school board (she works at our school!!!). School told my grandparents who barged in the bathroom, which I was completely nude in, getting ready for a shower, snatched my phone and went through everything. Still found out I was talking to my ex (the life saver, btw), still cursing etc. Got pissed, took my phone. Whatever, that's fine; I don't care about the phone, but now I'm bored as hell in quarantine and struggling to talk to anyone. I still have online therapy and here's when the fun part comes in!   \----  My therapist is okay, she's from the school and my "main" therapist is out on leave (she had the cutest baby). I told her everything; my depression acting up again, suicidal thoughts etc. Because Im not in immediate danger, my therapist can't call to have me baker acted. She did, however, establish a safety plan: including having constant ability to contact my sister, the suicide hotline and mobile response team (they talk to people and evaluate for baker acting). She asked me to have my phone again for safety reasons, remove all sharp objects from my room, talk to my sister about my problems, and establish a better relationship with my grandparents. Therapist called my grandparents about it, called me back to tell me what they talked about and here is the cherry on top: nothing has been done. I have personally told my grandparents all I think about is slitting my own wrists (they once walked in on me trying to slit my throat. Nothing was done, but my knives were taken...however, i found one of my bedroom floor the next day. It is still in my room now.). Nothing has been done about any of the things I feel. I tell them i'm depressed and they tell me I shouldn't be because my life is great/I have a puppy/no reason to be depressed. I'm tired and scared.   \-----  I don't want to die. I have a lot of goals in my life; I want to be a neuroscience. I want to help people, i want to stop people from going through what i've gone through. I wanna stick it to my bio parents. I recently learned I have a baby brother on my bio dad's side, who I will not see because, according to my grandma, there is no point trying to help him. I want to see my baby brother and be there for him, and show him what love really is...I know that being with my bio parents will not show him love. I have goals in life and I want to be happy. But how can I, when my own grandparents call me a trashy slut and act like I'm a terrible person? I have no idea what to do. I can't leave, but I can't stay here for three and a half more years. Help me.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: My grandparents know I'm suicidal and don't give a shit, I don't know what to do. Help me.   PS- Im posting this to sever subreddits. I don't know where would be the best place to get some help.
866	real	Do you add/follow someone you’re interested to late in the evening or early in the morning? [End Title]: So theres this guy in my workplace who I’ve never been interacted with but Im pretty sure that we are aware that we both know quite a few things about each other. He walks past me and we never had an eye contact but I feel he’s someone Ill date.  Lately, my coworkers started working with him and they all get along very well. Still we were never introduced.  But yesterday morning, my heart skipped a beat. He added me on facebook! My dillema now is Im not yet accepting request since I only add people who I actually talk to in person.   Im feeling guilty and he might think Im a total snob. The thing is Im not sure if hes adding me because its work related or Im just assuming he’s interested in me too? Who adds someone (not a new person) theyre interested to at 8am in the morning?  FYI I’m NBSB by choice at 25
511	real	I’m tired of putting on a fake smile around everyone. [End Title]: I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but my parents don’t believe it. I grew up in a household of being told to tough it out and walk it off. Lately I’ve given up on trying to talk about my feelings and just put on a fake smile and a fake personality to convince everyone I’m better than I actually am. Now I feel lost because I can’t express my feelings without turning it into some kind of joke. I wish I could just talk to people without feeling like I need a fake personality to do so.
903	fake	I tore my ass yesterday taking a constipation poop and it bled a little. [End Title]: I felt accomplished.
601	real	I hate being black. [End Title]: That's all. I hate being black in the United States. I love black culture, but I am terrified. I cannot say this in a way that makes sense and I'm sure I will get people in the comments being pissed- but I have been an anxious mess recently because of all the black people who have been dying recently and made public. I hate that we are so much more likely to die from preventable diseases because of wealth disparities. I hate that George Floyd was record being murdered and if not for the video it would be written off. I hate that if Ahmaud Arberry was called a burglar who had an incident with homeowners and would have remained being labeled a criminal if not for a video. I hate that black women are so much more likely to be victims of homicide. I hate that trans black people are so much more likely to be killed. I hate that the circumstances of my death could be dependent upon a bystander pulling out their phone and recording it happening. I cannot stop crying. I fear for myself and all of my family.    I was very very young when 9/11 happened, too young to think about it aside from in school. My parents talk about how there was collective fear and grieving felt by so many people afterwards. That's how I feel now. Like I put my life on the line by simply being.   I hate being black. I am ashamed that I could ever say that I hate being my own race, but I do.
290	real	After a week of my heaviest alcohol bender, I'm at the tail-end of my alcohol withdrawal. The dreams have been particularly vivid this time around, they were intense movies of the different Iives I could have had; I'm near the verge of tears [End Title]: In this dream it is snowy. Late dusk. Me and some friends--boys and girls--are walking home from the movies, laughing, playing in the snow.  At one of our friends home, their mother had us dinner, which we are all looking forward to.There is kindness, love and understanding. Just palpable, I can feel it in the air.   (There was a particularly vivid scene of me teaching people how to squat on the tips of one leg while using the other to draw a perfect circle around. I've never done that in my life haha or thought about it ever.)  In another dream, the white curtains are flailing in the wind coming from the open window, as me and my fiance lie in bed in a cottage, in a green field of grass. Just a walk's walk away in the next village, both our parents live. They're excitedly helping us to plan our wedding.   _  Very simple scenes, very calm, but I've never felt such intense love--to love and to be loved--like this. It's hard to put into words. My brain is still hazy, my hands shakey, as I'm recovering from this withdrawal.  I've been up, reeling in emotion. Always thought i don't need anybody, just as nobody needs me.  My brain is recovering, my body hurts, and I'm disappointed at all the things I could have had.  To make all this clear, here's a short summation of my life:  _  I'm Dee. I'm 30. I have never thought I needed romance and friendship until the dreams I just had. It's currently 5:33 and I woke up 10 minutes ago.  At 6, I left to live with my dad and saw my mother twice a year on average for another six years.  At 12 we moved halfway around the world. Have seen mom for a grand total of four times in 19 years. I still miss her and love her.  At 19, I had my first girlfriend.  At 22 I had my second--she was a math teacher a few years older. I fucked it up bad. She was perfect and put up with my alcoholic ways while trying to change me. We were going to be married and have kids. Due to my young partying ways, I decided to party until 30 instead. She's happily married and with her own family.  At 23, my third. That was intense. She wanted to start a family and help me my "stupid life of alcohol". When she left, I felt this huge hole in me. I was with her all the time, met her friends, but now there was nothing. No one to love and to be loved by.  At 24, my fourth. She was beautiful, quiet and sweet. She never said why, but I fucked up on our valentine's day by drinking with some people elsewhere, and she called it quits right after. I met her one more time, the day after. To this day I still remember the look in her green eyes, as I apologized in person on the 15th of February. She never said it, but she bailed due to my alcoholic ways. Also has a family now.  At 25, my fifth. She had anxiety and depression, I was too much of a weakling to be a man and help her through her life, which was hard and tragic. (This is around the first time I discovered this sub.)  Also at 25, my sixth. She was very easy going. By then, I'd been used to very intense relationships, lots of stormy passion. I never realized until much later how her calmness and laid-back attitude is what I needed to my wild, unrestrained passionate ways.  All these were relatively short relationships, all ended because of the bottle.  Throughout all this time I'd been studying on and off, working on off, but invariably failing all these things because I'd rather get drunk. Work, school, relationships--all fucked.  I also was in a social group were we did creative writing, but I stopped due to...can you guess?  I had lots friends, but they've moved on with their lives, while I still get drunk as a skunk.  For the past four years, as I've descended deeper, I've been single with very few friends. Their shit is in order. Mine is worse than when I was 24.  Went on a few dates during, and the girls told me "you're too fucked up to date". Women in their late 20s know not to enter somebody's shit show.   _  If you've read all this, let's talk if you'd like. Tell me about your life too. Your ambitions. I'll keep answering every single message for as long as people keep replying.   It's now 6:40 and it's been a feat typing this novella on a phone, I can tell you that haha. Formatting, shaking, just to make it readable.  _  Here's to a life that could have been!
310	real	2 years after an event, I still cannot move on [End Title]: Basically, in 2018, I moved back to my home country for the first time in my life to live without my parents in order to "learn the ways of the world".  I was living with my uncle &amp; sometimes with my aunt &amp; although I am grateful for their hospitality, I made the mistake of expecting that they would take care of me emotionally. I mean that is why I moved there right? to learn the ways of the world?  Anyways, 2 years have past &amp; I have not been home &amp; I cannot bring myself to it... because every time I think about visiting, I get those "memories".  I know it is my fault for expecting &amp; everything but why haven't I moved on? Why does that thing come up every now and then and take part of my day?  Any thoughts/suggestions?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you.
194	real	Free at last [End Title]: So I got a text message that my abuser passed away while serving a life sentence in prison and all I could do was laugh hysterically and then crying uncontrollably I finally feel free
686	real	I hate the person I was in highschool [End Title]: I graduated highschool in the spring of 2017, and ever since then I have realized that I was a horrible toxic asshole. So, I'll tell you about it because I'm upset. Also, if it at ALL sounds like I'm excusing my actions anywhere, I'm not. I'm just explaining my mental health status/mental thoughts at the time. Just because someone is going through stuff gives them no reason to treat others like shit. Let's continue.  My problems really started when I was 15 (10th grade). I became very sad and suicidal. Also when I was 15 I had Bulimia. Also with these problems came jealousy and over-possessiveness. I would get jealous if my best friend (now ex-friend) was talking to someone else, like genuinely "hey why aren't you talking to me? Are you mad at me? Do you hate me" kind of shit. I would also make up lies (like that I had Vaginismus and that was why I didn't masturbate) because I was worried that they were leaving me/going to leave me if they didn't reply to a text message in 10 minutes.   I also told them that I had been \*\*\*aulted a child (which is true actually), but then I told them that I had dreamed it up and that I lied. The reason I took back the truth was because I felt bad about telling on the person and that I was on the fence if it was bad or not (after recieving therapy I can say that yes, it was bad).   Also when my best friend at the time told me that their then boyfriend cheated on them I told one of our mutual friends without asking because I'm a dumb fuck who didn't think.   I also talked about my best friend behind their back and complained about them. Not everyday, but if they made fun of me accidentally or made me feel insecure I did. The two times I can think of when this happened was during Halloween when they saw my costume and full on laughed at me (I cried and washed my costime makeup off (I'm not saying this to make you feel bad this is simply showing my mental state at the time)) and another time at graduation when they saw my pearl necklace and told me I looked like an old woman.   I was also very emotionally unresponsive. I was shit at comforting others and still get very uncomfortable when strong emotion is displayed (especially if it's anger or sadness).   I feel like they tried to be my friend, but I was such a piece of toxic shit that it made me impossible to be around. I also wasn't as mentally developed as my friends in a lot of places, and it always made me feel left out. I noticed that we were growing apart later, but I still wanted to cling on to them because we had been friends for so long. It was comfortable for me, even though I was suffocating them. The last time I ever saw them was on my 19th birthday when they took me out for food (which was very kind of them). We barely talked, and it was awkward the entire time. I sent them a long text on facebook on their birthday, telling them happy birthday and to send me their address so I could send them a gift. They never replied to that messege, so I sent another apologizing for being a shitty friend, and told them that if our friendship was over to them to not reply (not in a mean way, just so I'd get the message). They never replied, so we don't talk anymore.   This all came to the front of my mind a little bit ago because I got a friend request on facebook from someone who we were mutual friends with in high school, and I saw my ex-bestfriend on their friend list. Everything came flooding back and I feel like even more of an asshole.   Was our friendship toxic? Yes. Did they do some mean things? Yes (I didn't mention any because this is about me). Did I do even more shitty things? Yes. Do I regret those things? Yes. Honestly, there's a part of me that wants to text them one more time and properly apologize, but I also don't want to. I want to leave them alone and for them to completly forget about me. I've just been thinking about these things lately because I have been in therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD, and it got me thinking about how my shitty attitude hurt others I cared about.   So, I just wanted to get it all off of my chest. It feels good to get out there, honestly. Please feel free to judge me in the comments.
849	real	I hate my life [End Title]: I’ve failed at everything I have ever tried and I don’t know what to do.   I dropped out of my dream school after getting so depressed my grades tanked and I lost my scholarship. My parents pulled me home to go to a local university where I couldn’t help but be reminded daily of how I ended up there. Meanwhile, all of my friends from high school are thriving at their schools and doing amazing things with scholarships and internships and award-winning projects. All of these things I only find out about from social media, since none of them talk to me anymore.   I dropped out of school altogether after this past spring semester, as my mental health continued to decline. My then-boyfriend got a job five hours away from our hometown and I moved with him into a trailer, as that was all we could afford. It was a tiny, middle-of-nowhere dump of a town where I made no friends and hated my job, but kept telling myself things would get better because I at least had him.  Well, fast forward three months and he loses his job so we move back home. The following month is filled with nothing but miscommunications despite a sit down conversation regarding how we need to communicate better in order to save our relationship. Not even a week after this, he goes AWOL for two days and when he comes back? He’d gone and enlisted in the army national guard. Something he had never mentioned ever before and just expected me to be okay with. This is the final straw for me, and I dump him. He’s since unfollowed me on all social media (which is only notable because of how childish it is) and we haven’t spoken.   I am admittedly not very beaten up about the split, only that now I am completely and utterly alone. He was my only friend and the only person who got me out of the house other than when I went to work. So here I am, 22 years old and spending my nights either picking up extra shifts at work purely for something to do or babysitting my siblings while my parents go out with their friends.  I don’t want to kill myself, because I really don’t want to die. I just don’t want to be living this life. There isn’t a single part of it that I like or am proud of. Nothing makes me happy. I haven’t felt honest joy or even basic contentment in so long I’d be lying if I said I remember what it felt like.  tl;dr: I dropped out of school, I have no friends, and I really have nothing to live for but here I am anyway.
519	real	i’m terrible at comforting people [End Title]: someone just told me two of their friends died this saturday and although i said the usual things (i’m so sorry, how are you holding up) etc i don’t really care, i mean i care about this person but not his friends so much (i didn’t know them) i’m jut waiting for him to get over it so we can hang out
952	real	I'm terrified of modern society collapsing. [End Title]: I know, a very irrational fear.   This fear mainly stems from games like Fallout, and my personal experiences.   I have absolutely no survivability skills, i'm autistic, and incredibly sensitive. As in, i cry when people yell at me. I'm so insanely terrified of modern society, the internet, all the modern pleasures we enjoy, just being destroyed overnight.   It also doesn't help that people often view people with Autism as lesser, and as weak. My main fear of it comes to where if society does collapse, i'd probably have my rights stripped away first. Considering i'm Young, i'm Asexual, i'm Autistic, and not that handy, i'd probably just get forgotten about. People in situations like that don't care about accommodating people who are "lesser" than them, every man for themself.   I dunno, i just worry about these things. I'm sorry, this probably sounds stupid, but my mind's racing about these things.  If modern society collapsed; like in a Zombie apocalypse, i'd probably just fucking kill myself. I have no desire to survive in that world.
512	real	Telling mentally ill/lonely people to just "be more confident bro" is obnoxious and incredibly privileged [End Title]: I'm a mid-functioning autistic person with major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder and an undiagnosed but medicated anxiety disorder. I used to be a fairly confident person, comfortable with myself and who I was. Then once I got to be about a pre teen everyone around me changed and started pointing out all of my flaws, and my illusion of self-worth was completely shattered and at 23 I'm not even close to fixing it. I can't just "be more confident" when I have no idea how to socially talk to or interact with people I already don't know, and don't know how to groom myself properly, or know if someone's flirting or just being friendly (option 2 is the safe bet, always). Every day I spend hours in bed after waking up because I don't have a reason to get up. I slept through my alarm this morning that was supposed to wake me up for my first therapy appointment, lol.   If "faking it till you make it" works for you/your friend/your SO, that's great, but don't fucking condescend to me about what I'm doing wrong. I didn't choose to be born this way, I didn't choose to have this unclose-able gap between myself and the people around me. This might be arrogant to say, but if you think you can truly get self worth out of faking it, you probably haven't had enough mental issues in your life and you'll be OK anyways. People assume that a low sense of self-worth just has to do with someone's warped perception of themselves, but I see myself very clearly for all the flaws I have and experience the consequences of those flaws on a daily basis. No amount of chinese fortune cookie-tier advice is going to get rid of my mental health issues or autism.   Please, for Christ's sake, just stay in your lane and don't talk about mental health issues you clearly have no ground to speak about. I'm not trying to gatekeep mental health experiences at all here, to be clear, so sorry if it came off that way, but some of these posts just reek of neurotypical privilege.
728	real	I hate YouTube's adds so much. [End Title]: I'm not even upset about the adds that play during videos but the ones that appear while browsing videos.  All I get anymore are these adds for sexual anime story games, dating sites, or gambling apps.  The anime stories are always disgusting and cringey looking.  There's one that looks like it's trying to sell itself as a dungeon crawler RPG but it's about a woman wanting to climb a tower to marry a female demon or something at the top and during the add while trying to convey RPG elements it spams "+1 GAY" on the screen.  I've never downloaded one of these games and I don't watch anime so I have no idea why they would appear.  There's a dating site for sugar mamas that is being spammed on my YouTube atm and I'm tired of it.  I understand dating sites being more mainstream but this one is just gross and it or this "news" add showing a storm near my area (the radar it shows is not where I live) are the only two adds on my mobile YouTube atm.  I'm married and have never used a dating site.  The gambling apps don't bother me as much because I don't find them as cringey as I do a rip off.  I've never downloaded one of these apps and I don't gamble so idk why Google thinks I'm the target demographic.  I've turned off personalized adds but they still appear.  I could see people falling for fake dating sites or gambling apps but the story games really confused me cause I can't imagine that would be mainstream.  Don't even get me started on the Trump adds that stay on the homepage now that the election's coming up.  TLDR:  Google thinks I'm the target demographic for sexual anime story games, dating sites for milfs, and gambling apps despite never using any of those, turning off personalized adds, and telling them I find them "inappropriate" (just cringey honestly).  I guess I should give them credit, they "try not to show that again."
969	real	I feel hurt [End Title]: Perhaps you did this to indeed hurt me to get rid of me easily?? If you didn't want to do this, then say so, if you didn't want to be my friend, then say, if you didn't want to see me at work then say so. The last thing I ever wanted was to bother you or offend you and now I can't even explain myself or even get answers as you blocked me, at the same time I hope I never see and  hear about you again as I am so hurt and embarassed of myself. I don't want to face the world and want to die. I feel so stupid
917	real	I Hate Working Saturdays [End Title]: I am aware and accept the fact that working weekends is a fact of life for a lot of jobs out there. The core of my anger and frustration over it doesn't even stem from it being the central day of the weekend and "my plans."   I have been working in the food service industry for this one business for about three years now. I have gotten to know my manager pretty well and built a pretty good relationship with them. They are fully aware that I play in a band. Before the pandemic, we worked out this little deal that they would not schedule me for the weekend shifts and I would only work Monday-Friday during the spring and summer so my band and I could freely schedule as many shows as we wanted. Basically just treat it as an availability thing, although weekends have technically been "mandatory" upon hire since the dawn of time. In return, I had agreed to be Weekend Bitch for the winter months, basically working every single weekend to give other coworkers a break from it.    I have been working pretty much every single Saturday since we re-opened back in July, with the occasional exception of Saturday shifts a coworker of mine wanted so they could earn some extra money. And I am so fucking tired of it. I have tried to keep my head up about it, because we are currently all on two 9.5-hour shifts with pandemic unemployment benefits to supplement our income. That means two days of work and suffering per week, with five days off. And I mean it when I say "suffering."   Saturdays are so fucking busy. And that's fairly universal for restaurants. What sets us apart from a lot of places is that our owner is only willing to have two of us working, /all day/ for Saturday, despite how busy it is. So it's just me and the aforementioned manager /all 9.5 hours of the day/. We used to have a middle shift where someone comes in for a few hours to ensure that we got breaks even if it was slammed. The person who worked it was only a temp, because they moved overseas recently. And now the owner has not given consent to hire a new person for that position, and no one else on our team is willing to take it. We ensure that we get to eat a meal, so we take turns taking our break and dealing with customers completely alone while the other one eats.    I'm a bit pissy at my other coworkers. None of them are willing to pick up that support shift, or work Saturday. Tough shit because one of them will have to when I move, hopefully in the next couple of months. One of them has children and an every other weekend custody thing going on, so she is excluded from my pissiness for the most part. The others basically have no reason to be unavailable on Saturday. They just don't want to work it because they're little bitches. After nine months of doing it consistently, I just wish they would share the load a little, or that my band will get to play shows soon so I can go back to that deal the manager and I made.    I don't know who came up with the idea of server wage, but server wage is BULLSHIT. Also, Saturday customers tend to either not tip or generally tip poorly, even when you kiss their ass and give them your best customer service. JUST FUCKING TIP 20% REGARDLESS, Y'ALL. Maybe someday we'll figure it out and eradicate server wage, but as it stands, restaurant workers literally /need/ those tips.    I am so grossly underpaid for the way I bust my ass for this place. On top of the server wage bullshit, only two of our employees had ever gotten a raise. I haven't gotten one in the three years I've been there now. I know some people will defend the idea of raises for merit, but the hitch in that otherwise nice little sentiment is that the owner is rarely seen and he's never around to see how exactly anyone works. He's just a cheap ass in a Tesla with a home where the kitchen by itself cost half a million dollars. He basically just doesn't want to pay any of us a living wage and it's why I hope he loses the business somehow.   I cannot wait to move away and leave this job for good. I've grown attached to it over time because I like the job itself, and my coworkers, for the most part. I'm just tired of the system we've been working under and I cannot wait to move on.

760	real	I’m so tired of my career choice [End Title]: Hi, I’m not from the US and our university system is bit more basic. You just choose a career right away, we don’t have courses you can choose, everything is already planned out if you chose that specific career. I love art, I love literature, I love philosophy and social sciences in general. In my country they mix economics and business together. You do a common plan and then they separate after 2-3 years.   I chose to go for economics because of various reasons. The main one was a mixture of my parents, whom both had to struggle because of their careers and a safety net my future. I want to study philosophy in the future.  But it hasn’t been easy, I haven’t found enjoyment for so much time in what I study that I sometimes feel so beaten. I thank the heavens I don’t suffer from any mental illness because I feel so down sometimes. I get bad grades from classes I hate and it makes me feel so fucking stupid. I like my economics classes. But there are barely 3 in the 3 years, already in 1 and a half, and almost everything else is business.   I talk to people from time to time but I just want to scream I detest everything about this career. Most of them wonders why I chose that one but don’t understand when I try to explain to them it is not that simple. I know is a not a big problem but I just needed to write this. I just feel tired. I just miss being happy about what I am passing in class, I loved school because of this.
123	real	I’m stuck in a cycle of spending money on a shitty car. [End Title]: My husband and I own a ‘97 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It breaks so often, and we spend a few hundred at the most each time it messes up. We’ve poured probably close to a thousand into it, and it’s not worth it. But there’s nothing we can do because we only own the one car and both of us are in college and have jobs. It’s just so frustrating. I feel like I’m in this endless cycle of spending money on this thing. Sometimes, unfairly so, I find myself getting angry at my husband because his love of Jeeps got us here.   We’re both in school and work as much as we can, but we don’t have a stable enough income to warrant getting a car from a dealer and making payments. He doesn’t graduate for another seven months, and we’re just fighting tooth and nail to get by even now.  TL;DR: I’m tired of spending money on a POS cars. It’s affecting my marriage and finances.
303	real	feeling so empty after my last examination ever [End Title]: Ohh boy... just finished my last examination EVER as an undergraduate. I’m starting work in less than a month’s time.   I feel so empty.   Like, what, so i’m just going to work for the rest of my life, now that i’m done with my 16 years of education?   How do I reconcile with this? :/
880	real	Overwhelmed and Confused [End Title]: There's something wrong. I just wish I have the ability to understand and say it better. I'm afraid of being alone. I'm afraid of being old, depressed, vulnerable, bitter and full of regrets. This isn't fear, it's something else but I don't know what it is. It's probably a lot more simple than what I think it is. Is that really it? Childhood is the pinnacle of human experience. If you're ugly you're done for. That I'm brown. That it's actually something I'm insecure and worried about. That there's a lot of things thats wrong with me. I'm socially inept,I'm ugly, I don't know how to keep friends, I hate my body, I'm gay, I'm brown, I'm insecure, I'm mediocre, I'm lucky to be in Australia but moving here made it worse caus now I'm a minority in the gay community, I'm insecure about getting a job, I'm losing my resentment about all the things that I hate about myself and scared that it'll make me not seek out solutions for them anymore. At least complaining about them gave me an outlet for my emotions and anger  but now that I'm starting to calm down it just feels like it's a lot easier to just leave all of these problems alone. That everytime I try to solve one of my insecurities it'll just come back and what I did before that worked doesn't work on it anymore. That suicidal thoughts feel more like a valid solution rather than a direct cause of being severely depressed.
741	real	I think I'm in the friend zone officially [End Title]: So I've been talking with this girl at my work for a good bit now, and to summarize she's has a boyfriend that she's pretty in love with but I kinda have feelings for her. Well a little bit ago she called me crying saying that she thinks she might have feelings for this other guy at work and feels really bad cause she still loves her bf a ton. It kinda hurt cause the way shes been talking and acting around me I thought for a second that she was gonna say it was me. But no I spent like 30 minutes on the phone trying to give her advice and help. Should I feel hurt even though I've never expressed my feelings toward her?

190	real	I just woke up minutes ago and i had the most terrible dream, and im so grateful it didnt happen. [End Title]: So since the start of summer, she never did chat and most of our conversations were me flooding msgs to her. I was wondering what has gotten into her.  I was upset and i couldnt sleep but last night i finally went to bed with ease. But in my dream, we saw each other at school and she decided to talk to me. I was pretty delighted  Then she started acting weird, or suspicious. i asked why and she told me shes pregnant and she got raped by a guy when she was outside.. And that was why she wasnt chatting for months..  and shes only fucking 16. In my dream i was crying like hell and i hugged her so damn hard while my tears fell  Then i woke up with my chest heavy asf. I was so thankful that it didnt really happen. So very very thankful.
102	real	Married 15 years, 5 kids. Never been in love with her [End Title]: Tl;dr below. I (48m) got married 6 months after meeting her(40f), only because I slept with her before marriage and culturally, that’s a big no-no so I had to go through with it.  Didn’t and don’t have anything in common. As I hate confrontation, have the emotional experience of an ant and generally fucked up arsehole, I’ve cheated on her, got caught, tried again (only because she’s too chicken to leave I think).  Then I met someone at work and fell in love for the first time in my life (still the highlight). Used that as an excuse to leave (that i’d been hoping to do for many years) Missed my kids, went back. Have behaved since then, had another 3 surprises born.  Now instead of cheating, I let her know how I feel and told her I don’t love her. She doesn’t like that, but accepts it and hopes one day I will. She’s a nice enough person, but we’re so different. no similar interests, no similar outlook in life. Ever religiously, I no longer believe what I did, she still does.   We’re good co-parents. No happy ending in sight. If I leave, I know i’ll miss the kids, if I stay, more of the same misery and a greater chance i’ll look for a connection outside the marriage (which I would tell her i’m doing as we-re just co-parenting). She doesn’t work, so not a bad gig on her part, I make decent money. She’s on her phone more than i’d like, wish she did more stuff with the kids, rather than just shop (sometimes spends more than we make, but doesn’t care or check).   She was addicted to collecting a particular ornament, she has over 1000 pieces that take up 2 down stairs rooms that basically we can’t use. I used to run around downstairs with the younger kids, but that’s impossible now. I was diagnosed with adhd 8 years ago, explains a lot of my past behaviors so i’ve been able to improve and be less of an asshole. Clinically depressed (no shit sherlock).  There’s more, but the book will have all the details 😃 (kidding)  TL;DR married for 15 years, never loved my wife. We have 5 kids, so I can’t leave without destroying them.
657	real	I’m tired of this bullshit us blacks face in this world. [End Title]:  There’s so much to say, but I’m going to keep this short. I’m just honestly disgusted. How can you dislike someone because of the fucking color of their skin ? How can you harbor so much hate in your heart over someone’s ethnicity ? Make it make sense. I’m honestly scared for the future of myself, my family, and others..It’s like no matter what we do we’re always going to be seen as targets or as some type of bad guy. All the movements and protests are just a waste of time because before you know it, there’s another death of an innocent black “man” on the news while the perpetrator just gets placed on leave or fired.. To add, most of the times their families never get justice. I would just love for once to see action being taken instead of having to watch a video of someone helplessly crying for help while someone records. So, so many lives could’ve been saved this way. A more recent one is, George Floyd.. May he rest in peace. I’m just ready for this all to stop. I want us to be seen as human and not a threat.
569	real	I just want to be worth something to someone without having to work myself to death [End Title]: I don't know what to say because if I put this out there, I'm going to sound like an asshole bragging. I don't want to drop my life's story either but I have no one else to vent to.   I just started divorce proceedings. I'm leaving my wife of 3 and a half years. Found out she cheated, and it's basically over. I've been glossing through my relationships, looking back and I'm just aghast. I feel like I've always had to be absolutely 100% perfect, and if I show even the slightest imperfect, I'll be thrown in the garbage.   This isn't even with my relationships, but hell even my professional relationships and so-called friendships.   I grew up poor and fatherless. Ended up doing decent in school and headed into the navy. The navy helped me get through school, but also taught me a lot about maintaining a healthly lifestyle(eating right, actual fitness-grade school doesn't teach you that-, self care-I had awful acne as a teenager and had no clue how to shave- and so forth). I graduated with a degree in industrial engineering with almost a 4.0, only sitting at 3.9.   And since then this is the life I've maintained. I maintain myself to the highest degree in all shapes and forms, all while having to attend to everyone else's needs, having to guide and support them while never having any breathing room for myself.   My wife told me that she cheated due to me not being there, but how was I supposed to be there when she couldn't curb her spending despite multiple discussions about it. How were we supposed to have time for sex when she claimed to be repulsed by me if I gained even the slightest bit of flab? Between that, and still having to take care of so much of the housework and also be the consoling, listening husband, where was I supposed to find time for that?  And you know what? None of my relationships prior to this were any better.   I wish I could let myself go even slightly and still be loved, still be respected.
857	real	"Fetish" Shaming should be normalized [End Title]: Alright so this is a weird topic and it's kind of a sensitive topic, but hopefully most agree and I can explain my reasoning.  So with today's culture alot of human have created different acts of sexual pleasure that each party can enjoy, but there should be a HUGE line that should be drawn between moral and immoral.  I've meet or have seen people who are into fetishes such as, but not limited to, BDSM, Feet, Furry, etc. and that's great. I'm personally more Vanilla than Ice Cream, but if you enjoy it, hell yeah!  However, there are acts which I think people should be shamed for and need legitimate help...  An example would be the r*pe and cheating fetishes...  These are legitimate things people are into wether it's porn or hentai or whatever and it's disgusting and should not be ignored and pushed aside. Alot people who defend this use the excuse of it not actually being "real", but how far does that actually extend? Imagine telling your partner that you're into fantasy r*pe or cheating?!! you wouldn't have that partner much longer unless you're both equally gross.    I did get into an argument with a person into this stuff and they said there's something called CNC, which is Consenual Non-Consent...How the hell does that make sense? There's consent or non consent you can just mix the two together because you have a sick mind.   No normal human being would be okay with this and I shouldn't get shamed for my stance and opinion. I don't care if anyone here tries to defend this because I won't listen. It angers me to no end that you can't take a second and be like, "oh yeah...this is weird, I need help to fix this disgusting thought in my mind."   I did try and make a post like this awhile ago, but either no mod saw this or didn't want to post this because of the nature, but if you do please look into this because I don't want to be breaking any rules I just want more people and be aware and not brush this side of any culture away.  Thank you for reading.
426	real	I want to help out others [End Title]: Today I saw a video on YouTube of a girl who is a burn survivor and she shared her story. She is very beautiful and so strong and brave for sharing her story....At the end of the video I cried really hard for several reasons. One, it made me realize how ungrateful I am. I am young, healthy, have two jobs, have a roof over my head, I have a father who provides a lot for me, I have food in my stomach everyday, my family is healthy, etc. I have all of these things and SO much more to be grateful for, and yet I take it for granted everyday. I get so stuck and centered in on my daily problems that I overlook all the things I should be grateful for. So after I saw that video, I felt so shitty that I complain about such small things that many  people would much rather have in some cases. Two, it made me think, why do bad things happen to good people? It’s not fair that such tragedies happen to good people. It hurts my heart a lot to think about this. Why is it that there’s so many other people who live such a good life while there’s so many other people who are suffering either from mental illness or a tragedy? The world isn’t fair and it upsets me.    Thinking about how we need to spread more love and positivity in the world is needed more and more everyday. How can I live my life so selfishly and not want to help others or give back? It’s always been a goal of mine, to want to help out others and also our environment. However, it wasn’t a main goal of mine until now. That video made me realize I have to do a lot more. I truly want to dedicate myself to helping out others in every way that I possibly can. Whether it’s through acts of kindness, donating, showing support, and just going above and beyond to make someone’s day better.   As of right now I’m going into real estate. I was going to invest in multiple properties to gain more money in the end and just kinda have fun with whatever I earn. Now, I want to take that money and create a non profit organization to help out others all across the board.   I know this might come off as cheesy to a lot of people, but I can’t live my life selfishly while there’s other people suffering and in need of help. I think it’s important for all of us to remember to just be kind to one another. That goes a long way too and if you can do more than that to support or help someone, it’s life changing.   I hope someday the world can be a better place where we all can be more kind and empathetic towards one another. Because in the end, we’re all going through challenges and we all suffer in some way or another.
961	real	Exhausted [End Title]: I’m just so, so tired of being sick and tired.
296	real	I once said a horrible thing about a black classmate [End Title]: This is destroying my conscience so I need to get it out somewhere.   I’m white and I live in the UK where slavery wasn’t taught to me until I turned 13, no idea why I think it should be changed. I knew the N word was a ‘swear word’ but I had no idea of the history behind it and if I did I never would have said it ever.   There was a new boy in school (black) and there aren’t many black people in my small white town so people were curious, well I was at the park with my friend and we were talking about him and I blurted out ‘he’s a n word’. It was not the hard r but immediately after that I felt regret, I knew I shouldn’t say it but had no idea why at the time because the history hadn’t been taught to me yet. I was 12 so I should’ve known better but my parents kept me very ignorant and only told me not to use it but never gave my a history lesson behind it.   I never said it to his face and I never said it again after I found out the meaning and strongly advocate against racism now.   It eats me up inside. I feel awful for saying it. I will never be at peace with myself knowing that I said something like that about someone else even if it wasn’t to their face. I really deserve to suffer and I am really sorry.   I expect people to say horrible things about me but I needed to get it out. I have worked hard to educate myself every day and do better. I had no malicious intent to the boy and I wish him all the best, like I said if I had known how bad it really was I wouldn’t have said it.   Thanks for reading. I’m really really sorry.  Edit: I just want to say in case it wasn’t clear. I knew it was a bad word to say to black people but that’s all I knew. I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal like people tell you not to call girls ‘bitches’ but we do anyway. I had no idea the word meant slave and if I had known how derogatory it was I wouldn’t have said it. If I had known the connotations behind the word I never would have said it. I was just plain ignorant and thought it was just a swear word that didn’t really matter if you said it out loud. Until I grew up and realised how wrong I was. Also the reason I felt regret is just because I didn’t want to be a mean person in the slightest so even when I believed it wasn’t that bad I still felt regret because I didn’t want to be even a little mean to anyone.
470	real	I cant help falling for my best friends. [End Title]: Ive fallen for two girls in the last seven years and both of them are people who I considered as one of if not my best friend at the time.  The first girl became my first girlfriend but the relationship ultimately ended because she wanted something different. We havent contacted each other since. The second girl simply didnt feel the same way about me aside from being really close friends. She wants to stay close friends but ultimately things got awkward.  Idk what it is but I just can't fall for people I wasnt already close with. But at the same time, I cant help but  become scared of confessing my feelings in the future or getting into a relationship because im afraid of losing a really close connection.  At this point, i just feel so drained and alone. And i am so scared ill ruin another friendship by falling for a friend.
990	real	Masturbating makes me cry [End Title]: I get insanely nauseous and I can't get into the pleasure aspect of it. My boyfriend and I are long distance and he wants me to be intimate with him through text, voice, or pictures/video... I feel like I'm failing him because every time I try to get myself into that sexual mode, I get flashbacks to my rape. All the physical sensations and emotional distress I felt back then come rushing back. I've been doing EMDR therapy and I feel as though it's making things worse in this department.
224	real	I’m really ill and I’m fed up with people. [End Title]: I got really ill in early November with tonsillitis. I never really got better, my voice still sounds like a frog, my muscles are constantly sore and I’m always tired. I put up with this until about late April when I finally went to see a doctor. Over the last month I’ve been blood tested for just about everything, and all of its come back negative. It’s now been decided that nothing more can be done for me at a GP and I need to go to a specialist.  I haven’t actually had too much of an issue with the medical side of things(other than doctors trying to think there’s nothing wrong with me but... that would need another post) It’s the social side I’m finding really difficult. Every time I talk to someone I get the ‘you should take a nap’ or the ‘are you feeling any better?’, or perhaps ‘have you looked into this condition? I’m sure you have this!’ and they’re all fucking annoying. If it was as simple as taking a nap or having a rest I would’ve done that 7 months ago, and because I’ve been ill for that long with no results at the GP the chance of me getting better next week is pretty bloody slim, and I wouldn’t be going to a bloody specialist if web-diagnosis was a thing.  Thing is, when people say these things they’re not trying to be patronising. They genuinely are worried and want to help. But being ill is bad enough, especially coming to terms that you could be chronically ill, without people constantly asking when I’ll get better. I know as well that the fatigue is making me far less patient, but I’m too tired to have a go at anyone so you just have to awkwardly reply with something and have a cry about it later.  Anyway, thanks reading my rant.

THEN HE STARTS HUFFING AND SAYS "FUCKING SHIT SHOW" WHEN HE SEE'S THE APARTMENT AND ASK IF THE CLEANING LADY WE HIRE CAME ONCE A WEEK CAME AND I SAID NO BECAUSE THE HOUSE HAS BEEN CLEANED AND DIDN'T NEED HER.  HIS IDEA OF A SHIT SHOW IS MY LAPTOP AND THINGS ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE, I EXPLAINED I HAVE HAD NO ENERGY TO PICK UP MY THINGS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SICK.   HE SPENDS SOME TIME SIGHING THEN GOES TO BED AND APOLOGIZES FOR OVER REACTING.   &amp;#x200B;  THE MORNING OF MY BIRTHDAY STARTS OFF WELL, I'M GETTING LOVELY MESSAGES, HE SAYS HAPPY BDAY.  I WAKE UP THOUGH COVERED IN SWEAT AND THE BED SOAKED IN SWEAT BECAUSE I HAD A 102 FEVER THE NIGHT BEFORE.  HE BEGINS TO START TO CLEAN UP THE HOUSE BECAUSE MY MOM AND 16 YEAR OLD BROTHER ARE COMING OVER FOR DINNER AND MY MOM IS MAKING SOUP SO I CAN FEEL BETTER.  AS HE BEGINS TO CLEAN  HE SAYS " THIS PLACE IS A FUCKING SHIT SHOW" AND BEGINS HUFFING.  THEN HE TELLS ME TO GET OUT OF BED WHILE I FEEL CRUMBY AND SO HE CAN WASH SHEETS AND THEN TELLS ME I NEED TO START CLEANING AS WELL....ALL MY JOINTS HURT.   HE KEEPS SAYING THAT HE HAS BEEN GONE FOR 20 DAYS AND EXPECTS THE HOUSE TO FEEL CLEAN AND I TELL HIM IT IS, AND HE GOES ON ABOUT HOW IT ISN'T.  I START TO SHUT DOWN.  HE THEN GETS UPSET BECAUSE I HAVEN'T CHOSEN WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND I TOLD HIM IM SICK AND JUST WANT TO TAKE IT EASY.    &amp;#x200B;  WE GET INTO A FIGHT AND I BEGIN TO CRY AND WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SIT IN PARK AND BEGIN TO SWEAT AND FEEL DIZZY BUT CAN'T GO HOME BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL WELCOMED.  THE FIGHT WAS BECAUSE I TOLD HIM I DONT CARE WHAT HE THINKS OF THE HOUSE I JUST WANT TO CHILL AND SPEND TIME WITH HIM, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN SO LONG. MY MOM WONT CARE IF THE HOUSE IS A BIT MESSY EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T.   &amp;#x200B;  WE MAKE UP AND I BEGIN TO FEEL BETTER BECAUSE I TOLD HIM EVEN THOUGH HE MAY BE JET LAGGED AND TIRED HE NEEDS TO REMEMBER IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE A CHILL DAY.  I'M NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING BUT COZY DAY.  MY MOM AND BROTHER COME OVER AND WE ARE ALL GOOD UNTIL MY LIL BROTHER WHO IS HIGH SCHOOL EXPRESSES HE WANTS TO BE A SOCCER PLAYER AND MY BF TELLS HIM IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO HIM AND TO BE REALISTIC. MY BROTHER GETS UPSET BECAUSE MY BF WAY OF APPROACHING HIM WAS AGGRESSIVE AND FATHER LIKE.  MY LIL BROTHER AND LIKE MYSELF WERE RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM.  MY BROTHER LEAVES AND I HAVE TO PUT OUT THAT FIRE AND TOLD MY BF HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO MEAN AND SHIT ON HIS DREAMS.  MY BROTHER SAYS HE WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN MY HOUSE AND MY BF SAYS AFTER FINDING OUT MY BROTHER SAID THIS, THAT MY BROTHER ISN'T ALLOWED IN OUR HOUSE.   THEN MY MOM AND BROTHER LEAVE WITHOUT SINGING ME HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND I TELL MY BF HE WAS OUT OF LINE FOR SPEAKING TO MY BROTHER LIKE THAT AND SAYING HE ISN'T ALLOWED IN OUR HOUSE AND HE IS A GROWN MAN AND SHOULDN'T BE RESORTING TO A TEENAGERS MINDSET.  HE THEN SAYS "OF COURSE, IM THE BAD GUY AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST FUCKING LOONEY TUNES" I BEGIN TO CRY AGAIN BECAUSE I'M EXHAUSTED OF ALL THE DRAMA.   &amp;#x200B;  I GO FOR A WALK AND RETURN AND TRY TO SALVAGE THE 3 HOURS LEFT OF MY BDAY BY SAYING LETS JUST MOVE FORWARD AND SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  HE REFUSES SO I SING MYSELF HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND THATS WHEN I BREAK INTO A FULL SOB.  CHECK MY PHONE AND MY MOM TEXTS "SORRY WE RUINED YOUR BDAY" AND I TELL HER SHE DIDN'T RUIN ANYTHING.    &amp;#x200B;  I JUST FEEL LIKE BREAKING UP WITH HIM BECAUSE HE IS SO FOCUSED ON PROVING HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING WRONG.  AND IF HE FEELS AT FAULT HE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE IT'S A CONSPIRACY AGANIST HIM.   HE NEVER APOLOGIZED WILLINGLY UNLESS I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD...ALL I WANTED FOR TODAY WAS A CHILL DAY.   ALL I WANTED FROM HIM WAS FOR HIM TO APOLGOZIE AND SAY "IM SORRY, I OVER REACTED AND TODAY WAS ABOUT YOU, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS."   &amp;#x200B;  AND NOW I FEEL NUMB AND SAD.  I WANT TO RUN AWAY FROM HIM AND MY FAMILY AND BE LEFT ALONE.  I HATE HIM FOR BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD.
353	real	I miss her a lot today, it hurts like it used to. [End Title]: I miss talking to her about everything, attending to her, looking after her. I miss holding her, kissing her, cooking with her, eating with her, joking with her, sleeping with her. We had a real connection, but it all went up in flames as I started to get depressed about moving away for study.  It's been over a year since she broke up and cut me off. I hate her brother so much, that fuckwit played a hand in our demise, I'm sure of it. She listens to anything he says. He put me down so much in her eyes, she would tell me he's being unfair to me somedays. But other days she would pressure me to prove him wrong. I said it's fine, I can ignore his words... I had experienced about 8 years of bullying and isolation through school. I learnt to deal with "words".  We became so toxic towards the end. But rewind 2 months and you wouldn't even think anything was wrong between us two. I did make mistakes, I made plenty. I apologized to her through email 2 months ago, she didn't respond... I didn't really expect her to.  I regret leaving my studies to come back home. Everything just went downhill for me. I became who he made me out to be, a loser. Fuck COVID, fuck him. I'm going to lose two years of progress because I couldn't handle my break up. I never thought we'd end, she made me believe she'd be there for me.
238	real	Mistook a panic attack for heart problems and went to the ER [End Title]: So this happened last night, I am just home now and I feel pretty embarrassed. I woke up in the midst of a panic attack, something I've never experienced before and I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was scared that there was something wrong with my heart, I called my parents to bring me to the ER, So after hours of waiting and all the checks, x-ray, ECG and blood work, nothing was found. I was perfectly healthy, it was a stress induced panic attack, I guess I haven't been managing my stress with college and finals correctly.  I really feel embarrassed, for possibly taking up time and resources that someone else might need and for not taking care of myself property.  TLDR; Mistook a bad experience for something worse.  Edit: guy's thank you so much for your kind responses, it really helps ease my mind, I could not appreciate you morem
566	real	Help [End Title]: One of my teachers is this 25-year old dude who is ripped and honestly has an awesome personality. So, I'm attracted to him especially because he pays special attention to me and stuff to make sure I succeed. Well, today we were doing a practice STARR and were sitting in alphabetical order. So, of course I'm in the front row cause I'm close to the front of the alphabet even though I usually sit near the back. Btw, his desk is in the very front. So, anyways, I make eye contact with him when I'm done for a bit longer than normal and I blushed a lot. And of course I realized just how beautiful his eyes are and maybe get horny. And maybe I want to go to the bathroom(to do ya know) but I'm too afraid to ask. So I might have spent a good half hour blushing while reading and was really horny the whole time. And at the end of class, he was picking up our papers and he came really close to me when he got mine. And I feel comfortable and like a young girl in his presence. Btw, I'm 16 so I know it most likely will never happen but he is an awesome dude with a personality that might seem weird to some but that I admire. What should I do?
991	real	Getting kicked out by my step family [End Title]: This will be my first post ever, but i really needed to get this off my chest.

227	real	i bullied this girl when i was 13 and i still regret to this day [End Title]:  UPDATE : she replied " it's okay i forgive u. it's fine i got over it thanks for apologizing " -  i replied that i would make it up to her and thanked her for forgiving me generously and i'm waiting for her to reply again ;;  thank you all of u who gave me the courage to message her i hope she feels better and more at ease ,, i read every single comment and i love all of you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  i apologize as this post is very messy and i'm not very good at expressing myself or telling stories so i want to thank every single one of u who commented and it's touching how many people are willing to come forward and share their own personal stories from different perspectives. i learnt that everyone reacts differently to every situation and there is no one correct way to approach this ; but to those who said they hope i die i have nothing to say. i genuinely do regret hurting others and i hope she is not traumatised.  um i guess that's it ? i don't want to make this too long so i guess this will end here.  once again thank you all so much and i hope everyone has learnt something one way or another because i've learnt more about bullying in this one post than in my entire primary school life 💜  ~ story ~ - i was a total beach honestly all she wanted to do was eat lunch with me but i made her life a living hell  edit : for those of u asking why i bullied her it's partially because i myself was bullied at 9/10 years old... it hurt so much but i didn't know that it was bullying until i grew older and i realised that i projected the hatred of others onto an innocent girl and she suffered so much because of my actions so now i feel super guilty...  i know it was wrong of me and i know how it feels to be an outcast... so i just messaged her and I'll update when she replies :')  edit 2 : i apologize if my confession is really incomplete i typed it out on a whim so for clarification she was my target solely because my other classmates disliked her for slacking on group work ; although she wasn't in my group since my whole clique was bullying her ( verbally ) i fit in by throwing insults at her and whenever she talked to me i was cold and extremely rude ; however i did not instigate anything and i felt bad because she was hurt and i could see how affected she was. she initiated conversation with me because we were in the same orientation group ( in my country 13 is where u go to a new school ) and i was sort of the 'leader' of my clique because i was very extroverted and i tried to get along with everybody. i genuinely wish i could take back all the hurt because she didn't deserve it,, she was ( and still is ) an extremely nice person. hence everyone took advantage of it and trampled on her because they knew she was too scared to tell the teacher.  and i'm 15 now if anyone wants to know haha  edit 3 : holy crap this blew up way bigger than i expected ;; i'm so grateful for everyone who offered me advice and how to approach her / how to format my message i genuinely appreciate it so much and for those who shared their own stories it really opened another perspective and allowed me to see why and how different people may react from certain messages / incidents ❤️❤️ thank you all of u so much  i can't really keep up with the comments i'm sorry it's 4am for me right now i'll reply in the morning and be sure to update if she replies 💜

743	real	Manipulation with a baby is the deepest level of disrespect. [End Title]: I am so angry with my sister in-law and I seriously think my little brother is being a bit of a pushover.  Last night my little brother called me and he was clearly not doing ok. For him, dating is not exactly easy. He has Aspergers and it’s hard for him to get his feelings across, even emotions are hard for him to understand, he’s not very empathetic. But last night he clearly was upset and ready for a good cry.  2 months ago, his girlfriends nana died, they were very close and she now has this hole in her heart. She chose to handle her death in a very unhealthy way, by telling my brother that she wants a baby. Now it came to a surprise when my brother told me he actually wants kids, he never came off as the paternal type. So we all sat down and we talked about the pros and cons, mainly focusing on the cons at this time, they are both young and they haven’t really been together long enough to build that amount of mutual commitment.   Just when we thought we put that thought to bed, my brother calls, and tells me what she said to him.  She said that she still thinks they should have a baby and when my brother said no and that he’s not ready for that, she said:  “I’m 95% tempted to go to a sperm bank.”   I was shocked when he told me that. That is a breeding ground of trust issues, he feels like he needs to start hiding his condoms and he’s now considering a vasectomy. I think he should’ve dumped her. But he wants to see if he can talk to her first, he loves her and he thinks that she might be the one, but I beg to differ now.  I understand that she’s hurting from her loss and we’ve tried explaining that a baby won’t replace her nana. I told my lil bro that it might be time to break up. If someone is willing to say something like that or even think about manipulating him like that and cornering him is the lowest of the low. I’m 99% tempted to drive up there and give her a piece of my mind.
432	real	what's wrong with me? [End Title]: I have no fucking clue what the hell is wrong with me. this year has honestly been the worst for me, and I feel like its never getting better. earlier this year I did the worst thing a high school teenager could possibly do: my sex-tape got leaked and everyone found out. schools that I didn't even know *existed* had it. my entire family found out. and when I found out during fifth period, right before lunch, as soon as the bell rang I ran out to my friends. I pretended like nothing happened but I felt eyes on me everywhere. I started getting texts from people saying "Albert, is this you? people are airdropping it to everyone." My friends noticed every pair of eyes watching me as I walked down the hallway, and as soon as they asked me if I was okay, I broke down into tears and fell on the floor crying. *in front of everyone.* the next morning, school admin pulled me out of my first period class and I just remember walking there, having the biggest panic attack and feeling so anxious to even step foot into the office. "*im assuming you know why you're here?"* of course I did. *"how are you feeling?"* I tried killing myself the night this happened. the worst part is that my best friend leaked it. she sent it to her boyfriend or boy toy or whatever it is to her and he sent it to the entire football team. luckily, the police officer handling my case wasn't a dick and my parents were out for Las Vegas this all went down. my mom called me, she was so mad at me, and god I couldn't blame her. shit I would be mad too. I haven't even came out to her and she just found out from school saying that her sons sex-tape involving two other guys got leaked. im pretty sure admin told her I was having suicidal thoughts. she asked me if she wanted me to come back. I stayed in the school office from first period to 5 pm. my grandma had to come pick me up since she was the only guardian I had that was nearby since my parents were in Nevada already. the police officer didn't tell her every detail what had happened, but he just said to keep an eye out for me and keep me close, and that I was the victim in the situation. she didn't know about any video, she didn't know anything. she kept checking on me and I remember that night I gained over 400 followers on instagram and homophobic dms. I decided to go to school the next day and own it like a fucking bad ass, and I remember during lunch I received a text message from her saying that she loves me and she didn't want me to do anything that would harm me. this meant so much to me and it was honestly the most comforting thing I could ever receive. I loved her so much.  to this day, from February to September 29, I still occasionally get teased for it by homophobic guys, but I'm glad I have friends to defend me.  but since then, I've had the worst year. I started drinking and smoking after this, not constantly, but at parties whenever I had the chance. I was the most sober kid and wouldn't even think of getting drunk or high, even though it was always around me and I would always get offered. im always getting in trouble for something every other week, and I feel like its just non stop negative energy and my life isn't getting better. I know its my fault for some of the decisions I make, but honestly, since the February incident I just don't give a fuck about my life anymore. I've literally considered taking Molly, ecstasy, acid, and other stimulants to get rid of my terrible thoughts, but I'm glad I haven't taken anything other than weed and alcohol. my parents have this weird thing for me not sleeping over at friends houses, but I still stay but I get grounded for it the day after. I hate being home. My house is so toxic, and sure I have everything I could ask for. Just got a new MacBook Pro, I have a new iPhone, camera, and I'm supported financially, but not emotionally. I share a room with my little brother though, which sucks ass. He tells my parents everything I say or do, and twists the story around in a negative direction. I'm always getting told on and then grounded, and its fucking annoying.  I've always wanted a boyfriend. Someone to be there for me whenever. Love me, hold me, go on dates with, to tell them all the shit I go through. Fuck, I come with a lot of baggage but I have so much fucking love and care to give to people but not anyone at my house (except my dog, I love her&lt;3) but yeah, I have friends, but never anyone to love the way I want. someone to hug and cry with.  I've tried killing myself 7 times this year. Overdosing, slitting my wrists, drowning, suffocating. Anything to go away. I'm happy at school and with friends, but some days I just feel like shit. Am I depressed? I don't know.
221	real	Why’re you on tinder if you’re just going to ghost people [End Title]: I don’t understand why ghosting is so common on tinder when it shouldn’t. This app is literally designed for dates. It’s designed for you to actually get to know somebody and potentially date them.   I get that this shifted to a hookup culture, and that now tinder is used to hookup. That’s fine. The only problem is people ghosting others and it being **so god damn common.**  I chatted this girl up for a few weeks. Not hours or days. But literally weeks. We chatted for about three weeks and we decided to finally meet for a cup of coffee. She ghosted me a day before we were supposed to meet. She never answered and then when the next day came for us to meet she never even answered me. What the fuck was the point of talking to me for that long then?  I ranted to my friends and they said that being ghosted is what happens most of the tine on good old tinder. I was so confused. Why the fuck are you going to download the app and just ghost someone if you don’t want them. Also, can’t you pick who you match with? So why would you purposely match with somebody, and then ghost them? You’re the one who literally matched me!?  It’s so confusing. I’m aggravated. She was a pretty decent girl and am upset that she’d just literally never speak to me again for no reason one day before going on a date. And apparently this is common???? Delete the app if you’re just going to ghost someone.
702	real	My oldest brother is an asshole [End Title]: My relationship with my brother has never been the best. We don’t really communicate even though we’ve been around each other for years. One time, he was giving me shit over something and he said he was gonna “Slap me like a hoe” and me being an angsty teenager, replied with “Do it.” Nothing happened after that but he tried telling our mom that I was in the wrong. He’s been super aggressive towards my other siblings. For example, he physically fought my brother for having a pet snake, slapped my sister, and throwing her to the ground during an argument. I don’t know if something is wrong with me, but I always have an urge of hurting him. He’s hurt all of my siblings and I’m just waiting in line.
390	real	I don't know where you went but I hope you're ok.

This morning I checked it again and the whole conversation has disappeared, not sure whats happened and I am regretting not taking note of your username. If you see this, I am still here ready to listen to your troubles, you are not alone.
902	real	My job is stressing me out so much yet I can't even pay for my own wisdom tooth extraction. [End Title]: Hi, I'm a 19 year old who works as a call center agent 8 hours a day, 5 times a week. Recently, I started to have really awful pain in my lower jawbone and muscles. It was definitely my wisdom teeth.  I spent 2 days contacting various dental clinics (included in my workplace's HMO handbook) which were supposedly accredited and should cover dental procedures that I may need. Then, I got a panoramic x-ray (which was pretty expensive for an x-ray, also not covered and came out from my pocket) and saw that 3 of my wisdom teeth needed to be extracted.   Come to find out that ALL the clinics that I contacted no longer accept my job's HMO and even if they did, it would NOT cover the cost of a wisdom tooth extraction. I get paid every 2 weeks and the price for a wisdom tooth extraction is almost 95% of my twice-a-month salary. I am STRESSED out of my ass and I want to quit my job every day and it just feels like everything is so awful right now. I've never been this unhappy. I'm definitely caving in emotionally.  My parents can't help me with the cost because they are already struggling financially and I'm supposed to give money every salary to help with groceries and other costs.
9	real	Manipulated into doing gay sex when I was 10 [End Title]: When I was 10, I had this friend and he was always the pervert, looking up and watching porn on his dad's computer. At the time, I knew nothing about sex, but always attracted to girls. One day, I went over his house to play and he was showing me all these new porn he found. Couldn't remember all the details since it has been 11 years. But I guess I was a little pervert too since he didn't force me or nothing. Neither of us got hard so there was no penetration. We are the only ones who know about it, I lost contact with him 10 years ago because I went to America

He lost his job, his house, and most of his friends because of this drug.  My boyfriend went in to see you for a rash and he left your office with 60 pills which he immediately took home and snorted.  Fuck my boyfriend for asking for them but also fuck you to the doctor who decided that giving them to him was a good idea.
665	real	I don't let go easy [End Title]: Too much time has passed. Tears streaming down my face. I love a Ghost of what was or never was. I love a man who never existed. He never loved me back. Time to forget certain things. Time to understand letting go is healthy. I will let go of my idea of him I will let go. And I will be happy.  I have always been butt crazy in love BUT I can be happy with myself. I will do things I love, try new things, start new things, and enjoy life! I want to LIVE not just survive! Acceptance is the first path to healing. So for ME I am going to live
26	real	Can’t Live Normally Anymore Without Emotional Intimacy [End Title]: For so long in my life, I have considered myself highly independent and generally pretty chipper. The most important thing in my life was working hard at my job and feeling fulfilled professionally.  It has been 3 years since my last serious relationship. It was also the longest one I’ve been in and I was getting on great once I recovered from it. At first, I never thought I would be able to love again so I just focused on myself and turning things around. I have all of these amazing friends in my life who are there for me no matter what, but in the past year or so, I have been longing for something more. I can count on one hand the amount of dates I’ve gone on since that last relationship, all of them went great, but all of the people I’ve seen ended up being emotionally unavailable.  Now, with quarantine loneliness and not being able to find someone who is ready for a commitment it just feels like there is a gaping, ever growing void in my life. I am so ready to just love someone who loves me and give them everything I’ve got, but my timing is perpetually off. Sometimes it feels that I’ll be alone forever. I’m still so young so why does it feel like my life is over already if I can’t find someone? I will never understand this feeling. I can’t just bring myself to focus more on work anymore and while my friends are wonderful, it would just be so nice to find someone that I can pour some coffee with in the morning and just talk— someone who finds my flaws endearing and who loves me just as much as I love them. As the title says, I just can’t continue normally anymore and have no idea how to help myself.
22	real	Trauma left a lasting mark. (TRIGGER WARNING FOR ABUSE/SUICIDE/SELF HARM) [End Title]: **TL;DR- I'm recovering from trauma, and thought I was doing really well. However, I've noticed a lot of subconscious issues that stem from said trauma, and it's killing me. I can't find my niche and I second guess myself too much.**  Hi there. I don't really know where else to post this, and I really need help/ to vent.  **PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST THERAPY, I HAVE A THERAPIST. I'LL ELABORATE BELOW. Also just a quick note, I've been diagnosed with OCD tendencies resulting from abuse.**  I'm a 17F, and I grew up with a very abusive stepmom. **DONT WORRY, I AM OUT OF THAT HOUSE NOW, AND I HAVE BEEN FOR 2 YEARS NOW.**  Anyways, I was in that household for basically my entire life, save for the past 2 years that I've been living away from her with my father.  During these past 2 years, I've grown a lot. However, the first 1.5 years were awful. I became very depressed, began self harming, and was intensely suicidal. I've only just crawled out of that pit for good about 8 months ago (I still have bad days, but I am really healthy now for the most part!) I've learned to love myself, am very self assured/ confident, and I'm learning more about myself every day. It's interesting to finally start getting to know my personality away from the suicidality/trauma/abuse, and I'm so happy that I'm alive! I've made a lot of improvements, and I'm happy.  I went to therapy for a while, until my therapist decided that I was doing very well, and we stopped having scheduled appointments. I can call her whenever I need her, but I haven't spoken to her since last October. I haven't really needed to.  However, here's the issue: I've realized that there are a lot of subconscious issues that I have left over from my trauma. Being in quarantine has helped me realize that there are a lot of things I still haven't gotten over.  For starters, I second guess myself a LOT. I am very confident, but I'm also pretty critical of myself and tend to quit a lot of things before I even start due to the fear that I won't be good enough. It's almost entirely self conscious, and I've often written it off as procrastination/laziness.  Just for a quick background, I was often called stupid, and also had objects thrown at me as a very young child for not being able to do math problems correctly. It was incredibly traumatizing and I can still see how it has affected me.  I know that I'm a pretty capable person, but I never get anything done. I love creating things, and want to take up a few hobbies/sports I've always been interested in, but I never go anywhere with any of them. I know I have potential in certain places, but I never put in the work to improve myself. I live with this undying fear of never been good enough. I just tell myself "oh I'll get around to it, I'm just being lazy haha" but it's SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I literally just feel like I can't be good at anything, even though I know that's not true.  It feels like I haven't found my niche, even though tons of people around me already have. Whether it's a sport or an art form that they appreciate, they know what they want to focus on. For me, I'm just sitting here saying "I want to do this and this and this" but once I start, I quit before I can progress. I KNOW I have so much potential, but I'm just not going anywhere with anything.  In school, I constantly choose the easiest classes. I know I can do better. I know that I can put in the work and effort and easily succeed in higher classes, but I just don't. I even doubt my abilities in easier classes and put off assignments.  Math is the WORST issue, though. I constantly find myself intentionally guessing on math tests, and I'm always flunking them. I got a 540 math score on the SAT because I would freeze up on math problems, panic, and end up guessing. It happened both times I took the test. I could barely write on my tear-stained paper. I had thousands of dollars spent on me to go to SAT classes, and I didn't retain anything. I KNEW how to do the math, but I still froze up and second guessed myself. I know it has a lot to do with the way I was treated growing up. I can vividly remember those moments I was screamed at for not understanding math. I asked for help and didn't get it. Even though it was years upon years ago, it's still painful as all hell for me. It's not like I ALWAYS return to that moment when I do math, but the damage is still there. I guess on every math problem I do unless I know FOR SURE that I understand the formula. Halfway through math problems, I sometimes just give up and stop putting in effort. When I see my scores, I call myself stupid and break down and feel like giving up. I don't know how to fix this. I'm virtually terrified of math now.  I value intellect, but my inability to focus on math/ follow through with it makes me feel incredibly stupid. I know I could be very good at it but I just... Suck at it. I doubt myself so much to the point that it feels like I'm lowering my intelligence.  Anyways, I think that's all I wanted to say. I don't know what to do. A lot of these things are very subconscious but now that I'm more aware of them, I'm starting to feel discouraged about recovering. I don't want to be a loser. I want to find my niche and be good at it. I want to enjoy what I'm doing, and stick with it. I can't hold myself to anything....
31	real	I don't think I want to be in a relationship anymore. [End Title]: My partner and I have been together for 4 years. Nothing is wrong and my s/o is really great but I think i want to be single. Has this happened to anyone else and what should I do? Should I wait and see if my feelings change? Im 24 and im so conflicted. I don't know what I'd say if they asked me why, I dont have a good reason. I'm scared of hurting them or breaking up being a bad idea. idk what to do or think.

923	real	I just lost my virginity [End Title]: 19(M) I just lost my virginity today to my girlfriend and nobody knows that we're dating and we like it like that but I just feel like telling everyone what I did today. I feel extremely proud of myself that I could lose it to someone who wants me for the person I am and also she's very attractive.
104	real	Does she make him smile [End Title]: As he told me he's proposing to another woman, when he never wanted to marry me, I wondered, does she make him smile?  Well, he never smiled and only ever had a scowl on his face the months that I knew him. It was very sad, that he could never be happy. I never saw any pictures with him smiling. And the one picture he sent me, wherein I could tell by his eyes he had to have been smiling, he dubbed a fake beard and mustache in over his face so the smile could not be seen.  His eyebrows were always so intense that he had permanent wrinkles between his brows at only age 30. And he was a man of very deep passions and curiosity. So all the drawings I sketched of him, from the pics he sent me, had frowns on the faces and that very deep furrow in his brow.  But there were two times he smiled the entire times we were together. I'd never be able to forget those two times.  When he told me he'd marry her, I attempted to imagine him smiling over that detail, picking out a ring at the jeweler, bragging to his mother and sister about his plan. I tried to imagine his joy. Yet I couldn't because the thing is, he still loved me and told me so. He told me he can't stop thinking about me night and day. So this made me wonder, did these thoughts of me leave an indelible frown on his face and that frown extended into his idea to propose and buy the ring and share his plan, etc?  I imagined being there officiating at his wedding, as a chaplain. Would he smile on his wedding day? What about on his honeymoon? Would he be smiling then? Could he smile when his first child is born? Could he smile watching his toddler's first steps?
605	real	I shit into a bag and threw it out the window [End Title]: So a few years ago I moved into a house that had just had a complete refurbishment. The bathroom was completely brand new and the water hadn't been connected yet. So of course the toilet didn't have any water in it and obviously wouldn't flush, for some fucking reason they thought it would be okay to let me move in the day before someone came to sort the water out.   Anyway I'm properly dying for a shit and I have no where else to go, all my friends live miles away and I don't drive. I'm in the middle of nowhere so there's no restaurants or public toilets around. I didn't know any of the neighbours and felt way too anxious to knock on their doors and ask to use the toilet.   So I sort of hooked a plastic bag around the bowl of the toilet, shit into it, tied the bag up and was like fuck where can I put this bag of turd? We didn't have an outside bin yet and obviously I can't keep a bag of human shit inside my house...   Anyway I figured I would just place it outside and wait til I got an outside bin and be done with it... but life had to go and fuck me over yet again! So as I go to open the back door to the house guess what happens? The key snaps inside the lock. So the doors locked and I can't open it at all. Fuck. I'm literally stuck with a bag of shit and can't get to my back garden to throw it out.   Anyway I just decided at this point the only thing I could do was throw this bag of turd to the back of the garden through the window. So I'm there just literally launching a bag of my human shit out of the top window of my new house. Luckily it managed to fall into like a hidden bit in the garden and no one saw me do it. I just put it into the outside bin the next day when I got one and that was the end of it all.   So yeah guys, moral of the story, make sure your waters all set up in your house before you move in.
234	real	All for the Wrong Reasons. [End Title]: I got into a relationship for the wrong reasons, but now I'm happy, and guilty.   I don't want to disclose why or what it was, but basically, I was initially attracted to someone because of the wrong reason. It was a physical thing, and I don't feel comfortable saying, even with Reddit being anonymous, so I won’t disclose it.   I met her my first day of college. We got to talking. She broke up with her boyfriend. I lost my virginity to her the next day.   We say things are gonna be chill, casual. All of a sudden there are feelings involved. We both feel them. I'm an anxiously attached person in relationships. She accepts me for who I am. She is so beautiful, and I come to learn it is who she is on the inside that I truly enjoy, even more than how gorgeous she is to me. I come to realize the initial reason I may have been attracted to her doesn't even f\*cking matter! But I still feel guilty. I still feel guilty because I had thoughts, and I was attracted to her for the wrong reason. Now I'm not, and I realized how I viewed things wrong and have corrected how it could affect me in the future- but I'm the paranoid type. I feel like someone will find out and expose me. I get pretty anxious pretty often and I'm paranoid sometimes. I wish I could tell her, but it just seems wrong. I'm having trouble forgiving myself. I always do.   Is it okay, since I realized my mistake? We've talked a little about it, but I haven't fully disclosed that I went into it partially with the wrong mentality. By the time we became closer it wasn't even in my mind, but I still feel guilty for how I once felt.   I'm sorry this is kinda vague, but even with a burner I'm still paranoid. I just needed to vent.
996	real	My Friend Comitted Suicide [End Title]: He was 59. He lived two doors down from me. The best neighbour I ever had. Would do anything to help someone. He was excited to be a grandfather in December. I can’t stop thinking about how he was feeling. Was he afraid? Was he sad? Was he angry? We spoke just a couple of days ago. Did he know then that he was going to do it? Did he talk to his children on the phone that day knowing? I wish I could’ve seen the signs, I wish I could’ve done something. I’m so sorry for him and his family. He was a good friend. A good man.
738	real	If I could monetize my suicide, I'd kill myself for my brother. [End Title]: It just doesn't pay out that way.
272	real	I’m tired of trying to show you my loyalty and love when you constantly say that I’m cheating on you or that I don’t loved you. [End Title]: I tell you I love you everyday, I do things with you and your family, I clean the whole house, I watch movies with you, I stopped doing things I enjoy doing because you say I don’t give you any time, I cuddle with you every night before you fall asleep then I go play video games.   I have changed a lot and you still fucking say that I don’t show you affection .  I’m sorry I can’t drown you in affection like you do me.  I don’t like feeling suffocated, I like my space and you don’t like being alone at all.  We are not married   I don’t need someone telling me how to live my life and what decisions to make .  I’m a grown ass man, I need my space and I don’t want to feel like I’m holding a little kids hand, I shouldn’t have to go to the store with you EVERY time , there is stuff I want to do at home , we’re both adults capable of doing things on our own.
456	real	Throw away for obvious reasons, had written in my phone for a few days and need to vent [End Title]: I feel like I never got a real sincere apology or any type of "compensation" for your actions. You got caught cheating and had everyone feeling sorry for you because it was played off as an addiction.... yet you stopped going to meetings, never did any of the steps, and didn't see any issues with that.   If it was actually an addiction, then why didnt you keep going? You know an addict cant stop on his own.   You played the victim this entire time. When I was hurting and trying to heal, and I would get angry or bothered and have anything to say in regards to what you did, you would loose it on me. I was never allowed to grieve. I wasn't allowed to get angry (with the exception of that first day you got caught). I wasn't allowed to bring it up without being rebutted.   I asked your parents for help. For the most part, I thought they helped a little bit. They said it best, when they said we should look at this as even playing ground now... despite our screw ups being on different levels; but I got it. I spent $25 g in a few short months time, and you cheated... for what you say is 4 years. I agreed with them in saying it's even playing field, and I didn't want to have it hanging over my head..   Fast forward to August 2019 (1.75 years since my mess, and almost 5 months since yours) and there's been no change from you. The last "talk" we had resulted in me crying my eyes out because you tore me apart. You said I could be my mother, and again held the finances above my head saying there was nothing done when I screwed up.  How dare you.  How can you even say that there was nothing done when I screwed up. I worked 2 jobs, making some of my days 17 hours or more, with maybe 3 hours of sleep before going in to teach the next morning.  I lost access to our money, to my own money. To this day, I still cannot withdraw from my WFCU account, and it's a joint account and I can't even do anything with it on my own.... yet the only money that goes in there, is the money I've earned and the CCB. I got rid of all credit cards (understandably so) and finally (after you messed up) I was able to get one off of your credit card with a $500 limit for emergencies (which is fine, I haven't even had to use it, but it took over a year before even getting that).  I have gone without on an abundance of occassions because of the justification on me spending that absurd amount of money... and for a long time I understood... sort of. It's hard when birthdays, other special occassions go by and theres no gift... but what hurt, was even after what you put me threw, my birthday and mothers day (which happen within 2 - 3 weeks of each other) went by unnoticed. I didn't even get a card for my birthday until the day after, and mothers day you didn't even encourage the girls to do anything or say anything until I pointed it out... yet we had to go and spend all day at your parents house for mothers day, despite that not being what i want... however on fathers day, we dont go spend it there and that's okay.   During our "talk" you said how there are some time where you want to give me "that gift" but a lot of other days where you can't because of what I did.... I explained to you I don't need a big gift. I just need the reassurance, the feeling of love I get when you pour your heart into a card.. picking me up a simple coffee or a candy or something when you're out because you're thinking of me. I don't need a lot of money spent on me, but goddamnit does it ever fucking hurt when I get 0 acknowledgement for anything. Theres been anniversaries missed. Theres been days where I just get all dolled up and pretty to be noticed by you and you don't even see it (but you noticed it for 4 years on other women ever fucking day).   I carried your daughters for you. My body has been occupied; weight gained, stretch Mark's, swollen hands and feet, puking all for these girls I'm doing my best to raise, for you. They are the greatest gifts you've ever given me; and none of them were intentional.   I've asked for you to propose because i never got one. You use to throw in my face that i don't get one because of the money i spent. After being cheated on, i took the majority of my wedding rings off (i wear my thin band but not the diamond or promise ring) hoping you will notice and maybe come to think that hey, she really does deserve that sincere proposal of pouring my heart out... but you haven't even noticed. Haven't asked as to why. Not even a comment.   My heart is broken. It has been since I caught you... you use to break me down and make me feel like shit all the time for the years you felt I treated you like garbage. Yet now I know you were cheating that whole time. Theres no emotional connection, no communication, and as much as I try to pour my love out, you're still boarded up anyways. I don't want to do this anymore.  I don't want to be your wife if it's this one sided.  I don't want to be told I'm my mother and need to change because I've already changed so much for you. You've broken me down to the point where there is nothing left to change.  I don't want to walk away, but I know I'll have to one day... and that saddens me. It saddens me for the kids. I don't want to do that to them but how much can I take?  I don't believe that you won't ever cheat on me again... you didn't follow through with your group or the steps and there's been no changes in our marriage so I have no reason to think you wouldn't.  I don't believe you will ever stop tearing me apart. I think you'll always comment on "my reality" and compare me to my mother, but I'm 26 years old and I'm more aware of my thoughts and feelings; well enough to know I'm not schizophrenic or bi polar and am NOTHING like my mother.  I don't believe you will ever think enough of me to think of me on your own -- I don't think you'll ever just pick something up for me, for just because. I don't think you'll ever just get a random gift for a holiday or something. Even christmas. I have to purchase my own gifts every year.  I don't think your communication/emotional skills will ever improve. I don't think your capable of doing that, at least not with me. You don't know how to tell me how you feel (in a safe way) and you don't know how to respond to me when I try to pour anything like that into you.  Lastly, I don't think you even like me as a person. And honestly, I don't like you. You are a great father when it comes to our girls -- that is playing with them and encouraging them, etc. But in all other aspects, you are just a shitty person with an inflated ego that thinks he's done nothing wrong. You had a wife that catered to you; to this day I still clean up your end table in the morning because you've left all your dirty dishes there over night again. I wash and fold and put away all your clothes. I buy you what you need for your lunches because you will not go out and buy it yourself. When it comes to paperwork and filling out forms (this goes back to uni) I did all of that for you while you relaxed and played your xbox. I make sure every inch of this house is clean (with little, now currently none) help from you.  I'm the only one who cooks.  I'm the only one who gets up with our littlest, even when you took a week off to be at home with us. You were suppose to be helping me and all you did was treat it as a vacation and play video games. You didn't lift a finger around the house. During that week, you kept saying how you wanted to buy a playstation... how you should have with how "cheap" they were... yet ON SALE was $300.... but hey, I bet you totally deserve to spend that $300 on yourself. You also kept saying how you didnt want to go back to work. But I know you werent kidding. This was also the week you tore me apart. Our first week home with our newborn, and i call you out on smoking pot all say, so you rip me a part... I'm sure just to justify to yourself and make yourself feel better. But you broke me that day. That was the day I realized I didn't want to be with you anymore. Not like this. I can't do this anymore, with the one sidedness and feeling that you never do anything wrong ; that still I'm the one who needs to change. That my feelings aren't real, and that everything is actually good.   Well it's not.   There is so much more I want to say, and maybe another time I'll sit here and write out more. But for now, these are the things I'll never get to say to you. Maybe if I do ever leave, I'll send them to you then.
712	real	So Confused [End Title]: I'm 17 and don't have any friends. Everyday is just like the last. I sleep, eat, and play on my phone for the rest of the day  (5-12 hrs). I have accomplished nothing in my life other than being somewhat decent at drawing, but even at drawing I feel useless since I don't practice much.   Overall, my life is just bland and repetitive. I used to cry a lot wishing something would change or for someone to appear and make me feel less lonely. That never happened. It's been  almost 2 years since the last time I've cried about my life. Occasionally I think about how things are going for me... no friends/ only talking to classmates and everything I've missed out on, but the thoughts don't feel as crippling as they were 2 years ago. It has me confused because everything is still the same. Am I OK now?
2	real	It’s almost been a year [End Title]: Why won’t she just give me 5 minutes. My life is destroyed she has won. So why can’t she just do this one thing. Is it really to much to ask for? I’m tired of living this way. She claims not to want me dead but doesn’t want to help me. So does she want me to live this way the rest of my life? I wish I had a car I would just go see her at least then I could get some answers. Even if she did help me I would still have to live the rest of my life alone. So maybe she is right by not talking to me and she is trying to save me from having to spend so long miserable and I would be better off just letting go now.
785	real	Trying to build and getting nowhere [End Title]: I realize that by many standards around the world I have it great. But as I lay here sleepless I had to say this to someone.  Life has been a struggle. For a long time. Most days I really want to end it. But i can't because i have a son who needs me. I work full time. Parent him 50/50 with my ex.   In the last few years, I abruptly had a decade long relationship end, left a career in teaching after suffering a traumatic amount of abuse in a correctional school, and landed a job that was doomed to start because the owners were looking for a chance to bail.  I became so depressed that I sought peofessional help but all that has done so far is add yet another bill onto the pile that I cant afford.   I got an okay job in August after losing my job vecause of corona in March.   I've been trying to catch up since then but i can't. Ive sold my collection of Magic the Gathering cards that Ive had since childhood and I cant use that to suppliment my income anymore.  And still i keep falling behind. Rent is 40% of my monthly pay, basic bills like utilities and my car take up another 25-40%. Im left scrapping by and still trting to give my son a life that he would be proud of on an income barely cracking 35k compared to his other home where his mom makes almost 6 figures.   And now, my main support system, who i rely on for childcare, and so much more, my mom has falling ill and is being quarantined while awaiting corona results. I'm trying to put on a brave face because neither her not my son need to see me struggling.   But now I lose my childcare for my work shifts.   I just feel broken.
780	real	Someone stole my car! [End Title]: I’m new to reddit but wanted to share my story so forgive me if this isn’t the place for what I’m about to post.   2020 has been a unforgettable and painful year for so many reasons but last night someone thought it would be a good idea to add extra pain and misery to me personally by stealing my car. I know to some this may seem privileged and for others they may wish a stolen car was the least of their worries but imagine being an essential worker who has been working non stop to support the most vulnerable people in our communities, working 7 days a week non stop since March in 2 jobs trying to support as many people as possible. I did take a break last weekend because my manager insisted but I felt as though I was letting people down so logged on my laptop and worked from home! They say their is something about us Social Workers that we just never switch off and I must admit that’s true and I love my job, the people I work with and the members of the public I work for!  I qualified just before the world went into crisis and to celebrate I bought the car of my dreams outright in March because I wanted to remind myself of the achievement I had made and that the endless university assignments and assessments were all worth it even more so that it’s unlikely my class won’t have a graduation. Now it feels like I punch in the gut and the sleepless nights are not because of my anxieties due to deadlines but because I feel deflated and defeated.  My closet friends think I should start a crowdfund but I’ve never been a person to ask for other people’s charity. So thought I’d share my thoughts and see what happens.   Some people are probably wondering how someone stole my car well this is  the crazy bit. I don’t even know as I still have both keys! When I reported it to the police they didn’t seem very surprised because apparently it’s quite common that cars are stolen without their keys however saying that you’d think Audi’s were better equipped or better yet some will say that’s what happens when you buy an Audi!  Anyway that’s my story!
622	real	The nasty person formerly know as FF. [End Title]: Fyi, a good lay doesn't nail someone in the head with their knee.   The only thing good about you is that you're sick like me.  Then you went on to kink shame me and cry that you were abused my actions.   I've got the texts logs where you begged me to do it. I even said I wasn't comfortable with it.  Your one redeeming quality for the "relationship" we had was chemistry. Obviously it wasn't good enough or I wouldn't have dumped you.  I even remember stating that you started things when I was vulnerable. You agreed.  You love to say you know what abuse is.  I honestly hope you figure it out before your next relationship. All of your fuck buddies won't help you. But I don't wish you ill. I just can't take on a project when I'm already in one, let alone anything else.
443	real	I'm having panic attacks about university and I don't have anyone to talk to. [End Title]: Naturally this is my alt-account but I really just needed to tell someone this or at the very least write it out.  To most of the people that know me I'm the "happy-go-lucky", charming, rarely serious, barely anything-phases-him, a rock to build on kinda guy. Which I am... most of the time.   Most issues I can easily ignore or deal with with ease, but some deep stuff I only tell my very very good friends.   Now with another Corona lockdown in my country and the fact that I'm seeing my friends even less. I really don't want to talk to them about how rough of a time I'm having in the little time that I do speak with them, because I don't want to appear weak or associate our hangouts negatively because that's all I want to talk about.  For example last weekend I went on a hike with a friend for about 2 hours and it always takes me a good while to get comfortable and to be able to tell people how I'm really feeling in description and she had her own issues in her life she wanted to talk about. Not stupid internal issues like mental health as I have, but financial and family issues which hit her really hard and she really needed to talk about. So after that I didn't bring my thing up to not burden her.  Generally my default answer when people ask how I'm doing is now is "fine", " it's corona so meh" or to really good friends a "bad" after which I give a charming smile and laugh to not to worry them.   But it's hard keeping up the mask now. I'm constantly stressed out about my exams and failing my courses, which means I don't do anything out of fear of failing and the stress, which means I get even more stressed which just perpetuates the cycle. Today I looked at the group assignment I had to submit this week and I had a panic attack and couldn't continue for a bit.  It helps to talk about stuff like this but I don't really feel comfortable telling anyone because I was raised with the idea that I am already a weakling and I need to appear/ be strong. Which is a mindset I have tried very hard for the past couple of years to get rid of, to some extent successfully thankfully, but it's still somewhat present.   Hell I just realized I use a lot of diminutives and adjectives in my speech naturally to make things appear less serious and better than they seem.  My mom might understand, but I'm scared of telling her, because I feel like a failure. It's not even that much work or that hard but I just get frozen up and have a panic attack when I think about it.   I'm already taking longer over my bachelor than intended and I'm feeling like a pathetic, unambitious failure compared to my friends. They all seem to have incredible passions for their fields, whereas I do not.
399	real	I rat on my brother when he’s eating snacks that I like [End Title]: For context, my brother is a bit on the... *ahem* heavier side, and my mom is really hard on him about random snacks during the day, especially unhealthy ones. Me and my brother are pretty cool, all sibling teasing aside, we have each other’s backs.  He sneaks the snacks on the regular, but I usually don’t tell mom bc sibling solidarity. What he doesn’t know that when he’s eating something that I like, like oreos, or ***my*** *fucking sweet chili doritos* that he *swore* he didn’t like, I go and snitch to mom.   I tell her not to make it obvious that I told her, citing that my brother would get mad at me. She pretends to walk in to do something a couple minutes after I get back, and she “notices” he’s eating a snack when she didn’t say he could. I’ve been doing this for years, and he doesn’t suspect a thing.   Feel like an absolute asshole, but if I am, I’m an asshole with full custody of the oreos :)  PS: to my brother, if you’re reading this, stop eating my fucking doritos

I’m to point where I’m feeling like I should’ve just quit my job since  I’m not able to be with my child and I’m  not getting any extra pay at all   I’m just feeling overwhelmed and needed to get it off my chest.
914	real	I cried for the first time in about 8 years last night, and it felt incredible. [End Title]: I was very drunk, hanging out with the boys. A couple of them went to bed and it was just me and my closest friend sitting on the deck. We’ll call him T, me and T have been best friends since the 7th grade, and we just started talking about everything. Our pasts and hoe similar they are, relationships, girls, families… and at one point I just broke, I shed a single tear and he looked at me and just said ‘I love you brother, that’s until death’ and I just broke, I mean a grown ass, 19 year old man sobbing on a deck at 2 am, and it felt incredible. He didn’t but before we headed back inside I looked at him and said ‘you know you’re next right?’ And he said ‘I hope so man, and we had a good laugh about it. I feel good now. It felt good to get that out. But part of me feels like less of a man. And I know that’s dumb.

Do you get joy out of it? My cum filled my underwear and is dripping down my leg. All because of you. I'm at my wife's funeral right now and I cummed all over her coffin. My great grandpa looked at this post and cummed so hard he died! Now I have to got to two funerals, all because of you. My great grandma slapped me in the face, which made me cum even more! I'm sitting in a pool of my own cum with two dead people in this room, just because you had to post this.

96	real	Opened eyes [End Title]: I’ve learned over the past years that you can literally walk pass your enemy wave and smile at them, not knowing they are your enemy ( someone who is working against you to destroy you) Some individuals are so nice and polite but in the end they bite. You can live under the same roof as your enemy and not know it. I was so naive and gullible at one point in my life. My trials have made me stronger and more aware of those I come into contact with. I’ve gained much wisdom from watching the snakes around me. Not all help is good help. While some people are genuinely helpful and polite there are others who come with an agenda to destroy you. They get close to you, learn your habits only to destroy you. Years ago I only wanted to see the good in people, but now I’ve gone through so much and learned much as well. I’m thankful for the wisdom. Be careful everyone. Know who’s for you and know those who are against you. People RARELY change.. when they reveal themselves to you the first time believe it wholeheartedly.
214	real	Found out today that my mom is cheating on my dad and my dad hits my mom [End Title]: sorry for the typos or incorrect grammar i just need to say this somehwere  Today I woke up and and my sister showed me a video that she took at about 6 am where you can hear my dad throwing things and hearing my mom and dad shout at eachother at each other and you can hear my dad hitting my mom and her screaming. My room is all the way down in the basement so I didn't hear it. I could barely believe it because my parents have always seemed like each others best friends, where they would always side with each other over me and my sisters, or they would hang out outside together and just would always be around each other laughing and joking and would always watch shows together and stuff. so I saw this video and realized my parents havent been around eachtoehr much and seem to be avoiding each other around the house for the last 4 days. then I went upstairs this evening to just check on my mom because i was really worried but i didn't want to let her know that I heard what happened because it seems like they are trying to hide it from us so I just asked her what she was doing and i caught a glimpse of her phone screen and im about 90% sure that it was tinder. I just feel like my family is falling apart and because im the oldest sister I have to keep it together for my younger sisters and i just don't know how to handle it because Ive always thought my parents genuinely truly loved eachtoehr  and now its all falling apart and i don't know what to do
807	real	I want a girlfriend [End Title]: I want a girlfriend. I thought I was at a point where I could finally have one but now I'm not sure. So many women have came into my life and we talked but nothing happened. They all said that I'm handsome, cute, charming but I didn't get anything afterwards. All of this makes no sense. I'm not a perfect person but I'm trying to put myself out there and meet someone. I just don't understand anything anymore..do women just wanna use me until they're tired of me? Am I just a plaything or do they just like the thought of me?
388	real	I don’t want you anymore [End Title]: For months I cried, mourned losing you.  I even tried to take my life because it hurt so much and I just wanted to stop being in pain.   It caused me to finally seek help, and It’s almost two months since I started my antidepressant.   You were a mistake. One I wish I could undo. But I’ll move forward and leave you in the past where mistakes and regrets belong.   I want nothing to do with you.  You hurt me more than anything else You tossed six years aside as if they were nothing. As if I was nothing.   I deserved better than you. I deserved to have been talked to when things were bad. Like I always talked to you when something in our six years together was bothering me.   There will come a day that you miss me. That you wonder how your first boyfriend is doing.   But I won’t be there.   You’ll have to live your life knowing that your first hates you and wants nothing to do with you.   I’m finally moved on.  I’m finally free of you.   I’m looking forward to the future and no longer wishing you were here.   Fuck you.
667	real	I was fired today [End Title]: I’m pissed and I want to scream UNFAIR. Please tell me, how do you move forward?  If you have time to read, below is my story. I just want to get it off my chest.   I was hired into a very promising company by a friend I knew from some years back. He’d be my manager. Truth be told, I’m not the best at my job but definitely not the worst. One thing I always do is put in the work, lots of it. But I have a few things working against me, I was new to the country/ market (ie, lack of local knowledge), and I’ve been working remotely overseas due to COVID travel restriction for the last 7 months (I’m 1 year into the job). The biggest drawback, however, is my manager/ so called ‘friend’. He’s one of the most demanding people I’ve ever worked for. He constantly points out my shortcomings to the point that I’m more afraid to screw up than trying to get things done well, let alone being creative and innovative and all that. Today, he sat me down and without any warning, any improvement period, anything at all, told me it’s not working out and I need to resign immediately. It’s not like I was doing wonderfully and this came out of nowhere. But I feel like a slap in the face, the shock, the anger, and certain level of betray. My so called friend thought I could be of use to him so he hired me. But once it turns out that I need some help with my current job, or even that I can be placed in a different job that is more suitable than my current one, he doesn’t do any of it, just you’re trash and you need to go. Some will say don’t be naive, your work is not your source of trust and stability, but yea I guess I’m a sucker in believing in people doing the right things and it really sucks.
483	real	I was groomed from 14-16 [End Title]: It didn't start out as grooming but it ended that way. He was rejected by a girl then saw me as an opportunity. He talked me through my drivers license then he talked me through sending nudes. I said no and he kept pushing. He called me his best friend he loved bombed me, he even invited me to stay with him if I could get the money. Then one day he said I was annoying and blocked me. I could move on through that but then he invited me to a discord chat with his friends where they ridiculed me and said it was my fault. Once I went into the server he modded and exposed him he told everyone he had only met me two days ago. He told everyone he didn't do anything and at the same time he said he never asked for pictures. He muted me I didn't realize it at the time it was because he was scared of what I had to say. I showed as much proof as I could, but everyone said "he only knew you for 3days" . I  had a two day breakdown but now it's turned into a lifelong one. I tried to get over it with a "it was your fault you're fine move on" then I had nightmares about the situation and then I started deleting all trace of myself from the internet. Only using temp emails and accounts. I was shameful. Now I can't masturbate or think of anything sexual without taking me back to the whole situation sometimes if I dont think about it for awhile it'll pop up and I'll have sleepless nights replaying it. Its eating me alive I've tried to change my viewpoint from it wasn't my fault it was his. He knew better. It kept eating me alive. I shaved my head so I can pretend to be a different person but it's still eating me alive. I go through his socials now watching him live a normal life with no recollection of the situation as though it never happened. Sometimes when I think about it I smack my head as hard as i can hoping the memory will disappear. No one knows this happened and I don't think any one will. If someone found out I think I'd kill myself. I dont look at men the same now, to me even if they don't show any predatory behavior I still see them as child predators. Im an adult now. Maybe getting it off my chest will let me sleep this week. I just want him to apologize, to say my name and not deny ever knowing me. Maybe he's shameful for his actions, maybe he's trying to be a different person like me. But he gets to forget about it and thats what bothers me the most. He gets to say it never happened, he gets to walk away.
460	real	People that talk shit behind others backs. [End Title]: I moved to Canada couple years ago and although I love the country I don't get this habit some people have of talking behind each others backs. Why would you smile and be friendly with someone to start spilling shit on them soon as they leave the room? I am not saying be rude to them, but at least be somewhat sincere. I heard someone say once that telling someone you dislike something about them is "toxic", and when done in their absence isn't. Do a lot of people actually believe this? If you don't want to say it to the person's face how about you keep your fucking opinion to yourself then? Otherwise you're not helping anyone.  Just to clarify, I am not encouraging people to talk shit to each other. I just don't understand how it is normalized to be super nice to someone in a group and start saying the worst things about them soon as they can't hear you. And if you want to talk about being civil, I don't see how its civil to make someone seem as an asshole to others just because you think so.
779	real	People should not be allowed in mask-required spaces if they aren’t wearing one properly [End Title]: Right now my city is under an order requiring everyone to wear a mask when they’re in public and can’t maintain social distancing. Essentially, our city is a petri dish with infection rates increasing daily.  Despite the mask order I still see people wearing their mask below the nose, especially in grocery stores. I’ve even seen someone take their mask off for a second to cough in a store. I understand masks won’t protect entirely, but when there’s a requirement to wear one an establishment should enforce it as much as they can.
507	real	My desire [End Title]: I know it sounds stupid, but I have an innate desire to leave my college, run away from my family and friends, forget everything I grew up with, and just live in a forest or the woods like a wild man. I don't know why but a life like that, even one with potential dangers excites me more than the traditional path of growing older, having kids, then dying type of life that my ancestors have led. It sounds stupid, but it's my personal desire, I have no aspirations in the civilized world. I hate the idea of a 9-5 job and I find no meaning in anything the way my life is now. I want to live as a mountain man, but I know I never will
120	real	Skinny boys are valid just the way they are [End Title]: For a bit of background, I'm a 20 year old male, and I'm 6"3 and roughly 150 pounds. I'm considered to be medically "unhealthy".  No matter what I eat, I don't gain weight. I also have very little muscle, so I'm basically skin and bone.  The stigma and attitude surrounding skinny males, and skinny people in general is awful. Skinny shaming is a huge issue.  I've been told many times that I need to visit a gym, even by people who didn't workout themselves. I've been told even more times that I needed to eat more, despite eating regular amounts of food. Society's prescription for skinny guys is to work out, and eat more, and then and only then will your body be beautiful.  The thing is, I dont want to work out. I'm active and do a lot of walking, but building muscles doesn't appeal to me. I consider myself healthy, yet I will always be seen as unhealthy in my super skinny body. When I do a Google search for articles promoting body positivity for skinny men, instead I'm bombarded with workout routines, diets, and ways to make myself different.  Male culture has this idea that a man must be muscly and physically strong, and have "plenty of meat on their bones".  Thess attitudes are unnecessary and harmful.  Dont get me wrong, if someone wants to exercise and change their body, regardless of body type,  that's great! That's their right to do so. But shaming males or really anyone who are perfectly healthy and fine the way they are is not okay. Even if they're not healthy, it's none of your fucking business.  I do not plan on going to the gym, and I'm going to wear all the tank tops I want. And I'm not making any excuses for this skinny body. And neither should you. Skinny boys are valid just the way they are.
261	fake	I'm a peeping tom but instead of watching I listen and do the deed during [End Title]:     I live in a basement of someone's house cause they're family owns apartments and so this guy made his basement into a nice studio loft. My landlord is same age and gender as me (late 20's male). I like to use porn to masturbate but there is something about hearing/seeing people have sex in real life that really gets me off. My landlords girlfriend is a definite moaner and I've always loved women who moan during sex. I realized I could hear them if I didn't make any noise and I thought it was pretty hot; it would get me in the mood and I would use porn to finish myself off.   Anyways, to why I made this post. I discovered that the closer I was to the vents, the better I could hear them. I have a vent in the closet that is the biggest one down here, maybe it's the main outflow for when the heater/AC goes on? Whatever, point is, I can stand on a stool and put by ear up to the vent (it's about 7ish ft high) and listen to every moan, breath, and ball slap that goes on and I think it's so fucking hot. My landlord and his girlfriend are pretty attractive people it's not like I have to pretend they are someone else while listening either.  I feel like a trained dog because whenever I think I hear a moan, I rush over to the closet, get on the stool, dick-in-hand and put my ear up to the vent, hoping to get some audio porn. Half the time it's a false alarm, but when it isn't, it's so hot and I proceed to have a great orgasm.   So another lesser confession would be that one time I heard what sounded like moans and so habit kicked in. Stand on stool, dick out, ear to vent, proceed to masturbate. Half-way through I realize it's the girlfriend crying and making moaning sounds, not sex-moaning sounds. I almost shot my load off to a woman crying by herself at midnight. Fuck that was weird. Fuck I'm a weirdo for even getting half-way there.
64	real	I Hate My Business Self and It's Bleeding Over [End Title]: I used to be good at what I do- knowledgeable, attentive and driven. I was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, people in my line of work in the country- it's not something that young people really want to do. I got shit done, and I got shit done the way that the old guard didn't- because I'm enthusiastic about what I do, I approach it like an engineer. *How do I make it better? Why are we doing things this way? What are the long-term effects of this?* I wasn't content until I knew it all.  I'm now co-owner by way of the owner getting sick and leaving me and my partner on the line for millions upon millions of dollars of debt. Debt at insane terms. Debt that leaves multiple people threatening lawsuits we cannot afford. My co-owner doesn't understand business and I'm too slammed to run the business. My general manager generally doesn't because he has talents that are needed elsewhere in the company. My co-owner's general manager generally doesn't because he fucking sucks at his job.  Enter the annoyed clients and the creditors asking why we're late. Enter payrolls being late. Enter robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Enter me being overwhelmed, having panic attacks, being medicated for the first time in my life. Enter me losing my optimism. Enter me gaining my hatred and my bitterness. Enter me dodging client calls because I've been making excuses for more than a year and a half now and what the everloving fuck am I supposed to do- make more excuses? I don't have the money to finish almost anything.  COVID took my recharging place away from me for months, now it's open and I just can't go out there. I don't want to bring my funk there. It's a fine and pristine place and I want to go there when I'm already in a good mood so I can come back in a great mood.  Oh, and I fucked up my side hustle, which was doing great and was on the verge of becoming a household name, because I fell into a depressive episode and hurt my customer service reputation.  I want to run away. This isn't my life anymore.
782	real	Even though I don't believe in God, I still feel warm inside when someone tells me, "God bless you!" [End Title]: Basically title. Nice and simple. Kindness is universal folks.
821	real	Nudes [End Title]: Sometimes I take a particularly amazing suggestive/nude photo to send to my SO and think, "damn, what a shame only one person is ever going to appreciate this!" I would never violate his trust and share them with anyone else, but sometimes I'm proud of the photos and think it's a shame, especially since they usually end up in a folder that he doesn't look at super often.
867	real	I’m living my life as a lie [End Title]: I’m convinced that I have a mental condition. Since a young age, I’ve lied about the stupidest things even to complete strangers. I remember making up a lies in elementary and middle school about things like smoking weed and cigarettes at a young age, 11 to be exact, and drinking alcohol, which I told everyone that I started doing at 12. There’s a chunk of my life that I don’t talk about because of my supposed gang affiliation at the age of 13. I just can’t help but lie. I’ve told everyone that I know that I lost my virginity in middle school, but in reality I’m 16 years old and a virgin. People think that I was addicted to Xanax and an alcoholic, and that I’ve done nearly every drug around, but in reality my experience with drugs is smoking weed and snorting promethazine pills once. I just can’t help but lie about my life and I don’t know why. I hate it. I want to tell everyone the truth, that my entire character is falsified. But I feel as though it would ruin my life. I would lose friends and no one would trust the things that I say. I remember the main reason that I started lying was to keep people from hurting me in school. I was a real scrawny kid growing up, so I told everyone that I fight a lot and that I’m good at it. I’m reality, I’ve never been in a fight in my entire life. I had a kid tell one of my friends that he didn’t like me because I fucked all of his friends, which I found kinda funny seeing that I’m a virgin. It kinda made me laugh a little bit, but it also made me realize that extent of my lies. And people think so poorly of me because I’ve created this macho man demeanor about myself, but in reality I’m just another normal kid.
582	real	Everyone I’ve met that was born in 2000+ has severe communication problems/ are not very confrontational (good and bad) in person and I can’t seem to understand why? or maybe it’s me idk. [End Title]: Could it potentially be that this is a byproduct of being raised by the internet? and projecting false images of ourselves online maybe ? i’m honestly looking for answers cuz i’m losing friends/relationships over communication problems and ik ppl say before pointing a finger, look in the mirror so that’s what i’m tryna do, maybe i should stop being so up front and direct but that’s really who i am so idk discuss at length ig wanna see what y’all think..
137	real	I'm tired of being medically neglected. [End Title]: My health has never been the best. I know exams and medical stuff was always based on men as the binary, and I know it's harder for women. But if it is this hard for every woman, just the thought of that makes me wanna break down.  I went to 12 doctors before one listened when I said I had chronic pain (after years of research on my own). I grew up in excruciating pain, and it didn't help it was my reproductive system. I had doctors say I'm lying, or I should go get psych help because it's all in my head, and my results were "normal". I grew up thinking I was dirty, that my body was broken and I didn't deserve to be alive since I couldn't put up with the pain, because I just assumed every woman had it and I was just dramatic.  I had doctors think I was lying when I said I was a virgin at 15 and actually wrote it down that I wasn't. Another doctor, years later, refused to let me get sterilized (i'm child-free and it would be an extremely risky pregnancy anyway) because I would change my mind since it's my duty as a woman. Then I asked about birth control, but the hormones affect me too much so he basically said "too bad" and left the room.  And is af that wasn't enough... 4 years ago, I tore my hamstring. I heard a pop, I couldn't walk for days. My guardians at the time didn't let me get it checked or get physio because it was nothing and I had to suck it up. I quit my favourite sports, i can't exercise anymore, and I'm still in so much pain to this day. I asked a doctor not long ago if there was something to do, and he said "stretch". I did, and I went back 3 other times, and 3 other times he said the same thing.  I put all of the symptoms down together with what happened, and apparently, it's a very common thing called Hamstring Avulsion, but it needs surgery. I get it, it sucks and we wanna do whatever possible to avoid it... But it is what it is.   Why can't they just listen? Why do I keep being dismissed every single time? I got scared of telling anyone about my pains and all that in fear they wouldn't believe it, and now, they're just debilitating. But all of a sudden, I'm doing it for attention, since I didn't bring it up earlier.  These were just the main big ones, but there is so much more. Especially with male doctors.   I'm tired. I'm always in pain. I can barely walk. I can't eat properly. I can't have safe sex. I can't do anything without almost fainting. I can't wear a lot of types of clothes.   I just want all this to end.
