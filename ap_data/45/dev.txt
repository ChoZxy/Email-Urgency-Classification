801	real	The Word ‚Äútoxic‚Äù is overused nowadays. [End Title]: It‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs meaning. People can just slap ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù on anything (particularly relationships) and brand the other party as a villain. But that‚Äôs not how life works. Typically both sides are at fault, even in a slight way.
792	real	I took the last bus home tonight and I feel great [End Title]: As I stood in the side of the dance floor making conversation with friends about who they‚Äôre dating and who they hooked up with while sipping a pint.I got bored. Usually when I get bored I look for drugs to stay awake and become more interested in people just so I can stay out. But this time, I just decided to get the bus home. Got some food in the shop, change for the bus and as I was on the bus I never felt better that I was deciding to just go home.
858	real	Something I wrote in a spiral [End Title]: You‚Äôve ruined a lot of music for me How dare you You knew how much music affects my head I‚Äôm so terrified of you and the thought of you I feel like I‚Äôm crumbling just writing this  Because of anger oh my god I‚Äôm so angry I‚Äôm so angry I need space but I need someone to hold me as tight as they can because I want to break just so that someone can come pick me up and put me back together. When I save myself I feel selfish because I don‚Äôt deserve being saved. But when I‚Äôm saved by someone else it‚Äôs okay because other people‚Äôs opinions of me validate me more than anything I could ever say to myself. I hate you but I think about you, what‚Äôs the point of thinking about something you hate. I really wonder how long the scale is before hate turns back into something positive. It‚Äôs like my hate for you is wrapped around the world but has somehow made it all the way back around to where we started
611	real	I'm finally telling her [End Title]: I'm going to tell my best friend that I love her next week. I've been avoiding it but it's time to get it off my chest.  That's all, thank you   Edit: it became complicated...
46	real	I have issues [End Title]: Any time something happens regarding my father and step mother I always get extremely pissed and I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs towards them and I generally feel very little emotion from my day to day life but this is all cause when I was 8  my mother and step father got arrested for drug dealing and abusing drugs while I was home and they got literally dragged away screaming my name into cop cars and they just made me sit there for the whole day and I went to my dads and lived there ever sense Idk why I have so much pent up anger or why it always comes out on them but it does and I worry I might become a fucking sociopath or something because every day I feel less and less there and emotionally i am normaly completly numb I know this was a ramble buts it‚Äôs all I can muster up right now
882	real	Why does it feel like I‚Äôm not moving at all?? [End Title]: While everyone I know is getting their life together and moving on to do great things, I‚Äôm stuck here. I swear to God I don‚Äôt remember the last time I moved from this place. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve always been stuck here unable to move from this place. I know people say patience is key to achieving great things and etc. But I‚Äôm running out of patience. And I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being a bum. I feel so behind in life...and it feels like I‚Äôm always running to catch a bus thats never going to stop for me.
283	real	I haven‚Äôt ever slept with my GF because of crippling body issues [End Title]: We‚Äôve been dating for 7 years. 7. She‚Äôs put up with 7 years of abstinence that she didn‚Äôt sign up for. I feel like I‚Äôm robbing her of her sexuality but the thought of having her see me without my clothes on is so fucking crippling that I start to shut down to not deal with it.   She deserves better than me and my insecurities. I love her so much but she needs someone better than what I can give. I‚Äôve felt guilty forever, I don‚Äôt know what I can do. I have eating disorders and all I‚Äôm doing is looking uglier and uglier while she only gets prettier. I‚Äôm sorry. I desperately needed this out there before I lose my mind.
468	real	I got my abusive ex sent to prison. [End Title]: This is definitely going to be one of the cruelest things you have ever read. Warning: mentions of miscarriage, abuse.   This happened around 40 years ago. I used to live in a conservative country. The whole "women don't work. Men can't be abused. Abortion is a punishable crime." sort of country.   I was dating a girl at that time. She was a typical narcissist. One year into the relationship and she was abusing me in everyway: verbal, physical, sexual. At that time, I didn't even realise what I was going through was abuse. She forced me to sleep with her and forcibly got herself pregnant, when I told her I wanted space. She told me how I must always be her or the child will pay the price. She used to threaten me saying that the child will die if I leave her. A  Few weeks into the pregnancy and I wanted out. I was very confused at that time. I felt angry, frustrated, disgusted with myself but I didn't know why. I knew what was happening was wrong, but I couldn't articulate my feelings to others. All I knew was that I need to get out or I wasn't going to survive.   So, I got a transfer to another city secretly. I was planning to leave and never look back. But the though of an innocent child under her mercy was unbearable.   Then, I put another plan into motion. I got abortion pills from a dealer with cash. I had to travel to another city for a week for work. I grounded the pills and replaced the powder inside her medicine capsules (üíä) with the abortion pills powder (she takes those medicines daily). I told her I am breaking up with her just before leaving. And I also told her I will leave the city by the end of the month. She called all our mutual acquaintances and told them about how heartless I was being.   The child got aborted while I was away on business trip. She was detained by the time I came back because the doctor suspected that it was an abortion and not a miscarriage. When the police questioned me, I told them that I told her I was breaking up with her and that I was all set to move to another city by the end of the month. This was confirmed by others. The police thought she performed an illegal abortion to avoid being a single mother (she didn't have a job and generally it is frowned upon having kids out of wedlock).   She got sentenced to 25 years in prison for homicide. She died in prison after serving 23 years.   She was a horrible person to me. But there is no sure of me justifying my actions by saying she would have been horrible to the child too. Maybe she would have changed. Maybe she would have come to her senses once I left. Maybe her mother instincts would have kicked in and she would have been an amazing mother.  It just wasn't a chance that I was willing to take. I made a choice into getting into a relationship with her. I just couldn't even entertain the thought of leaving an innocent baby with a person like her.   I am an asshole, a murderer and a fraud. But I don't regret what I was forced to do.   P. S. I don't feel comfortable sharing my abuse. But I can honestly say that being raped wasn't the worst of it. There were other much much much horrible physical abuse, some of which I can't talk about till this day.
976	real	I want to disconnect from my family [End Title]: My mother is an abusive and manipulative person and has no good intentions with anyone unless it's for her own good. She treats me very badly when in private but is super nice to my younger brother, so nobody in my family or friends would ever believe how poorly and mean she treats me. My biggest wish it to never talk to her again but I know that would be impossible unless I cut ties with all the people we have in common in our lives, including my family and some of my closest friends. I know they wouldn't understand and would never try to because she never shows this side to them. I would lose basically everyone in my life, but right now that seems so much better than constantly wanting to kms because of her. I don't know what to do, all I know is that I can't put up with her shit anymore, that only got worse since the pandemic started
659	real	I‚Äôm eating myself into an early grave [End Title]: Over the past 7-8 years, I‚Äôve gained approx. 125 pounds. I‚Äôm morbidly obese at this point. I‚Äôve tried every diet and exercise routine and I always do really well initially, but then I binge and ruin any progress. I know all about restricting too much causing you to binge, but sometimes I eat only a few hundred calories less than my maintenance and then screw up with a binge anyway. I just feel hopeless and it‚Äôs made me be a complete hermit.   I rarely leave my house. I spend most of my money on food delivery. I can‚Äôt seem to stick to any diet or exercise routine and I know I‚Äôm literally killing myself. I don‚Äôt like to meet new people because I‚Äôm ashamed and I won‚Äôt take photos with my friends or family because I‚Äôm disgusted with myself and if I do, I make them send them to me so I can edit them before they can post them anywhere.    I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to get down to a healthy weight and my life is passing me by. I feel like life was wasted on me and I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore... but I know I‚Äôm too afraid to just end my life even though I‚Äôm ironically just ending it very slowly anyway.
577	real	I graduated college today but it was bittersweet because the person who supported me most died 3 years ago [End Title]: I toughed it out the whole day without tears and being fake happy but deepdown and pretty much the entire day I couldn't shake the feeling that my dad wasn't there. He wasn't perfect and I had some resentment towards him not letting me live with him to escape my abusive mom and stepdad but he was involved in my life more than a lot of other fathers were. He made sure we had money etc and when I started college in 2016 he paid for everything. Then in March 2018 he died from opioids he was perscribed for back pain from his kidney surgery. I have a new job I'm starting next month and I'm moving into the next chapter of my life but I just wish my dad could've seen me graduate more than anyone else. I'm happy but I also feel kind of empty.
302	real	why do people disregard science [End Title]: my mother disregards science all the time and it‚Äôs so annoying. she just doesn‚Äôt think about biology, psychology, sociology etc. often i‚Äôll have to send her articles because she just doesn‚Äôt think about something as simple as evolution ‚Äúwhy did god give us wisdom teeth if we have to take them out‚Äù ma‚Äôam our heads got smaller ‚Äúthen why didn‚Äôt god evolve with us‚Äù ma‚Äôam god is not thinking about that. she thinks therapy is unnecessary and it‚Äôs stupid to talk to a stranger about our problems. sometimes i just look at her like wtf. she reads so much why can‚Äôt she read up on the most basic scientific information once in a while.   maybe i was born as the science lover in the family to educate everybody else but god it‚Äôs so annoying lol.
827	real	Being Single Is Horrible [End Title]: All my friends are in long term relationships and now at the stage of settling down, having kids, getting engaged, and married. I am so happy for them, but it feels like we are worlds apart. I broke up with my long term boyfriend a year ago. I've just turned 32 and feel like I'm back at square one, I can't talk to my friends about dating because they can not relate at all, all they care about is when their bfs are going to propose and when they are going to have kids.   I feel like I'm in the wrong space. Dating at this age feels so weird. How are you meant to get to know someone and "date" when your body clock is ticking? It takes so long to know someone properly...at least two years. All of my friends have been in 5+ year long relationships.   All the dates I go on, go really well, but after two weeks or two months, they just end it for no substantial reason. It makes me feel like I'm considered too old. Or these guys have so many options that you can't get anything real. The process is draining and saddening.   What's the point in all this if you don't have your forever person?
273	real	Former crush/bestfriend proposed to me and I rejected her [End Title]: I've known her for almost 8 years. Let's call her 'S'  We started talking about 6 years ago. I felt connected to her because she went through self confidence issues, same as me, however I didn't mention that to her. I stood by her as a rock, constantly encouraging her. It made me happy.  So we had just kinda started seeing each other about 2.5 years ago. We had messed around for 5-6 months in that period and hadn't made it official.   However after 6 months she said that she doesn't want to talk to me again. I asked her why, was it something I had done? She said no and explained that for the next 2 years, she was doing something that required her whole attention, that she couldn't waste time with me. I'll not go into the whole conversation we had but it was very much along the lines that our ambitions and goals didn't match, and that I wasn't on her level as to the quest for achieving success. I said okay and never contacted her again for the next 2 years, after all I had my own self respect.    During this time, I started learning new things. A photograph I had taken got printed in a magazine, I started learning an instrument and I was also scoring well in school. We followed each other on social media and she knew all that.   The photograph thing happened just a week before her exams got over. The days her exams finished, she messaged me. We talked for 2-3 days and then she asked to meet me. I agreed.   We met at a cafe and then went to a park. She told me that she had worked hard these 2 years and was happy with her life. I said good for her. She was mentioning everything she had done for the past 2 years while I was sitting quietly, listening to her. Then she said something about how I had matched her expectations about utilising my time in a good manner and that at first she had thought that I couldn't do all that. I was a bit hurt by this comment but decided to let it slip.   She then said to me that she wanted to get together and have a relationship with me. I rejected her saying that I was someone whom she had not seen as an equal. She always considered me inferior to her and her proposal was coming on the basis of me doing something worthwhile rather than liking me for who I was. I said this in a very polite manner and left the park.   However, she messaged me later that it was rude of me to not listen to her fully. I said that the last time we stopped talking you had decided it. I think its my turn now.   Now, I like her and I respect her. But I couldn't stay in that relationship where she had a predecided notion of my ambitions. Even though I had supported her as such a close friend and had stood there for her and loved her for who she was, she couldn't even understand me. She thought of this relationship as an achievement. I want to move on but it'll be difficult.
83	real	The whole "how tall are you" question some girls ask on dating sites isn't that big of a deal [End Title]: Seeing some guys get super upset over a girl they've never met asking them how tall they are is fucking cringe inducing. Get over it.  In my opinion, there's a **lot** of issues with modern/online dating but some chicks having a preference for tall guys isn't one of them.
579	real	First valentines single in 10years [End Title]: And I must say, I‚Äôm rather enjoying it! I‚Äôve had 3 long relationships in the last decade with barely any gap between them! My most recent ended the start of January and since I‚Äôve been learning to be single. And today I appreciate it! The day you‚Äôre expected to be with your SO or on a date and I am sitting here alone, at 11pm, finished a bottle of wine and about to start a 4-pack of beer and some CoD! And I couldn‚Äôt be happier right now. I used to think you had to have another half in your life, now I‚Äôm learning that I am whole, not a half.  Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day our there to everyone! Wether you‚Äôre married, in a relationship, single, it‚Äôs complicated, it doesn‚Äôt matter! I love you all and just stay true to you and enjoy this day!
229	real	this idle feeling [End Title]: i feel like i can‚Äôt do anything. i have work to do for college, practicing for my work, i could be reading, watching something, cooking, working out, and i just cant its like i dont have like ‚Äúvital force‚Äù i would call it? libido maybe? i take vitamins, i went to therapy before not being available to go out (because you all know why) still its like i can be all day laying down in my bed till it gets dark. i dont know what is wrong with me. nothing is wrong or its bother me in my life, actually its pretty good and i feel glad to be alive and having the life i have. but i cant do a thing.
804	real	I really hope I didn't make a choice I will regret for a long time. [End Title]: I was going to make a post a month ago about how I got kicked out my house due to just not good living conditions and finally got my first apartment with new great job but now im glad I never made that post because I would feel like even more of a dunce.   Everything in my life so far is good... I got an apartment at 22, I have an amazing girlfriend that does so much to take care of me and until a week ago I had a great job where I was making close to 1000 a week doing lien searches for a company. Well... I quit that job and went back to my old job in retail, I couldn't handle the stress. The people that hired me gave me horrible horrible training, every little mistake couldve turned into a big mistake and everything was super hectic in the office. I was the youngest one and only male in a female dominated environment where everyone was 50+. Everyday I was getting treated shitty and had "joking" threats about letting me go if I didn't catch on quick, I was being told that this was a woman's job and men aren't at detail oriented and I felt like ass to say the least... my pay checks were amazing though, and I feel so fucking shitty for quitting that job just to go back to random hours at my retail job making not even what I could make in a month here vs what I got at my lien search job in a 2 weeks. I feel like I let my girlfriend down, I feel like I let my future self down... I dont wanna work at my old job, I hate getting paid so little and never knowing what my schedule is gonna be like. I cant help to to thibk that if I toughed it out just a little longer at my office job I would be making life changing money... I could've bought a house and a better car that wasn't the POS im driving now... I could've done so much with my girlfriend. I cant help but to constantly feel that I made a big mistake just because I couldn't put up with the work environment which wasn't all that bad other than the passive aggressiveness and weird joking threats of being fired.   I really hope I didn't just make a big big mistake... I hope I get another opportunity to make money like that again...
584	real	I hate how Americans portray Mexicans in their series and films [End Title]: I was feeling exhausted this weekend so I decided to spend my free time watching tv. I was trying to find something to watch on Netflix and I watched trailers of some comedies and I noticed how Mexican characters are always portrayed as obese, loud, unintelligent and with a lowbrow sense of comedy or the other way Mexicans are portrayed as criminal, drug-dealing thugs. Mexicans are a mere joke in films and series, this has not changed for decades and it puts me off from watching most American productions.  Does Hollywood have something against Mexicans? African American characters have evolved, they used to be just like Mexicans, portrayed in a bad manner, always the character who died first in horror films, now they are portrayed as cool or wise, they have been appeared as Norse gods... while Mexicans just clean toilets and fart.
713	real	Trump supporters all look like morons [End Title]: Call it the liberal media if you must but I have yet to see/ encounter an intelligent trump supporter. Trump may not be the worst president or even a truly incompetent one but his base are full of very stupid people. If anyone has found one in a museum or preserved in a block of ice somewhere, link em to me, I‚Äôm curious.
739	fake	I tried to beg my (ex) wife to turn gay, and it didn't go so well. [End Title]: OG post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/kb93sf/so\_i\_accidently\_sent\_my\_wife\_to\_a\_gay\_conversion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/kb93sf/so_i_accidently_sent_my_wife_to_a_gay_conversion/)  So, In order to save my marriage and get out of this financial trouble I'm in, I would try to convince my wife to be a Lesbian. I wasn't sure, how I could do this, but then I finally decided after I talked to my minister. I'm going to pay for a hot Prostitute, and have sex with her in front of my ex wife. You see, my wife has always said she was disgusted when ever we had sex and disgusted with my body, so I thought it would be smart if she could watch me have sex, and maybe then she could have sex with women. I wasn't sure how this could go wrong, but... it did. So, I told my ex wife to meet me at an empty warehouse at 12pm. BUT, I will be having sex as soon as she walks in. So, I did. Me and Sugar tits (my prostitute,) met at the warehouse at 11am. I took a Viagra, so it will be awhile until it goes down. Finally, 12pm comes and so does her new boyfriend... Her boyfriend is Chad. Chad is a cop. Chad arrested Sugar tits a while back, so he knew I was having sex with a prostitute and I went to jail. Now, I have to pay a big ass fine, I have to pay alimony, I have to leave my house, give my exwife my car, since the judge sided with her. I can't even pay for booze. I've been having to convince teenagers into buying me booze. I don't want to mention on how I convince them, because it's too NSFW but it ain't pretty.
910	real	I‚Äôm so tired [End Title]: I just want to go the sleep and not wake up
117	real	i'm so in love with this girl [End Title]: my school has a kind of mentor system where certain students in the older grades would hang out with the younger grades at lunch and just be kind of mentors for them. My class mentor in middle school was a girl who I'm going to refer to as Annalise and she was just great. All of us immediately hit it off with her, she was basically a model student, but not in the goody two shoes way. for me, I felt a particular connection between her. Around Christmastime we started chatting just the two of us on our school website, and by the end of the year we started DMing each other on instagram. During the summer we exchanged phone numbers and we just had a great time chatting it up with one another. The next year was even better. We would walk to the subway almost every day after school together, and by the summer we'd often meet up to go shopping and such. She's just an all around amazing person and I don't know what I'd do without her. She's kind and loving, and never cared about the fact that I'm four years younger than her anytime we chat. She's funny, and we're both into the same stuff too. We just get each other.  Anytime I'm around her my heart just blows up. I can never stop smiling whenever she texts me. If I mistake a person in the public for her my entire body heats up. When I do see her I can't stop glancing at the time because I'm just calculation how much time I have left with her. Even now that she's been in uni for a while we call each other all the time, and when I hear her voice on the other side it brightens my day. I even memorized her voicemail and will sometimes call her when I know she isn't there just to hear it. She is the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last before I go to bed.  I wrote this draft a while ago and am revisiting it, and wow. I just happened to look at her instagram and can't believe how lucky I am to have coexisted in a world with this girl. Everything about her is just- wow. I didn't know it was this possible to love somebody this much. I haven't heard her voice in over a month and she has barely texted me in that timeframe, and my heart aches because I realize that while I'm constantly thinking of her, and couldn't live without her, she's perfectly fine without me.  And in a sense I know this isn't true; I notice that when she comes to visit the school (she's graduated now but I'm still here) she talks to everybody, her past teachers, friends. She greets everybody, makes a point of that. And she likes everybody, she's interested in what everyone says, that's one of the things I love about her. But she always texts ME beforehand to get the times right. She finds ME when she arrives. She makes sure to tell ME where she's going. She comes back to ME before she leaves so she can give me a proper goodbye. But what I noticed above all is her hugs. When she hugs me, it's a little tighter, a little longer, and she does this thing where she rocks back and forth. She doesn't do that with the others. I never feel better than when she hugs me, maybe for this reason. All I know is that whenever I notice these things, it restores my faith that maybe, maybe, she likes me just as much as I like her.  I can't stress enough how lucky I am to know her. I wish I could attach a photo of her just so you can all know how gorgeous she is. I could talk about her forever. I wish all of you could meet her just so you could see what a great person she is.  We have all these inside jokes too. All these stupid things that only we'd find funny. Whenever we talk about them we laugh so hard, and I love hearing her laugh, especially when I know I caused it.  Every time I see her, talk to her, hug her, laugh with her, I can't stop this feeling. A feeling like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. Like I'm home. I know she's the love of my life, I know I'll never love anyone like how I love her, but even more than that, I know I have to let her go. I've been obsessed with her for two years now, and I doubt she feels the same way. Unrequited love is a funny thing. It seems so impossible that you could feel so strongly towards someone, be obsessed with them in every waking moment, while they barely think about you over the time of a full month.  And I don't mind. No matter how much this girl hurts me, I know I'll never stop loving her. I'm so in love, I'm terrified.  Edit: so I'm an idiot. I completely forgot that since she's in uni, she ends in April, so she's been studying for her finals. To get rid of any distractions she just. Ignored all her social media for a while. But she's done now, so we're back to chatting regularly and sending each other memes and talking on the phone. All is currently well.
349	real	I found out I was barely tolerated [End Title]: It's something you can usually think, or feel, but I got to know for sure. I don't get any benefit from this realization but I guess I should be better. I'm the person who only good thing is I'm there, but I thought that was it. I guess it's that much worse and I'm someone to be suffered to be around. I don't know what's wrong with me
718	real	Wife is "concerned" that I eat an edible every night to get to bed [End Title]: She just won't let this go. I'm so sick of hearing about how I'm "spending all our money on drugs". And how dependent I am. Yes honey - about $40 a month. And I sleep sooooooooo god dang well.   Even with your little white dog barking every three hours at god knows what.  Let's talk for a second about you. Klonopin. Zoloft. Vyvanse. Lady - you're the one that's drugged out!
150	real	my "S/O" just abused me. [End Title]: I don't know what had happen. It was just any other day, I woke up to find my S/O just on their phone looking at the protest videos and I was just minding my own business, after we watched something on netflix, she started getting aggressive and mean, she talked me down, she made me feel bad about myself, she mimic me and my problem of dealing with the loss of my father at a early childhood. I wanted to leave but she kept stopping me from packing. She got physical and hit me and I tried to run away to the bathroom but she followed. I felt scared, helpless, I wouldn't hurt her. She said I tried to strangle her but I simply pushed her on the bed to get away from me. she threw my phone, hit me, and i felt terrified. I didn't know what to do, she won't listen to me. After i fell to the floor and she kicked me, shoved me down and stomped my back. Only thing that happen is my lip got cut and i started bleeding. I felt so helpless. I had to leave, I'm scared to face her. Im safe from her now but she's apologizing and threatening me, I'm scared, I know she won't come near me and only thing she has left to say is 'exposing me' but I could do the same but thats childish, and I'm scared because she's not okay, she needs help. I know this is gonna traumatize me and I'm hurting just remembering all tonight
389	real	Overflow of emotions causes, thst I desperately want to pierce my chest with something sharp [End Title]: Long story short, I was raised to not express my bad emotions, which caused me to have troubles with expressing them overall and few months ago I managed to totally seal them in me. This is not alexithymia, I am aware of these emotions, I can feel them and recognize them, but I cannot just let them out. I cannot smile when people ask me for it, I cannot be angry when something makes me angry, I can only feel them gathering inside me unable to do anything with them. I can only have short bursts of laughter or fear, but it almost emideately comes back to normal. I have no idea why this is like that and my therapist couldn't help me.  About a month ago my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend, left me, and I was not even able to cry or scream on her. I only cried twice during that month. It came to this point, that I literally feel constant physical pain in my chest. Once, during going to work I was pinching this point so hard, just to slightly ease the pain, that when I arrived I had red scars. Today when I was holding a stupid butter knife, I had urge to turn it opposite way and hit my heart as hard as I can, but I only pushed the handle part against me to satisfy this urge at least a little bit.  This pain and urge to punch it, pinch it, push it, anything, never stopps, I have it even now, escaping to games and movies hepls only temporarily, and stupid shower feels like the most painful thing to do right now. I also feel like I am going insane because of that, I've been already called a creep multiple times because I cannot stop thinking about her and what happened. I never had guts to commit suicide, but a knife in the heart was never something I even considered, as this might be one of the most painful death, which makes me wven more scared about what the f*** is going on with me, that I just did it today but with the back side. As I said, nothing helps, four therapists worked on me and only one was right - the one that said therapy is useless for me because I can't be helped.
74	real	I don't know what to do with my life [End Title]: Hello. Hope all is well. I joined the Navy a month after I turned 18, and entered bootcamp in July of this year. I am 8-9 days out of bootcamp and in A-School. I struggled in Bootcamp, mainly being alone and being a "slow" individual. I'm behind on my PFA stuff, both because of my height and my lack of muscle. I joined to make my family proud, but I hate myself so fucking much now. I admit, I'm a better person because I joined, but is life just going to stay sucky? My A-School experience has sucked so far being away from family and knowing no one gives a shit about me.   I know I'm being quite pathetic about it, but I can't help it. I want to stay to make my family proud, but the situation I'm in really does kill my emotions, to a point where I'm exhausted and don't want to get out of bed. I want to see my family, I want to know that I can leave and get a job once I get out. But everyone else makes it sound like it'll be harder to get a job after the Navy, so am I just stuck to a life I hate? Does it get better? What do I do?   Nearly everyone around me is A-okay being away from family, but I am not. I don't know how I got in at this point or why I'm here, but nearly every way out now disappoints my family or puts me in a riskier situation for my future, especially job wise. Did I make the right choice joining?   There's alot more to it, but I'm mainly concerned about if those who have felt the same and made it through, or even know something about it, know what to do.
416	real	Unfinished business is keeping me alive [End Title]: I live in germany where you can get legal assisted suicide if you pay the right people. I've saved enough money to do it but I've got a feeling of unfinished business. It's just the things people will know about me after I'm gone and how I want my possessions to be distributed. The problem is that I don't know how to get everything into words and onto paper. It's keeping me up at night and away from suicide.  Today someone recommended me a book I should read about dealing with one of my reasons to commit suicide so it's not only unfinished business after all but you get the point.
40	real	Somethings been messing with my dreams and I don‚Äôt know why [End Title]: Whenever I sleep,I tend to listen to music at the same time. When I‚Äôm sleeping with the music on, I‚Äôll usually dream of myself driving a car and playing the music through the radio. It‚Äôs one of my favourite parts about sleeping... however recently there‚Äôs been a problem with it. Before I explain what the problem is is must exclaim that this change in the is not traumatic and associated with anything that I can think of.. but I still find it pretty annoying. It‚Äôll be the same principle, I‚Äôm listening to the music in my car radio but my car starts to flip.. like as if I‚Äôm going so fast that the back is going to fast for the front and the front or the car picks up. This will happen even if stationary. To be honest it sounds kinda weird/ strange.. but I‚Äôve been having the same dream for years... but now I can‚Äôt enjoy it, so I‚Äôve been having to abstain from listening to music while sleeping so I don‚Äôt get those kinds of dreams anymore, mostly to prevent myself from waking up due to that ‚Äúfalling‚Äù feeling you experience when you sleep. I was posting this mainly cause I wanted to know if anyone might know what this means, or knows anyway to get rid of the ‚ÄúFlipping‚Äù thing, cause I would really like to listen to music while I sleep again
724	real	When I was 12 - 15 I used to purposely act suspicious so police officers would approach me, search me or chase me. I did it because I fancied them. [End Title]: First of all I don't do this anymore and it was just something I did during my earlier days.  Ever since I was quite young I really loved police officers. To start with I would go and talk to them, but it would never lead anywhere. They were never interested in me when I approached them. I was too young for them to like me the way I liked them and they would always just walk away after a while. I wanted their attention so badly I started to do stuff to make them come to me.  Stuff I would do included:  * Acting suspicious when walking down the street so officers would stop and search me. I would even wear my hood up to look like the typical hoodlum up to no good lol. * Running away when walking down the street and seeing police officers patrolling (90% of the time this would cause them to give chase lol) * Whenever they were asking me why I ran away or why I was acting so suspicious I wouldn't explain myself and pretend I'm hiding something. This would prolong the situation until they searched me and then took me to the station or let me go.  Even when I was taken to the station I was never given a criminal record, because I did nothing wrong anyway. I used to do it because I really fancied police officers. I was also really submissive, but too young to ever date an adult. I loved the procedure they'd go through when they questioned me and searched me. It was the only way I knew to interact with them so that they'd approach me. They thought they were keeping me against my will, but really I just wanted to bathe in their authority and presence for as long as possible.  Police used to run after me and tackle me to the ground and it was a lot of fun to get chased. I would always run just fast enough that it'd be a challenge and a thrill, but just slow enough that the officer would catch me in the end. Handcuffs would go on and they'd start asking me very reasonable questions that I didn't have answers for. I'd get searched for drugs / weapons, but they'd find nothing. Sometimes they'd search me multiple times just to make sure. Most of the time I'd get let go, but sometimes I'd be taken to the station for questioning despite doing anything wrong anyway. Whenever that happened the ride in the police car was fun and so was getting marched into the station. Whenever I got chased I never got properly hurt despite how many times I did this. I think it could have easily happened over a hundred times. The worst thing that ever happened to me was I got tased or officers were rough when tackling me to the ground.  I became well known at a lot of the local police constabularies for running away despite never doing anything wrong. One time at the station a guy that worked there asked if I kept running away because I was scared of police officers. I said yes. They spent the next few hours introducing me to the local police officers so that I was familiar with them and not scared anymore. I loved every second of it and got to know their names. It felt like actual heaven to experience that much positive attention from them. Anyway after that I didn't feel I could keep running away from them anymore because they knew who I was. Most of them just wouldn't chase me anymore. It sorta killed the thrill for me a lot. I did run from them sometimes if there was a new officer on the job, but that was very rare and after the first 2 times they'd stop too. At 17 I got a girlfriend instead who was a security guard. I'd never tell her about what I used to do because I wouldn't want her to think I'm only dating her because of her job. It's only a part of why I'm attracted to her.  I know that what I did was wrong and would never do it anymore. I have massive police fetish and childhood me wanted to date a police officer, but couldn't because I was a minor. Running away from them and pretending I was up to something was the only way I could get them to spend any time around me. It's pretty much comparable to the child in school who misbehaves because he fancies his teacher.

800	real	I can‚Äôt stand brushing my teeth [End Title]: Context: I was heavily abused as a kid, by my dad physically and my stepdad sexually, I didn‚Äôt get a break really. Focusing on my dad, he ‚Äòpunished‚Äô me in a variety of ways. Among many, Two of the ways were putting washing up liquid in my mouth and making me hold it there for hours, and squirting toothpaste in my mouth and making me hold it for hours. Till this day I also can‚Äôt stand the smell of lemon dish soap, as it sets my ptsd off. But toothpaste is unavoidable, because I have to use it every day. Yes I‚Äôve been to many therapists, but every time I brush my teeth I gag because I can feel the burning in my mouth all over again, and how awful my mouth would feel after I spat it out (he wouldn‚Äôt even let me wash it away with water) I‚Äôm nearly 19 and I still can‚Äôt stand the smell or taste of toothpaste  Edit: I don‚Äôt know why I feel the need to clarify this, but I am male
593	real	I killed a frog with a Nerf gun. [End Title]: This happened about 9 years ago, I mist have been 10 or 11. I was fucking around with my nerf guns when I realized that I could exchange the soft rubber tip for a thumbtack. It worked surprisingly well, and the nerf darts with the thumbtacks even got stuck in walls. My mum didnt want me to shoot these around the house, so I took it outside to have some fun.  With my modded nerf darts in hand i started to shoot around outside. There were some frogs living underneath my trampoline and I decided it would be a good idea to shoot around the trampoline. I shot a dart and hit a frog dead center in the head, and it started to jump around. After about 20 seconds the frog wasnt moving anymore and I felt terrible and sick. I decided to dig the little frog a grave and pay him respect. I could not forget about that frog for the longest time. I never told my mum because i thought she would kill me if she figured out I shot a frog.
668	real	A messy rant about feelings of happy and dread [End Title]: I miss dancing and flowers, aka, I'm missing soft nice things, like having and starting a friendship, seeing the stary sky with a heart at ease, I see it every day but not with ease. Feel like I haven't seen the actual sunset for a while now, or eaten candy cotton or something fluffy,sweet and nice.  I wanna paint, something, over the walls, some pots or other things. I feel soft like a cloud but if I remember anything else I'll become so heavy I'll fall into this ocean, not the shallow fun part, but the dark trench. I want to float and spin around and jump high like a foal. I want the moments of happiness, I want to learn how to have them, I cherish them, I long for a happy family as well. Just this once I've forgotten and forgiven the wrongs done, I want to move foward and build something meaningful again, I don't remember how I used to interact before, the days are filled with sadness and gloom, I'm trying to not be so sad, waking up today was trouble, but I've cleaned so I feel a bit more free? Free from the dust that was there before? No clue, but it's better than how it was in the morning.  I really want to not remember some facts of this world, some worries and concerns, I'd like to learn how to get better before all of that but it feels like there's no room to breath sometimes. I remember when I used to dream of flying and being off and away soaring trough clouds. I've forgotten how to smile, how as a kid our house was robbed, but I felt content at finding a 10 dollar bill because the robbers didn't take it, it's wishful and maybe stupid, non the less, it was a naive and pure happiness for something so small in tough times, and it brought the police officers and my parents a smile to their face, that uppon all that mess there was someone seeing something good. I want to learn how to be confident even in my failures, that they don't define me, they're something to experience. No one should have a say in my own worth besides myself, I want not to have happiness, but to at least be able to wake up without feeling such dread, I hate when everything hurts, when I can't breath, when it's all a confusing mess inside. I want to paint or draw, to do something so I won't feel as bad, I want to wake up with some motivation for it, with some excitement, something to look foward too. I just need to find that something, lately organising simple things around my house has helped, I feel a bit more free, it doesn't work always but doing something is better than nothing or so I've been told.  If anyone reads trough my blurry mess of a rant, I hope you have a good day or a good night!
500	real	Really Youtube?! [End Title]: There I am, watching family friendly content and along comes an ad which drops the n-word twice. I am fed up with the shit. Yes I cuss, but never have I used the n-word. It is a discriminatory term that I fed up with. The fact that black people use it in reference to any person they want to grab the attention of, the word's meaning has lost value over time, and it isn't acceptable to use at any time, no matter who is using it, and so for a massive platform such as Youtube to put it out on display for the public to hear, little kids to hear, it infuriates me to no end. It's just horrible to hear that word being used by a company who is supposedly all for equal rights, but that word is something that represents a history of intolerance and discrimination, and maybe it's just me, but to use the word is to discriminate and continue to put down the black community. Thank you for reading my Ted Talk.

298	real	I just got diagnosed with depression and I've never felt more liberated. [End Title]: I never thought I had depression, more so just anxiety that came up periodically. I have gone through waves of these emotions for a long time and never knew why. With quarantine happening, living at home, and a ton of stressful events, I realized my mental wellbeing was spiralling out of control QUICK. I finally decided to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to try and get some medication that will help me when these anxious feelings arise, and get it under control. However, after talking to the doctor, she told me that she's diagnosing me with depression. And for some reason, I've never felt more comfortable with myself. It's as if a ton of questions have been answered and now I have a path to take.   I don't really know where to go after this other than practising my already existing "self care" habits and taking my antidepressants. But I'm so glad to finally have a reason for all of my intense feelings and have a path on how to get out of this cycle.
765	real	Everything in my life is falling apart and so am I [End Title]: Right now I'm sitting in my car crying, mind spiralling and on mobile so sorry if nothing makes sense  My brother and his wife relapsed on heroin so we started taking care of their sweet little girl while they get "help". My brother lied about detox and went to a mental hospital for two days. While his wife got arrested had seizures almost a heart attack and as soon as she got out she posted on social media that we kidnapped their little girl. They went right back to using. They left and took their little girl with her and I loved their child with all my heart now I don't know if I will ever see her again  Everything is falling apart I'm breaking but have to pretend to be strong because other people can't. I'm so tired of this. I want it all to stop. There's so much more but I don't even know how to put it in words or who to reach for to get help handling this. I just want to hug that sweet girl one more time and for her to have stable parents.

346	real	No one to talk to and need to let it out [End Title]: I've always been alone throughout life. My parents were emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive. I can't tell my parents anything now without a lecture,  instructions on what I SHOULD be doing and handling things, or an oh well. My sisters were mean to me, and eventually we stopped talking to each other. I went straight into a marriage where the proposal was 'marry me since you're pregnant or we'll break up' after my parents said that he was gonna leave me now that I was a pregnant teen. I never really loved this person but was afraid. I finally left the marriage after I couldnt handle the anger from him, and the resentment for my life towards him. And then I found some actual happiness and didn't feel alone any more. And then lost it. I was alone before, and can do it again, but I don't want to, not that I have a choice. There's a quote, 'Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.' And I really felt that. I feel like a piece of me will always be missing. At this point I feel exhaustion, emptiness, panic, sad, and more. I just want to sleep through all this and make it to the part where I'm back to being ok with being alone. I'll get there, but I don't want to

I‚Äôve worked at this job for two years and haven‚Äôt ever been given anything for my birthday! I feel so silly for being upset about it but it‚Äôs just kind of a bummer.
778	real	I am transphobic [End Title]: I am culturally aware enough to know that merely expressing my fears about this issue can cause unintentional hurt.  Hurt people hurt people...so I understand the backlash reaction as well.  I am transphobic because I fear hurting trans people with my words   I fear hurting them with my words because I haven't studied the issue enough to have words that don't hurt.   I haven't studied the issue enough because it's not an interesting topic for me.  I understand that me not studying more is a life or death issue for some...but I kinda got over that moral concern once I realized that I couldn't care for the sufferings of every oppressed identity without becoming a sacrificial figure like Jesus.  I can accept that others will take up that burden and hopefully they will help save us all from this growing sense of despair.
740	real	please don't talk about what I eat [End Title]: Hi, I need everyone's opinion. About a week ago I mentioned to my family that it really bothers me when they talk to me about what I eat, how much I eat, etc and I would appreciate it they would refrain from it. Food has always been a tough subject for me. The immediate reaction from them was to laugh and call me crazy. That I was being stupid and that I was being immature if that really bothered me. They don't understand what I've been through and my relationship with food. Even as a child people commented on what I put on my plate, and being a bigger girl has always affected me in a negative way. They continue to bring it up and play with my feelings. I don't understand how my parents can laugh at the way I feel with a good conscience   Is what I'm asking too much? Am I overreacting over something that seems so simple?

[End Title]: Anyone out there who plays multiplayer games knows what I'm talking about. It's some weird age superiority thing and it's carried over from multiple generations. I remember when I was a teenager back in the ps2/Xbox days and hearing people call each other "kid".  Like damn, just because you can now legally sign up for a life long commitment to debt, doesn't make you some eternally wise ancient elder all knowing being.
922	real	Physically Sexually harassed by the therapist to which my father took me because I came out to him as Gay. [End Title]: Just to give a background, I'm Bisexual and I am from India. When I became sure of my sexuality I came out to one of my friend on 22nd June 2020 i.e. last year. And during one whole year I came out to a lot of people and finally on 7th June 2021 i.e. last month, I came out to my dad as gay (because I didn't want my parents to say that so if you are Bi then leave your one part and be a straight person). Being from a typical indian family the reaction was not too bad, it was neutral to negative I would say. But what happened afterwards was horrifying. After coming out, my dad told me that he wants some time  to study and know more about the LGBTQ community, which was absolutely okey and I even told him that I can help him with some links. But he told that he wants to do it his own way. So he went to 2 of his friends, one is a doctor and other one is a biology teacher at my highschool, and asked what is gay and both of them told my dad that oh it's nothing just a mental illness which can be cured with therapy and all. So, my dad came home on 11th June and told me that he talked to these 2 person and they told that I need to go to therapy and will have to take some medicines. So I instantly denied for the medicine. But I said yes for the therapy just for the shake of my parents. Because I knew that nothing will come out of that session. But a lot came out on that session. . Main story goes from here . At the therapist, I went inside the room and after me the therapist closed the door. Also to state one point the therapist is my dad's friend and I know him since my childhood and he's around 50, fat man with a dark complexion. Yeah so, he asks me if he can close the door and I said yeah sure. Then he came inside the room and throws his hands in front of me and asks me to hug him. As I have never been in a therapy before, I thought that therapist may do these things to calm down the patient and to make him feel relaxed. So I went forward and tried to hug him. It was super weird and awkward for me. But he insisted. He held me so tightly and close to him that I was able to feel his heart beat on my chest and his breath on my neck. My heart is pacing at a ridiculously high speed. He asked me what happened I told him that everything is very awkward. And the conversation started. The session was of 35 mins after which I ran away from there. And I cannot write the whole session but I will write few of the parts to clear my headline and the story. . So he's still hugging me tightly and whispers in my ear do you want to do it, I asked what, to which he answers the thing which I wanted to do with you for a long time, and after this he tried to kiss me on my lips and I tried to move away from him but I'm very lean and thin and he's a fat man so I was not able to move away but I didn't let him kiss me. After that he told  me that he wanted to contact me and have something with me for a very long time. But was unable to do so, but finally as I'm here he can. . Cut to some next part the conversation went on I somehow got away from him and sat on the chair beside me. He tried to hug me back several times but I stopped him and didn't let him do it. He asked me do you know what is ejaculation, I answered yeah definitely, he asked me have you ever done it, I say yeah everyone does it it's very natural, then he says let's do it together right now. I'll do you and you'll do mine. I was stunned not known what to say I was just staring at the ground near my feet and wanted to just burst into flames. . He dropped his pants in front of me, he asked everything about my penis, how it looked how big it was he asked me to show it to him, he told me to show my ass to him. And a lot more horrible things. . Out of those 35 mins I have told the story of hardly 8-10 minutes and things only escalated during the whole session. . After a week or so after this I told my parents about it, and they told me to forget what happened and move on. But I don't know how to. . Thank you for reading
274	real	It‚Äôs not even my birthday yet and it‚Äôs going to be the worst one of my life. I‚Äôm tired of this. [End Title]: My 21st birthday is Monday. It‚Äôs seems to be the last one people are generally excited for. I was too until these past two weeks and today was the final straw.   My initial plans for my birthday went the wayside with the sickness that I shall not name. All the bars in my state are closed; I was going to go out drinking with friends. I wanted to go to a casino in the morning with 20 dollars to test my luck; that casino is closed.   I got laid off last week because of that sickness. It‚Äôs a wonderful feeling knowing that I won‚Äôt be making any money until who knows when due to the fact I probably won‚Äôt qualify for unemployment because I work low hours. And also school has moved entirely online. I love going to school because it gets me away from my house. There‚Äôs so much negative energy here that it‚Äôs exhausting to be around.   These four things have made me feel so shitty. I thought wow? Can it get worse?   Why yes it can!!!   The last thing I had to look forward to was my birthday cake. At least that couldn‚Äôt be taken away from me. Well wrong.   My dad tells me and my mom today that he‚Äôs selling our mixer so he can have some extra money in the bank. His main point was so we could get pizza or something for my birthday and he wouldn‚Äôt feel as bad not giving me anything. I ask how are we supposed to make my cake tomorrow if we don‚Äôt have it. He suggest we use the hand mixer and my mom lets him know that it doesn‚Äôt work.   Well this whole situation pisses my mom off and next thing I know they‚Äôre fighting. Big surprise. My dad tries to tell me that he‚Äôll help me make it tomorrow and while I appreciate the whole thought of is this he doesn‚Äôt follow the directions when it comes to baking like you‚Äôre supposed to.   The reason this feels like the last straw is because once again, they‚Äôre mad at each other now and when they are, it lasts awhile. I‚Äôve had to deal with this for almost 21 years. I am so tired of this whole situation. From my plans falling through to the negative energy I have to deal with every day.   I‚Äôm sick of this.

86	real	I'm a flake, ruled by feelings [End Title]:  I just moved from the PNW to SWFL to be near my mid-eighties parents.  This is the second time I moved away from the place I love to be near them.  It was a mistake in 2010.  It seems to be a mistake now.  Why do I have to follow my emotions, and at such cost?  Thousands of dollars in relocation/ lost wages.  The trauma of uprooting a life.  I HATE it in Florida.  And I can't find work here.  But I'm old, and dumb, and have a ruined resume, and have been an addict.  I don't know anything.  Am I really thinking of going back to the PNW???  A second return?  What if they die after I go back?  Should I wait here in the hell hole until they die?  Is that really why I am here?
41	real	Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps. [End Title]: 26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of web-dev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately.   Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad (despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name $60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression). Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasn't making any profit still, mainly breaking even- didn't start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasn't making any real money.   2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that would've put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and I'm left like  a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldn't even leave the house. Psych didn't care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasn't making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly.   Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isn't in the field I want, I'm spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business.   Now I'm 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings (parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible...I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I could've gone to a great local state school with my grades.). I'm near NYC so that's where I've been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. I'm still in a very anxious state and don't think I'll continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly I'm about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I can't tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. It's relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice.  I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I can't think original thoughts, it's just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like I've been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesn't get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things could've been. How I'm the only one I know who's ever faced this level of mental deterioration.   Reflecting on it now I realize the victim mentality may be playing a large part in this but the suffering continues with not much of an end in sight, just dwindling hope. I know my first step is to try to address this depression but it keeps outrunning my attempts.
66	real	I hate Of Mice and Men. [End Title]: I‚Äôve been trying to find at least one person who hates it too but nope, everyone thinks it‚Äôs a masterpiece. I think it‚Äôs a boring, awfully predictable plot whose only unexpected moment is the tearjerker ending that is so, so easily avoidable.  I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been fuming over this darn book. Guess depressing books whose lessons can only be learned if you really squint, and even then the lesson‚Äôs basically ‚Äúgive up on your dreams‚Äù, is just what everyone loves. What little hope the characters are given, it‚Äôs just thrown away, stepped on, spit on, burned at the stake and thrown in the river.  The characters are so damn dumb sometimes it‚Äôs laughable. The author throws in half ass excuses for characters to do stupid shit and surprise, they win stupid prizes.  I did a literary analysis of this book and I tried for months to like it. Nope. It‚Äôs just such a downer and pessimistic that I can‚Äôt bring myself to enjoy its contents. I don‚Äôt care if it even has a good lesson hidden in there, I didn‚Äôt find it after three readings of it without some serious jumping-to-conclusions tomfoolery and I sure as hell ain‚Äôt reading it again.
240	real	My loneliness and anxiety are getting worse everyday [End Title]: I used to be okay with not having many friends. I was okay with having less than 8, with even fewer ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends. But now? I constantly think about it. I constantly think about how they hate me for this or that. How they‚Äôll probably leave me and I‚Äôll have no friends at all.  It‚Äôs only gotten worse as my depressed best and closest friend has repeatedly told me how they don‚Äôt deserve me and how I should just forget/leave them. I get so scared and worried when I don‚Äôt hear from them. 3 hours ago they sent me a text that was worrisome and haven‚Äôt texted or called me back and I‚Äôm so scared I can‚Äôt sleep, I just can‚Äôt stop crying. They promised me they weren‚Äôt suicidal or going to leave me but I‚Äôm so terrified. They‚Äôll probably think I‚Äôm crazy if they‚Äôre actually fine and leave me anyway.  I can barely talk to people of any authority. I get too nervous to go to my counsellor or ask my parents to take me to a therapist, which is morbidly ironic considering I really should. I have a hard time looking people in the eye as well, which just makes me come off as stuck up.  I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this. I should be grateful that I have friends at all. And I don‚Äôt have any reason to have so much anxiety.  It just sucks. Idk what to do. Only one person even remotely understands how I feel. It‚Äôs just so draining.
545	real	Something is wrong with me [End Title]: I have got a couple of friends but I feel like none of them actually like me. I am never invited to do stuff with them, i always have to text first and i always have to ask to hang out and 9/10 times nothing happens. I have never had a best friend or anything close to that  It has always been like this all of my life and I know im annoying but I really just dont understand why does it feel like everyone hates me and why do they hate me I really just need a good friend that likes me for me and actually wants to hang out with me  Im sorry that this is typed so messy english is not my first language
968	real	I Don't Know What to Do... [End Title]: I have been with my husband for almost 20 years, and in that time, he's had multiple medical emergencies, including open heart surgery which I helped him through. When I had my knee replacement surgery, we were still caring for his Dad, with help, but he made me toast twice. That was the extent of his help.      He was in intensive care two weeks ago for three days. I rushed him to the ER because he had terrible chest pain. Yes, I stayed by his side throughout.     Ok, tonight. I sneezed and my nose was running like crazy. My husband was three feet away from me but in another room. I asked him for a kleenix and he handed me a dripping Clorox wipe.      I'm heartbroken. Not to mention my best friend died three weeks ago...
547	real	I might be in a cycle of destructive thought patterns that I'm now just noticing [End Title]:    The last couple years have been tough for me. I had virtually no real friends, or a girlfriend or anyone close to me. I was living abroad for College and it was just some of the worst years of my life. I was already pretty introverted and now I had to deal with figuring out things while trying to make it in a country I don‚Äôt know their language, all by myself.  I guess I subconsciously asked myself ‚Äúwhy does nobody like me?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúMaybe because you‚Äôre ugly and weird.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell then, since I‚Äôm ugly and weird, I should probably not bother asking out that girl I liked. I shouldn‚Äôt also try to make any friends because it‚Äôll just be awkward and I wouldn‚Äôt fit in.‚Äù  And so I distanced myself even more, developed social anxiety, stopped maintaining basic daily hygiene, because ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm ugly and weird anyway, no matter what, so who cares, right?‚Äù.  I kept at it for a long while, becoming actually ‚Äúugly and weird‚Äù with no self-esteem or confidence. I even actively tried to not engage in conversations with people interested me. And whenever I was feeling lonely I could just play the victim and attribute it to my unfortunate nature.  I‚Äôm trying to break my way out now and I hopefully will.  So there‚Äôs that, Reddit. Thank you for reading.
783	real	This is my biggest confession... [End Title]: Alright so I downloaded reddit around 6 months ago and ever since then, I never upvote posts I laugh at. I know some of you might be disgusted right now and I am too when I think about it. I never upvote posts I like ever since I downloaded this app.
560	real	I went to my second funeral in two months today [End Title]: Last month, my maternal uncle passed away unexpectedly. He was like a second dad to me. And last Saturday, my paternal grandpa passed. Though he was taken off of dialysis, and we knew his death would be coming soon. I was never really close with him growing up, or close with anyone on my dad's side of the family. And he distanced himself from them also. "Toxic" would be a polite word to describe what his family was like while he was growing up. And so I never really spent much time with my grandmother either. He said she was also distant and just not a good parent. I don't ask for specifics though.   At the funeral home, they had an honor guard present since he served in the Navy. But it was just a memorial service as he has already been cremated. As for the family that showed up, my dad was basically my encyclopedia and I constantly had to ask who was who since I just don't see them at all. I did see some of my cousins from that side and my aunt, but one of my other cousins didn't show up because he apparently hated my grandpa. And he's a bit of a hair trigger. Thankfully though, everyone was on their best behavior, we had a small prayer service from a local deacon, and then we all left soon after.   Not to sound cold or uncaring, but my grandpa's death hasn't really affected me much. It's my uncle whom I miss the most. I have this never-ending cycle of anger at the fact that a person as wholesome and kind as him has to leave us while the myriad of evil people out there get to walk free. It pisses me off to no end and I don't know if I'll ever get over it. I just want him back. If I could die in his place, I'd do it in a heartbeat. No questions asked. But sadly that's not the world we live in
986	real	I am mentally incapable of completing most homework assignments [End Title]: So ever since I've started school this year, I've been unable to work on homework assignments that didn't hold enough of my interest. You know that feeling when you want to jump off something but your mind just doesn't let you? or when you've been running for a while and you just can't. anymore? because that's how I feel every night. I feel like quarantine has screwed up the way I do work. As of rn, my grades are mostly dependant on successful test scores and whatever I can get done during school.
98	real	everything goes wrong at once [End Title]: In the last week or two I have had more negative things happen to me than probably the entire year so far. So much change.   I don‚Äôt believe in fate or magic or higher powers, but this level of shit luck is absurd to me. I feel like it‚Äôs me getting it wrong or there‚Äôs a problem with me. I wish I could be tested for being a crappy person so I‚Äôd understand it.  I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt do anything this week like I wanted. I hope venting this is enough to finally make me shut off so I can wake up in a couple hours. I can‚Äôt think, I can only exist and feel dread right now. I don‚Äôt want t wake up and see what tomorrow brings. I feel like I‚Äôm lying because the last few weeks have been so shit.
970	real	When will I ever be happy? [End Title]:           I‚Äôm tired of living in a world of suffering, I wish I was never born in this world. All I want is to have a peaceful life that doesn‚Äôt have bull crap happen all the fucking time.                      I‚Äôm so envious of other people I wish I got a pet I wish I was more confident I wish I wasn‚Äôt so small and tiny and insignificant. I wish I was smarter, I wish I had a job, I wish I was stronger, I wish that I didn‚Äôt do stupid things all the time, I wish I lived on my own, I wish I had friends that liked me and genuinely cared about me, I wish I wasn‚Äôt so shy, I wish for so many things it‚Äôs ridiculous and I feel like I‚Äôll never get those things or become a better person.                        I know no one will read this or care, but I just want to get my feelings out. I‚Äôm scared and anxious about the future and I hate what I did in the past and I hate the present. Why can‚Äôt I just chill out on a field of grass and sleep for eternity?                       Why did I have to be born? The only reason I haven't tried killing myself is that I know my family cares about me and that would hurt them. It‚Äôs just I hate myself so much and I know I need to work on loving myself but it‚Äôs so damn hard. How do I accept myself and love myself?             Why are there even people that care about me? Everyone just seems so much better than me. I feel like nobody will take me seriously if I ever got a job because I‚Äôm just a tiny dumb ugly skinny girl. So it just seems so hopeless to even find a job.                       How will I ever live in a society that‚Äôs so judgmental and rude to each other? Honestly, I‚Äôm so done with all that crap going on right now, I just want peace and love towards other people. I wish people could be understanding and care about others more.              When will I find that peace? Probably never. Never in this lifetime will I ever find that peace that I desire. But I keep on living for others, when will I ever want to live for myself? These are the kinda moments I wish I was a Buddhist that meditated, living in the moment and all peaceful like, enjoying what life offered them at the moment.               How do I end this war that I have in my brain? It feels like I‚Äôm constantly fighting with myself.                      Anyways nobody has to answer me, as I‚Äôm used to people ignoring me. I don't even know if I should post this, but whatever nobody's gonna read it anyway.
218	real	Boyfriend(30m) of 4 years admits he follows instagram accounts because he is sexually unfulfilled. [End Title]: TLDR: Lax phone rules, wanted to look at memes and funny dog videos. Found hundreds of naked instaram girls instead. Calmly voiced my concerns, bofriend says it is because he is sexually unsatisfied. RIP my heart   Foolish. Naive. Undeniably replaceable.  Where would we be if my phone wasn't running out of battery last night? Would we just keep living our lives assuming the other was happy with our current situation?   How can I put into words the absolute beating my self confidence received after he admitted to replacing his sexual needs by looking at hundreds of other women during his day to day? I feel like shit. When he followed these accounts before it was a few and I was fine accepting them as aesthetically pleasing for him to look at. Now I cant scroll through his account in public because there are hundreds of naked, or scantily clad pictures of women in unmistakeable poses.  I approached the subject out of genuine concern for our relationship. I was hoping for a simple explanation. At first he hardly said anything, and was content to leave me with a non answer. After expressing my concern now he says he isn't sure but it may be because he isn't sexually satisfied.  To be told that it was a way to cope is painful. To have been left waiting in the wings all this time. Telling myself he is busy or tired, even him admitting the stress of life in general was the cause of his distance. It still hurts, that instead of approaching me and telling me he wasn't satisfied, he chose some other outlet. I thought I had explained that my lack of drive was medically related. That though I may not think of sex first doesn't mean I wont enjoy it once it starts to happen.  I can't help but wonder if I am unapproachable about his feelings. Don't I explain myself well enough? Maybe I am too quick to end a discussion before we reach an understanding. I don't know.  What was even the point of it all? Him keeping pictures of me undressed, and videos of our intimate moments, if theyre not what he looks at anyway? Why have them saved, and easily accessible on his devices? Does he not think of it seriously when I ask him to keep them more securely?  Does he even understand my discomfort considering the shared accounts and devices between his family? Are these photos of me actually just collectibles for him?  It used to make me happy to think he valued them and looked at them fondly. I wonder if he even remembers he has them.  I haven't recieved any reassurance regarding this particular concern. I haven't pushed the issue further because I thought it was important for him to have these photos and videos. Now, I doubt he has even looked at them since I've brought up my fears of someone accidentally finding them.  He has changed in how he treats me sexually. I remember when he took the time to have a conversation, even a short one before being intimate with me. He used to kiss me deeply. He took the time to make me feel loved in the moments before. Nowadays he shakes his penis at me to indicate what he wants. Literally. It's funny, now and again, but it isn't how he used to treat me. I cant even remember the last time he was focused solely on my pleasure, yet I'm to remember that I should get on my knees from time to time to focus on his. To take the time and courage of wearing lingerie for his enjoyment. I remind him he is handsome and that his weight gain doesn't make him any less attractive to me.  What has happened to him since the days of our beginnings? Am I being taken for granted now that I'm always within reach instead of a thousand miles away? Is this what I have to look forward to in our future together?   Im left here on my side of the bed unable to sleep. After our conversation my mind has kept reeling. It must be nice to be able to sleep now. While I'm wondering if I actually got through to him. If I even bring up these new thoughts since he has fallen asleep. I question the validity of my feelings. Am I just another jealous woman having issues with my own self confidence?
439	real	I failed as an older brother. [End Title]: I thought I was doing right. I really did. I used to be a spoiled rotten little kid and then one time I got into a fight over something I didn't really care about, and realized it was all stupid. I good old "knock up side the head" and all that. My younger brothers childhood was ruined by two barely functional alcoholics, and 12 years had already passed until I realized that It wasn't right to take out my anger on my brother. He was f*cking nine and I was twelve. I shouldn't have been angry with him. And by the time I realized how bad it must have been for him, and got out of my own childish shit, my parents decided they were actually parents and not just background disappointments. I hate how much they gaslighted and guilted us, into doing anything they wanted. I hate that I didn't step up when my brother was told to drink a shot glass. I hate myself so much. Even if I was a kid I could've done SOMETHING!
347	real	my grandmother has covid and i‚Äôm scared about what‚Äôs going to happen next [End Title]: my grandmother, who lives in southern asia, has coronavirus. she‚Äôs had it for about a week i think, and according to my mom, she‚Äôs doing a little better, but not great. i lost my grandfather to cancer last october, and that was the first time i lost a close relative, so it hurt a lot. i was also close to him, and he was always my favorite grandparent growing up. it didn‚Äôt help that i was also in a toxic relationship at the time too.  i‚Äôm scared about going through grief again. i sound selfish making it all about me. with my grandpa, i never really got to say goodbye since everything happened in a flash. it was the first semester of my freshman year at college and i wasn‚Äôt able to go with my family to go see him because of midterms and labs.   I guess i don‚Äôt really know where i‚Äôm at mentally. i‚Äôm just hoping for the best. i wish i could go visit her, but that‚Äôs literally impossible. the most we can do is video call here and there but time zones make it tough. thanks for reading this guys :)
138	real	I hope every day that my computer breaks at work so I can talk to the nice tech support guy [End Title]: I work in management in a food service company and multiple times a week, my computer stops working in one way or another. When it happens, we have to call the tech support line, which to my knowledge is just one guy. Every time I call him, he‚Äôs just so god damn nice and funny and actually makes conversation with me which maybe I‚Äôm just starved of at this point. So now, every time I get on the computer I hope that there‚Äôs an issue pressing enough that I get to call him and have just those few moments of nice conversation.  If you‚Äôre reading this, dude, you‚Äôve made multiple days of mine just a little bit better just by being nice to me.
576	real	I cheated on my new husband and I don't even feel guilty [End Title]: New account for obvious reasons.  I have been married twice. Currently with my 2nd husband of 5 years. I never cheated on the first becayse I tries to make it work. So I have dated plenty of men. The problem is all guys over time become complacent. They seem to get lazy, not make any effort and I lose that spark I have for them. Most of all they just are boring. My husband is a very stable decent guy. Thats why I am with him. As a woman I deserve to have a house and lifestyle provided for me. Sorry boys thats just how the world works.   But the problem is...I just don't want to fuck him anymore. Only assertive men that take me whenever get me going. The problem is those men are fucking assholes. The thing that makes me want to fuck him also makes him terrible husband material.  So I don't feel guilty anymore because this is mens fault. Men suck at being able to give women the entire package like we want. So why should I as a woman live a life of unhappyness due to mens shitty types? Ugh no thanks.   So now I have a guy I fuck and a guy that takes care of me. And thats just the only way to be happy in the end. I have told my husband many times the things I like in the bedroom etc and he tries but you can tell its pretty weak lol.   So why should I settle for less. Women deserve everything they want and we can get it. I deserve to get the house, family AND great sex.   If my husband finds out it doesn't even really matter since I have already talked to a lawyer and I will be financially well off if he divorces. So either way I win I guess. So I'm not gonna feel guilty anymore.
335	real	I wish I didn't have a dysfunctional home life... [End Title]: I don't know if I will ever break free from these people. I'm constantly feeling anxious that my parents will fight again. I'm constantly feeling anxious that my parents will verbally and physically abuse my 4 year old sibling. I'm constantly feeling anxious that my low functioning 21 year old autistic brother will attack somebody again in the house or destroy something in the house again.   The only other place I can go to is my stupid college, where I have no fucking friends and studying a major where I can't relate to anybody. College is slightly better than home I guess, but I feel anxious at college too. I feel anxious about what career I have to force myself to like, why I always seem to be a loner in every class I attend, if I can understand and finish my homework at school fast enough so I don't have to do it at home where I'm surrounded by constant fear.     I honestly dream of having a place to myself and just doing simple things everybody else can do. I want to be able to move around a house freely without feeling like I'm walking on eggshells. I lost interest in reading because there is nowhere I can go where I feel comfortable to read. I wish I could make an actual meal in a house, rather than having to buy cheap junk food to keep in my bag pack because being around my parents make me extremely uncomfortable.  I really wish I was free...
940	real	I am jealous of my roommate [End Title]: She has this awesome loving relationship, and my boyfriend is a total fucktard.  Today, for her birthday, her boyfriend surprised her with tickets to New Zealand for Christmas.  They had gone to see a movie and then went to her favorite restaurant for dinner.  My boyfriend forgot my birthday then got me a shitty Naruto figurine that, surprise, turns out he wanted for his own collection.   Then there was that time he insisted I come with him to a convention even though it was the same weekend as my aunt's funeral.  And he threw a tantrum when I couldn't go.   Now he's hounding me about going to another fucking convention even though I FUCKING HATE ANIME!!!  If he gives me a pass for it, I'm selling it on craigslist and using the money to go on a vacation.  Fuck him and his weebo ways so much.  I am going to dump him and suggest he date a body pillow instead.
160	real	I‚Äôm incredibly lonely lmao [End Title]: Like a good amount of people lol but I just don‚Äôt want to keep it in anymore because it‚Äôs kinda tiring. I‚Äôm a teenager (yes I know you may think I‚Äôm supposedly too young to complain about life and I don‚Äôt know the real hardship about life and all that but teenagers also live hardships and loneliness) and I‚Äôm lonely (hence the title) I‚Äôm not sure how to write this but I‚Äôll just go as I feel  I have three siblings, all are older than me and either has their own problems that I feel are worse than mine (like bullying) or left the house so I can‚Äôt really talk to them My parents aren‚Äôt necessarily the people I trust the most with these kind of stuff,  my father was never really there during my early childhood, because ya know being immigrants and being the only breadwinner it was hard, (especially since we didn‚Äôt have money, still don‚Äôt btw lmfao)I don‚Äôt feel any resentment towards him, it‚Äôs just a bit awkward talking about feelings and all that. As for my mother, she‚Äôs christian, not the cult or forcing someone to go to church type, and everytime there‚Äôs an emotional or deep conversation, she always turns it to something we should talk about with god (which is logical because she is christian and she think i still am too...) and that‚Äôs not necessarily what I personally need, but, don‚Äôt get me wrong, they‚Äôre amazing, they‚Äôve always supported all of us and loved us no matter what, it‚Äôs just hard because I don‚Äôt really have my family to count on. Now, you might be thinking ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm sure you have friends‚Äù yea, no. it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm bullied or don‚Äôt have people who ‚Äúthink‚Äù(i‚Äôd like to emphasize on the ‚Äú‚Äù) of me as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù but honestly I know they just call me that because we go to the same school and spend some time together, they don‚Äôt trust me, I‚Äôm very VERY easily forgettable/replaceable, heck i‚Äôm literally the last choice, sometimes not even a choice. If anyone happens to read my previous rant and/or comment you might think that I‚Äôm someone who speaks my mind  and all that stuff but come on, it‚Äôs obviously all fake, I don‚Äôt even know who i am, so how am i suppose to show it? I constantly act immature, make dirty jokes, try to act all confident and (excuse my language)shit, but when I think about it, it‚Äôs all so dumb. Why do i do it? because even though I feel incredibly lonely, I don‚Äôt want it to seem like I‚Äôm lonely, if I just keep it to myself and people don‚Äôt know, then, I don‚Äôt know, maybe I won‚Äôt feel as lonely as I am. So, basically, I‚Äôm lonely, friendless, I have absolutely no one I can trust and I‚Äôm probably the fakest person alive. Am I going to change? Not a chance. I hope you‚Äôre having a better life than I am lol
748	real	Afraid of myself [End Title]: TLDR at bottom  I have always been afraid of myself, my voice and being dramatic. When I get angry I get quiet and tend to give the silent treatment. Granted I don't mean too and as I sit here after another pointless argument with my boyfriend I wish I wasn't. Im afraid I will start to scream and shout at him and show a side of myself I don't like. A side that reminds me so much of my parents that I hate myself for being angry, but that doesn't negate the anger.  I get Quiet because I dont want to say hurtful things, and I dont want to be mean. I get quiet to squash the spark of anger myself because I know the minute I speak I am talked too like its no big deal, but it is to me.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: Stupid anger makes me go rage and I don't like it.
288	real	Had a nightmare that my family was shot and killed by white supremacist. [End Title]: For some background: I‚Äôm a 20 year old Mexican American woman and my parents immigrated to the U.S before they had me and my siblings. We are all citizens and my parents are permanent residents.   Story:  My parents and I decided to go to the mall to just walk around and hangout. But they got tired from all the walking so they decided to stop and sit on a bench to take a break. For whatever reason I decided to leave to meet up with 2 other friends who I have never met before but I guess in my dream I did know them. I immediately noticed that their were a lot of white people everywhere and I remember asking this man if he had seen my friends to which he proceeded to look at me like he was disgusted and offended that I was talking to him and he started to look angry.   To describe this man: He was like 6‚Äô2 and had a overall big built, had a beard, annnnd was wearing a cap that said ‚ÄúMake America White Again‚Äù.    I continued to look for my friends and I saw them going inside a little convenient store so I followed them in. When I went inside the man followed me and my friends immediately looked terrified, one of my friends was middle eastern and the other was asian. The man walked in and said that ‚Äúhe can somewhat stand their races but he hates Mexicans‚Äù something along those lines. They proceeded to run away so I ran away, and as I was running I heard them say they were gonna find me and shoot me dead. I ran inside the mall and saw my parents I yelled to everyone in the mall that a shooter was coming and to run away and call for help. I took my moms arm and my dad followed behind and we began to run when we heard gunshots and people yelling.   Everyone started to hide anywhere they could, I was trying to hide and protect my family but they caught up to us so we hid in a very shitty place where they eventually recognized me. I quickly moved away from my family and I was ready to sacrifice myself thinking if they kill me they wouldn‚Äôt hurt my family. Instead they pulled them out from hiding and shot my dad than my mom in front of me and they died instantly. I remember it feeling like someone had clawed my heart out of chest, or pulled the rug from under me and I got the wind knocked out of me. I didn‚Äôt just yell I wailed and I was in utter pain and anguish. They shot me next but I somehow didn‚Äôt die. They eventually left and I was left there bleeding, the last thing I remember is being helped by strangers and me just crying. Than I woke up and realized it was a nightmare and I felt tears on my face, it felt so real.   I think with everything going on it just triggered something dark idk.
411	real	I feel broken and shattered and I just want to die [End Title]: Since senior year has began I have had an overwhelming Sense that I don't deserve to be alive because I am a failure. Before this year began I was actually happy with myself, but now I have constant thoughts about suicide, but I can't act on them. It feels as though being alive is my punishment and I am constantly tortured. My parents keep telling me to let it go and suck it up and I honestly don't know what I expected from them. They are never emotionally there for me and usually just gaslight me to the point where I feel like me being depressed is something I started of my own free will. Even if I am happy in the moment, my problems eat away at me from the back of my mind. The same problems keep coming up and all I can do is lay here crying in my bed alone and wait for my brain to numb itself enough to the point where I can push down my true feelings and just move on with my day. I feel like if I can get to graduation my life will be better, but right now I just feel like my entire mind is cracking and I just want to escape my life.
626	fake	Idiocracy [End Title]: I feel like everyday we‚Äôre closer and closer to that movie being a reality ...   BROUGHT TO YOU BY CARL‚ÄôS JR.
333	real	I feel like a prisoner in my own life. [End Title]: By all accounts I have a good life, not a perfect life, but one the most would call good if you were looking from the outside. I have a great job, a nice house, a beautiful wife, and a new baby boy that‚Äôs so handsome he‚Äôll make your heart melt.  The only problem is that I have almost nothing in common with my wife, My job requires some pretty long hours, and when I‚Äôm home I do nothing except watch our baby.  I grew up as a gamer. I played games with my dad, starting on PC based shooters back in the late 90s‚Äî like Tribes and Medal of Honor. My brothers and I always played games together as kids. It‚Äôs really an integral part of my life. It‚Äôs how I like to relax, it‚Äôs how I keep up with my family now that I‚Äôve moved away to start my own life, it‚Äôs really just what recharges my batteries.  My wife on the other hand, she has no hobbies and a personality I‚Äôd describe as water flavored milk. I can play games for several hours, and she can Scroll on her phone for several hours. I like to read fiction to get lost in a world, and she only reads non-fiction. I like cartoons and horror movies, she likes exclusively sitcoms and romcoms. If you asked me what she does when she has nothing but free time, I‚Äôve only ever seen her on her phone. Even if we try to discuss one of her non-fiction books, it honestly feels like she skimmed the whole thing. She‚Äôs the only person I know who can read an entire autobiography about Churchill and, when asked about the content of the book, can only reply ‚ÄúHe was one of the main guys in World War II.‚Äù   That‚Äôs fine and dandy, and we used to accept these differences, but now we suddenly don‚Äôt. Now that we have the baby, if my wife catches me gaming, suddenly I‚Äôm being an irresponsible dad. If I get stuck at work too long, I‚Äôm not a caring husband. If i try to relate anything I‚Äôve been thinking about to my wife, it‚Äôs like describing the beach to a pool of lava. It just doesn‚Äôt click.  Now, when I‚Äôm at home from work, I stare at the wall with my baby boy. Sometimes the floor. Sometimes the ceiling. Sometimes we look at each other, but I can only barely lock eyes with my wife. I feel myself blaming her for her inability to relate to me, and I blame myself for thinking that being such strict opposites made our relationship exciting.   Tl;dr it feels like I‚Äôm pretending to live my own life.
890	real	Do you ever just get so sick of where you are in life at this moment? [End Title]: Knowing that you‚Äôre stuck and that you can‚Äôt do anything except wait until you‚Äôre cleared to finally start your life?  Especially since everyone you graduated with is already halfway done with their first year of college or already done with bootcamp or already have a full time job.   It just depressing. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone.
908	real	lost my diary at school? [End Title]: i lost my journal/diary at school!.. or home, or my boyfriends house, or anywhere else on earth. it has embarrassing "fun" facts about me, nasty mean rants about people, what i want to tell my therapist, things i wouldnt even want my boyfriend to see. its all so cringey and embarrassing. any advice/emotional support? i could really use it right now.  EDIT: its at my boyfriends house, PHEW!
823	real	I hate it when people, instead of just leaving me on read, just never reads the last message [End Title]: Like please I don't care if you leave me on read but it's even worse to know my last texts are not even read. It makes me uncomfortable to write again knowing that I have some other messages still waiting to be opened but ok. Sometimes I think that those people who have a lot of pending chats are those who never read the last messages from other contacts and don't archive them either lol.
925	real	Sorry for hiding my shit stained underwear under your sink [End Title]: We were kids. It was your birthday. While we were playing football, I shat my pants, probably from that full batch of brownies I ate earlier. I was embarrassed, but I don't think y'all could tell, so I ran inside your house, went upstairs to the bathroom that was off limits. I'm so sorry man, I was too embarrassed. I took my shorts off and revealed the mess I made. I wanted to hide the evidence, I thought I could just ball the underwear up and toss it under the sink. My kid brain just assumed that maybe the underwear would just disappear magically or maybe y'all wouldnt see it. But let's be honest, your incredibly nice parents probably went up stairs later that night and found it. I'm sure your dad was like "what the fuck is this", and for a moment considered cancelling all future birthday parties. Maybe that's why I never got invited back.  But I'm sorry man. I never told anybody. But if I see you ever again, I probably still won't tell you.
978	real	A long lost friend suddenly asked me to purchase something for her [End Title]: I mean. The audacity?? Where the hell is her manner. I'm definitely NOT buying anything for her as she doesn't deserve it. But still to be treated that way hurt me to an extent. Why do I need to deal with such assholes in life??
681	real	I am so sick of self-absorbed, narcissistic, immature "friends" who only use me. [End Title]: It fucking SUCKS to be 24. It seems that almost nobody my age has outgrown the immature high school bullshit games and everyone is completely, 100% wrapped up in themselves.   I could write a book, but in short, I get my texts and phone calls ignored constantly, lied to, manipulated (I know I'm an idiot for allowing this and I'm trying to get the confidence to put a stop to it), treated like shit because for some reason my friends think I have a charmed life and therefore deserve to be treated that way or that it doesn't matter since they think I'm rich (no, I just actually have a fucking job and I don't blow every penny I have on dumb shit) and have a perfect life. Everything is all about them and what they want, and God forbid we do anything I want even though I do what they want all the time. Friendships aren't give and take with these people, they think they should be able to just take, take, take. They're also shocked that they end up losing friends.   There are the ones who still want to be children, refuse to get a fucking job and play the victim, blaming everyone else for the fact that they have no money because they're too lazy to get up off their ass and get a job, and then there are the ones who are baby crazy and absolutely obsessed with getting married and having a family, who act like anyone who isn't wanting to rush into marriage and pregnancy is immature. There's pretty much no in between.   Why is making halfway decent friends at my age so hard? This is such a bullshit age, and such an over-glorified one as well. Everyone told me in high school that the bullshit games would end once I graduated and everyone would act like adults, but no. It's just High School Lite and kids trying to play grown-up and house. I get so sick of hearing that a person's 20's are the best time of their lives and their prime. If this is the best it gets and this craziness is people's "prime", then yikes. Life must be one huge, major disappointment.
106	real	One of my childhood YouTube idols "liked" two of my photos on Instagram and I am elated [End Title]: I don't know who to tell this to or who can relate, so here it will be.  I've followed this YouTuber since he started making videos in 2008. I was one of those teens who spent A LOT of time on the internet watching OG YouTube vloggers and wishing to be as cool as one of them, someday. And I always wished to be connected to this person in some way. Whether that be by a VidCon meetup or some chance encounter in my future travels. He's just such a cool artist and I feel like his videos contributed to a lot of my upbringing!  Well today on a whim, I decided to look at his YouTube channel to see if he is still active on YouTube and he is! So I followed him on all of his current socials and liked some of his content - AND HE LIKED TWO OF MY MODELING PHOTOS IMMEDIATELY!   If there is anyone else on here who grew up watching early 2000's vloggers - please celebrate this small win / elation with me.  I am on cloud nine.
504	fake	I terrify people online for their benefit [End Title]: A couple of weeks ago, I had too much to drink and I decided it was time to teach people the dangers of oversharing.   I made a fake tinder, uploaded bullshit and matched with everyone I could, all the while taking down any information I could. Job titles, age, pictures - just about anything I can to find on them. I limited the app to the closest setting, I used every tool I learned of and with a little persistence and people's inability to see a problem with oversharing, I was  inside their lives. I had doxxed a handful of people within the hour.  I can see everything I needed to make their life miserable but I didn't do it. I just harassed those who responded to my troll account with their lives. I made them squirm and panic for a bit before I told them that they were being careless and how if someone wanted to hurt them, they could.  I don't know why I did it. It wasn't the first time either. I've even done it on other apps and websites. I've even done it to people I personally know while pretending to be someone else.  I know it's not right and that's why every moment I feel that desire, I remind myself that I don't own them - I don't own anyone. They didn't do anything to me and they need to protect themselves from people who are worse than I am.  I hope I never go farther than just simply frightening people but I can't promise anything. There was a time where I couldn't ever do this but now look where I am now.  I think a part of me knows what I want to do and is trying to stop the other part of me from ever actually realizing it's twisted desire.  Take heed and protect yourself online and in person. Decentralize your profile. Use multiple emails with non-identifying features, use different passwords, don't link your phone to your accounts, don't link your social media accounts to anything, limit your photos, don't state where you've been and where you're going. There's much more you need to do or not do but don't give people like the weapon to hunt you down and do something if we feel like it.

I HATE MY LIFE, I am in constant pain and turmoil lol my abusers live free and rich and I'm poor and can't find a job because I made shitty decisions lol... Everyone I told about my experience has done nothing but make me feel more shite. I feel like ill never move past my shitty childhood performing arts story.

966	real	I feel disgusted and helpless for r*ping myself. Is it weird? [End Title]: I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who is triggered by the title. My pain is in no way comparable to yours and I don‚Äôt mean to demean your trauma.   It‚Äôs just that my depression has gotten so bad that I‚Äôve been masturbating more to escape and get a quick hit of dopamine.   I feel like an addict. It doesn‚Äôt feel good to do. Not this. Not cyberpunk 2077. Feels like I‚Äôm just trying to escape and skip the days.   But the thing is. I‚Äôm not even in the mood. So I feel guilty for myself. I‚Äôm dragging my sexual energy involuntarily out of myself just to get high on dopamine.   I really don‚Äôt want to be offensive but it feels like my conscience is r*ping my unconscious   Is weird to have this guilt? I just don‚Äôt know how to keep going without my dopamine vices.
977	real	My grandma fell in front of me and I didn't move [End Title]: Last Christmas I was in charge of picking up my grandma, who is 88 and fairly senile, and taking her to the family party. When I went to open the car door for her to get in, she handed me her cane and grabbed at the top of the door to hold on to, missed, started wobbling for about 2 seconds and fell right on the concrete and gave herself a huge hematoma (lump on her forehead) and bruised up her hand.  I don't know how much it was the fact that I didn't realize what was happening or if I was just too shocked and confused to react but I didn't even move until she was halfway to the ground.  In the end she went to the hospital and they didn't need to do surgery or anything, they just pretty much iced and bandaged her up and sent her on her way. I wouldn't really be too worried because people her age fall all the time and she does suffer dizzy spells occasionally but I swear her mental faculties have been deteriorating way faster over the past few months than they had up until that point. And the sight of her falling and thinking I should've at least tried to catch her terrorizes me all the time
587	real	I got the courage to break up, but now I'm second guessing it. [End Title]: I've been in my relationship for over 10 years - from 19 when I graduated HS and moved cross country to be closer to him during college after meeting him online. I'm 31, and put a lot of my life into him.  But we were on such different pages for so long. I felt like I put my all in, emotionally, financially, and time wise into the relationship, but it was never enough. He cheated on me with online people twice because I wasn't enough, and he never felt I was putting in enough level to make him feel wanted.   And I stuck around trying harder - it hurt that I loved him as much as I did, and it just.. wasn't enough.  I was walking on eggshells too since as much as I tried, a small mistake like talking to someone he didn't like, or writing with someone (roleplay) without explicitly telling him was seen and responded to on the same levels of cheating - but his events was okay,  reasonable in his mind, he didn't have any choice.  It had definitely made it worse, where I became afraid to be open because I was told it was fine to express my feelings - but if I did, id be yelled at and it seen as I was sure to betray. So eventually... I think for things that I have felt I wasn't doing wrong (making art for, chatting with, etc) I just didn't say anything. A total mistake on my part, I know.  The recent weeks have been exhausting - he was severely depressed, and as time passed he constantly mentioned how barely anyone would care if he died, that he wasn't my #1, that no one cared as much about him as he did others... it was exhausting to now beyond being told I'm not enough, that I couldn't keep him from feeling like I'd just brush off his death. We tried individual therapy, couples therapy, no luck.  I finally wanted to break up - if I'm not going to be enough, especially if I'm trying to solve my own issues... why should I put him in that situation? But I held off because of the way he spoke, that he wouldn't have a reason to live without me.   It came to a head when I went on a trip for a very personal need (visiting my passed mothers grave) but since I would be there, I would make quick side trips to see a friend. I didn't tell him initially, but I told him when he directly asked. It didn't turn out well - very confrontational,  just short of being hit I guess, since he wouldn't do so, but he threatened to find and attack said friend, among other things.  Even after when he calmed down, that made me more firmly decide to break up - because in our talk after, he expressed that he had no interest in... him. That he needed people to need him to the level that wasn't being met. He wanted to help, and be necessary - but I was never achieving that. And even when I try to push to do so, it never comes off as being genuine, so... it'd always be a lose/lose for me.  He wouldn't accept that, breaking up - because I never tried in his eyes, but me trying was never genuine so I can't break up.. because I never tried. Get why I am exhausted?  I consider it such, such a mistake that I left him alone to get out of the house because I was having a panic attack, but I thought it'd be safe (I got rid of all of the knives and risky items in my apartment).. he later told me that he checked himself into a hospital since he was a risk to himself.   It.. sucks. This is my chance to get away, and everyone who knows including my therapist (aside from his family) has told me that I need to get out of the house before he is released, or I shouldn't allow him back in.  But it's hard. At first I was really sure I wanted to end it, but now it's just like... if he really did have an issue he refused to get checked out at first, maybe it'll be acknowledged while he is gone? Should I give him a chance on new medication? What if his antidepressants + the occasional cold turkey periods was all that made things worse lately? Nevermind that I feel like I'm the complete cause of all of this - that if I somehow reached his standards, that we wouldn't be in this situation.  So I can't help but second guess my want to break up, or at least living separately, but I know that it's necessary, and that I would regret this chance to get space. And I'm terrified to tell my therapist this, since she was super pressing to find another place.  I have a week to wallow in my guilt and doubt while I figure things out, I guess.

355	real	I used to sell foot pics and enjoyed it [End Title]: Some people have previously called me depraved or weird when I did it in the past but I don't care anymore about their opinions. I'm thinking of doing it again at some point too. I was bullied for my long toes all of my life and always hid them away.  Now I know some people are attracted to big long toes like mine, it makes me feel a bit better about them!  I am not bad looking but I've spent most of my life worrying about my feet when I could have been making money and making people happy at the same time. I am definitely a people pleaser lol. Thanks for reading my confession!
205	real	In 2019 I ruined my one chance at finding love [End Title]:  TL;DR God blessed me with happiness but I was an idiot and I wasted it by catfishing this girl because I liked her.  It was a cold Wednesday night in November of 2019, I was really bored on the public bus (where anyone could get on and off) home from after school work and suddenly out of the blue, a very pretty girl who looks around my age walks onto the bus. I had never seen her before and she sat on a seat across from me making it really easy to glance at her and just admire it. She noticed me looking at her a couple of times and smiled but out of embarrassment I tried my best to make it seem like I wasn‚Äôt looking at her.  Then came the time for me to get off the bus, the bus stopped and I saw her stand up to leave the bus at the exact same time as me and surprise surprise she lived in the same estate as me, it was clearly an act of God but I was too stubborn to realise that at the time, I was actually shy for some reason, we were the only two who got off the bus then so we were all alone as we walked into the estate. Now what happens next had potential to be really awkward because we were walking in the same path and I was walking behind her, I felt like saying hi to her but I have never done that to a girl in my life in a situation like that and I never did.  But she had other plans, she turned around and saw me walking behind her, I looked up and her and she said hi to me. Now I don‚Äôt know what came over me but somehow I had managed to start a long conversation with her as were walking down the path and we just started asking each other random things and we both smiled throughout the whole thing, it was a really good conversation but eventually I had to stop talking and go to my house so I said bye to her and she did the same. The whole night I just spent thinking why any of that happened at all and what I even did to deserve that.  The next week she never came onto the bus and I walked home alone and just thought to myself that she might be sick or something so I waited another week and she didn‚Äôt come again.  So curiosity got the better of me and I looked up her name on Instagram and after days of finding different people I finally found her profile, but I didn‚Äôt want to come off as weird so instead of following her I made a fake account and messaged her there with a fake name. Now this is where everything started to go a bit downhill, well not ‚Äúa bit downhill‚Äù, this was basically the beginning of the end.  What happens next is pretty weird so before anyone asks I don‚Äôt know why I was like this and why I did what I did but just remember this was almost 2 years ago and I was dumb and stupid.  I messaged her on the fake account telling her that I had a crush on her and she asked who I was and I told her I can‚Äôt tell her, she basically said to me that I can just tell her she won‚Äôt react weirdly or anything and I started giving her clues and answers to her questions, she was asking if I went to her school etc. I don‚Äôt really know where I was going with this once again I was really stupid back then. I lied and told her I went to her school but then eventually she saw through that and asked me to tell the truth.  Now this conversation basically went on for a few days and another day came and surprisingly enough she came onto the bus I walked home with her, this time I asked her if she had instagram even though I knew she what it was I just wanted her to think that I only found out when she told me, and she did.  That night I added her on my real account and we didn‚Äôt really say anything there, so I logged onto the fake account and she seemed really invested in finding out who I was so I just continued to message her there. A day after I was beginning to get bored and realised how weird what I did was so I just asked her if she wanted to know who I was, and she said yes so I did.   Now I had really low expectations understandably and sure enough told me that we barely know each other and that we‚Äôve only spoken to each other twice and we could never be in a relationship but we could still be friends.  I knew that what I did was really weird so I just told her okay but I didn‚Äôt really stay in contact with her because to be honest I didn‚Äôt deserve to be her friend after what I did, not only that but it wouldn‚Äôt be the same talking to her.  She did come onto my bus occasionally afterwards but we never talked in person after that, she would always walk on the other path and walk home by herself.  This was around Christmas so it was pretty hard dealing with this short lived moment of happiness but eventually I sort of got over it, I still think about it every now and then thinking about what could have been.
387	real	We are all fucked [End Title]: Everything's becoming too expensive, climate change, peoples extreme political beliefs, Facism, big corporations controlling us plus the amount of other issues that I can't name off the top of my head and no political leader is doing anything about it. How sustainable is this lifestyle? It breaks my heart when I see people in their 20's and 30's not being able to start their life cause their stuck in their parents house due to house prices and rent being unaffordable for everyone. I'm 17 and I feel my future is gonna suck. Just when I thought my 6 years of hell in secondary school would be over I have all this to deal with. Fucking excellent
703	real	Possible divorce [End Title]: My husband and I are in a pretty bad situation before Covid started.  He is very sick, and I was just starting a new job in the corrections field.  I haven't been hit yet, but he has put holes in walls, separated me from family and friends, and been unemployed for a few years. I really do regret meeting him.  I don't know if I am the bad guy or if I am just always playing the victim. I've been abused before, and he sometimes uses that as an example of why I am being the asshole.   I don't know what to do anymore... He said I could not handle the "in sickness and in health" part of our vows, but I don't know if it is that or that he is just an asshole.  I often take off bites that are way too big, and I don't know what to do. We live in his grandmother's house, with his mother and brother. His mother and I are the only ones working, and thankfully are essential workers... But I don't know what to do. I've been working 48-60 hours mandatory, and I have been just at my wit's end. What do I do? Do I get a divorce?  Do I try and do something else? I don't know anymore.
521	real	Shrooms ruined my life [End Title]: Shrooms are powerful. They release a bunch of chemicals in your brain at once, which can be awesome, but can be bad at times too.   Anyways, let‚Äôs start at the beginning. I‚Äôve smoked weed since high school. Never had any issues, it was just something I did with my friends for fun because our town is small and boring. Talk about a gateway drug haha, they definitely are, but it‚Äôs mostly a choice to move forward all in all.  Fast forward a bit. After we graduated we decided to go on a trip to the beach, and we had 10g of shrooms and 2 tabs of acid. 4 of us total, so 2 people took the acid and 2 of us took shrooms. I took 5g of shrooms, and had a great time. I basically was able to reflect on my life up to the very moment I was in, and I saw how all my experience shaped me into who I was, and I was proud of myself for how far I‚Äôd come. I felt awesome and it was a great time.   Now seeing as my first experience with shrooms was a great time, my dealer ended up getting ahold of some shrooms and I was quick to buy them. I bought 7g total, enough for 2 smaller doses of 3.5g each, and I knew that would be plenty. I decided to do shrooms with a friend who I hadn‚Äôt talked to in 2 years, and we wanted to catch up a bit. This was my first mistake.   It turns out this kind of shrooms were much more potent, and much less mentally safe than the previous shrooms I took. I was tripping so hard I couldn‚Äôt comprehend my own train of thought, I couldn‚Äôt believe anything I was seeing, I was scared out of my mind, and above all else there was another person right next to me with a brain in their head just like mine, and the thought of even trying to communicate with it freaked me the fuck out.   I came down and nothing changed. I couldn‚Äôt be around people anymore unless I was super comfortable with them. People scared the shit out of me because I couldn‚Äôt even understand my own mind, and I had the drive to try and understand other people as well. It was like my neurological pathway of communication beyond simple talking was completely destroyed.  That was in 2018. Flash forward to 2020, in this moment, and I have the worst social anxiety I have ever had in my life. I wish I could go back and not take those shrooms the second time. I was awkward all throughout high school and as I graduated I was developing into the best version of myself, and doing shrooms for the second time was a fucking huge setback. I have almost zero motivation for anything, I have only 3-4 friends whom I talk to but rarely actually hang out with in person.   This quarantine has been a bit of a life saver for me because I don‚Äôt have to leave my house except for my ‚Äúessential to the country‚Äôs infrastructure‚Äù job, which is fine because it‚Äôs a factory job I barely have to socialize at, and I‚Äôm still making money which a lot of people can‚Äôt say right now, I‚Äôm very fortunate.   All in all, if you are thinking about taking shrooms, be cautious. They are one of the safer psychedelics of course, but be sure to take a smaller dose, make sure you take them in nature or somewhere else secluded, and for fucks sake make sure your strain is safe and your mental state is safer. Do not make the same mistake I did. It‚Äôs taken me 2 years to start coming out of my shell again and if I could take back my mistake I would.
637	real	I fucking love lifting weights. [End Title]: "lift heavy rock. Make sad head voice quiet". Well isn't that true. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety due to university and an ever shrinking social life. I felt helpless for the longest time. Due date. Due date. Due date. Every single. fucking. day. And this is also supposedly my last term, if I don't fuck everything up.   I've been fortunate enough for my father to offer to pay for my undergraduate studies, if I go to the school of his choice, which is in another country. If I fail a single module, it would mean I'd have to extend my stay here for 4 more months, which means I have to pay rent, utilities, internet, not to mention the failed module itself. The pressure is unreal.   But due to the quarantine, I've been trying to find a hobby to do at home to drown out the pressures of life. One day, I stumbled upon a gym-meme page on instagram. One post had a caveman with a thought bubble that said "lift heavy rock, make sad head voice quiet". On the comment section were people actually taking this seriously, saying that the gym gave them empowerment, the strength to get through life and all its challenges. So I said, why not. I got myself a barbell and some weights.   Fast forward to present day. I've stopped caring if I've improved my physical appearance. All that matters is I get that weight up in my lifts. They gave me the strength and confidence to deal with my problems. I feel like it hasn't only helped me physically, but also mentally. The doubts I had about myself went away when I proved time and time again that I COULD do it. I could get that personal record lift. I lifted double of what I used to struggle with. I am a changed man, and sad head voice has gone for good.

826	real	Slimeball [End Title]: You are slime. You taught your son to be just like you. He uses sex as a weapon. I have never been anything but a good fuck. You even told him once that you could show me how a real man does it. Sure, I cook, clean, raise kids, clean up his social messes, look the other way when he cheats but it isn't love that he feels. You are an ass. I hope that you find the same happiness in life that you have given to me.  One day I will be safe and you will still be an asshole. One day someone will love me because I am smart and funny. They will see the courage it took to endure this first life and they will be ok with me being a strong and intelligent person. One day your son will bury you and I will not feel sorry for him.
222	real	I just feel so incredibly alone. [End Title]: I wish things could be different.
604	real	My boss is mad at me and ignored me all day. [End Title]: This has been eating me alive all day. Im a counselor at an outdoor day camp with 5 others and our director. I came in today and noticed director quiet and a bit moody, not like their usual self(loud, engaging, talkative). Other counselors came in and noticed it too. We asked if she was good, she responded that she wasn‚Äôt. Maybe a family thing? Personal? We didn‚Äôt want to pry so we continued to sign kids in and what not. After half the day I picked up on something that made me slightly uneasy. She hasn‚Äôt said anything to me all day, but she has been talking to the other counselors.  Because ive been here the longest, and every other staff member including her are new, she asks for my help the most. Today she didnt ask me to do anything. Ive been ignored. No eye contact, no task to help with, nothing.   I tell another counselor ‚Äúhey I think she‚Äôs mad at me, she hasn‚Äôt talked to me all day.‚Äù Counselor‚Äôs eyes widen a bit and with a ever so slight grin and avoiding eye contact, tells me ‚Äúyeeeeeeeeeeeeaaahhhh sorta‚Äù. And just like that my mind starts gushing out possible reasons. I ask the counselor if they could tell me, or at least hint at it because if I never want to upset anybody and if i do i would like to fix it immediately. They tell me to ask another counselor. I wasnt about to walk around asking for an answer, even though im in panic mode.  Hour goes by and 2 other counselors were talking so i casually join in the convo for a bit. They werent awkward or anything so that relieved me. Eventually i said ‚Äúso im pretty sure boss is upset with me an it‚Äôs killing me on the inside‚Äù. One of them is like ‚ÄúyeAh she‚Äôs been talking about you all day‚Äù. Im stumped. What could ai have possibly have done?? Every year I‚Äôm asked to return and always get near perfect or perfect evaluations. Im even in the running to be assistant director next yeAr so I‚Äôve been on the top of my game the last few weeks.   Here‚Äôs some info that i know:  -Yesterday a supervisor came by and talked to boss for 10min. When they were done she said that me and another counselor were going to switch groups(no explanation given)  -Camper told me that he walked by there convo and heard boss say the kids listen to him(me) more than them(boss).  -All the counselors know because boss told them, but no one is telling me.   -I confronted boss after everyone else left today:  Me: Are you mad at me? It‚Äôs been very tense between us today.  Boss: yes.  Me: oh I‚Äôm really sorry is it something I did?  Boss: no. Well yes.  Me: ....ok can i know? I‚Äôd like to fix anything I‚Äôve done wrong.  Boss: i don‚Äôt want to talk about it now. It would be unprofessional. Talk about it tomorrow.  Me in my head: well ignoring me all day isn‚Äôt very professional either.   Im sorry this was long it‚Äôs been a long hot and tension filled day and just needed to get this out. I just cant think of anything i could‚Äôve done. Boss avoiding me doesn‚Äôt help either. I couldn‚Äôt even focus on the kids as much as I do because that‚Äôs the only thing on my mind. And since everyone seems to know i feel so isolated. This is middle school shit. Talk to me about the problem. Let‚Äôs solve it. Feels like everyone is against me but the other counselors are still talking to me normally so I feel like it‚Äôs not that bad. Thanks for anyone who reads this. I told myself not to let it bother me for the rest of the night and bring the same energy I usually do tomorrow. Im there for the kids and if i cant give them my all then it‚Äôs a failed day.
38	real	Should I show my sister a letter I wrote to myself as a child? [End Title]: I wrote a letter to my sister about how she treated me as a child and how she made me feel (we do not talk to each other) mainly because I've been told writing a letter to yourself in the past helps to deal with childhood trauma. I feel like I have let it go but probably won't work to mend our relationship unless she puts in the effort. Should I show her the letter in the future or do you think it may come off as a bit of a "you're the reason I was depressed!!" vibe. In the letter it's not accusatory as it was written to me in the past, and there are sections where I empathise about her behaviour but ultimately it was more as a final note to myself to close that chapter of my life.   Would showing her the letter be akin to that show 13 reasons why?? And does the fact that I'm blaming her mean that I may not have grown past it as much as I thought? I can blame her all I want but it's ultimately my mind that was depressed and thinking that way.
832	real	I've wasted so much of my parents' money on schooling yet I'm still unwilling to change... [End Title]: I've blown almost $15000 USD of my parents' money on non-existent/useless education throughout my lifetime. It started when I was in middle school, where they registered me for a private school that I had no intention of attending, left after the first day, and blew $2000 back then. I dropped out of culinary school last year after 3 weeks, blew $1000. I signed up for a "Personal Trainer Diploma" (LMAO) last year and just realized that this is not something I wish to do long-term or at all but am too far into it ($11000). My parents being the considerate individuals they are still supporting me in finishing it, despite the fact that I will not likely pursue this career path. I realize I'm a lazy idiot and I will probably end up working a dead-end minimum wage 9-5 job since its the path of least resistance and I will at least have more personal time for myself.  Yes, I do live with my parents I have no intent on moving out ever. I also haven't even graduated from high school.
8	real	It hurts [End Title]: I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years this month. I love him dearly - He's the best blessing I've ever received. I've always struggled with believing in God. I was in darkness for a while and I denied that he existed - I hated the thought of there being a God.  I met my boyfriend and he helped to change everything I viewed. His family is Catholic - so I was invited to attend mass. I started going - and I fell in love. I'd been to churches before, but never truly enjoyed them like I enjoy mass. Long story short, I decided that there was no way I could deny that God is real. I decided that I want to become Catholic - with my boyfriend - and I joined RCIA with him, and we are to be baptized together this Easter.  My mom does not approve of us being Catholic. She is a baptist - but she doesn't understand our religion. I try so very hard to explain to her the things I DO know - but I'm met with nothing but continued challenges and "you're wrong anyway."  It hurts. It really hurts because I've found where I want to be - I want to be a Catholic, and the person who is supposed to be my biggest supporter shoots me down. Not only does she frown upon me becoming a Catholic, but she constantly ridicules my relationship.  We plan to be married sometime soon - and we want to buy a house. I can't even bring it up to my mother without being told "if you love God like you say, why do you constantly live in sin?! Why do you live with your boyfriend?! Do you do this just because it's CONVENIENT for you?!?!! Why don't you just get married NOW like you're supposed to!?!!?!?!"  I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do... I want the engagement. I want to be proposed to.. I wanted to know how he and I would fair together if we lived together BEFORE we jumped the gun and got married.. So I moved in with him at his mom's house.. I wanted to know him and know how we get along..   I know that I'm a sinner - I know that I'll never be perfect.. But I want to be proposed to. I want to get married in the church, which we can't do yet BECAUSE WE AREN'T BAPTIZED.. I WANT to buy a home with him. I WANT to do things SLOW so that we don't get in to anything TERRIBLE and screw ourselves, LIKE SHE DID WITH MY BROTHERS DAD. AND MY DAD!!!  I want to be wiser than that.. But I am constantly reminded that I am WRONG. And I am DIRTY. And I am AWFUL.. But I already know these things, and I'm working to make it right.  I LOVE God. I worship him - and I ask him EVERY. DAY. to forgive me for being such a sinner. It is a BATTLE - but I get better every day. Every single day I am closer to being baptized - and I am closer to being married. And I become proud of that. Proud of the fact that I'm learning MORE about God every day, and every step forward I take is another step forward to being in communion with Him.  ...But then there's my mom. Who constantly feels like it's her job to remind me that I'm wrong about everything and God frowns on me. And it hurts. I sit at work and I cry because of the emails she sends me.  I know that I'm a sinner but to be reminded every day of my life exhausts me and it makes me cry harder than I ever have.

162	real	I know that my co-worker is autistic. She's still annoying. [End Title]: I (23M) feel bad about it because really she's a nice lady (45?F)  but sometimes I really just want her to shut the fuck up. We work in a small room together at the university's writing center so there's no real way to opt out of listening to a conversation. We're all grad students and virtually always have something to read or write. Last shift she talked nonstop from the time we got there until the time we left. I want to talk to her about it but there's literally no way to say "Hey can you talk less" without coming across as a dick. So I'm venting here. She also addressed the entire room for something trivial yet again as I was typing this.

I've just reached a tipping point today, I've told my parents I'm going to graduate in July but truth is I'm a 8 exams away to get it. Obviously I lied all the time in the last year, they really think I finished my university exams.   Now I don't know what to do. I can give all myself to pass these exams in June and July but I can't graduate before September. I feel bad, guilty and upset. I don't want to disappoint them. I'm a failure. During this last year I thought more times about suicide. Now I can't empty my mind of it.   Please help, I need an advice. Thank you.
833	real	Stop calling things an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù just because they don‚Äôt sound valid enough TO YOU [End Title]: If I based my opinion of life from the internet, I‚Äôd believe that there is no such thing as a set back, just an ‚Äúexcuse to be a victim‚Äù.   This mentality is even worse on reddit. I swear it‚Äôs like emotional retardation, total lack of empathy, and a smug, myopic outlook of the world are prerequisites for thriving on this platform.  You could be a war veteran on the streets with severe ptsd that has rendered you incapable of sustaining a job and some idiot from reddit would tell you ‚Äúwell, actually iF yOu rEaLLy wAntEd tO tUrN yOuR Life aRoUnd...‚Äù  This mentality is so fucking annoying and completely shuts down productive discourse.

313	real	Don‚Äôt Approach Girls walking around on campus. [End Title]: Seriously, if you want to meet girls try clubs, parties, classes, mutual friends, heck even the gym or dining hall.   Don‚Äôt try just walking up to girls you see walking around because that‚Äôll turn out bad for some reason I don‚Äôt get.  The two times I approached girls, one right when college started and one tonight it ended up badly.   First time I saw these two girls together walking out of the university hall and decided to approach them after awhile as they were heading in my general direction. I started talking to them about a board one of them had and the conversation seemed well off. I then got her snap and a few minutes later she blocked me.   Tonight I tried the same thing and tried to have a better convo and come across as more nicer and better and it seemed much better than last time, then the same happened.  If someone can answer, please lmk.
48	real	To My Boyfriend [End Title]: I feel like it‚Äôs been a long time coming, our relationship coming to an end, we haven‚Äôt broken up but I can literally feel it coming.  Part of me has accepted it, part of me wonders what the fuck am I going to do? My first love, the only person I‚Äôve spent time with since I‚Äôve moved to varsity, my best friend.   Losing your first love truly hurts, I know no matter how many times I beg to work things out, I know eventually you‚Äôll get tired of trying to work things out.   Wish you‚Äôd see me before I go back home for two weeks, you haven‚Äôt asked how I‚Äôve been, miss when you‚Äôd take care of me, did you forget I‚Äôm carrying yours, wonder what this all means.   In my dreams it all works out and we‚Äôre meant to be but when I wake up, alone, realise that in reality, you want me to leave.
217	real	My fathers death anniversary is tomorrow, im afraid to be alone... [End Title]: As of tomorrow, my father will have killed himself 9 years ago. I don't want to be alone and i need to get out of the house for my own sanity but im afraid i will have a panic attack if i leave. (he did it right when i got out of school so i came home to him...)  I miss him, he was the only person who knew what i was thinking or what i was going to say before i even said it. We were two peas in a pod, now its just me alone in this pod. I know my mother isn't going to want to do something for it but i do. I cant do my normal tradition of smoking a bowl for him because i might be getting a job soon and will be drug tested.   On a short budget so i cant make his favorite foods to eat either. Maybe ill just buy two things of mtn dew, one for me and one for him.

His daughter (one of several kids) passed a few years ago of ALS, and the son in law immediately took up with one of the nurses.  Maybe sickness makes them realize time is precious, but dang, 5 months? Feels more like a rebound :(  I bite my tongue but can‚Äôt get over the shock.
60	real	I have a huge crush on my kinesiologist [End Title]: The more I think of this the less it makes sense, but it feels fine letting it out in the open. We talk for the full hour I'm there and even though it is just meaningless banter, he remembers my worries and concerns, pays attention and shares with me his own. I know it is part of his job to be friendly. But it just feels nice. He must treat dozens of prettier younger more charming girls weekly, meaning I'd have no chance in hell of being liked back. And I've been in a stable relationship for 6 years already. So just that. This Friday is my last session ever, after that I am moving overseas.

646	real	I got a guy fired. [End Title]: I'm a Quality Engineer in a glass manufacturing company. So each engineer have men under contract working as Sorters. So, as part of there job they sit before the moving bottles and reject the defective ones. So, one day production operator comes to me and complaints that one of the sorters asked for chewing tobacco as a bribe to pass the bottles over an argument they were having over the rejection of the bottles. I take this up with P&amp;A Dept and after a enquiry they fired the guy. These guys are usually from a poor family backgrounds or sometimes the only breadwinners in their house. I think now that I should have resolved it myself or given him a warning of some kind. Before this bribing incident came to light I knew the person to be a very good worker.

We headed out from the dock, and to our first cove. I was farting like crazy, then told my buddy, "I gotta shit!". He offered to head to the bank, but it was too late. I pulled my pants off of on leg, stood up with one foot on the motor, and one on the deck and shot a blast of mustard gray crap into the water. Man, that felt great. I got done  just before another boat came around the bend. I'm sure the saw the floater I left for them.

691	real	Hard break up [End Title]: My ex-wife moved out at the end of 2020, we now share custody of our 2 year old son 50/50. I was super lonely when it was her week with him so I started using online dating sites. I met a wonderful person, we got along in every single way and she really made a difference for me. Made me re-evaluate my relationship with me ex, which I had a lot of self blame for. My confidence and self worth improved drastically. We eventually met up for a few dates on the weeks my ex had custody and things only got better from there.   Yesterday after work I went over to her place, we went out for food and drinks, then went back to her place. We had a nice night together, and I was going to spend the night there. As we got into bed and were lying there I started to rub her back and she snapped "stop touching me." It came out of nowhere, so I told her if she wasn't comfortable with me spending the night I would leave. She said "I don't know what to say" and I told her I just want her to be comfortable and happy. She was silent for a few moments before she said "I can't see you anymore."  There was nothing that I did wrong. That's what hurts so much I think. We are so compatible in every way, which is why it hurt her so much too. She thought she was okay with me having a kid, but she isn't. She doesn't want kids, and doesn't think she ever will. She didn't want this relationship to continue because even though she had no issues with commiting to me, she couldn't commit to my son.  I respect her so much for ending things now before we were more involved. This happened at 2:30am last night, and it's 5:30pm here now. I haven't heard a word from since, removed her from any social media, deleted her contact from my phone. Just trying to erase her. It was only a few months we were talking and I'm sure I will get over it quick since our relationship was short lived, it just hurts so much to know someone that I was so compatible with in so many ways is gone from my life forever within minutes.
404	real	Thanks for making me have a shit day, boss. [End Title]: I'm a software dev intern and today I experienced what it's like to have your workplace superior be hateful to you for no reason at all, it sucks.  First of all I should explain that because of lack of time from everyone else in the company two weeks ago I was assigned to be responsible for a whole project, from architecture to development. The project was/is also waaay above my level, I've been an intern for only 3 months  and I've got no prior experience.  At first I was pretty pumped up for the amount of responsibility that I was given but then my lack of knowledge started to show and I was having trouble getting somewhere. So I did the only thing that was within my reach, I studied my ass off. With that came a lot of stress and anxiety, I've felt absolute dread thinking I wouldn't be able to finish it in time, went without showering for some days. I dreamt about developing the project almost everyday in the last two weeks, I'd wake up in ecstasy because in my dreams I had found a way to do it. I gave my everything for this.  My boss did check how I was doing sometimes and when I found myself stuck and asked him how to something he'd say "I don't know.". Even when he did help me or gave me a hint it wouldn't work when I tried applying it.  Today I finally managed to do the necessary for a proof of concept for our client tomorrow and was stoked. Me and my boss got on a video call and he asked me to explain what I've done. So that's what I did, I told him every step I took, explained to him why the things he told me to do when he tried to help wouldn't work and showed him the final results. As I'm in the middle of my presentation he cut me off and said "Get off your high horse and don't talk to me in that tone, are we clear?" That did take me by surprise, I was just talking to him normally, and people even say that I usually have a very serene way of speaking, there is no way I was being aggressive or something. I said that I couldn't understand what he meant and he just responded "I won't accept you talking to me like that, so you'd better rethink your words." I apologized without really knowing why and kept going. He didn't interrupt me anymore.  I don't know what's up with this guy, maybe he was having a bad day but there's zero need to take it out on others and make their day bad as well. Especially on the person that had no business being responsible for the project YOU accepted and didn't even know how you'd accomplish it.
962	real	I (25/M) Met A Girl (23/F) On Omegle [End Title]: I decided to hop omegle because I was bored asf especially since being in covid lockdown, so there I am swiping through random people *most of them swiped on me üôÑ go figure* until I met this girl and so we started talking for a while I didn't think of it as anything more neither did she we were just chatting getting to know each other, she's pretty cool she's quiet but im quiet aswell so it was awkward silences too but I tried to keep a conversation going "also heads up im not good with talking to girls so my mind was all over the place" started asking questions what we do for a living, interests etc. And so that was it, I even asked if she has insta or facebook but she told she doesn't except for snapchat so I asked for her snap cos I was actually interested in talking to her more so we started chatting abit more on there after ending the conversation on omegle &amp; since then we've only spoken to each other a few times either every other day or once every two days, she's a personal trainer so I felt like she didn't have much time to talk to people on social media even if it is only snapchat she uses, I work too as a pizza delivery guy so yeah.  I'm confused on how im feeling right now &amp; im not too sure if I either like this girl or just like talking to her as someone I just met, im just confused that's all, she's pretty cool &amp; nice but we're sort of different in some ways, taste in music &amp; probably in other things too.  Lately I've been the last person to respond back on our conversation &amp; she usually only responds back to me the next day one time &amp; I feel like she's getting bored with talking to me or I'm probably overthinking it because now im like constantly thinking bout the next time she responds back to me and I'm hoping it's not just a one time response because I notice when people do that, it makes me feel like they lost interest in talking to me &amp; honestly I have no clue whether I like this girl or not because if I'm thinking bout if she's ever gonna respond back then what does that mean ? *do I like her or do I just like talking to her as a friend????*  I could be overthinking this but I thought I would just speak about it on here because I want to let out my thoughts so yeah.

My life sucks every girl i liked has rejected me and friendzoned me if i lose weight and still can't attract a good looking woman then it means I'll always be conventionally unattractive.
536	real	Never been perfect [End Title]: Just need to vent....so I have started working out again this week. Not at a gym just kind of on my own with an app. I'm trying to finally get to an acceptable point for myself.  I always get discouraged because some my people don't think I'll ever get any smaller. I'm just a size 8, down from a 16 but I've been stuck here for 2 years.  I try to workout when nobody is awake or around wherever I am at the moment. Today that wasn't an option. I was laughed at and feel like I was being mocked for trying to better myself.  Exact words were "yeah have fun with getting ripped" followed by laughter. Yes I was struggling to follow the workout but damn I was doing something!  Maybe I shouldn't be bothered by it but I am.  I'm an adult and should be able to brush it off some days I can others not so much.  I know it's trivial. Just expressing frustration.

Fuck the void, fuck the planets, fuck the stars, fuck heat death, fuck the big bang, fuck earth, fuck nature, fuck diseases, fuck aging, fuck death, fuck time, fuck it all. And to all of those good and beautiful things out there, yeah, kindly fuck you too. Yeah, you're cool and all, but ain't fixing the other shit.  Yeah, I know the universe doesn't give a crap about anything, mostly since it's a collection of stuff of which we are part of, nothing sentient. Just stuff. Unless it does have a sentience or some shit, in which case, I'm making a double fool of myself; and in which case, fuck it even more still.   But I ain't gonna throw the towel. Nah, fuck that too. I'm gonna be here til the bitter end, and when the time runs out, I'm gonna kick and scream as much as possible. So yeah. Damn, felt nice to spew something.

528	real	A few years ago my ex cheated on me and wouldn't cut contact with the person he cheated on me with so I made it so the person he cheated on me with cut him off. [End Title]: He was the guy (P) I was told not to worry about. Gut was right. I knew my ex (F) was going to cheat on me before it happened, I felt it in my bones. And he did. Him and the guy were childhood friends and they went way back and had a bit of a history, and I knew he was going to be seeing him and that at that point, stuff would happen. This is a bit of a confusing story so bear with me here.   While P was with his ex girlfriend (A), he cheated on her with F. Then P became single, and F cheated on me with P. Now, A lived with F's best friend and his fianc√© (AH) - they knew about P cheating on A with F, but did not say anything to her.   So I found out, and I lost my shit. About all of it. I told F that if he wanted any kind of second chance, he would have to cut contact with P, completely. Around that time, I'd also developed symptomatic HPV. I'm not sure whether F gave it to me or I gave it to him (this was before the cheating).   My ex was reluctant to cut contact, so I said that if he did not cut contact, I would tell A, and dump AH in it as well. I was begged not to, because A was still heartbroken and did not know why she was broken up with, they'd been together for 4 years. Everyone was panicking that I would basically dump everyone in it with this girl.   I wouldn't have done it, there is no merit in hurting someone who is not involved for my own purposes. Although, I do still believe she has a right to know that her ex was sleeping with my ex when they were together, and the same had happened to me as well.   Because my ex was reluctant to cut contact, I took matters into my own hands. If my ex would not cut contact, I would make sure P would cut contact with him instead. Was further infuriated when I saw a message from F to P: 'H(me) knows about what happened'. P replies: 'oh I'm sorry to hear that'. Sheeeeeeeeesh. You're sorry to hear that? Okay.    I said that he also needed to tell P that he had passed on HPV as they hadn't used a condom. F was reluctant to do this, so the threat went from, I am going to tell A everything, tell P you've given him an STI myself, and showed him a message I had drafted which I was going to send, and it was not pretty.   AH would also be implicated and it was in their interests to shut me up as well - such that when me and my ex finally broke up AH sent my ex a message telling my ex to tell me not to say anything...2 years after it had happened. LMAO. (AH stands for assholes, in case you were wondering).  As above, I was never actually going to tell A, but it worked a charm.   In fact, it's some of the worst stuff I've ever written. I'm not proud of it. It would have outed this guy. Being gay myself, I know how awful that is to do to someone. With how angry I was, I would have sent it and created havoc for all involved. I did no such thing. But knowing I would have sent that message? That's a confession in itself.   F eventually told P about the STI, and P never replied. About a year later F asks if he can try to see up with P to 'say goodbye' as I was his priority now. I said sure, go ahead, because I wanted to see if my plan had worked. Turns out, it had. That message also went blanked. Job done.   Upon reflection, I'm not proud of what I did or how I reacted to this situation. I effectively emotionally blackmailed my ex and my ex's friends by way of threatening to cause upset to someone completely unrelated and out the guy my ex cheated on me with. I needed to get this off my chest.

645	real	I'm sick of my father [End Title]: I used to think the world of him. Over the past few years, it has dawned on me that he might actually be a terrible person. I guess I'll start from the beginning and work from there.   My parents divorced early in my life, and from there on out my dad did nothing but whine and complain. The entire time I was growing up right up until I left for university, I was treated to regular rants about how she had apparently "ruined" his life. He literally constantly shit-talked the mother of his kids *to his own fucking kid!* Saying things like that she is a "piece of work" or that she was "turning us against him." I don't think it ever occurred to him that this might have been an immoral or even questionable thing to do. But out of love for him, I was totally blind to it.  He would also constantly throw tantrums over completely trivial things. For example: one time I was holding a soda for him in a convenience store while he went to the bathroom. I was 7 at the time. He comes out and we go to the car, and after opening the bottle it fizzes and overflows all over the floor of the vehicle. He immediately starts screaming his face off at me and I remember him hitting my leg at one point. I was fucking terrified. Another time, we were camping and my sister and I tracked a bit of grass into the fifth-wheel trailer. Again, he just immediately launched into an insane screaming tantrum as soon as he saw the "mess", which all told took maybe a few minutes to clean up. He loved to say things like "There's always something" whenever something went the least bit wrong, or even when it didn't and he was only anticipating whatever horrible events might conspire to ruin his day. I remember every family camping trip consisted of nothing but tension and him saying things like this, and if we were lucky he wouldn't launch into one of his famous screaming tantrums. At least when we were at his house we could avoid his BS by staying in our rooms, but his toxic attitude pervaded everything. Incidents like these continued throughout the rest of my life before I left for university.   That's when the real fun started. I would call him up pretty much every week and be treated to the same shitty self-pity infused diatribe every single fucking time. He would say things like "if I could do my life over again, I would do what you're doing" and talk about how shitty his colleagues at work were (who, incidentally, were also the bearers of the responsibility for ruining his life). He also liked to say things like "you'll understand how I feel when you're older", as if becoming a self-pitying wreck of a human being is some necessary rite of passage to even be capable of empathy for him. He even told me in person, to my face and over the phone, that he could now "live vicariously through me" while I was studying at university and doing the things he had always wanted to do. I have never been able to wrap my head around how he could have thought that was a remotely acceptable thing to say to his son. Of course he continued to shit-talk my mother the entire time. He also had a massive falling-out with sis right when I began my studies, after throwing one of his famous tantrums. After this incident, he came to me with an absolutely pitiful and (in retrospect) disgusting appeal for how she had apparently wronged him. His idea of an apology for overreacting was to text her "Hello". When she didn't reply, that was it. Relationship over. Over the following years I was treated to a helping of all the bad feelings of his that came of this fallout as well.   The years pass, and my graduation comes around. Despite everything about the way he has been, at this point I still regarded him as the most important figure in my life. So on the day of my graduation we are all gathered on the campus together; my mom, sister, dad, grandparents, etc. And he can't even act normal for the duration of a single fucking day. Around my mom and sis he acts completely standoffish and rude. After the ceremony we went out for dinner and he refused to come to the restaurant because the prospect of having a meal in the presence of two of the people who "ruined his life" was just too much to bear. And finally, when I said goodbye to him personally, and it was just the two of us at his car, I hugged him. And in response, he just stood there like a limp rag. He couldn't even hug his own son back on the most important day of his life up to that point. I have never, ever been even remotely able to rationalize how he could have thought that was OK, and it has bothered me to no end in the years that followed that day.   It has only been in the last few years that I have come to see my dad in a new light. I think he's a downright awful human being. He spends the majority of his time laying on the floor and absorbing the news. He constantly complains about and shit-talks other people, whose lives he knows nothing about. He hasn‚Äôt even attempted to clean his house in more than 8 years, and there are still items in the back of his fridge from when sis and I were toddlers. He is manipulative, vindictive, weak, cowardly, narcissistic and temperamental. I truly believed that by hearing him out and showing him I cared about his problems that things would start to improve for him, but I was mistaken. He has only gotten into my head and made me extremely unhappy, and I needed to get this off my chest.
225	real	I‚Äôm quite torn [End Title]: First and foremost, I‚Äôll provide context to why I‚Äôm torn. Me and my ex of nearly two years (11 months previously before we got back together again) broke up going on 4 months ago. At first I was distraught, for the first three months I was but i slowly come to accept it more and more and I didn‚Äôt become happy but I was okay. It was due to the fact I didn‚Äôt try and talk to her more as time went on, and she had seriously little time for me that i actually healed, or so I thought.  About a week ago now she called me. No warning, few texts but it was completely about of the blue, she did this a couple months earlier when she was really upset about something, she came to me. She was down about a family friend (I learned a couple days later was now her boyfriend) had been arrested and she was very upset. I asked why she had called and she said she needed a friend, but I never knew she even classed me as friend anymore?? Anyway for the next couple days and mornings (I was off work) she called and we just chilled together, she commented on how nice it was to be around me again and even got a little jealous when I would get notifications (this wasn‚Äôt new, she used to always get nosey and jealous when my attention was diverted away.) Then I learned about how she had moved on, and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself around to being happy for her but actually being so hurt, but also happy he was being put in prison, so much so I couldn‚Äôt help but be honest, I thought it was best. This led to her going, understandably pissed at me, continuously calling me names saying she regrets ever meeting me, ever knowing me and some things that are too personal to reveal, they hurt a lot. The following day, she was seemingly docile until something reignited her and she started up again with all the abuse. I didn‚Äôt take it to heart as much, I know her well enough to know she was saying it out of hurt more than anything, trying to hurt me. I thought that whatever friendship we even had at that moment was lost, I thought I‚Äôd lost her for good.  Until she called again that same night. I was so confused because by now I‚Äôve probably given her every reason to hate me and yet here she was, she wanted to talk to me and she wanted me around for comfort. Even when I would offer to leave she refused to let me go and got visibly upset that I was leaving, it wasn‚Äôt necessarily that she wanted to be alone it was that I was there that she could keep herself together. She still shows me that warm loving smile she used to, she still cares deeply about how i feel and, dare I say she still comes to me for support.  I realised why she had been around less and obviously she was around her boyfriend instead, but now I can‚Äôt stop asking why me of all people, her ex who emotionally drained her, who destroyed the relationship just because of how insecure and jealous he is, why would I be the one she relies on when she needs someone the most? I‚Äôm torn because I want to see this girl blossom into the wonderful, most amazingly beautiful and intelligent woman I know she can be, but I also know her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt deserve her, and that goes without saying that I definitely don‚Äôt deserve her. I‚Äôm happy he was arrested, I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs more than likely gonna be sentenced because he is guilty of what he‚Äôs done and I know he doesn‚Äôt love her. But I can‚Äôt say this to her because it simply isn‚Äôt my place, nor do I want to lose her anymore than I already have. I‚Äôll be honest with you, I really don‚Äôt know what it is anymore. I guess really I‚Äôm just looking for someone to offer guidance or tell me I‚Äôm completely overthinking everything and/or tell me I‚Äôm just a jealous idiot. I just can‚Äôt make sense of the situation i am in
557	real	Stop Telling Me to Be Strong [End Title]: As a child, I cried a lot. I was easily bent. My family constantly fought. My mother was ill. My grandmother a figure of terror. My grandfather, while not a safe haven, could sometimes be seen as indulging when he didn't fully behind my grandmother or now better known as grandmonster.  The adults in my life were no help since a few told me to not cry. While others thought telling a young child of five to suck it up and don't cry. Your mom is going to die. I had few friends because I somehow snubbed the popular girl who was once my best friend. From being well liked and having someone to count on, I became a pariah. Only a few played with me or sometimes just on weekends where no one else would know. I still cried and bent so easily.   Though, my mother loved me. Though, between her parents, her illness, depression, and general helplessness I sometimes became the target of her ire. Telling me if I didn't get good grades or clean my room, she would send me to a father that ran off. Sometimes her temper would flair and physical punishment would be dealt. But not always spanking sometimes it was being hit with a plastic hanger till it broke, my toys pelted at my back, sometimes it was my clothes. The worst were always the school books or shoes thrown at me. Each time, I cried and it got worse with the words, 'I give you something to cry about'. Yet after the episode of all that, she would remain angry for maybe a few more hours or a day then she would beg for my forgiveness which I always gave. Thus, this continued.   Many times I cried until one day I got tired. I didn't want to cry. From that day a became a little rock at the age of ten. My grandmother would never love me. My grandfather while kind would occasionally show me affection. My mother while normal loving could not always be counted on because of her illness or depression. So, I stopped crying. I stopped seeking help from my mom unless the situation was dire. While the emotional and psychological abuse from my grandmonster never stopped. The occasionally physical abuse stopped from my mother. Though, I became her support pillar at too much of young age to know about the financial burden and such things. (Age 8 I know about the finances, her abuses etc)  Now, my grandfather, my Papi, the only father I ever had is dead due to medical negligence. All everyone has been telling is to be strong. You have to be strong for your mom. She's sick and your her pillar of support. Meanwhile, all my pillars of support are a continent away. My support system which took YEARS TO BUILD is on another continent. They are doing what they can while an ocean away, but there's only so much to that they can do. I know that some, if they had the cash, would get on a plane and be here.   I want to yell at people 'Stop telling to be strong! I've been strong since I was 10! Let me cry! LET ME WAIL BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE ONLY TIME I CAN DO IT.'  Let me cry for the only person in my family who has NEVER HIT ME. The only person who bought me candies or small toys just because and not as rewards, bribery, or apologies. Let me cry for the closest thing I had to a father. I'll never see him again or hear him again. All I will have are pictures, memories and his ashes. He was recovering from an illness but because of medical negligence he didn't survive. He fought till the fucking end to live. Because he want to die at 95 or 105 not 89.   SO, stop telling me to be strong. I made myself from a god damn piece of straw to fucking Galvanized steel. I've slowly trying to get out the dents in myself. Because whenever I finally got help to mend the dents (psychological help) it been taken away due to circumstances. So fucking let me open up the dam. LET ME FUCKING CRY FOR MY GRANDPA. STOP TELLING ME TO BE STRONG. I WANT THIS MOMENT OF WEAKNESS. I'VE NOT LET ALL THE OTHER TERRIBLE THINGS BREAK ME.  I just need this moment. Please just let me cry for him. Let me be sad. That's all I need.

164	real	The interconnectivity the world has thanks to the internet is amazing [End Title]:  I love learning about other cultures and customs and the fact that I can do it from the comfort of my own home is absolutely astonishing. I‚Äôve learn so much by talking with people on the other side of word that I would probably never meet without the Internet. It‚Äôs even made me more social, The other day on a hike I had a conversation in Spanish, a language that I only took 3 years of and am barely adequate in but because of talking with people in Venezuela and Columbia on the internet I was confident to do it face to face. I‚Äôve learned a lot more from talking with people on the internet than I ever did with a worlds cultures  class. I have a better understanding on what‚Äôs going on in the world because I‚Äôm able to talk with the people it affects.   Sorry if this seems like a rant and very disjointed but I‚Äôm just very grateful that I‚Äôm able to talk with people all over the world and I would go into a lot more but I feel this post is getting too long.
736	real	I can‚Äôt get over my abusive ex... [End Title]: I have been separated from my wife since June. She has some mental issues such as PTSD. She was raised in an abusive home. I have intervened in her issues before, such as when her mother, father and sister were beating on her she called me while we were dating and I asked my parents if she could stay with us. So she packed her things and moved in with us. Then we got a place of our own eventually and because she wanted to become a singer and I had no dreams or goals of my own I thought I would support so moved almost 11 hours from my hometown.   She always had a problem with other people, like if you met her in person you probably wouldn‚Äôt like her because she stares at you like she is judging you. She couldn‚Äôt keep a job no matter what. She blamed it on everyone else that they were sabotaging her because they didn‚Äôt like her. But I can‚Äôt help think how can you lose job after job after job? The only job she kept the longest for was 8-9 months and even then everyday she was crying about how she wanted to quit because of how they treated her. I would always be the one working all the time and when she was unemployed and I came back from work and let‚Äôs say I had the day off the next day she would complain that I don‚Äôt help around the house.  The worst part was she got into drinking and then would start to bully me when she got drunk and because I wasn‚Äôt acknowledging her bullying she would resolve to violence. She has thrown plates and mugs at me. She has punched me, kicked me, clawed at me with her nails, bite me, hit me in the balls, cut my face with a knife and on one occasion sent me to the hospital after beating me with a broom that broke in half and had sharp edges and left me with scars that I will see for the rest of my life....   I met another girl who I really like but I honestly still wish that it would have worked out with my wife... but she left for another guy who apparently listened to her and appreciated her and was calling her beautiful. I later found out that he was only interested in being fuck buddies only, so she gave up her marriage for something that wasn‚Äôt worth it.   She has blamed me for everything and she has called me abusive and accused me of not loving her, even though I took care of her when no one else cared about her.   She has always said to me that I could never get better than her, and that I‚Äôm scum and I deserve to die. But even with everything that she has done to me and has said, I still feel a little bit of love towards her and wished it would have worked out.   I‚Äôm just looking for your opinions and thoughts, and if you have any questions please ask me. I just need to vent. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have any children with her but I‚Äôm sad that my marriage went to shit... I thought she was the one. I thought since I saved her that she was gonna be my forever partner you know?   Anyway I‚Äôm just having trouble letting her go and getting her out of my thoughts.   Tell me what you think..... thank you to whoever took the time to read this.
36	real	I think I might be a narcissist. [End Title]: When I read various definitions and characteristics of narcissism, I think, "Oh, shit, that sounds like me." But then I read where a genuine narcissist would never diagnose themselves as such. So now I don't know. One thing I know for sure is that the traits within me that meet the criteria are things I keep very well hidden. People think I'm wonderful. Deep down, I think I'm manipulative, controlling, deceptive, and dishonest. Maybe I just have low self esteem. Now I'm just confusing myself even more.

Someone that makes you uncomfortable because they hold you accountable is not "toxic."   It's a very cool sounding word, to be sure. But quite possibly on track to be the most abused, overused, and projected word ever.

No. Was i scared shitless? Absolutely. You thought it was my friend but no. It was ME. The shy girl. I shoved them in my pencil case. Then after the bell rang for next period i ran to the bathroom and flushed them. Next period came and i left my pencil case on the counter where you proceeded to open to take a pencil bc you left yours. No silly bands. Why? BC I FLUSHED THEM. I was saved that day. From my anxiety. I stole them for nothing. Sorry not sorry.
230	real	I was sexually abused as a kid [End Title]: I've never told anyone about it, mainly because I didn't even remember it or realize what it was until years later. The abuser was my grandfather and he is now dead, and when I did remember it late in middle school I didn't think it was important to tell anyone and I didn't want my family to see that side of him.          It started a year or two before my grandfather died (when I was in 6th grade, so it started around 4th and 5th). He would have me sit on his lap, and then he'd rub his hand in that area between my legs while we watched TV. In hindsight it was super weird. It wasn't violent or anything (thankfully) and it could have been a lot worse. But it did make me super uncomfortable and stressed whenever I had to go to their house. He told me that it was our secret, and he would only touch me if we were alone or if there was a blanket over my lap. What's worse is they lived in the same town, and my mom had started a part time job (on top of my dad who already worked), so I was dropped off at their house often.      I have this memory of standing in the kitchen with him towering over me asking if it was okay and if I wanted him to stop. But I was the sort of perfectionist kid that wanted to please everyone, and I didn't want to disappoint him, so I told him it was okay.   So yeah. Throughout my life I never really thought it was a big deal but today I wanted to get it off my chest.
21	real	You can call it a 'salad' but it doesn't make it food [End Title]: I've had this on my chest for a long, long time. Salads. Not the colorful, leafy ones you eat with vinegarette and crusty bread, but the gloopy abominations that get slopped onto your plate by a bored caterer at every mid-range wedding and potluck from Vermont to Oklahoma.   I know they've been a thing since far before I came along, but I think now is a wonderful time to stop. Midwesterners, please. Collectively come together and oust these so-called salads from your cultural digest. Please. I mean, at least at one (1) fruit or vegetable to them‚Ä†. I'm sincerely begging you.   You can't just toss random shit in mayo (or Cool Whip‚Ñ¢ if it's a dessert) dressing and call it a salad! You're not fooling anyone, The Midwest. Calling random foodstuffs dressed in mayo a salad does not make. Firstly, barely any of these (I'll be generous and call them) foodstuffs contain any actual vegetables. They're liar salads.   Midwestern cuisine is like 60% these 'salads' and not a lick of them have anything green in them! Unless you count lime Jell-0‚Ñ¢. Macaroni salad, egg salad, tuna salad, ambrosia salad. In another subreddit I saw someone call the filling of a Maine Lobster roll 'lobster salad'. NO! STOP! It is NOT a salad! Salads have integrity. The Midwestern answer to 'salad' just looks like something you'd spot on the floor of a taxi at 2AM on Saturday. It's hardly food.   Coleslaw is the closest thing to a salad as any of these get... Yet nobody calls it 'cabbage salad'! Why not?! Instead, they're over here tossing chopped apples and candy bars together and calling it salad, or Jell-O‚Ñ¢ and canned fruit cocktail. Excuse me, ma'am, but where is the salad in any of these?! How many more potlucks and weddings do I have to endure before we collectively wise up and realize that this slop isn't anywhere near salad?!   Flyover food culture is a joke!  ‚Ä†And no, celery doesn't count. It's not a real fucking vegetable and nobody actually likes eating it. We just put up with it so people don't think we're picky. Same goes for green bell peppers.
442	real	I am so terrified that my memories aren‚Äôt correct and have corroded into lies through time. [End Title]: What if it‚Äôs a lie? What if I didn‚Äôt attempt suicide back in 6th grade? I know I held my cousin‚Äôs fake gun, and I know I fired it at myself, but was I actually aware of it not being real? I don‚Äôt think I was, but the more I think about it, the more I realize I don‚Äôt really recall.  How do I know that the terrible thing I was accused of wasn‚Äôt true? What if I‚Äôm some sick monster and have been trying to convince myself otherwise for so long that I‚Äôve started to believe it? I don‚Äôt even know.  I think this might be my worst fear. Just needed to rant about it. sorry.
620	real	The weird shit my roommates and I do.. NSFW [End Title]: Uhh ok so, we‚Äôre pretty weird.. we‚Äôre all military. We‚Äôre at MOS school which is the schooling for our jobs. It‚Äôs the second to last step before hitting the fleet. So, for me boot camp was 5 months. (Normally it‚Äôs 3) I was in for 2 extra months for medical issues. So, I was sex deprived.. near the end of the 5 months I felt like I could literally fuck anyone. And I do mean a n y o n e. Male or female.   Then 10 day boot leave and shit I was like a bunny.   MCT came around (marine combat training) which is 1 month long and again, sex deprived.   For MOS school I was determined to not let this be the case again but since we‚Äôre not allowed to fuck.. yep. I also didn‚Äôt get signal in the room so I decided to buy WiFi.   So, i had this extra phone I brought with me. I jokingly called it my ‚Äúporn phone‚Äù but eventually.. it became my porn phone. My roommates got in on it and soon we made a ‚Äúbathroom reservation ‚Äú and to make it more legit we made an actual piece of paper and hung it on the bathroom door. One day for field day we forgot to take it off and the instructor came in and kept staring at it ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù We said it was a reservation for who showers when.. lmfao.   Then, my porn phone just became the rooms porn phone.. tbh we don‚Äôt even close the tabs anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èthere‚Äôs a shit load of tabs open and we‚Äôre just too lazy to close them.
984	real	We're hearing a woman's voice in our apartment, and I'm terrified [End Title]: For the past few months, I've been hearing what sounds like a middle-aged American woman saying "hmm" very vividly. It sounds *so* distinctively like a human!  I hear it on average every 2 days, but sometimes I'll hear it twice in one day, or not at all. I know I'm not just hearing things because my boyfriend and roommate heard it last night too!  The *hmm* noise lasts for about a full second in length of time. It sounds almost IDENTICAL to Amazon Echo's voice for Alexa. I thought it was that at first, but my Echo is in my room near my bed, so I would've been able to tell if it was coming from that.  I live in a 2-story loft on the 2nd floor. My roommate's bedroom is directly below mine, but she says she's never heard the noise unless she's in the living room area. I've heard it there too, but I hear it the strongest when I'm inside my room. The closet where the AC/heat and water heater are is directly next to my room. I was thinking that that's what the noise is coming from. However, one time I heard the hmm noise 30 seconds before the heat kicked on, and a separate time I heard the noise about halfway through when the heat was running for about 8-10 minutes.   I'm having such bad anxiety thinking about what that noise is coming from. If it was a quieter, less articulate noise, I wouldn't worry about it. But this sounds EXACTLY like a middle-aged woman saying "hmm," and it's definitely not quiet, but not super loud either.   To try to calm our worries that we either have a person hiding in our house or ghosts, we've named the noise Alexis. I'm not even kidding, sometimes Alexis makes a more calm sounding *hmm*, and sometimes its an angry, disappointing sounding *hmm*.  To try to calm our worries that we either have a person hiding in our house or ghosts, we've named the noise Alexis. I'm not even kidding, sometimes Alexis makes a calmer sounding
522	real	I (f20) have lost weight after years of hating my body and still hate my body [End Title]: (obligatory throwaway account and i‚Äôm on mobile so i‚Äôm sorry for any grammar errors)  I‚Äôm not sure if this needs a tw but i guess if you‚Äôre not into reading about eating disorders then this is your chance to keep scrolling lol.   I‚Äôve struggled with my body image since grade school and luckily in the seventh grade i was finally able to figure out why i felt like i looked like the most horrible looking creature on the planet and sometimes didn‚Äôt even recognize myself in the mirror. i was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder (bdd) which essentially distorts my mental image of myself and makes me do things like pick at my skin (super fun! /s). And although this has helped me understand that how i perceive myself isn‚Äôt how others see me, it has honestly just made me hyper aware of my outward appearance. My therapist was hoping that the diagnosis would help me get over my body issues but it‚Äôs honestly gotten worse (not her fault i‚Äôm just weird i guess).   Around grade 8 my family moved to a new state and the idea of meeting new people made me so anxious which of course set off a weird alarm in my brain that was like ‚Äúwell the only way they‚Äôll like you is if you‚Äôre skinny and pretty‚Äù which thinking back now was kind of ridiculous but i just had such a want and need to have everyone like me and think i was attractive. So i started calorie counting which led to disordered eating and obsessing over my weight. Mind you, I was 13 and *maybe* 100 lbs when i started eighth grade so by the time my parents realized i had a problem i was practically emaciated. The thing was that I used to eat a lot even with my worries about weight and my parents used to tease me about being chubby so when i started cutting back on how much i was eating they were near encouraging me and congratulating me on looking so thin.   I went to therapy, got treatment and was doing pretty great until my junior year of high school when i suddenly gained thirty pounds and fell off the wagon again. I lost about twenty before heading back to therapy and maintaining a healthy weight until my freshman year of college. That‚Äôs where shit kind of hit the fan for me emotionally and i guess all the years of pent up rage from only eating my ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods collapsed on themselves and i gorged nearly every night. I gained back those thirty pounds and then some. Tbh i felt pretty great, i didn‚Äôt really think about weight or how i looked because my boyfriend kept reassuring me that he thought i looked great and that if i was happy that was all that mattered. Until i came home for winter break, took a few photos with my family and bawled my eyes out when i saw them on facebook. I thought i looked humongous and i was so embarrassed that i was living my life looking how i did.   Since then my boyfriend and i have been (healthily) losing weight together and i‚Äôm down about twenty pounds and although i‚Äôm at a healthy weight, i still want to lose more to gain it back in muscle so i can finally have the toned muscle i‚Äôve always wanted but have been too afraid to gain.   My problem/confession is that i know, theoretically, that i look good. But when i look in the mirror, because of my BDD i do not know what i look like. And i‚Äôm scared that i don‚Äôt look as good as everyone says i do because i‚Äôve never really known what i actually look like so i can‚Äôt compare myself to anything.   TL/DR: I‚Äôve suffered through eating disorders and Body Dysmorphic Disorder most of my life so now that i‚Äôve lost weight, i‚Äôm not sure i look good at all, nor do i feel confident that i know what i look like and frankly, i‚Äôm too scared to find out.
747	real	I‚Äôm an Alcoholic. [End Title]: So, I have a pretty bad addiction to alcohol. I have been drinking since the age of 18 and from the ages of 22-28 I drank to blackout nearly everyday I had the money to buy booze. If I had money (which I usually didn‚Äôt since I spent it all on liquor) I would go to the liquor store or have a bottle already. I‚Äôve tried to quit about 4-5 times in the past two years (I‚Äôm 30 now). I don‚Äôt know how to help myself. The longest I‚Äôve gone without a drink is 94 days and my life was so good then. I moved from VA to CA for love any had a good job and loved with someone I loved very much, then I drank and lied to her about it. It ended our relationship and I was forced to move back to VA. Alcohol has put me in the hospital 6 times now, the most recent was this past Sunday and I‚Äôm still recovering. This most recent hospital visit I was moved to the ICU shortly after arrival because I had also taken 90 Atavan within about two weeks. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression, I have tried medication, I have been to AA, and nothing has done it. I‚Äôve lost my past 3 relationships and jobs to alcohol and nothing has mattered enough for me to make a permanent change. I don‚Äôt know what to do... I have so many people that love and support me but I still go back to the drink. I‚Äôve hurt so many people and done so many bad things... I think I‚Äôm beyond redemption at this point and I honestly think this last time was a suicide attempt, but I‚Äôm not sure.  I didn‚Äôt tell anybody it was, I played it off really well. I‚Äôm so sad, and don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm so worried I‚Äôm gonna mess it all up again. I‚Äôm gonna wrap this up through tears. I‚Äôve never told this to anyone before but it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my mind.  Sorry for the bad grammar.

111	real	The sexting is always hotter on the other side, or the Ouroboros of insecurity [End Title]: LONG.  So, like many, many others today I'm currently struggling on pretty much every front. Deep debt, poor ass family I'm constantly worried about, virtually nonexistent career that provides me with a random gig to rather keep me somewhat busy than actually pay any bills, fucked marriage, no solid place to live, mental illness, drinking problem, no health insurance ‚Äî you get the picture. Despite all that I've managed to meet A GOOD PERSON. Like, legitimately GOOD. Who is actually, genuinely INTO ME. And here comes the story of spectacularly moronic self-sabotage.  In the midst of the pandemic I somehow land a gig that pays just enough to compensate for its soul-sucking nature. Doing that stupid, pointless job that makes me question why I even bothered to get a degree and 10 years of experience in my field to be doing what a trained monkey could do. At the same time I feel like I'm being an entitled &lt;slur&gt; who doesn't appreciate an opportunity to make any kind of money in the era of mass unemployment. And while I'm going through my circles of self depreciation, the GOOD PERSON (let's call them Jo from this point on) expresses some concern for me working too much. The pay is hourly and the gig is relatively short, so I answer with a joking "Well, you know, people have to work sometimes, have you ever dated anyone with anything resembling a career?". To which Jo goes ahead and replies with "Well, I have actually dated a &lt;my exact profession&gt;. They worked at this place, &lt;a prestigious fucking firm&gt;, I don't know if you've ever heard about it. But they don't work there anymore. I think they are &lt;a fucking boss&gt; at a &lt;massive corporation&gt; now". Following with the sound of my fragile ego cracking.  Naturally, every free second I have from my diminishing job I spend stalking The Ex on every social media known to humanity. They turn out to be exactly what I imagined ‚Äî a painfully normal person. An avocado-toast-beautiful-sunset-i-was-invited-to-a-hip-party instagram posts kinda normal. The-goverment-wont-stop-oppressing-the-oppressed retweets kinda normal. Look-at-my-very-average-face-shot-in-a-flattering-manner selfies kinda normal. With one exception. They are among the minuscule slice of the population who are doing fine. Extremely well, to be precise. They are not just employed. In my current financial situation I would give my left arm for a chance of the stability that the employment UNDER them would bring me and my family. And of course, they are my exact age.  The diminishing gig is over, I've been payed my pennies. The unhealthy obsession, however, continues and I find myself pretty much in the middle of a psychotic episode sneaking into Jo's computer to find out for myself the exact nature of their relationship. Spoiler ‚Äî it didn't work. You can't really get a full picture of someone's past relationship through their texting history, surprisingly enough. What you can do though is forever fuck up your existing relationship with that person.  At this point I should probably mention that it has been a couple of years since they have been last talking. However.  Their texting interactions were predominantly consisting of sexting. Lots of it. My naturally shy Jo, who would normally avoid any kind of dirty talk or even a casual innuendo, would apparently feel perfectly comfortable communicating their most explicit intensions with The Ex. They would clearly have some kind of on-and-off relationship full of deep miscommunication resolving in physical passion.  So not only The Ex is(was and will always be) more successful. Their sex was also hotter.  Well, here's the Ouroboros. I'm a fucked up broken person coming from a fucked up abusive family. Every chance life would give me I would eventually sabotage due to not having a slightest idea of how to be stable and happy. Jo came into my life at the most turmoiled moment and gave me that idea. For months I felt like I might actually deserve happiness, like my future is of my own making, like there is finally some sense of safety in my life now. Until The Ex fucking reveal. And now I feel like I'm some kind of a consolation prise, like Jo couldn't maintain a relationship with a demanding successful person and now just settling with me, petty, low-maintenance loser. And it's not like I don't realise how ridiculous, unhelpful and underinformed this line of thinking is. Yet everything around me at the moment just keeps pointing out how little I made of myself pre-pandemic and how fucking unstable my situation is now as a result of it. And the less I think of myself, the more I juxtapose it to the imaginary construct of The Ex, the person I don't even know but who will probably never, EVER have to economise on food or be afraid to get sick due to doing well enough in life. Plus used to have hot sex with the person I'm in love with. And the more I think of them, the more of a distance I create between me and Jo, currently my main source of support and self-worth. And so the circle goes.  And the sex is, of course, ruined now ‚Äî The Ex seems to be always there with us, smelling of expensive perfume and achievements.  Anyway, if anyone happened to make it to the end of my pretentious rambling and feels like sharing their story of inordinate jealousy/insecurity over your SO's exes I would actually be rather grateful. Ideally with some kind of positive learning experience coming of it but I imagine that doesn't really happen much in real life.  Cheers!
264	real	I turn 30 in a month and I have been thinking about killing myself since I was 20 [End Title]: It's 3am and I'm just sitting here depressed so this is going to be half-assed  &amp;#x200B;  In highschool my friend group decided they didn't want to hangout with me. One of them told the others that he wouldn't let them in his car if they kept hanging out with me, I was never that close to this friend but I didn't think he hated me.  When I got to university I had my own car, and for a while would hangout with a regular group of friends. But over time they would contact me less and less and started to only call me when they needed a ride. I stop giving them rides and eventually heard from one of them that they would talk shit about me whenever I wasn't around. This is where I stopped putting much effort into making friends  I dropped out of university, talked to a doctor and got on meds for my already severe depression and anxiety issues. I started working and met someone who seemed to want to be friends. She invited me out and I thought we were actually becoming friends, but she wanted a relationship and I didn't. We kept talking and hanging out, then one night she pressured me into sex, this is when I lost my virginity. After about 15 mins of her grabbing my penis and trying to convince me I just said yes we tried but I couldn't keep it up so it stopped after less than a minute. I didn't see her again after that.  While I has dealing with her and dropping out of university I started living with some new roommates. They had all been friends since highschool and had been living together for 1.5 years when I moved in. There were 5 of us between 19 and 23 but I was the only one that didn't smoke cigarettes. This wouldn't seem like it's a big issue, but they started to get annoyed with me because I wouldn't join them every time they went out for a smoke and would often just continue doing whatever I was doing. At first I just heard a few off hand statements about disliking how I did this or that (not smoking, not clubbing, didn't party much) but by the time I was moving out they would openly talk about not wanting me there and wishing I would leave. So I did.  I moved out found my own place, and I tried online dating after I got settled. It took a while but I got a date and then a girlfriend. For the first year things were pretty good. My lease came up and we both were tight on cash some months, so we decided it would be best if I moved in with her and her sister/BIL. At first it was fine, but she had a higher sex drive than I did, and with us living together it really showed. At first when I would reject her she would be disappointed but nothing unreasonable, then she started to accuse me of being gay, not liking her, or cheating on her. Then instead of getting upset when I said no she started waiting till I fell asleep and then having sex with me. I woke up multiple times a month for about 6 months to her on top of me or trying to get me hard. Each time she would get mad at me when I was upset. The last time she tried I wasn't even asleep but she spent 30 minutes pushing me and trying to force herself on me till I pushed her off and she got mad because I was physical with her.  I moved back in with my parents and started saving up to go back to school. I tried online dating again and did have a healthy relationship, but I broke up with her due to my worsening mental health. At this point I have started my education up again, but it has been a year since I last spent time with someone who wasn't part of my immediate family, I have tried to make friends with my classmates but covid19 made that quite difficult, I am not sure how I can meet people in real life as I have not really tried since I was 22. I would prefer not to kill myself but every day I spend more time just thinking about how much easier it would be to be dead rather than alive.
192	real	He became a different person when I asked him to put on a condom [End Title]: I hooked up with my ex-thing (though we ended things 6 months ago and we have both been seeing other ppl in the meantime). I should mention how I think the world of this guy - he has always been extremely intelligent, level-headed, respectful and nothing but sweet to me. When he reached back out to me, I couldn't resist and I came over to his place.   While we were together, we mostly had sex without a condom but that was when I knew we were monogamous with each other. Now that it's been 6 months and he has had sex with multiple girls in the meantime - I wanted to be safe, so just before we were about to have sex, I asked him if he had a condom. He reluctantly says "maybe... if you really want it I can get one" He asks me why I'm being so responsible all of a sudden but he goes to grab one. He doesn't put it on though, so I just kiss him instead of proceeding and he eventually asks, "Can you go down?"   Me: "Sure, if you put on the condom"   Him: (surprised and hurt) You don't trust me?   Me: It's not that I don't trust you, I just wanna be responsible  Him: -sighs but then laughs it off- Okay okay it's good that you're being responsible but it's just not very sexy.   Me: (sarcastically) ...well, sorryyy   We just make out and he says it's hard for him because "just the thought of putting on the condom makes him not hard anymore"   He tries to put his dick in again at one point without a condom, and when I resist he says "Really?? It's nothing we haven't done before. What if I just put it in and don't move it?" (this fucking idiot)   We cuddle and he takes me home, as sweet as ever, but I just can't forget what happened.   Like he is the sweetest guy but as soon as the clothes come off, it's like he's a different person. Incredibly selfish in bed and this level of disrespect for me prioritizing my sexual health just left me feeling betrayed and disgusted.
431	real	Off my chest and mind. [End Title]: Hello all.  So here it is. I'm fat. And I know why I am fat.  I overeat. I live a sedintary life. I'm depressed. It's the triple whammy.  However. Today I drug the stationary bicycle outside, used it for 21 minutes on my lunch break at work (I work from home). I counted my calories. According to MFP, I have 321 calories before I hit my limit. I will go over that today, but whatever.  It's not much, but it's something. I still counted my calories. I still got off my ass and did something. I feel a little mentally better. That's already better than yesterday.  That's all. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.  EDIT: I am blown away by all the support. This community is truly amazing.

351	real	A text I sent after being told "it's ok to make mistakes" by my Gf. Please don't mind my Christianity [End Title]: It's not ok to make mistakes. Im judged for anything I do wrong. Any mistake I make is just another reason to give up.   It's why I'm like this. If I do something wrong in this relationship, I become overwhelmed with guilt and a large motivation to give up. But I fight it, because I want to be in a relationship, but I just can't let mistakes go unforgotten. It burns me, and makes me numb to the world, ignoring everything else. Trying to give myself a reason to continue.   I just need someone to hug me and tell me it's ok. It's ok that you've made mistakes. It's ok that your trying. It's ok that your trying to do something for yourself and for others.   It's ok that you love someone.   I only want the best for you, but It requires the sacrifice of knowing what's wrong and not letting you fall into the same hole.   I drag failure around with me daily, always reminding me, your not the best, nobody sees what's happening, nobody really cares.   It's hard to fight it. It's like fighting yourself, destined to mess up and lose. Fighting a battle that, in the end, really doesn't end well.   It's what you say that keeps me going. The fact that someone does care, and understands. But I fear of losing that. My mistake bound to happen. It burns me and takes away my own energy trying to defend against it. Trying to not lose what I love so much.   Everything dies eventually. Nothing lasts forever. But my failure, my mistakes, my losses, it sure seems like it does. Never ceasing and always there when I don't need them. Reminding me, your not good enough, youll never make it, your bound to fail.    I help others so they can be their best and not fall like me, but that requires the sacrifice of being in that position. Of knowing what will happen. Of feeling and always knowing your mistakes.   I know this is late, but it's whats been on my mind for a long while now. It's the truth of why I look forward to being in a relationship with you and a relationship with God. An escape form fear, from lies, form the world. From myself. From my failures. From my mistakes. From anything I've done wrong. From anything that I've done to hurt others.   I love you, and I hope one day we can be together, both at our bests. No more suffering, no more reminders of failure and mistakes.   I hope when you read this you don't think I'm crazy and making stuff up.   - A man with failures
395	real	All I want is someone to go take a beer with [End Title]: I just moved to a different city for university. It‚Äôs weird I knew I was going to study in another city just not this one. I expected to go from my hometown to a city that feels like a second home to me where half of social life is. However unexpectedly I received got accepted to a better university in a dream program for me that I forgot I applied to.   Moving here feels so much more intimidating since not only I am twice as far from home as I thought I was going to be but everything is in my third language and I feel insecure about that even if I generally receive positive comments. All of this just to say I miss my hometown, I miss my friends, I miss the other city. I feel like I left exactly when I felt the most comfortable.   It‚Äôs a Saturday night and I was thinking about going out but I don‚Äôt have the heart for it going solo. I would be out right now if I had a friend to go with. Instead I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep. I feel so isolated since I don‚Äôt have any friends to go do activities with. I already went to see a few attractions on my own. But at the end of their day I feel bad drinking and eating alone at a table for 4.  I was really hoping to make need friends that would share at least a few interests with me at uni. However everyone just seems to keep it to themselves or we just really not click. I even start the conversation with the group and try to get social interaction going on but the minute I stop pushing they all just go back to their phones  makes you feel like NPCs are real no one wants to know each other ! The real tragedy for me is that they are social science students shouldn‚Äôt they be more curious about the other..  I just wish I had friend that I could hang out with.
319	real	It really sucks [End Title]: Im just confused. Why have two of you done this?   One of you says you thought I was more mature two years ago. I was more mature when I fucking starved myself and distanced myself from everything because I thought I didn‚Äôt deserve happiness?   Another says you liked me from the ‚Äúidea of me‚Äù. So from seven months to now, you talked to me because you thought I looked pretty? You helped me heal, but it was all for nothing? I was nothing to you? You still talk to me, but how am I supposed to deal with the fact that you, the person who I thought truly cared for me besides my family, did it all because of nothing more than my appearance.  I like myself now. This is the first year I‚Äôve eaten three meals and talked to people without any fear of what they thought of me. But I guess I‚Äôm more pleasing when I‚Äôm suffering. I really thought you liked me for me. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not what you want.

When someone else makes a mistake I end up having to take on their work as well as my work that I‚Äôm already overwhelmed with.   And the company sees it as a perfectly acceptable to tell other employees to take their time and do everything very slowly to avoid mistakes.   We have the same job title but I am now expected to pick up everyone else‚Äôs slack because of layoffs, and employees working at 25% speed and if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be written up. The double standards in most corporations is just baffling.
116	real	I hate being a cheap drink [End Title]: Or I guess I hate how it's a normal way to socialize. There's people with alcohol problems and we're just casually offering to buy each other drinks. But that's not even the problem I have.  I hate it because I'm super light weight that it feels like I might just have an alcohol intolerance. Want to go for drinks after work? What am I going to do with my car because I get drunk after a single drink and there's no way I'm driving home. I can't even finish a beer. Yet every time I want to get to know my coworkers it's like, oh we can hit the pub after work. I'm always bringing my boyfriend along and it makes me feel uncomfortable because it's either I bring him or I don't go because I can't get home and for some reason there are barely any Ubers in the area. Even if there were it would be like an extra $30+ Yeah ok so I'm gonna casually spend around $50 every time I want to socialize?
485	real	Ever felt like you were punished for saying how you really feel? [End Title]: I don't mean in a nasty way, like "That dress *does* make you look fat." I mean feeling really angry, sad, or scared, but being afraid of what others will say or do if you tell them about it.   I've been feeling depressed and hopeless about reality and life in general, but I'm afraid to seek further help outside of therapy. I once tried to get outpatient treatment so I could still maintain my work and home life. Instead, the doctor had me locked up in a psych ward for 2 weeks, which only left me with extreme anxiety, bad memories, and +$1,000 in debt. I had no desire to hurt myself then and now, but I don't want to take the risk that I'll get locked up again. I've been bottling up my depression because I fear that completely speaking my mind will essentially get me punished.  IDK how much longer I can keep up this lose-lose situation with my mental health. If you've been through anything similar, what worked for you?
508	real	My mom is going completely nuts [End Title]: Sorry guys, I have no one to vent to.   So my mom has been in a psych ward for a good 7 months now. She got abused by her ex husband and had a rough life, and is also unable to work right now because of a chronic inflammation in her hand. She's completely soaking up whatever her therapists says and additionally taking around 10 different meds now. Some are for sleep, some for pain and most are for mental stuff. So far so good.  She just broke up with my dad, which I saw coming from miles away. I'm okay with that.  But now she's obviously thinking about moving out of their household. Far.Far.Away.  She'd love to live in the woods. Okay, she noticed that the woods are a bit unrealistic. Now she wants to live in some small village 30 minutes away from here. She currently hates people, especially children and immigrants. She wants nothing to do with anyone. She also has unrealistic ideas about her job future. She'd love to open up a dog hotel. Obviously she's piss poor and this will never happen. I'm worried about her isolating herself and not keeping in contact with us. She was never good at that, never writes/ calls me or her best friend. So obviously her best friend threatens that she'll quit the friendship if my mom moves out of the city. I've been inbetween these fights for all this time now, having her best friend vent all the rage in front of me. It made me feel really bad mentally and I'm actually starting to see a therapist now.   My mom's therapist says that it's all gonna be fine if everyone wants to keep in contact. Truth is, it just doesn't work like that. She just doesn't have the energy to care for a relationship. We are only in contact because we all live close to each other and share a community garden and walk our dogs together. It just wouldn't work if she moved away.     It's a shit situation in general. I obviously know that my mother has to make her own decisions and that I have nothing to do with them. But I also think that a family should look out for each other, and I think her isolating herself from everyone is not a healthy way to live.

891	real	"Universal truths" about relationships just aren't true. You don't have to obey them, you don't have to listen. [End Title]: I'm fighting a personal battle in my head and considering what I went through in life, I don't have enough strength make myself believe it on my own. Writing it down might help, not just me, but maybe someone else. I'm writing down some of the things I need to hear from myself.   - Emotional dependancy on the other person is not inherently wrong.   - Fulfilling all of your emotional needs yourself is just not realistic, atleast not for everyone.   - If you are afraid of abandonment, you don't have to leave and try being on your own.   - Your relationships, your boundaries. What may be (un)acceptable to someone else, doesn't have to be (un)acceptable to you.   - No matter how qualified people may feel, noone has say in how you "should change".   - You're not "less" if you refuse to follow someone else's life rules.   - You don't have to fill an assigned role you're given.
465	real	The Woke crowd had ruined dating. [End Title]: If you dislike a certain group of people you are racist. Example, if you dislike obese people you are a fatphobic, anti-Black white supremacists. But if you like a certain group of people you are just fetishism them and a white supremacists. For example, if a white guy likes Asian women or  if a person like plus size women. You can't win with these crazy people. They are always very insecure and sees racism in everything. If someone thinks you are hot because you are fat, Black,Asian or Alien just like take the compliment and keep it pushing. It's not that serious.
301	real	I work with my ex‚Äôs parents [End Title]: I need advice.   I was with my ex for 2 years, and he had very unexpectedly broke up with me a week before Valentine‚Äôs Day. We were both unemployed for most of 2020, so we decided to find steady jobs in January. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt want to work with his family, but you need a college degree for this job (which I don‚Äôt have) so when my boyfriends step dad offered it to me I had to take it.   After the breakup I continued to work. The first week or so I was just a mess. His mom would bring me gifts and tell me I‚Äôll always be her little daughter in law. I cried in her office a few times. I keep telling myself if I was going to quit I would‚Äôve done it then. It is now April and I‚Äôve been here for a full 3 months. I‚Äôm not as close with his mom as I was then. We rarely speak now. I can tell I make her feel conflicted, and that me working here is a cause of conflict in their family. The thought of throwing all of this experience away kills me, but continuing to work here is even worse sometimes. I‚Äôm constantly seeing my ex at the park across the street from my job. I swear he goes there when I get off just to mess with me. I hate that he knows my schedule. Just a few days ago, his siblings ran into my best friend at the store and told her they thought it was f***ed up that I still worked for their parents.   I feel so stuck in the middle. I‚Äôm trying my best to make a plan to get out of this company, but it‚Äôs hard. I hate starting new jobs, and I truly am learning so much here.. I‚Äôm planning on signing up for a 6 week program to extend my skills that I‚Äôm learning here. Hopefully with that certificate I won‚Äôt need years of experience with this company under my resume.    I should also say that I have always stayed with my jobs for a year or more. Quitting just a few months in seems like such a waste of experience to me. What am I going to do with just 3 months here for my resume?? I have never had a job like this before and know I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this job without the connections. UGHHHH.   I know it‚Äôs probably impossible to give advice for this. Ultimately I have to do what‚Äôs best for me, I know that. Honestly, I just needed to vent because this is a huge struggle in my life right now. Half the people I come to for advice tell me I‚Äôm crazy and need to quit. The other half praises me for maturity, and advices me to stop caring about what my ex thinks. I honestly don‚Äôt really care what he thinks about this at all, but I do worry for his mom. She‚Äôs always been treated so poorly by her kids, and I know she is the one receiving the wrath by them. I can‚Äôt ask her these things because it isn‚Äôt my place anymore and like I said, we‚Äôre not as close as we used to be.   I keep telling myself to tough it out a little bit longer but I‚Äôm worried that one day I‚Äôll just snap and quit in a horrible way. (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd do that but I‚Äôve never been in this kind of situation before!) It truly is causing me so much anxiety. I mean I‚Äôm here right now and felt the need to write this because I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it without them thinking I‚Äôm going to quit!!!   I could go on forever about this.... anyways,   Thanks for reading and any advice would be appreciated.
919	real	I rehomed my cat, and I miss him everyday [End Title]: McFlurry was in a parking lot when I first saw him, and I knew from the moment I picked him up that it was fate or something like that. I love him so much and I had to rehome him because where I'm moving to I couldn't have him. I was supposed to rehome my other cat Finley as well, but now I'm being told I can keep her. You would think I would be happy with that, but I only felt worse about McFlurry not being in my life anymore. I love him so much, and I worry about him all the time. Edit: spelling

279	real	i'm never gonna get over him [End Title]: he was the first person to make me believe in soulmates.  i tried to force a sense of acceptance and told myself 'hey, time to let go it's going to be two years by the end of 2020' but instead i am caught up in this delusion that i WILL see him again and it WILL be perfect. i don't think i will ever love as strongly as i have again - quite optimistic to assume i will even love again but realistically i probably will. when he comes up in my dreams i try to convince myself it's a sign even though i don't believe in signs. i don't know what type of fairy land i'm trying to live in but holy fuck i wish i wasn't so insecure in myself and projecting, but i know that it wasn't all me. i promised myself i would never write another poem about him, now all i do is write a line.   i've tried but suddenly i feel like something is pulling me so i go back to check his social media, his new and old friends' socials just to see him. i do this multiple times a day compulsively. i've checked every single day at least five times a day if he has unblocked me. what is wrong with me. the maximum i have ever gone was about a week to two weeks. all this just to see his fucking face but his eyes bring me to tears. recently i have come so close to trying to reach out but i know i shouldn't, and i won't. every time i think of a memory i had with him i feel physically sick and start to panic. no one has ever made me feel like this before.   i just wish i could talk to him again. right now we are at completely separate points in our lives but here i go hoping that after three to five years we will find each other again. realistically nothing is going to happen and i can't believe myself.   i see pictures of him with other girls and who he follows and i get so possessive and defensive until i realise that he isn't mine anymore. then deep down i tell myself that he will be mine again. what the fuck?  so i appreciate finding out what love was almost two years ago now but honestly never again if it's going to end like this fuck that.
672	real	My sons new habit. [End Title]: My 17 year old son is wearing paper mache masks. I think he started wearing masks to hide his face? He has a nasty scar from a car accident a year back. Whenever I ask him about it, he wouldn't answer. He just stops talking. He was always a social kid, but now he's just quiet. Can't even ask him what he wants for dinner anymore. What do I do? What's wrong with him? I need help.
861	real	I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the one that got away [End Title]: We dated for maybe six weeks almost three years ago, but I think about her almost every day. I know how stupid that sounds. I‚Äôll call her CJ. I feel so guilty because I‚Äôve been in other relationships with amazing women who I am lucky to be with and I know that if CJ reached out, I‚Äôd go back in a second. I‚Äôd quit my job and move.  I know how awful that is. And it‚Äôs almost embarrassing to share. I wish I told her I loved her. I don‚Äôt think it would have changed anything. I miss how she whistled when she was getting ready, how she had a closet of black dresses, how she pressed her tongue against her top row of teeth when she smiled, how she held strong opinions without ever turning them into arguments, how she was curious about how everything worked, how she‚Äôd start laughing before the joke, how all her friends adored her, how time stretched out when I was with her, how she sang Billy Joel to herself,, How her serious concern would melt away into goofiness, how she could forgive anything, how easily she empathized with people, how she listened. I want to be more grateful for what I have. I know I need to let go, but I can‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm worried I never will.

It‚Äôs the highlight of my day and she really could be gone any day, I need to spend as much time with her as possible.
799	real	I feel helpless and frustrated by my own inability to fight to get my money back [End Title]: I'm in a really frustrating position right now fighting my old agency over my half of the deposit being returned to me.  A little context: I had a joint tenancy with a flatmate in a flat which was far from good condition. She didn't do much about it as she's already lived in the flat with different flatmates over the period of 3 years before I moved in.   I ended up fighting a lot of battles to get our boiler (which broke in the middle of last winter) replaced, the shower replaced multiple times because it kept breaking and they wouldn't send another contractor to check it for other issues, to get holes filled to stop mice coming in and running across our kitchen counters etc.  Safe to say I had a lot of frustrations in that flat, and was planning to move out a month into my tenancy, I stayed a year and a half.   I followed my tenancy agreement, giving them a months notice, helping my ex-flatmate find a replacement for me so she wouldn't have to worry about the rent, started the process early with the agency to make sure everything would be done by the time I moved out, even handed in my keys a couple of days early.  To clarify, the agency and landlord agreed, in writing, to repay me my full deposit as there was no issues with the flat.  I expected my money to be repaid soon after I moved, however they didn't update me, didn't get in contact with me, nothing.   I started emailing them calmly asking for updates, they kept telling me I can't get my half of the deposit until the new tenant (who already moved in???) paid her half in to replace mine.  Because this was a joint tenancy, I can't find ANY legal information about wether this is allowed or not. When I was moving in, I had to pay my deposit before I even got the keys to the flat. I don't understand why a month has passed since she moved in and she still hasn't paid her deposit in. Or why the agency is basically punishing ME for that.  I'm so frustrated, the agency staff keeps telling me I can't get my money until she pays, despite us having nothing to do with each other. If anything, it's their responsibility and they should pay my money out themselves.  I ended up contacting the safe deposit scheme they held our money with, but having read their website I found out my ex-flatmate was the lead tenant on our agreement, so I have no access to any pay-out requests etc. I emailed her this, telling her our contract states she has to deal with this because I have no way of accessing anything other than the status of our deposit, to which she blocked me. lol.  As if I wasn't stressed enough by this.  Now I'm waiting to see if the deposit scheme can give me any advice or a solution to this, because I don't know if I can even expect the new tenant to pay that money in anymore.  I feel so helpless now because I genuinely don't know what else I could do. It's really stressing me out, I have no legal knowledge and don't know if I can demand that the agency pays me back, or if I have to agree to wait with no guarantee the girl will ever pay her deposit in.   Had to get this off my chest, because I've just been feeling like I big frustrated ball of stress walking around constantly thinking about it.

71	real	Tired of Loneliness/Weird Space [End Title]: Brand new baby girl was born yesterday, birthday is today, I have a loving wife and another daughter who is ecstatic about her new sister. I love them all so much.   I should be way more into this, but I am not. I am 25 but feel old because we had kids young. We moved this last year so feeling extremely alone with no family or good friends. To make matters worse, the friends I did have here I have grown apart from or were only friendly with me because of who my Dad is. I feel judged by them and everyone who knows them.   I don't want to see anyone or anyone to see me. A real kick in the nuts when all I do is crave a good friend to hang out with or feeling like a 25 year old with more going on than high blood pressure and dirty diapers. Depression is starting to kick back up, which it hasn't seriously in a long time. Just very frustrating.   Anyways, thanks for the space to get that out.
297	real	Christmas vent [End Title]: Every year as I get older, I feel like the holidays and birthdays just get shittier? I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôm really not the one to vent but I felt like this might be helpful and why not?   Christmas dinner was a shit and ended up butting heads with my dad. To keep it simple, my dad told my mom something that I said and it made her upset although I reminded him not to tell her because I knew she would get mad. My parents are too prideful to apologize so I never expect that out of them but at least bringing up the issue or owning up would suffice. i‚Äôm really tired of trying to save his ass every time he‚Äôs in trouble with my mom when he‚Äôs never stood up for me. Things escalated to the point where he missed out on dinner for the first hour. I even fixed a plate for him, poured him a shot and apologized for being upset. I asked him to cheers with me with a shot despite everything that happen but he looked straight at me and just simply said no. That hurts. My family has a history of having something always negative happening instead of trying to enjoy the time we have together and enjoy a damn meal. I have a toxic family environment so I think that might be the case.     My GF almost broke up with me today. I don‚Äôt prioritize her enough and I choose my family over her too much although they honestly treat me fucking shitty. My mom treats her differently from the my other two brother‚Äôs GF and its been making my GF feel some type of way. Lately this past year,I‚Äôve been realizing how shitty my family has been treating me but my parents has instilled the importance of valuing family growing up. It‚Äôs ironic because my family‚Äôs dynamic is so complicated and fucked up. I‚Äôm learning to understand to let go of my family a little more. I‚Äôm not dropping them but keeping my distance and staying in my own lane, if you will, might be the best option for me to work on myself and mentally as well. It‚Äôs sucks because she told me that it‚Äôs hard to be in a relationship due to how my family treats us.    I got some thoughtful gifts for my family this year and it seemed like everyone honestly enjoyed their gifts which makes me extremely happy. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt expect anything expensive but I‚Äôve never received a thoughtful gift from my family which makes me sad, or am I just expecting too much?    It‚Äôs been a long Christmas and a long year but I‚Äôm very grateful to have spent it with family nonetheless. Thanks for reading this long ass vent. Appreciate any advice or thoughts. Would like to hear what you think
850	real	Rant from a blind person [End Title]: Sorry I know I'll come off like a dick, but it gets old explaining myself all the time. Especially on here. How do you type? How do you dream? Can you wipe your ass? Fucking fuck off. Lmao I know people are just curious, but god it gets old. Especially if the post / comment in question has nothing really to do with blindness. If I mention it in passing, the questions roll in. Sometimes I just wanna bitch about python or music or whatever like anyone else. Then theres the stupid questions. How do you fall asleep? You got here by yourself? Wow. Or when you go to the cinema and they say "Oh, we don't have audio description, will captions work?" No, Jenna. They won't. Theres a difference between def and blind. Or the ones who don't even ask, they just show up with the caption thing and expect you to use it? Nah. Then theres the "I'd never be able to do what you do." Ok Suzan, but have you ever even tried? I'd think not. Also, Everyones fucked in one way or another, why am I so special? I'm not gifted for simply walking across the busy intersection, you do it every day too, chill the fuck out. Lights beep for a reason. And I know it might make me a moron, but I've turned down many a prayer from a passerby. Buddy, I'm just trying to book it to my 8:30 college class I'm running on 4 hours sleep from procrastination and I don't need your blessing, leave me alone. Prayers only help you not me lmfao. I'm fairly religion neutral, I don't need jesus. I wouldn't mind if they backed off when I said no, sorry I don't share that view or I've gotta go, but some people are really insistent. Not to say I turn them all down, a couple times I've let em do it, but I've heard 'lord lay your heeling hand on him' a few times already now and I still can't see jack. Heh. Then theres the people who think we always need help even without asking. I'm fine with saying no. But theres always people who grab you out of nowhere when your walking even though your cane will no doubt or already has hit whatever there trying to steer you around, or the ones who don't take no for an answer and insist on helping me anyway. I once had a guy grab me and shove me towards an elevator, I had to push him away to continue up the stares with him shouting "I insist" behind me. Fuck off. Maybe I just hate people? Idk. Most of the time, things are cool. But shit like this pisses me off sometimes.
189	real	I'm super happy to be able to be an organ donor now [End Title]: So twelve years ago I got hepatitis C through surgical contamination. It sucked badly. No drinking, horrible medication that didn't work including chemo that made me lose half my hair and get a bunch of cavities..  ugh.  But one of the worst parts of having it was that I can never donate blood. I wanted to be a bone marrow donor but.... Nope. Also not possible.  Well two years ago I was cured via new medication. It's like a miracle. Drinking again is nice. Not being afraid of an early death is great.  But one of the best parts is using new technology they can at least use SOME of my organs now if I die in a tragic accident. I got that added to my license ASAP.  I still feel bad trying to encourage people to donate blood and marrow when I can't do that.... But at least I'm now am organ donor, something I also feel passionately that everyone should be.  Weird thing to be happy about, but I am.

255	real	I'm in love with my ex who left me for the mother of his kids who he left to be with me. [End Title]: He lied about his relationship status when we first started seeing eachother. It wasn't until he left her n moved in with me that I fully realized they were very much still together and I was his side chick. I tried to be supportive and understanding while he still constantly talked, texted, and argue with her everyday because he said it was about his kids. I even secretly talked to her trying to help the situation and later on she used that to get him to comeback. I was even going to bail her out of jail. He swore he didn't love her and it was all about his kids. He promised there was nothing that could make him leave me, but he did. When he left he was absolutely awful to me  tbey both were, and I was a pathetic mess. I cried for weeks and just wanted him to come back. After a few months, he contacted me again and wanted to talk. He had to sneak around to meet me and basically just told me he was sorry and appreciated all I had done for him, but that he wasn't happy and she had made him be the way he was towards me and he only left because she told him he would never see his kids again if he didn't. He now sneaks around to see me, complain about his relationship, and get a blow job. It's fucking me with really bad and I feel so stupid for believing  anything he says, but I don't want to lose him again and secretly hope he will leave her again to be with me. I won't commit to a relationship with anyone else and stopped talking to someone when he came back around. I don't know what's wrong with me, I know he is a liar and that I'm being played . I need to tell him to leave me alone and get on with my life, but I can't. I love him and want him to want me as much as he did before.
287	real	I'm so tired of....everything [End Title]: Tl;Dr: Wah, wah, some more wah.  Just need to let some stuff go. Feel free to not read this.  So, I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately, and it seems like nothing ever goes right, whether due to something I did, or something out of my control. I'm 26 years old, married for 8 years, and have 2 kids. About 100 lbs overweight, despite attempting to lose weight several times, I end up gaining. Lovely. Oh, plus my dad died right after we reconnected after my daughter was born. My mother and I are practically estranged because my stepdad is a controlling tyrant, so my wife and I now avoid going over there. She can't come visit because on weekends he needs the car to start 9 tasks and finish 2.  I've had 4 cars, each one newer and more expensive than the last (first car was a 97 Skylark I bought for 1500, current car is an 09 Jeep Compass I bought for 9000), and every one has been a huge money sink because of issues. In the 3 years I've had this car, I've put probably close to 5000 on it in repairs. I mean, I guess at least I have a car.  Over my entire working career, around 10 years, I've had...oh, 10 jobs? A few were bullshit "I'm a teenage and I need money" jobs: grocery stores, fast food, pizzerias. Whatever. But a few of them were great. One pizzeria, I was basically the co-manager. Never had the official title, but it was me and one other guy. One day, we called the owner to tell him we needed supplies, and he had changed his number. We stayed open as many days as we could, thinking it was a mishap, slowly running out of ingredients. Then the other guy quit. I worked One more day, and left and never came back because we were out of nearly everything. A week later I got a call from the owner, blaming me for the store going under, because I left and never went back. One was a cashier at a store. First full time job. One day I got called into the office, and they showed me a video of me doing a transaction. Everything looked fine to me, until they asked how I missed the obvious theft on my part. When asked what they meant, apparently because I threw out a receipt after I voided out a transaction, that means I let the customer get everything for free, even though I clearly put the items behind me. So I could either quit, or have the police called for theft. Naturally I quit. Another one was a 22.50 an hour job, doing debris removal in a tire factory. I was there 3 weeks. It was my first *real* job, and I was walking around a hot factory, lugging bins full of rubber, in hot clothes, for 12 hours a day 4 days a week. After 2 weeks, my feet were raw, my groin and ass were so chafed, and my body was so sore, that one night I got home, sat in the shower, turned on just the cold water, and basically cried. I was 18, and the hardest I'd worked before that was stocking shelves for a bit. I called in one day...***one day***, because on top of all that, I wasn't feeling well, and they let me go because they needed reliability. I mean, I guess I get it. But whatever. Yet another was working Quality Assurance for an Insurance company. Was there for 2.5 years, gotten a few raises, was friends with a few manager's. Great right? Yeah, until I was approached by HR one morning, and told to vacate the premises as my employment was terminated. Luckily I live in a state where they don't have to give a reason for termination, so fuck me I guess.  I also don't have friends anymore, partially by choice. Most of my friends dropped me once my (then girlfriend) got pregnant with my daughter. The rest, I dropped. Remember how up above here, I mentioned how I was terminated from that Quality Assurance job? Well, right after that, my lovely wife got a bad feeling, went through my phone, and saw a gay joke I made to a friend of mine, suggesting I'd give him oral if he did me a favor. Was the joke stupid? I guess. Me and my group of friends made jokes like that all the time. Well, gay joke, plus mysterious termination, equals what? If you guessed "you got terminated because you kept leaving work to fuck men", then congrats! That's the same conclusion my wife came to, without thinking rationally, in any capacity. Thus began the darkest period of my marriage. My wife decided she wanted a divorce, so she distanced herself. No physical contact, barely any speaking aside from necessary stuff, making me look away from her if she needed to change or something. We got better, luckily. But not before she flashed a co-worker for revenge, her (now "gay") ex-boyfriend "accidentally" sent her a dick pic, and another friend confessed his undying love for her, offering to threaten me into moving out to save her the stress. We've been...okay since then. Except, my wife has learned to take advantage of my kindness, trying to make up for my "infidelity". Now, she spends all her time talking on messenger and discord. All. Her time. I do *everything* in this house. The only thing she's "supposed" to do is fold clothes, and she doesn't even do that. When I bring up her doing stuff, she gets all huffy.  Speaking of her phone, I asked her about something I saw while snooping, because I had seen her posting screenshots from IG to a friend. Turns out a friend from school found her on IG, was offering her nudes, subtley trying to bring up sex (wanna hang out? What would we do? Where would we hang out? My house? What if we hung out at night?), and stuff. A friend of hers was telling her to fuck the guy to get back at me, even though it had been nearly 2 years since my supposed infidelity. So I confessed, and asked if she was happy. She *exploded* and twisted it. Deleted every messaging app from her phone: FB, IG, Kik, Discord, name it and it was gone. Saying how she cant even vent in a private conversation. She never even admitted I had a right to be concerned. She's since gotten the apps back, all except IG, but changed all her passwords, and I overheard her saying she cant access her FB anymore because "I had to change my password because of my insecure snooping husband and now I don't remember It, and don't have access to the email".  How are we otherwise? Oh, fine, more or less. Except the sex. Look, I'm not the biggest guy downstairs, but I'm at least a bit above average. I just have a stamina issue, but joyously, only sometimes though. Sometimes I'm basically a two pump chump, other times I can go 20 minutes. Never knew it was an issue until last year, when my wife told me she's never gotten off. Not just with me though, she there's that. But 7 years of fucking, her seeming to get off often, to find out she's never gotten off. Since then, sex has dwindled, because I feel bad after because she doesn't get off, which makes her feel bad. She bought her a vibrator last year to have her explore herself, and she never really used it much, saying she didn't really care for it. The other day she went to bed before me, then came out about 15 minutes later, to proposition me for sex. Naturally i obliged. After a few minutes, she didn't seem into it, so I asked where her toy was to integrate it in our activity. She said "oh it's right here, I was using it". No biggie. We start going again, she wants to stop cause it hurts and she's not in the mood. Sex usually wakes her up, so I ask if she's gonna come back out in the living room, or if she's gonna stay in the room. She said she was gonna stay in the room and continue a bit. O...Kay...? First time we have sex in weeks, halfway through you want to stop because you're not in the mood, but decide to continue by yourself? Logical. Oh, and I think the other night she was using it in bed while I was next to her and she didn't know I was awake. Can't confirm it, but at one point the blanket seemed like it would be propped with her legs spread. I shifted positions, and it seemed like she jumped. Again, no problem with her using it, but c'mon bro.  I've found pregnancy tests in the house before, that she bought in secret, and when I asked where they came from (since sex was so low), she said that she bought them awhile ago because she had a scare. Once she was holding them for a friend. Over the last year or so, I've found a few different boxes of pregnancy tests, so they aren't all the same ones. But if I ask, I'm projecting my insecurities and previous infidelity.  OH, the best part, how I said she's always on her phone? Apparently me wanting attention is nagging, and wanting to talk and be lovey is being a "B", and if she wanted a "P" she would have married a woman (overheard her say that awhile ago). Yeah she could've just been being overdramatic for her friends, but it was still said.  Back to jobs, my current job it's just me and my boss in the office. She spends all her time leaving early, Facetiming her boyfriend, and not doing her job. Well, *her* boss found out, and is contemplating firing her for stealing company time. If that happens, he'll likely just gonna close the office, so there's another job lost.  It's bad enough that despite us both working full time, we're constantly behind on bills. But that's just how the economy is right? Wait, what's this? People I went to school with are buying brand new 2019 cars? Purchasing houses? Owning businesses? Lovely.  Not suicidal (really, 100% not suicidal, I have kids), but if I were to die.....eh. I mean, I want to live, but I'm tired of losing at every turn. Granted some things are a simple fix, "just leave your wife", "find a more stable job" etc, but I don't want to leave my wife. I don't want to be a statistic. I'd love a stable job. But I have no idea what I'd even want to do, so I can't go back to school for anything. I'm just a winner through and through.
773	real	so excited to see the loml in 9 days!!! [End Title]: i havent seen him in over a month since we live 2k miles away from eachother and i just cant wait to be in his armsüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíì
772	fake	I smoked my own semen while in active addiction [End Title]: As the title says, in what I can only describe as my rock bottom, I was having a stim fueled night of masturbating and accidentally came on my uncovered wax sitting on the table beside me and decided to smoke it anyway to go to sleep later. I can‚Äôt even describe the taste in words, but it gave me a lung infection or something, I never went to the dr because I didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone, and I would randomly vomit for the next few days.
14	real	I want to go to bed and never wake up. [End Title]: I constantly feel so numb. I'm trying to get through the days as much as possible but it is so hard. If I could just go to sleep and never wake up, I think I would be fine with that. I feel trapped. Online school isn't fantastic. The things I loved to do like art and reading novels seem so mundane now, like a chore. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them, it will be in one ear and out the other. My chest hurts and I don't know why. I'm scared, confused, numb, and so done with life right now.  I don't know if its just because I'm a teen going through changes or a serious problem. But I have experienced this feeling for a while now. I'm not thinking of ending my life but I just can't deal with my life anymore. I'm thinking of reaching out to a councelor at school but I'm scared and keep putting it off. I want things to get better but I don't know if things will ever change.
463	real	I have a fetish of being cheated on and it's quite awkward to see my gf talking with other guys [End Title]: I dunno, I just like it when I imagine my gf cheating on me and I masturbate to it. I only told about my fetish to few of my best friends and they didn't take me seriously, considering I'm quite a sarcastic person. It's so awkward when we go on a date. I can't help but want to imagine her cheating on me with one of her hot classmates, teacher, cousin, or even his father.
17	real	Hooked up w a friend, now he‚Äôs not replying [End Title]: We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in months but would message each other back and forth, sharing what‚Äôs going on in our lives or dumb memes. Finally got a chance to hang out and it was like no time had passed. We watched horror films all night, talked about things we couldn‚Äôt over messages bc of the context, and just had a fun time. Slowly I ended up cuddled against him on the couch and he held me closer until I was laying on top of him. Long story short we ended up in my room and had a casual hook up. It was quick, it was fun, and I felt like it wasn‚Äôt awkward at all. At least not on my part.  He messaged me when he got home that he made it back safe, I made a joke about getting a good night sleep now that we both got laid, he laughed. Then nothing. I sent him messages like I did before, funny memes I know he‚Äôd like. No reply. I hate to think our friendship is over bc of one night in bed together but I think it may be. I hate that.
85	real	I'm only just smart enough to realize how entirely useless and unremarkable I am as a human being. [End Title]: Honestly, I wish I was stupid, dumb enough to not know what it means to be successful, talented, worth something. If I could just live a blissfully ignorant life, I could be so much happier. Instead, I have been cursed with just enough intelligence to know that I will never go anywhere in life, but not enough to actually improve myself and become what I want to be. I'm decent at all the subjects I've taken in school, but I'm not talented enough in any of them to be anything special in their respective career fields. I'm a decent pianist, but I'm far from remarkable despite how long I've been playing. I'm good at a lot of video games, but I'm never the best out of my friends and always get outclassed by them quickly, even with months of previous experience. I could genuinely go on for hours about how mediocre I am at everything I do.  I know this type of thinking is harmful and an obvious sign of depression, but I honestly can't see how I could ever recover from this mindset. I've had friends who have similarly dealt with depression, and while it would be insensitive and rude of me to belittle their struggles, they were able to overcome them because they had a saving grace, a quality or unique talent in themselves that they could use to bring purpose to their lives. I don't have that. I am simply always worse in almost every way than those around me. I'm inherently slower than everyone around me, always falling behind my peers, forcing me to put in much more effort for a smaller reward. My behavior and choices are predictable and I get read like a book by everyone around me, which let me just say is one of the worst feelings ever, to know those around you are so much smarter than you that they can predict what you're going to do before you even can. This is most evident when playing games with my friends since anyone and everyone can shit on me because I'm just that easy to understand.  For all intense and purposes, my existence is the closest you could get to being pointless. I am simply worth less than everyone around me. Anything you can think of, I know somebody who can do it better than me. And since I'm inherently slower than everyone else, my efforts to improve myself are completely wasted, since other people can achieve so much more than me in the same amount of time. I'm not saying I want to die or anything like that, quite the opposite. The passage of time is one of the single most terrifying things I can think of and my inevitable march towards death strikes fear into my heart. Some days, it consumes my entire train of thought. If I could live forever, I would. All I'm saying is, I wouldn't complain if I'd never been born at all. Anything would be better than this cursed life, devoid of pride or direction, permanently stuck in the shadows of everyone I know.  I just want to know what it feels like to be happy with myself, proud of my own accomplishments and skills. I want to be worth something, anything.
72	real	I feel guilty because I am actually doing well in life. [End Title]: I have some of the newest tech, a decent internet speed, tons of food that I sometimes get for free and just recently, my parents offered to get me a brand new 2020 model Peugeot.  It didn‚Äôt get to me before, but now I read all this stuff in the news and think how much better I have it than quite a few people who are out on streets or benefits, barely able to make ends meet. what can I do ? I feel bad living this life when others have so little. I want to give back but I don‚Äôt know where or how to start.
689	real	I am graduating in a month, im scared s***less about whats next [End Title]: completely dont know what im going to do from now, or what the future holds. major uncertainty anxiety
33	real	It won't stop [End Title]: I realized I self harm because it's the only thing I can get right in my life like everytime I try to make shit better I only make it worse like I can't deal with being alone anymore and I hate it
993	real	Caught Myself Just In Time [End Title]: I was plugging in my 360 into my TV and I was on my phone looking at listings on eBay. I shifted wrong and got unbalanced. My hand planted itself on the wall before disaster.  Based on how and where I was standing I would have:  Taken down the TV  Sliced my thigh on the sharp corner of a table  Would have ended up with my full weight on my PS3 that has Oblivion inside it  And knocked down a pile of games  And possibly slammed my head into a set of plastic drawers that has toppled over before  I didn‚Äôt bust my ass or my stuff. I think I‚Äôve used up my allotted amount of good luck for the week though.
