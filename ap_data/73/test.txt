822	NE	Feeling my way through the darkness  Guided by a beating heart  I can't tell where the journey will end  But I know where to start  They tell me I'm too young to understand  They say I'm caught up in a dream  Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes  Well that's fine by me  So wake me up when it's all over  When I'm wiser and I'm older  All this time I was finding myself, and I  Didn't know I was lost  So wake me up when it's all over  When I'm wiser and I'm older  All this time I was finding myself, and I  Didn't know I was lost  I tried carrying the weight of the world  But I only have two hands  Hope I get the chance to travel the world  But I don't have any plans  Wish that I could stay forever this young  Not afraid to close my eyes  Life's a game made for everyone  And love is a prize  So wake me up when it's all over  When I'm wiser and I'm older  All this time I was finding myself, and I  Didn't know I was lost  So wake me up when it's all over  When I'm wiser and I'm older  All this time I was finding myself, and I  I didn't know I was lost  I didn't know I was lost  I didn't know I was lost  I didn't know I was lost  I didn't know
868	E	"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"  "But I'm only going to get this one chance" (six minutes-, six minutes-)  "Something's wrong, I can feel it" (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)  "Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what  If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble  And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"  "You are just what the doc ordered"  I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod  Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?  They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot  But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen'll go off when I half-cock it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a livin' and a killin' off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack  I'm an MC still as honest  But as rude and as indecent as all hell  Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)  This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop  You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match  With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'  Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack  And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that  I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs  Feel my wrath of attack  Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad  It's actually disastrously bad for the wack  While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce  'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod  Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?  Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got  Well, to be truthful the blueprint's  Simply rage and youthful exuberance  Everybody loves to root for a nuisance  Hit the Earth like an asteroid  Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)  MCs get taken to school with this music  'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"  Now I lead a new school full of students  Me? I'm a product of Rakim  Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren  Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position  To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them  Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames  Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame  On the wall of shame  You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames  Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?  Little gay-lookin' boy  So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)  You're witnessin' a mass-occur  Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy  "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, lookin' boy  You get a thumbs up, pat on the back  And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy  Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?  I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy  I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit  Get outta my face, lookin' boy!  Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable  Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-  I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod  The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR  Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God  Kneel before General Zod  This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard  So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin  You rodent, I'm omnipotent  Let off, then I'm reloadin'  Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'  And I should not be woken  I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'  But I got your mom deep-throatin'  I'm out my Ramen Noodle  We have nothin' in common, poodle  I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil  It's me, my honesty's brutal  But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes  To maybe try to help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines  Just in case 'cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come tryin'  To censor you like that one line  I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1  When I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine  Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9  See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm  Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal  You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for  You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows  You write normal? Fuck being normal!  And I just bought a new raygun from the future  Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad  'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad  Singin' to a man while he played piano  Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station  The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"  Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)  Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?  Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything  You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and  I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating  How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating  Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating  'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated  I make elevating music, you make elevator music  "Oh, he's too mainstream"  Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it  "It's not hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock, shock rap with Doc  Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it  "I don't know how to make songs like that  I don't know what words to use"  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you  It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you  How many verses I gotta murder to  Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?  Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie  But look at the accolades these skills brung me  Full of myself, but still hungry  I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I'm a million leagues above you  Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you  I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel  I'ma sleep in the front seat  Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"  But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me  They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred  I have, then you may be a little patient  And more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!  But if I can't batter the women  How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?  Don't mistake him for Satan, it's a fatal mistake  If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation  To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and  Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not  Why be a king when you can be a god?
