I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect  So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it  I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway  Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka  You dare me to drive?  You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"  About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning  But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?  That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning  Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy  And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call  I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall  I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it  You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it  And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it  I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me  See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!  Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk  But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you  'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too  Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now  Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?  My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I  Got out of bed at all  The morning rain clouds up my window  And I can't see at all  And even if I could it'll all be gray  Put your picture on my wall  It reminds me, that it's not so bad  It's not so bad  Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy  You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?  Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that  And here's an autograph for your brother  I wrote it on the Starter cap  I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you  Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you  But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?  I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?  You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling  To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some  And what's this shit about us meant to be together?  That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other  I really think you and your girlfriend need each other  Or maybe you just need to treat her better  I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time  Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine  If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan  Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan  I just don't want you to do some crazy shit  I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick  Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge  And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid  And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to  Come to think about, his name was, it was you  Damn!
