612	NE	This next song is about my father, Joe Mineo, the legend  Look August 23rd, how could I forget it?  Getting ready in my suite, it's the morning of my wedding  Invited all my legends, man it's set to be epic  And then I got that message I was dreading  My momma said it, "Andy I don't think your father gon' come"  I just laugh, said "oh well," and tried to be numb  I learned to stop getting hopes up  As a kid, growing up, that made the let down easy, when he didn't show up  But deep down I had this flicker of hope  This one time he pull it together, make a effort but nope  I'm standing at the altar, he nowhere in sight  How I'm thinking about him now instead of my wife  Best man Ray to my right said "you'll be alright  At least you know you're gonna be smashing tonight"  Then the doors open in the back, wearing all white  This the first day of the rest of our life  Father by her side while she came down the aisle  She's was looking all ow, then we exchanged vows  Long winded self, should have passed me a towel  We both said "I do," we team Mineo now  So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo  But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture  So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo  But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture  Now the ceremonies done, I know it sound dumb  But I thought he might come because the night was still young  I couldn't feel this space was like a hundred to play  I kept it just in case he praying he show up late  Then I wait, and I wait  I looked Cris in the face and tell her nothings gonna ruin our day  I hate the fact I still love you  I wish that I could turn you off, take the cord to my heart and just unplug you  Damn man, you my dad, what I did to ya?  To make you not love, mean what I should to ya  Look I don't understand, I'd jump off a bridge, I'd take a bullet to the rib before I'd hurt my kid  You know that Mark told me something that I won't ever forget  Sounded just like you, that's how I know it's  Legit  You know you go to Andy's football games but not lacrosse  Why, you told him you don't like that sport  Well do you like me, it's sad I got to ask  You either cry or you try to learn to laugh  Look I figured I'd be past this hurt by now  But after all this time it's only worse right now  'Cause when you bury emotions, you bury them alive  They only come back stronger, somewhere later in your life  And on the honeymoon, I got your text  But I ain't reply  Said "congratulation" like what a guy  I ain't ask you to be perfect, that's only God  I just wished you would have tried  So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo  But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture  So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo  But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture  God grant me the serenity  To accept the things I cannot change  Courage to change the things I can  And wisdom to know the difference  Living one day at a time  Enjoying one moment at a time  Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace  Taking, as Jesus did, this sinful world  As it is, not as I would have it  Trusting that He will make all things right  If I surrender to His Will  That I may be reasonably happy in this life  And supremely happy with You  Forever in the next  Amen, amen, amen
