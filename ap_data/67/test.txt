465	Rhetorical	Ireland help raise 1.8 million dollars for the Choctaw badly affected by Covid-19 as payback for a $150 donation by the Choctaw tribe in 1847 during the Irish Potatoe famine [SEP] As an Irishman, the story of the Choctaw donation to the Irish famine relief has always had one of the most profound effects on me.   For context, from what small amount I know of the Choctaw's struggles, their relocation through the Trail of Tears happened during 1830-33 (broad dates) while our famine was approximately during 1845-49. The Choctaw tribe had experienced thousands of deaths during relocation and were about as destitute as one could imagine. I think that makes the donation all the more powerful. These people had nothing except for heartbreak and betrayal and when the plight of others reached their settlements they rallied together to give almost everything they had. All this born out of the understanding of pain the Irish were suffering and not wishing to see another race of people face those same torments.   I'm not one for big internet posts or to get too emotional about this sort of stuff, but there's a special place in my heart for the Choctaw tribe and other Native Americans. I think it's one of the purest examples of the kindness and solidarity of people, something the modern world has forgotten a bit too often. [SEP] I completely agree. The Choctaw people will always have a place in the hearts of the irish. We will never forget it.

I've seen comment that we are ignorant and racist to lump all Native Americans into the same group. And that we are short sighted to assume Choctaw = Najavo. Most people here know that these are different peoples, separated by hundreds of miles within the continent that is North America. But the one thing we all have in common (Ireland, Najavo, Choctaw, all native Americans) is that we have all suffered greatly from colonialism, we've all had out land taken from us, we've all been forced to relocate (Trail of Tears, To Hell or to Connaught), we've all been brutalised and murdered by a larger power. Irish people sympathise with that, and this is a case of paying it forward, not paying it back.  We will gladly never settle this debt with Choctaw, and I imagine anytime the Irish learn of an indigenous people suffering, we'll be there to give a helping hand. [SEP] A lot of Irish people feel the same about Palestine especially in the West. Last time I was in Connemara I noticed a few free Palestine flags and banner around the place.

The Police is protecting government goons and an informal curfew is being observed with Bangladesh AwamiLeague goons setting up 'points' at places in Dhaka and targeting student irrespective of the fact whether they are protesting or not. No one is getting spared. We have no one to talk to. The people are left alone by all the major bodies of Bangladesh. The press is fully controlled by the government and the private TV channels are owned by AwamiLeague officials as well.  Please use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and any other source you can find to propel this news to the international media.  Please.  More than 100 FEMALE students cannot be traced.10-18 year old boys and girls are getting tortured and attacked be they be Muslims or Hindus or Atheists.  PLEASE send help before something worse happens  **UPDATE :**  The pro government student wing has trapped more than 150 student girls in a hospital/diagnosis center named  'Popular'.  **INJURED STUDENTS ARE NOT GETTING RECEIVED BY HOSPITALS FOR MEDICATION. I REPHRASE : STUDENTS ARE GETTING REJECTED FROM GETTING HELP FROM HOSPITALS. PRO GOV PARTIES ARE THREATENING STAFFS FOR THEIR LIVES.

Due to the lack of mobile data availability the public who were reporting through Facebook Live can't do this anymore. \*\*Connectivity is starting to degrade.\*\*The government is probably planning **on shutting down the entire National Grid** or at least the Dhaka's electricity supply to tackle news from spreading further and issuing a complete Blackout.

553	Argue	Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé named top plastic polluters for third year in a row [SEP] Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé named top plastic polluters for third year in a row [SEP] For the third time in a row I cannot believe this article made it to the front page. I know Reddit loves to hate big corporations especially Coca-Cola and has a massive disdain for plastic products, but to see this article with this source of data on the front page once again is really discouraging and really highlights the fact that there are many users who do not read what they upvote.   This article claims that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter**. This is a pretty bold claim, so let's see how they determined that fact:   The article cites a yearly study performed once again in which a supposidly accurate determination of plastic polluters is identified by using plastic bottles that have washed up on beaches.    This year's study was performed by collecting 346,494 plastic bottles from beaches. Among those, 218,291 of them were able to be identified by brand. Of those identifiable bottles Coca-Cola brand products made up 13,843 of the bottles found on the beach.   Although many of these smaller numbers are cleverly danced-around or completely omitted in the data source, this comes out to be a total of **4% of the total bottles collected were identified as belonging to Coca-Cola brand products.**   4% may not seem like a lot to begin with, but let's also consider a few other factors: Anyone who has ever been to a store in the past 10 years can tell you with certainty that Coca-Cola brand does a very good job of trademarking their product. Every Coca-Cola brand drink (including their teas, sports drinks, juices, and bottled water) has a unique style plastic bottle, and this is reflected across all of their sizes from 12 oz, to 24 oz, to 2 l bottles. This plastic bottle design makes their product visually different from the competitors' bottles who mostly use the same generic shape. When exposed to saltwater and constant sunlight many plastic bottles fade, fall apart, lose their labels, or the labels fade to clear. Because the bottles are discarded, bottle caps with brands on them are often missing as well. Those that have bottle caps are also usually faded and brand stamps worn away.    Despite the harsh weathering there is one persistent detail among the bottles that makes them uniquely and easily identifiable and that is **the shape of the plastic bottle itself**. and as we know Coca-Cola is one of the few brands that has a unique easily identifiable plastic bottle shape. What this means in the context of the study is that every single Coca-Cola product bottle from the past decade was easily identified by their bottle shape, however other leading competitor brands which do not feature a unique bottle shape relied entirely on the label print for identification. this means that 100% of the Coca-Cola products found on the beach were correctly identified as Coca-Cola brand products, however it's very likely that only a small percentage of waste from other brand products were able to be identified due to weathering.   So not only are the results fairly insignificant at only 4%, but they are also extremely biased and unreliable.   Using this data the study claimed that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluting brand**. Ignoring the flawed data for a moment let's take a look at what this claim means in regards to this particular study with an analogy:   *Imagine you're walking into work one morning and you notice a large pile of cigarette butts lying on the ground around the smoker's pole in the parking lot. Being the good samaritan that you are you pick up the trash. You count that you've picked up 100 cigarette butts. Out of those cigarette butts 37 of them are just plain orange or white design with no identifiable information. However, 63 of them have a brand name or logo printed on them. There's a very large variety of brands, many of which you've never even heard of, however 4 out of the 100 are Marlboro. With all the different brands mixed in Marlboro makes up the largest number of the identifiable cigarette butts.* **Using this information you determine that Marlboro cigarette company must be the number one litter producer in the world.**  ______  While the results of the study are interesting and important, they do not and never have supported the claim that Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter. Using the data in this way only proves one or more of the following points:  1) Coca-Cola produces the most popular brands of bottled products.  2) Coca-Cola product consumers litter more often than consumers of other products.  3) Coca-Cola brand products have the most easily identifiable plastic bottle.   If the plastic waste found on the beaches was somehow the result of Coca-Cola's factory runoff this headline could be valid, however all it proves is that Coca-Cola products are the most likely to be identifiable when found washed up on a beach.

The generation of my parents literally had to bleed on the streets to get our generation rid of socialism and ensure a future for us. We all thank them for their sacrifice every single day.   I just returned from an excursion to Devin Castle in Slovakia, which is at the border between former Czechoslovakia and Austria. It shows all the people who tried to escape socialism while risking their lives, only to be torn apart alive by dogs, or shot to pieces by border guards (if they got lucky). Yet people still kept risking being torn apart by dogs just to escape socialism, they kept thinking of innovative ways to escape (like home-made diving suits which caused the to drown, or home-made rogallos which caused them to be shot to death before their dead bodies even reached the Austrian side of the river).   The rise of the radical right in the US makes me sick as half of my family suffered immensely in camps the last time it happened in our part of Europe. And the rise of the radical left makes me equally sick as socialists did more harm to us than the nazis ever could. Please, I beg you, don't fall into this trap. My chess coach always said ""A smart man learns from his mistakes, a smarter man learns from mistakes of others"". Please learn from our mistakes, the entire world will benefit from that. Please listen to people who experienced what you wish for. We are not idiots, we are people just like you and we have experienced the thing you are wishing for right now. Please listen to us and trust us, you don't want it. Your children will pay the price for it. Please..."

Emigrating to a different country goes against a lot of traditional Chinese values, such as the responsibilities of looking after your own parents. Also, HK is such a tax haven where you pay pennies in income tax compared to the 20-45% rate in the UK.  I also wouldn't be surprised if this option comes with clauses like ""no access to public funds"", aka you're on your own if you failed, a lot of people wouldn't want to give up their income for a (seemingly) uncertain life.   All in all, I would be quite surprised if more than 10% of eligible people actually took advantage of the offer."
237	Inform	"Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity [SEP] Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity [SEP] Facebook is a multiheaded beast. Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.  I am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of ""in industry"". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.  It's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole ""Cambridge Analytica"" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that ""installing apps"" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.  Now, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with ""share on facebook buttons"". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.  Another thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this.   Most of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket.   "

As Allies, we are almost as invested in the state of your country as you are (well, I said almost!), and we are very pleased that the period of insanity is behind you. Hopefully the new administration is able to have an immediate effect on the COVID transmission rates, and you can all get back to a normal life.

New workers (teens with less than 6 months continuous service) or trainees make NZ$16 or only US$11.25. That's all pretty much on par with US (and likely much worse when you consider the average salary and thus purchasing power in NZ is one and half times that of the US.  There... go be less ignorant.

848	Inquire	Canada bans assault weapons, including 1500+ models and variants [SEP] Canada bans assault weapons, including 1500+ models and variants [SEP] I think a large part of the problem is people who don't have any experience with firearms perception of law abiding  people with firearms. The overwhelming majority of people who own guns legally  are just everyday folks who enjoy a day out in the woods or at a range having fun with their friends and family, testing there skill and enjoying the day. What they are NOT, are creepy weirdos sitting in a dark room plotting to commit crime. The only time people hear about these guns is when some fruitloop with mental health issues or gangster commits some unspeakable crime. Everyday thousands of gun owners go out and enjoy themselves without so much as a bother to anyone else. MILLIONS of firearms owners here in Canada go about their days without most people never even knowing they own guns. Legal gun owners, regardless of what type of guns they own, are not a problem here in Canada. Why waste time with irrelevant laws that mean nothing to criminals?

[SEP] School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government. [SEP] Please remember this, everything you normally hear about Bangladesh in the international media is sugarcoated. Bangladesh is a democratic country for show only. Freedom of speech is suppressed, the government is totalitarian, and they actively target, abduct, or beat up dissenters. The prime minister might be considered to be some icon for feminism, humanity, whatever by ousiders but we absolutely hate all ministers (including the prime minister) bar some. We are regularly threatened by BCL (the student political body), they've committed countless atrocities. You might hear about Bangladesh doing well economically but what good is that when you can't even be safe? Minorities like the indigenous people, refugees, Hindus and Christians are brutally discriminated. The military has no accountability, they can do whatever they want. It can be called an absolute shithole since you have no say, and human rights are breached regularly. The worst thing is that since corruption is so rampant, there's hardly anything we can do. And if we do try, they accuse us of being against the nation or the freedom fighters, they just manipulate patriotic sentiments. Even as we speak, the government is suing and arresting people who posted videos and pictures on social media. They're saying that we are spreading misinformation and absolutely nothing happened today. It's a total shitshow.

[SEP] OK, so it's important to pump the brakes here a bit - let's go over a few major major caveats to this study.  1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address. 2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving). 3. From the paper itself: ""We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment."" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already. 4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.
