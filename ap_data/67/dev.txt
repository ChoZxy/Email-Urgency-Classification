I was head of quality for one of the Aldi countries for a couple of years. At that time (4-5 years ago) sustainability was a complete novel thing that was just a side task of one of the buyers. They started hiring a small sustainability team that made quite some local impact.  Though i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder.   I have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material.

I bet the most amount of actual hard work Trump has ever done was when he shoves his tiny little nipple-dick in his disgusted wife for about 3 pumps before he gives up and falls off her like the disgusting fat slob that he is.   My point is, Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself and doesn't even understand what the word sacrifice means since everything he's ever had was either handed to him, or he cheated, lied and stole to get it.   Maybe people are being critical of him not showing up to the cemetery, but he probably did all those dead soldiers a favour by not walking across their graves.

40	Argue	More than 150 senior Russian officials sign open letter condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine as 'an unprecedented atrocity' and warn of 'catastrophic consequences' while urging citizens 'not to participate' [SEP] More than 150 senior Russian officials sign open letter condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine as 'an unprecedented atrocity' and warn of 'catastrophic consequences' while urging citizens 'not to participate' [SEP]  My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness.   NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits.   When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows.   The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU.   As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won.   With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned.   The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.  dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.  Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views.

So you're only going to have access to it if you're a particularly trustworthy guy, and proven to be good at keeping your mouth shut, because otherwise you wouldn't have clearance, right?  Then if you're senior enough to be briefing the President-Elect of the United States, you're going to have decades of secret-keeping behind you. I mean, these guys can't even tell their wives what they do all day, and there's a decent chance that these guys lie on a regular basis to their families to keep their jobs secret.  This is a very small group of people who are the least likely folks in the country to spill a secret or talk to a reporter.  These folks had to be convinced that leaking was better for the country than keeping quiet. Trump's conduct over the past few days could have been that trigger.

528	Argue	"'We Don't Know a Planet Like This': CO2 Levels Hit 415 PPM for 1st Time in 3 Million+ Yrs - ""How is this not breaking news on all channels all over the world?"" [SEP] 'We Don't Know a Planet Like This': CO2 Levels Hit 415 PPM for 1st Time in 3 Million+ Yrs - ""How is this not breaking news on all channels all over the world?"" [SEP] So insect populations are plummeting, over fishing is depleting fish populations, the phytoplankton is in danger, coral reefs are dying, the rain forests are being cleared out, and add to that the animals that are becoming extinct from starvation, habitat destruction, or hunting. Many of us can't be trusted with taking the full course of antibiotics or getting vaccinated, which is causing super-bugs like untreatable gonorrhea and reintroducing diseases like measles to the population. All it takes is for measles or some other deadly disease to mutate and we can forget about our current vaccines. Or when the billions old bacteria that are trapped in the polar ice caps finally thaws, we could get the next black plague. Sea levels are rising, weather extremes are becoming the new normal, we are running out of water, and now Co2 levels are reaching new heights.  &nbsp;  I don't think we are desensitized, many people are doing what they can. It's just that in order to make a total change in our current course, we as a whole change how we consume products, how we produce energy, and how we eat. Too many people live paycheck to paycheck and have little money to change their ways. Others don't want to make any changes to their lives like eating less meat, using less plastic, etc. Some are stupid and think they know better than doctors or scientists. A few don't care at all. There are also those that make money off of the status quo, so don't want to support what could affect their bottom line. I do what I can as part of the working poor, voting included, but many things are out of my hands until more people join in the fight."

[SEP] When your Govt has spent the last few years saying black is white and lining their mates pockets with taxpayers money then people tend not to trust them to steer the country through a pandemic and this is just one of the side-effects of that distrust.  I don't blame individual hoarders, I feel sad for the Australian public that it's come to this."

""Combining gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.  &nbsp;  The commotion started last week with the new game Star Wars: Battlefront in the the game you could buy so called ""loot boxes"", virtual boxes which could contain advantages for the game. You don't know however what it contains beforehand.  &nbsp;  ""The combination of money and addiction is gambling"", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.  &nbsp;  Geens now wants to prevent that these kinds of functions will be in any games going forward. ""But that takes time, because we'll have to make a proposal to the EU. We will definitely try to ban it.""  &nbsp;  Edit: changed some wording for clarification and accuracy.

It is greatly appreciated and I hope you have a great day like I will now have. Thanks."

[SEP] I live in Canada.   Here, the canadian FCC is the CRTC, and this is the CRTC take on Net Neutrality :  **Why does the CRTC support net neutrality?**  *We believe that it is important that all Canadians have access to choice, innovation and free exchange of ideas. If Internet providers price content differently, they are, in a way, influencing you to choose certain content over other.*  *That’s why we decided that Internet providers must treat data traffic the same, regardless of content.*  *Internet providers should compete on the quality of their networks, by lowering their prices or increasing data allowances instead of treating certain content differently. If you are unhappy with the price and data allowance of your services, call your provider and negotiate or shop around! You have choices. Demand better.*  Earing what's coming to the US next months makes me anxious : will the CRTC copy FCC ruling and chicken out on Net Neutrality sooner or later ?! Damn the stakes are high...  [SEP] They 100% will eventually follow suit if it succeeds. Expect no corruption from your government and you'll be disappointed every time. Constant vigilance keeps our rights, and nothing else."
