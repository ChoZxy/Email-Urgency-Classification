I hate that this is happening. I have a lot of Ukrainian friends and it’s truly awful to see how their families are suffering right now. We all are very close and almost everyone has a friend, relative or someone they know on the other end and we can’t comprehend why it’s happening.  It is so heartbreaking to see young soldiers to go to war that they don’t want to fight just because of our crazy president. The situation is really complicated because they do it out of fear for their families and their lives.  I’m almost crying while reading the support words that you guys write, especially after headings that I’ve seen recently “I hate Putin, I hate Russia”. Russia is not Putin, it’s much more than that. Putin is a fucking narcissist and psycho, one of the worst things that ever happened to Russia…  We have a great generation of empathetic, intelligent and friendly people and I believe that we will be able to bring a bright future in which Russia will not be seen as a constant aggressor…  I’m going to the protest in Sydney and will stand for Ukrainians in hope that it will help somehow.   Thanks for the support guys and we will get through this tough times together!

If someone was going to kill him, I would think it would likely be some new guy who voluntarily (as much as one can volunteer) signed up to be on his personal staff.  With that said, if (when?) someone does finally do something about him, I sincerely hope it is quick. Putin has already shown he is a raging paranoid lunatic with no regard for human life. I can't even imagine what he might do if he is poisoned with something slow acting and he knows he is going to die.

441	Argue	"Cancer ‘vaccine’ eliminates tumors in mice - 90 of 90 mice cured of cancers with lymphoma, similar results observed in colon, breast, and melanoma cancers. [SEP] OK, so it's important to pump the brakes here a bit - let's go over a few major major caveats to this study.  1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address. 2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving). 3. From the paper itself: ""We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment."" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already. 4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.  Source - PhD in Microbiology and Immunology [SEP] I do agree that the concept and implementation of oncolytic viruses are not new (clinical trials have started years ago around world), however I do disagree with one point, being that:   >T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors  and   >Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments.  [Regulatory T-cells can infiltrate tumors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041022/) (so not all T-cells are bad at getting into tumors). T-regs maintain our immune system's sense of 'self' and prevents pathological self-reactivity (i.e. autoimmune diseases). However, when recruited by cancerous growths, tumors hijack this feature (akin to stealing the body's sense of 'self' and camouflaging as 'self' cells). The reason why this paper's approach is effective because they are able to simultaneously inhibit tumor infiltrated T-regs (i.e. getting rid of the 'self' signal) and activate effector T-cell function (immune system soldiers). They force tumor-associated T-regs to express a receptor, inject the antibody to said receptor so they aggregate at the tumor site. Effector T-cells nearby are then stimulated by antibodies to OX40 and initiates the rest of the immune response.   I do agree that its major limitation is the direct injection aspect (which they acknowledged right out in the discussion) but it is a truly elegant system they've set up. "

I feel bad for hk since they are under China's rule and wants their own voice. But, why the fuck is everyone pitying the 16 year old by saying ""oh he is fighting for his freedom and got shot"". That poor 16 year old was literally hitting police with a baton... Like name me a country where you can hit a policeman, who is holding a revolver, with a baton, and expect nothing to happen.  There have been tons of violence on both sides and it has been slowly escalating with the hk protesters thinking that an escalation in violence and destruction would bring the world's spotlight and change china's attitude. That thought seems so preposterous its actually laughable. China would never allow such a precedent of giving in to violent protests to be set. The only way for China to give in is if negotiations happened under the table, away from spotlight.  P. S. Don't just downvote me, tell me what do you disagree with."

So I'll just skip to the point.  Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.  Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..  Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.  Or don't. It's your choice."

Things like members of the military opening accounts in Seychelles four days after Maduro's election victory and the boss of Venezuela's interpol being a drug trafficker. This could have a deep impact here considering we are right now on an almost humanitarian crisis in which people are dying from preventable diseases due to shortages of medicines thanks in great part to exchange controls and corruption around such exchange control schemes.  This is historic  Edit: This is a Channel 4 documentary on the shortage of medicines in case you want to know more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKocOdxTzvs&feature=youtu.be"

There’s this story that some Church goers need to hear...   A man got stranded in a flood and as the flood waters rises he climbed to the top of his house.   A man in a raft came by and offered to rescue him.   “Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the raft went on.   Then a boat came by and offered to save him.    “Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the boat went on. Flood waters continued to rise and a helicopter came by and offered to save him. He gave the same excuse that God would save him. Helicopter went on and eventually the flood waters rose higher and he drowned.   He got to heaven and asked God “Why didn’t you save me? I believed in you trusted that you would.”   Now all you smart people out there already figured out the ending to this.   And God said “I tried, I sent a raft, a boat, and a helicopter to save you but you turned them all down.”  I keep hearing stories about people who say Christians shouldn’t be afraid because God will protect us... that’s not how this works. All churches should close. They shouldn’t be exempt from this. Use common sense people. If you believe in God then you should believe God sent experts and scientists to give you the proper advice on how to avoid this.

You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.  Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail? [SEP] > fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights  Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.  EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.  He's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/)   [Áron Kovács - Friday, October 30, 2015, 10:09](https://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/ketmilliot-fizethet-a-kocsis-matet-melegnek-nevezo-ungar-klara-1030#!s0)  *According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*  *Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*  *Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*

It’s like when China criticizes America for acting authoritarian. I’ve seen progressives eat that shit up and sometimes conveniently forget about China’s human rights record.   I think we as citizens should be holding all of our governments accountable and not let them do this petty shit.

223	Inquire	Belgium says loot boxes are gambling, wants them banned in Europe [SEP] What we hope: To see an end to Loot Boxes as a feature in full priced games  What we'll get: Overwatch removed from Europe. [SEP] I’m really curious about how this could affect overwatch in different ways. I choose not to buy loot boxes, so from my selfish perspective, I appreciate all the people buying them and paying for all the updates and events that I get for free.   But at the same time, if there are kids out there stealing money from their parents to buy loot boxes, then that means I am profiting off of that.   If they changed to direct purchase of in game items, they no doubt would make less money, but I wonder if maybe more people would take part in the micro transactions. Would they still make enough to fully support the game at the level they do currently?  I also wonder how a season pass model would work. I would be perfectly fine with a $20 annual pass, but how many others would?   My unfortunate assumption is that the majority of players benefit most from the current system at the expense of those minority “whales” and those who spend an irresponsible amount on loot boxes.   So the question is, if loot boxes are removed, what could possibly take their place that would provide Blizzard with enough post-sale revenue to maintain overwatch at the current level?  (Keep in mind that all these thoughts relate strictly to overwatch’s micro transaction model, none of that EA p2w garbage.)
409	Inform	Newly revealed financial records show Trump owes millions to state-owned bank in China: report [SEP] Newly revealed financial records show Trump owes millions to state-owned bank in China: report [SEP] Disclaimer: I work in finance, am predominantly liberal, live in the UK and y’all need universal healthcare.   Now for the facts and figures:  Trump owe a 30% stake in a real estate asset that is partially financed by Bank of China.   This is **extremely** common in ANY large scale financing. Either the lead bank(s) lends the money, and then syndicates the loan out to dozens of banks, or a club of banks get together at the beginning and finance it.   Trump does NOT owe Bank of China 30% of $950m. That would be if he borrowed directly from them. He has a partial stake in an asset that has a $950m loan on it. That’s very different. If you owned shares in Tesla, even as a tiny holder, would you say you owe money to Tesla’s creditors?   edit: Trump absolutely should’ve put his assets in a blind trust, and frankly I’m hoping he is voted out in Nov. But you can’t make a mountain out of every single molehill, otherwise the next real mountain doesn’t get taken seriously.

Or is it one of those ""You're making us look bad, so you have to stop"" things? [SEP] California sets emission standard. Being they are the largest economy in the US by far, most manufacturers will use their standard as the baseline, because if you miss their standards, you are locked out of the largest vehicle market.  California has incredible ""soft power"" over vehicle emissions standards. Trump doesn't like California having so much power over emissions. He wants to go back to precatalytic converter days. He wants cars that get 12mpg to be on the road without a care.  What started as ""cut standards you're making us look bad"" has evolved into ""You ARE the standard, because of how well known California is for going above and beyond other states in that regard.

231	Inform	"Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity [SEP] Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity [SEP] Facebook is a multiheaded beast. Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.  I am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of ""in industry"". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.  It's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole ""Cambridge Analytica"" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that ""installing apps"" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.  Now, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with ""share on facebook buttons"". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.  Another thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this.   Most of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket.   "

This will take time, but momentum is in the West’s favor on this. If we continue to band together we can isolate Russia, crush their economy, and bring an end to their aggression. The entirety of the West must be willing to make sacrifices to ensure a future where this will not happen anywhere in the world again.   Glory to Ukraine!
