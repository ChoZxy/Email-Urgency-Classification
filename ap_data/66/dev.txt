801	4	In 1992, more than 150 countries agreed in Rio de Janeiro to stabilize emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at a level that would “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” — United Nations-speak for global warming.Many follow-up meetings have been held, long on aspiration but short on action. Emissions have gone up, as have atmospheric temperatures, while the consequences of climate change — droughts, floods, explosive wildfires in both familiar and unexpected places, melting glaciers and ice caps, dying corals, slow but inexorable sea level rise — have become ever more pronounced.Beginning on Oct. 31, in Glasgow, the now 197 signatories to the Rio treaty will try once again to fashion an international agreement that might actually slow and then reliably (and, it is hoped, quickly) reduce emissions and thus prevent the world from tipping into full-scale catastrophe late in this century. As with other climate meetings — notably those in Kyoto in 1997, Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris in 2015 — Glasgow is being advertised as a watershed event. John Kerry, the former secretary of state who led the American negotiating team in Paris and will lead this one, called Glasgow the world’s “last best chance” to avoid ecological calamity. President Biden said he will “be there with bells on,” and 100 other world leaders are set to attend, including, of course, the host, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but not, at least so far, President Xi Jinping of China, which is by far the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.Of all the earlier meetings, Paris was the most successful, in part because negotiators agreed to abandon years of fruitless efforts to achieve legally enforceable targets, instead eliciting modest voluntary pledges, known as nationally determined contributions, from nations large and small to do the best they could as part of a collective effort to keep the average global temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels — just a few tenths of a degree hotter than the world is today. The 1.5 number was believed then, as it is now, to be a threshold beyond which lie warming’s most serious consequences.That every country pledged to help inspired a lot of high-fiving among the delegates in Paris, and deservedly so. It had taken a long time to persuade both rich and poor nations that a global problem required a global solution. But the delegates were under no illusion that these pledges would be enough to reach the 1.5 degree target. So they agreed to meet again in five years in order to assess progress and ratchet up those commitments. Glasgow is that meeting.The lack of progress since Paris invites cynicism — at the very least, wariness — about Glasgow. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have since risen above annual averages of 400 parts per million, long seen as a dangerous threshold. In 2019 the world logged the most annual greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded, equivalent to more than 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a figure that includes methane and other climate-warming agents. The economic downturn caused by the Covid pandemic hardly moved the needle.With only a week to go before the clamor begins in Glasgow, China, Australia, Russia and India have yet to make new pledges to cut their emissions. The Washington Post recently reported that Brazil and Mexico have put forward weaker targets than they submitted in Paris five years ago. Many of those that have submitted new pledges have promised rather vaguely to reach a goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury, which on paper would help keep warming within manageable limits but in practice will not do so unless followed up with real policies aimed at sharply reducing the use of fossil fuels, switching to cleaner sources of energy, electrifying cars and buildings and doing whatever else is necessary to decarbonize the world.The question now is whether the delegates in Glasgow can rise above this pessimism and surprise us all with truly meaningful steps. Gloomy predictions to the contrary, several things have happened since Paris that should inspire everyone. For starters, the science of climate change has become tighter, tougher and more terrifying. In 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a truly scary warning — what one U.N. official described as “a deafening, piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen.” The gist of it was that if the world had any hope of meeting the 1.5 degree threshold and thus avoiding ecological and social calamity, it must radically transform its energy systems not on any sort of leisurely glide path but in the next 12 years, which meant cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and zeroing them out by 2050.In case anyone missed the message, the I.P.C.C. repeated it in a no less alarming report in August of this year, a report that U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called a “code red for humanity.” The report warned that so much carbon dioxide had already been baked into the atmosphere that further major ecological and social damage — floods, droughts, famines, fires — was inevitable and the world should begin now to plan for it. Yet as the panel did in 2018, it opened a window of hope, arguing that with swift and sustained action to reduce the fossil fuels burned in cars, power plants and factories; vastly increase the use of renewable energy sources; and find other ways to decarbonize the planet, the world could stay within hailing distance of 1.5 degrees to avoid an even darker future.Then, too, the delegates in Glasgow, unlike those in Paris, have lived through a year of extraordinary environmental upheaval, unprecedented in modern times. Much of it was associated with climate change — huge floods in Europe, Nigeria, Uganda and India; catastrophic wildfires in Greece, Siberia and California; fatal heat waves in the Pacific Northwest; drought and minimal snowfall that seem to be inexorably drying up rivers and reservoirs. No previous climate summit took place in similarly disturbing circumstances.One more post-Paris development: technological progress. As the writer Fred Pearce points out in an essay on the website Yale Environment 360, the potential for achieving reductions in emissions has improved since Paris because of technological advances. Electric cars were barely on the horizon in 2015, and now one big automaker after another has pledged to produce them for mass consumption. The costs of solar and battery power have continued to go down.Finally, and importantly, America is back in the game, after four dismal years in which President Donald Trump not only abandoned the Paris agreement but also did everything else he could think of to undermine the science of climate change and encourage the production of fossil fuels. In a complete turnabout, Mr. Biden’s ambitions match the I.P.C.C.’s demands: a 50 to 52 percent cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Along the way, he would aim to eliminate fossil fuel emissions from power plants by 2035.Key pieces of Mr. Biden’s climate agenda are embedded in a massive and controversial $3.5 trillion social spending bill, and one of the most important of these pieces — a carrot-and-stick program to require utilities to jettison fossil fuels in favor of noncarbon sources — is unlikely to pass. Despite grim predictions that this will undermine America’s claim to leadership on the climate issue, Mr. Kerry and his team will not go to Glasgow empty-handed. Far from it: Many other elements of the bill remain intact, including substantial tax incentives for cleaner fuels and electric cars. There are other tools in the administration’s toolbox, including proposed new mileage standards for cars and light trucks and new rules for reducing emissions of methane and the superpolluting hydrofluorocarbons used in refrigerators and air-conditioners.In any case, America’s credibility will not be the main issue in Glasgow. The main issue there will be whether the delegates will listen to the science, look clearly at what’s happening in the world around them and then — here is the hard part — provide action plans to match their aspirations.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

792	3	Climate change in Hawke's Bay and Gisborne will lead to fewer fruit and vegetables, more pests and probably more tourists, according to a soon-to-be-released report. The ‘Climate change projections and impacts for Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay’ by the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere was commissioned by the Hawke's Bay Regional Council and Gisborne District Council and will be made public on Monday. A paper before the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council says the new report is the “most up to date and comprehensive assessment of climate change risks to the region”. NIWA used modelling from vthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including a mid-range emission and high emission model, to describe changes that could occur over the 21st Century. READ MORE: * Fresh water storage sites to be investigated in drought prone Hawke's Bay * Mackenzie region forecast to feel climate change heat * Hawke's Bay Regional Council consultation could see zero rates increase  Annual average temperatures in the regions were expected to warm by 0.5 degrees Celsius and 1C by 2040 and between 1.5C and 3C by 2090, with the strongest warming occurring in autumn. In coastal areas, there will be five fewer frosty days by 2040 and about 30 fewer frosty days by 2090. In inland areas, there will be 20 fewer frosty days in 2040 and 50 fewer frosty days by 2090. Heat waves, defined as three or more days above 25C, will be increasingly common, with some expected to last 60 days by 2090. There will be up to five per cent less annual rainfall by 2040 and up to 15 per cent less by 2090. The potential for drought will increase substantially, and the amount of water flowing in rivers will decrease by up to 20 per cent by 2090. The coast will be affected by sea level rise. At present the mean high water spring level is exceeded by just 10 per cent of high tides. By 2090 it would be exceeded by every high tide. On top of all of this, there will be more pests and disease, and less and poorer quality fruit and vegetables. Higher rainfall will lead to increased erosion and damage to roads and water supplies, forestry, and agricultural land. On a brighter note, climate change brings a few potential opportunities such as increased pasture and plant productivity, provided there is enough water, due to the additional carbon dioxide, less frost damage and a boost to tourism and water-based activities during the longer summer. The air may get cleaner in winter due to a reduction in domestic fires, but could get worse in summer due to wildfires and an increase in windblown dust and allergenic pollen.
858	5	If I am brutally honest, there is only one motto I would give to the movement to stem climate change after the Glasgow summit: “Everyone wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.”On the one hand, liberal greens will tell you that the world is ending — but that we must not use nuclear power, an abundant source of clean energy, to stave it off. On the other hand, conservative greens will tell you that the world is ending, but that we can’t burden people with a carbon tax or a gasoline tax to slow global warming.On a third hand, suburban greens will tell you that the world is ending, but that they don’t want any windmills, solar farms or high-speed rail lines in their backyards.On a fourth hand, most of today’s leaders will tell you that the world is ending, so at Glasgow they’ve all decided to go out on a limb and commit their successors’ successor to deliver emissions-free electricity by 2030, 2040 or 2050 — any date that doesn’t require them to ask their citizens to do anything painful today.This is not serious — not when you’re talking about reversing all the ways that we have destabilized Earth’s systems, from ice caps and ocean currents to coral reefs and tropical forests to the density of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is pretend.Serious was how we responded to Covid-19, when it really did feel like the world economy was ending: We fought back with the only tools we have that are as big and powerful as Mother Nature — Father Profit and New Tech.We combined innovative biotech firms — like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and some small start-ups — with today’s massive computing power and a giant market demand signal, and what did we get? In a little over a year after first being locked down by the virus, I had an effective mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 in my body — followed by a booster!That was an amazing feat of biotechnology and computerized logistics to develop and deliver vaccines. And I hope the scientists, employees and shareholders of those vaccine innovators make boatloads of money — because it will incentivize others to apply a similar formula to stem climate change.I have nothing against Glasgow. I admire those leaders who are trying to inspire the world to cut CO2 emissions, preserve biodiversity and hold each other to account. But we will not decarbonize the global economy with a lowest-common-denominator action plan of 195 countries. Not possible.We will get there only when Father Profit and risk-taking entrepreneurs produce transformative technologies that enable ordinary people to have extraordinary impacts on our climate without sacrificing much — by just being good consumers of these new technologies.In short: we need a few more Greta Thunbergs and a lot more Elon Musks. That is, more risk-taking innovators converting basic science into tools yet to be imagined to protect the planet for a generation yet to be born.The good news — it’s happening. Two examples:The first is Planet.com, which I alluded to briefly in last week’s column from Glasgow. Founded in 2010 by three former NASA scientists based in San Francisco, Planet has some 200 earth-imaging satellites in orbit, most the size of a loaf of bread, to observe the entire global land mass every 24 hours in high resolution — in order to make the changes unfolding on the ground “visible, accessible and actionable.” No government in the world has this capacity.With these new deep transparency tools we can begin to reshape capitalism. For years, the rules and incentives of capitalism enabled oil and coal companies to extract fossil fuels — and industries to use them — without paying the true cost of the damage they were causing. That was easy to do because nature was hard to value; destruction was often hard to see in real time; and consumers had no tools to react. They had to wait for the courts.“Capitalism has produced enormous wealth, but in part that’s because it has been able to treat nature as self-replenishing, hyper-abundant and free,” explained Andrew Zolli, Planet’s chief impact officer.That will not be so easy anymore. Satellites are now “enabling us to put natural capital on every company and every country’s balance sheet,’’ so it will not take account of just your business profits and losses, “but all of your impacts’’ on the environment as well, Will Marshall, one of Planet’s three co-founders and its C.E.O., said to me.Planet’s satellites plus AI, Marshall explained, can track a country’s trees, farmlands, coral reefs, coastal mangroves and smokestack emissions with incredible precision — down to three meters — and provide transparency to show which trees are being illegally logged by whom and whose factories are violating their carbon dioxide emissions promises.That data can then be used — in theory — to trigger consumer boycotts, spread through social networks, against the government or the food or mining company doing the damage, or it can stimulate foreign aid or investment in the country or community protecting its natural resources.For instance, Planet, with a group of scientific and philanthropic partners, has helped create a detailed map — the Allen Coral Atlas — of all the world’s remaining coral reefs. The Philippines is using the atlas’s data about sea grass to plan nine new marine-protected areas throughout the country. At the same time, in a partnership paid by Norway, Planet is tracking deforestation in 64 tropical rainforest countries, including Brazil. Using Planet’s pinpoint accuracy, the Brazilian government has vastly increased the number of cease-and-desist citations against illegal loggers, according to Planet’s Brazilian partner, MapBiomas.Even more important, Marshall said, is how Planet’s commercial business also helps by, for example, enabling farmers to do precision agriculture by giving them fine-grain images of their crops so they know exactly where to add water and fertilizer or when to harvest. “This may have the biggest ecosystem impact of all,” he said. More efficient crop yields that use less water and fewer fertilizers end up “reducing the need to plow up more tropical forest and strengthens the environment generally.”The other company I am watching is Helion Energy, based in Redmond, Wash., which is working on “the world’s first fusion power plant.” Fusion energy has long been the holy grail for clean power generation — and it always seems 20 years away. As the International Atomic Energy Agency notes on its website: “The sun, along with all other stars, is powered by a reaction called nuclear fusion. If nuclear fusion can be replicated on earth, it could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy.”Last June, as the website New Atlas reported, Helion published results confirming that its latest system had managed to heat a fusion plasma to a temperature over 100 million degrees Celsius, “which is significant, since it’s around the point at which there’s enough thermal energy to create large amounts of fusion.”On Nov. 5, in the midst of Glasgow, Helion, across the Atlantic in Redmond, announced that it had raised $500 million in new financing in a round led by Sam Altman, C.E.O. of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator, along with a Who’s Who of tech entrepreneurs.The current generation of Helion’s system, Techcrunch.com reported, “wouldn’t be able to replace your Tesla Powerwall and solar panels — the size of a generator is roughly the size of a shipping container. But at 50 megawatts, the generators could power around 40,000 homes.” As New Atlas pointed out, “Helion projects it will generate electricity at rock-bottom prices of around $10 per MWh … less than a third the price of coal-fired power or today’s solar PV installations.”Is Helion THE holy grail? Don’t know. There are other companies with promising approaches — like Commonwealth Fusion Systems — all racing to the same goal. I just know this: We got into this hole thanks to the worst of capitalism — letting companies privatize their gains from despoiling the environment and warming the climate — while socializing the losses among all of us.We can get out of it, in part, by accelerating the best of American capitalism. We need to re-energize our innovation ecosystem to where government funds basic research that pushes the boundaries of physics, chemistry and biology and then combines that innovation with immigration policies that amass the world’s best pools of engineering talent and then unleashes that talent — propelled by risk-takers — to invent new clean technologies to slow global warming at the warp speed and scale we need.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

611	4	"A 30C temperature recorded on June 21 in Verkhoyansk, Russia. Photo / AP fileNearly impossible without man-made global warming, this year's freak Siberian heatwave is producing climate change's most flagrant footprint of extreme weather, a new flash study says.International scientists released a study today that found the greenhouse effect multiplied the chance of the region's prolonged heat by at least 600 times, and maybe tens of thousands of times.In the study, which has not yet gone through peer review, the team looked at Siberia from January to June, including a day that hit 38C for a new Arctic record.Scientists from the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland used 70 climate models running thousands of complex simulations comparing current conditions to a world without man-made warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas.Scientists reveal 'unequivocal evidence' of the influence of greenhouse gases https://t.co/aXSSDEigpbThey found that without climate change the type of prolonged heat that hit Siberia would happen once in 80,000 years, ""effectively impossible without human influence,"" said study lead author Andrew Ciavarella, a scientist at the UK Met Office.This study, coordinated by World Weather Attribution, was done in two weeks and hasn't yet been put through the microscope of peer review and published in a major scientific journal.But the researchers who specialise in these real-time studies to search for fingerprints of climate change in extreme events usually do get their work later published in a peer-reviewed journal and use methods  that outside scientists say are standard and proven.World Weather Attribution's past work has found some weather extremes were not triggered by climate change.Climate change made Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely – study https://t.co/k1tZAaAva7But 2020's Siberian heatwave stood out among the many studied, said attribution team co-lead Friederike Otto, acting director of Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute.""Definitely from everything we have done it's the strongest signal that we have seen,'' Otto said.The team looked at both the average temperature in Siberia over the first six months of the year when temperatures averaged 5C above normal and the heat spike that occurred in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk in June.Both just really couldn't happen in a world without the additional heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuel, Ciavarella said.The scientists said the heat added to problems with widespread wildfires fires, pest outbreaks and the thawing of permafrost which led to a massive pipeline oil spill.Thawing permafrost also has the potential to release huge amounts of greenhouse gases trapped under the frozen ground, which could then worsen the warming, scientists said.Nearly 300 wildfires are blazing across Siberia amid a record-breaking heatwave in the region. pic.twitter.com/HueE1P4OLl""This event is really worrying,"" said study co-author Olga Zolina, a climate scientist at the P.P.

""We can either adapt or suffer.""- AP"
46	4	U.S. intelligence officials have little comfort to offer a pandemic-weary planet about where the world is heading in the next 20 years. Short answer: It looks pretty bleak.On Thursday, the National Intelligence Council, a center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that creates strategic forecasts and estimates, often based on material gathered by U.S. spy agencies, released its quadrennial “Global Trends” report.Looking over the time horizon, it finds a world unsettled by the coronavirus pandemic, the ravages of climate change — which will propel mass migration — and a widening gap between what people demand from their leaders and what they can actually deliver.The intelligence community has long warned policymakers and the public that pandemic disease could profoundly reshape global politics and U.S. national security. The authors of the report, which does not represent official U.S. policy, describe the pandemic as a preview of crises to come. It has been a globally destabilizing event — the council called it “the most significant, singular global disruption since World War II — that “has reminded the world of its fragility” and “shaken long-held assumptions” about how well governments and institutions could respond to a catastrophe.At the same time, the pandemic accelerated and exacerbated social and economic fissures that had already emerged. And it underscored the risks from “more and cascading global challenges, ranging from disease to climate change to the disruptions from new technologies and financial crises,” the authors write.In language that will resonate with just about anyone who has tread water in the past year, the authors write of a “looming disequilibrium between existing and future challenges and the ability of institutions and systems to respond.”Within societies, fragmentation is increasing — political, cultural, economic — and “large segments of the global population are becoming wary of institutions and governments that they see as unwilling or unable to address their needs,” the report says.The effects of the pandemic will linger, and could shape future generations’ expectations of their governments, particularly as a warming world leads to new human conflicts, including, in the most dire scenario, global food shortages that spawn mass violence.Global power was contested long before the pandemic, and those trends haven’t abated.The report sees the international stage as largely being shaped by a rivalry between China and the United States, along with its allies. No single state is poised to become the dominant global force, the authors write. And competing powers will jockey for position, leading to “a more conflict-prone and volatile geopolitical environment.”Technology, with all its potential to boost economies and enhance communication, also may aggravate political tension — as it already has.People “are likely to gravitate to information silos of people who share similar views, reinforcing beliefs and understanding of the truth,” the report concludes.Prediction is an inherently risky business, and intelligence practitioners are quick to emphasize that they can’t see the future. But the National Intelligence Council imagines five scenarios on a kind of sliding scale that may help tell us where the world is turning as we approach 2040.On the rosiest end, a “Renaissance of democracies” ushers in a new era of U.S. global leadership, in which economic growth and technological achievements offer solutions to the world’s biggest problems and Russia and China are largely left in the dust, authoritarian vestiges whose brightest scientists and entrepreneurs have fled to the United States and Europe.At the dark end of the future is “tragedy and mobilization,” when the United States is no longer the dominant player, and a global environmental catastrophe prompts food shortages and a “bottom-up” revolution, with younger people, scarred by their leaders’ failures during the coronavirus pandemic, embracing policies to repair the climate and tackle long-standing social inequality. In this scenario, a European Union dominated by green parties works with the United Nations to expand international aid and focus on sustainability, and China joins the effort in part to quell domestic unrest in its cities affected by famine.In between those extremes, the report imagines three other possibilities: China becomes a leading state but not globally dominant; the United States and China prosper and compete as the two major powers; and globalization fails to create a single source of influence, and the world more or less devolves into competing blocs, preoccupied with threats to their prosperity and security.The present has a lot of say over the future. And there, the authors find reason for alarm.“The international system — including the organizations, alliances, rules, and norms — is poorly set up to address the compounding global challenges facing populations,” the authors write.But the pandemic may offer lessons on how not to repeat recent history. The authors note that although European countries restricted travel and exports of medical supplies early in the crisis, the European Union has now rallied around an economic rescue package. That “could bolster the European integration projecting going forward.”“Covid-19 could also lead to redirection of national budgets toward pandemic response and economic recovery,” they add, “diverting funds from defense expenditures, foreign aid, and infrastructure programs in some countries, at least in the near term.”But overall, the pandemic leaves the authors with more questions than answers — and humbled.“As researchers and analysts, we must be ever vigilant, asking better questions, frequently challenging our assumptions, checking our biases, and looking for weak signals of change,” they write.Their work is not all doomsaying. The forces shaping the world “are not fixed in perpetuity,” the authors say. Countries that exploit technology and planning, particularly those that plan ahead for the seemingly inevitable consequences of climate change, will be poised to best manage the crisis. And countries that harness artificial intelligence could boost productivity and expand their economies in ways that let government deliver more services, reduce debt and help cover the costs of caring for aging populations.Ultimately, the societies that succeed will be those that can adapt to change, but also forge social consensus around what should be done, the authors write. In a splintering world, that may be the hardest scenario to imagine.
882	2	TO THE untrained eye, the satellite photos of north-west Ethiopia on July 10th may have seemed benign. They showed a relatively small pool of water next to an enormous building site on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile river. But the project under construction is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is more than halfway complete. And the water is why it is so controversial.Since Ethiopia announced its plan to build the dam, it has inspired threats of sabotage from Egypt, which sits downstream and relies on the Nile for electricity, farming and drinking water. Egypt claims that it is entitled to a certain proportion of the Nile’s water based on colonial-era treaties. Ethiopia dismisses those agreements. The pool of water in the photos suggested that it was beginning to fill the reservoir behind the dam, reducing the river’s flow.That turns out not to have been the case. The pool was deemed by Egypt to be a result of construction and seasonal Nile flooding. But the alarms it raised are indicative of how sensitive negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have become. Talks over such things as how fast to fill the reservoir and how to operate the dam have stumbled. And a potentially huge complication looms over any discussion of the Nile’s future: climate change.By 2050 around a billion people will live in the countries through which the Nile and its tributaries flow. That alone will put enormous stress on the water supply. But according to a study by Mohamed Siam and Elfatih Eltahir of MIT, potential changes to the river’s flow, resulting from climate change, may add to the strain. Messrs Siam and Eltahir conclude that on current trends the annual flow could increase, on average, by up to 15%. That may seem like a good thing, but it could also grow more variable, by 50%. In other words, there would be more (and worse) floods and droughts.There is, of course, uncertainty in the projections, not least because differing global climate models give different numbers. But the idea that the flow of the Nile is likely to become more variable is lent credibility, the authors argue, by the fact that trends over decades seem to agree with them, and by consideration of the effects of El Niños. These colossal climatic oscillations, driven by changes in the temperature of the Pacific, are correlated with the Nile’s flow, and climate-change studies suggesting more extreme El Niños in years to come thus bolster the idea of a more variable Nile.More storage capacity will be needed to smooth out the Nile’s flow. But unlike Egypt’s large Aswan Dam, which was built with storage in mind, the new Ethiopian one is designed for electricity production. Once water starts gushing through its turbines, it is expected to produce over 6,000 megawatts of power. It is unclear, though, if the structure has the necessary flexibility to meet downstream demands in periods of prolonged drought.The talks between the three countries seem to be glossing over the potential effects of climate change. The filling of the reservoir is being negotiated in terms of years, but nature may not co-operate with their timeline. The countries would be better off focusing on how much water is needed downstream, which will vary in wet and dry years, say experts. Similar considerations will need be taken into account when running the dam. “Nowhere in the world are two such large dams on the same river operated without close co-ordination,” says another study from MIT. But so far co-operation is in short supply. The latest round of talks has been postponed. Even the methodology of impact studies is cause for wrangling.Once the dam is up and running, the Nile’s variability will be controllable for some 60 years, say Messrs Siam and Eltahir. That assumes the dam is flexible enough and that the countries work together. Even then, storage would have to be increased by about 45% to keep things steady for the next 60 years. So the countries have time to build new dams; but that will need even greater co-operation.
283	0	Earlier this year much of America went through hell as the nation struggled to deal with Covid-19. More than 120,000 Americans have now died; more than 20 million have lost their jobs.But it’s looking as if all those sacrifices were in vain. We never really got the coronavirus under control, and now infections, while they have fallen to a quite low level in the New York area, the pandemic’s original epicenter, are surging in much of the rest of the country.And the bad news isn’t just a result of more testing. In new hot spots like Arizona — where testing capacity is being overwhelmed — and Houston the fraction of tests coming up positive is soaring, which shows that the disease is spreading rapidly.It didn’t have to be this way. The European Union, a hugely diverse area with a larger population than the U.S., has been far more successful at limiting the spread of Covid-19 than we have. What went wrong?The immediate answer is that many U.S. states ignored warnings from health experts and rushed to reopen their economies, and far too many people failed to follow basic precautions like wearing face masks and avoiding large groups. But why was there so much foolishness?Well, I keep seeing statements to the effect that Americans were too impatient to stay the course, too unwilling to act responsibly. But this is deeply misleading, because it avoids confronting the essence of the problem. Americans didn’t fail the Covid-19 test; Republicans did.After all, the Northeast, with its largely Democratic governors, has been appropriately cautious about reopening, and its numbers look like Europe’s. California and Washington are blue states that are seeing a rise in cases, but it’s from a relatively low base, and their Democratic governors are taking actions like requiring the use of face masks and seem ready to reverse their reopening.So the really bad news is coming from Republican-controlled states, especially Arizona, Florida and Texas, which rushed to reopen and, while some are now pausing, haven’t reversed course. If the Northeast looks like Europe, the South is starting to look like Brazil.Nor is it just Republican governors and state legislatures. According to the new New York Times/Siena poll, voters over all strongly favor giving control of the pandemic priority over reopening the economy — but Republican voters, presumably taking their cue from the White House and Fox News, take the opposite position.And it’s not just about policy decisions. Partisanship seems to be driving individual behavior, too, with self-identified Democrats significantly more likely to wear face masks and engage in social distancing than self-identified Republicans.The question, then, isn’t why “America” has failed to deal effectively with the pandemic. It’s why the G.O.P. has in effect allied itself with the coronavirus.Part of the answer is short-term politics. At the beginning of this year Donald Trump’s re-election message was all about economic triumphalism: Unemployment was low, stocks were up, and he was counting on good numbers to carry him through November. He and his officials wasted crucial weeks refusing to acknowledge the viral threat because they didn’t want to hear any bad news.And they pushed for premature reopening because they wanted things to return to what they seemed to be back in February. Indeed, just a few days ago the same Trump officials who initially assured us that Covid-19 was no big deal were out there dismissing the risks of a second wave.I’d suggest, however, that the G.O.P.’s coronavirus denial also has roots that go beyond Trump and his electoral prospects. The key point, I’d argue, is that Covid-19 is like climate change: It isn’t the kind of menace the party wants to acknowledge.It’s not that the right is averse to fearmongering. But it doesn’t want you to fear impersonal threats that require an effective policy response, not to mention inconveniences like wearing face masks; it wants you to be afraid of people you can hate — people of a different race or supercilious liberals.So instead of dealing with Covid-19, Republican leaders and right-wing media figures have tried to make the pandemic into the kind of threat they want to talk about. It’s “kung flu,” foisted on us by villainous Chinese. Or it’s a hoax perpetrated by the “medical deep state,” which is just looking for a way to hurt Trump.The good news is that the politics of virus denial don’t seem to be working. Partly that’s because racism doesn’t play the way it used to: The Black Lives Matter protesters have received broad public support, despite the usual suspects’ efforts to portray them as rampaging hordes. Partly it’s because the surge in infections is becoming too obvious to deny; even Republican governors are admitting that there’s a problem, although they still don’t seem willing to act.The bad news is that partisanship has crippled our Covid-19 response. The virus is winning, and all indications are that the next few months will be a terrifying nightmare of rampant disease and economic disruption.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Franz Josef is flood prone, it sits on an earthquake fault line and the main tourist attraction, the glacier is shrinking. But none of that compares to the lasting impact of Covid-19. A quarter of the population of 500 has left since border closures wiped out most of the town's business, forcing several large operators including the five star Te Waonui hotel and the hot pools to close, and 60 per cent of jobs have been cut.  ""The numbers just dried up completely,"" local businessman Tim Gibb says. The Detail visited the West Coast tourist town earlier this month to see the effects of the pandemic on a town which thrived pre-Covid on 80 per cent of its visitors coming from overseas.  READ MORE: * 'We are asking help to survive': Franz businesses unimpressed by minister's visit * Is the future of glacier tourism viable in the face of Covid, natural hazards and melting ice? * Wildlife centre's climate change information panels labelled 'misleading' * Kiwi hatching season kicks off with early success in Franz Josef  Shops in the township were deserted, the carpark and tracks to view the glacier were near empty, while signs outside all the stores offered discounts on tours and trips. ""Our business is 80 per cent down on previous years,"" says Richard Benton, owner of West Coast Wild Life Centre.  He doesn't expect it to recover to pre-Covid levels for several years and it is the same story around the tiny township. ""The town has suffered,"" says motel owner Alan Glen. ""To get staff here is quite hard."" Glen himself has gone against the exodus and arrived in town with his wife last September to take over The Terrace motel. He had been out of the country for 27 years and decided to return to the West Coast in 2019, putting a deposit on the motel purchase.  Then Covid hit and he was torn between pulling out of the deal and losing his deposit or returning to face a decimated business.  The Detail's Sharon Brettkelly talks to Franz Josef business owners about the struggle to keep their doors open, with economists predicting the overseas tourist numbers will not recover to pre-Covid levels of four million a year before 2026. ""We can only survive going forward if we get outside support,"" says Benton. He set up West Coast Wild Life Centre in 2010, a public private partnership with Department of Conservation and Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio, where visitors see live kiwi and tuatara and can tour the kiwi hatching and inubation facility. The business has had financial support from the government but it could be forced into hibernation unless Benton can raise more than $500,000 before October. The geographic isolation of Franz Josef and the neighbouring glacier towns, Fox, made it more challenging to lure visitors from South Island centres such as Christchurch or Nelson for weekend trips. ""It's not easy but hey, we're battlers here on the West Coast,"" says Benton. ""But when you lose people you lose your community structure, you lose your plumbers, your electricians, your school teachers, your firemen, your volunteer stuff."" Tim Gibb has experienced first hand the loss of volunteers in the town. The fifth generation local runs quad bike tours, is a volunteer firefighter and a civil defence controller. The night before he spoke to The Detail, Gibb responded to a fire alarm and was the only firefighter to turn up. ""A lot of our guys, they lost their jobs so they've left town. So we're down to a skeleton crew at the moment."" Gibb plays down talk of moving the town further north away from the fautline and he's positive the town's businesses will pull through. ""If they've survived till now, then they're going to survive."""
976	4	To the Editor:Re “Study Finds More of Earth Is Hotter and Says Global Warming Is at Work” (news article, Aug. 7):The new paper by James E. Hansen, a NASA climate scientist, and two colleagues addresses a crucial difficulty many people have in differentiating weather and climate.During hot spells, for example, more people accept that climate is changing, but a colder spell reverses those opinions.Everybody understands weather: it’s hot, cold, raining, snowing, windy and so on. Fewer people understand that a region’s climate is the frequency of such weather events: how often does it rain or get hotter than, say, 90 degrees?The Hansen paper shows that these frequencies have changed substantially, both globally and throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Hot and very hot days have become more frequent; very cold days less frequent. The paper shows that there is more than a “perception” that climate change is occurring. The data show that change is real and substantial.The frequencies have shifted dramatically over the last half-century, especially for the most extreme weather events. The implication is that even more extreme weather is in the offing unless greenhouse gas emissions are quickly brought under control.ROBERT REPETTO Boulder, Colo., Aug. 7, 2012The writer is the author of “America’s Climate Problem: The Way Forward.”
659	3	Two-thirds of Americans believe climate change is either a crisis or a serious problem, with a majority wanting immediate action to address global heating and its damaging consequences, major new polling has found.Amid a Democratic primary shaped by unprecedented alarm over the climate crisis and an insurgent youth climate movement that is sweeping the world, the polling shows substantial if uneven support for tackling the issue.More than a quarter of Americans questioned in the new CBS News poll consider climate change a “crisis”, with a further 36% defining it as a “serious problem”. Two in 10 respondents said it was a minor problem, with just 16% considering it not worrisome at all.More than half of polled Americans said they wanted the climate crisis to be confronted right away, with smaller groups happy to wait a few more years and just 18% rejecting any need to act.“Americans are finally beginning waking up to the existential threat that the climate emergency poses to our society,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist and founder of the Climate Mobilization Project. “This is huge progress for our movement – and it’s young people that have been primarily responsible for that.”But while nearly all of those questioned accept that the climate is changing, there appears to be lingering confusion over why and scientists’ confidence over the causes.There is a consensus among climate scientists that the world is heating up due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation, as well as cutting down forests. However, just 44% of poll respondents said human activity was a major contributor to climate change. More than a quarter said our impact was minor or nonexistent.There is an even starker split on the findings of climate scientists. According to the CBS poll, 52% of Americans say “scientists agree that humans are a main cause” of the climate crisis, with 48% claiming there is disagreement among experts.“This remains a vitally important misunderstanding – if you believe global warming is just a natural cycle, you’re unlikely to support policies intended to reduce carbon pollution, like regulations and taxes,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, which has made similar findings in its own, long-running polling.“These results also again confirm a longstanding problem, which is that many Americans still believe scientists themselves are uncertain whether human-caused global warming is happening.“Our own and others’ research has repeatedly found that this is a critical misunderstanding, promoted by the fossil fuel industry for decades, in order to sow doubt, increase public uncertainty and thus keep people stuck in the status quo, in a ‘wait and see’ mode.”Similar to previous polls, the CBS research finds sharp ideological differences in attitudes to the climate crisis. While nearly seven in 10 Democratic voters understand that humans significantly influence the climate and 80% want immediate action, just 20% of Republicans think humans are a primary cause and barely a quarter want rapid action.On the science, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said almost all experts agree that humans are driving climate change, with just 29% of Republicans saying the same.Age is another key variable. While 70% of 18- to 29-year-olds think climate change is a serious problem or crisis, just 58% over 65 concur. Younger people are far more likely to consider it a personal responsibility to address the climate crisis and to believe that a transition to 100% renewable energy is viable.Young people have been galvanized by climate science being taught in schools as well as a spreading global activist movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started a wave of school walkouts to demand action. Thunberg recently arrived in the US on a solar-powered yacht, ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in New York on 23 September.This generational divide even cuts across party affiliation, with two-thirds of Republican voters aged under 45 considering it their duty to address the climate crisis, according to the CBS poll. Just 38% of Republicans aged over 45 feel the same.“Younger Republicans are much more convinced climate change is a crisis and are supportive of action than older Republicans – which has big implications for the future of the party,” said Leiserowitz.Around three-quarters of all respondents said they understand that climate change is melting the Arctic, raising sea levels and causing warmer summers. A further two-thirds accept that hurricanes will be made more severe by global heating. Hurricane Dorian, which recently devastated parts of the Bahamas, made 38% of Americans more concerned about the climate crisis, with 56% unswayed.Leiserowitz said that the relationship between extreme weather events and concern over climate change is a complex one, with people already worried the most likely to say that their alarm has increased when a major storm or flood hits.Regardless of concern over climate change there appears to be skepticism among Americans about how much humans can do about it. Just 19% said humans can stop rising temperatures and the associated impacts, with nearly half thinking it possible to slow but not stop the changes and 23% refusing to believe humans can do anything at all.This may well influence the views of leading presidential contenders’ climate plans. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, for example, has proposed a rapid remodeling of society where planet-warming emissions from transport and power generation are eradicated within just 11 years.“By saying we should merely slow and not reverse global warming, we are passively accepting the deaths of billions of people,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, of the Climate Mobilization Project.“The only thing that can protect us is an all-out, all-hands-on-deck mobilization, like we did during the second world war. Avoiding the collapse of civilization and restoring a safe climate should be every government’s top priority – at the national, state and local levels.”
577	4	The Australian bushfires could be just a taste of what's to come, according to scientists who claim that human-induced climate change is fuelling wildfires.The current bushfires across Australia, which have so far killed 24 people and at least a billion animals, according to estimates, will become 'normal' conditions, the scientists claim. 'The average temperature in Australia in December 2019 was exceptionally hot compared to the historical record, and played a key role in the severity and spread of the recent bushfires,' said Professor Richard Betts at the Met Office Hadley Centre.'Those temperatures would be normal at nearly 3 degrees C (5.4°F) global warming.' Professor Betts and other British and Australian scientists used an online tool to conduct a ‘rapid response review’ of 57 peer-reviewed studies on climate change. All studies showed links between climate change and increased frequency of severity of ‘fire weather’ – periods with high fire risk due to high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and high winds.Rising global temperatures, more frequent heatwaves and associated droughts in some regions increase the likelihood of wildfires by stimulating hot and dry conditions.Horses in a paddock as the Gospers Mountain Fire impacts a property at Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney‘Overall, the 57 papers reviewed clearly show human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire,’ said lead author Dr Matthew Jones at the University of East Anglia.‘This has been seen in many regions, including the western US and Canada, southern Europe, Scandinavia and Amazonia.'The 2018 fires in Sweden were about 10 per cent more likely in the current climate than in the pre-industrial climate, said the review, which has been published on the ScienceBrief online platform.In the Amazon, meanwhile, climate-driven changes in fire weather are made worse by landscape fragmentation caused by deforestation. Human-induced warming is also increasing fire risk in other regions, including Siberia and Australia.Australia’s bushfires, which have killed 27 people and scorched more than 10 million hectares of land, are still raging across parts of New South Wales and Victoria in the south west.Image on January 2, 2020, shows, a large fire burning in northeast Tasmania. The blaze is part of a network of suspicious fires near Fingal which have burned across more than 6600 hectaresThe fires had killed an estimated half a billion animals by January 4, with the number expected to continue to rise.  However, there is also evidence that humans have significant potential to control how this fire risk translates into fire activity, Dr Jones says, in particular through land management decisions and ignition sources.'Ultimately, society as a whole needs to carefully consider how it manages its relationship with fire in the “wildland-urban interface” where urban and natural areas meet,' he told MailOnline. 'Key to minimising risk is managing fuel loads in areas where humans come into close contact with increasingly fire-prone vegetation. Fire approaches the village of Nerrigundah, Australia in December. The tiny village has been among the hardest hit by Australia's devastating wildfires, about with two thirds of the homes destroyed and a 71-year-old man killedA 70-metre high wall of flames bore down in the Blue Mountains, north-west of Sydney in December'Embedding communities within forest exaggerates their risk of being horribly affected by forest fires when they do, inevitably, occur – so building further and further into forests is a bad idea.'  California also suffered from a series of wildfires last year, which burnt over 100,000 hectares of land.Fire weather seasons around the world have got longer by about 20 per cent on average, particularly in closed-canopy forest areas, the review says.A kangaroo jumps in a field amidst smoke from a bushfire in Snowy Valley on the outskirts of Cooma on January 4Fire and thick smoke covers the Australian village of Nerrigundah in New South Wales a hellish shade of redA rescuer approaches a lost looking koala to offer it some help. The government in New South Wales has dropped sweet potatoes and carrots onto forest floors to offer animals something to eat‘Wildfires can't be prevented, and the risks are increasing because of climate change,’ said Professor Iain Prentice at Imperial College London.‘This makes it urgent to consider ways of reducing the risks to people.‘Land planning should take the increasing risk in fire weather into account.’‘Fire weather does occur naturally but is becoming more severe and widespread due to climate change,’ said Professor Betts.Flames from a controlled fire burn up tree trunks as firefighters work at building a containment line at a wildfire near Bodalla, AustraliaFire burns peatland and forest inside Sebangau national park on September 14, 2019 in the outskirts of Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia 'Limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius would help avoid further increases in the risk of extreme fire weather.’Scientists aim to keep the average rise in global temperature below 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) this century, as set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.The scientists of the review are from the University of East Anglia, University of Exeter, Imperial College London, Met Office Hadley Centre – a government-backed UK research centre – and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, a department of Australia’s science research agency. The 57 peer-reviewed papers were published since the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report in 2013.ScienceBrief is a new online platform for scientists to gather and review current scientific knowledge. The amount of land in North America devastated by wildfires each year is set to rise, according to new research (file photo)The 'Thomas Fire' destroyed 281,893 acres in California in December 2017.Additionally, British Columbia's Nazko Complex Fire last year consumed more than a million acres, making it the largest ever recorded in the province.But the amount of land destroyed by wildfires each year will only go up in western and northern North America in the years to come, according to a new report published in the journal Plos One.Up to 90 percent of US wildfires are caused by people, according to the Insurance Information Institute.These fires can be initiated by unattended campfires, piles of burning debris, haphazardly discarded cigarettes or arson.The remaining tenth of wildfires not started by humans are attributed to either lighting or lava.
302	4	Some of the world’s poorest countries will be hit hardest as climate change affects marine fisheries all over the world, according to a new study.The global fishing industry produces a total catch worth of about $90bn (£71bn) but the warming ocean temperatures are causing many valuable species to shift their usual ranges.The potential for water to hit temperatures lethal to corals such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which support vast amounts of other marine life, is a particular problem.The researchers assessed 147 countries based on their vulnerability to the effect of future warming on fishing in their waters and their ability to cope with the changes.The worst-affected countries were mostly small islands, with Kiribati, Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, the Maldives and Vanuatu making up the top five, according to a paper in the journal PLOS ONE.However, large countries like China, in eighth place, Nigeria (15th) and Indonesia (26th) also featured high on the list.Ireland was predicted to be the least vulnerable country in 147th place, followed by Chile, the UK, Iceland and Namibia, with the US in sixth.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereThe five worst-affected countries were given a “vulnerability score” that was eight to nine times higher than those at the bottom of the list.Writing in the journal, the researchers warned that climate change’s effect on fisheries could harm food security, people’s livelihoods and public health – particularly in poor countries that are less able to cope.“More than 87 per cent of least developed countries are found within the top half of the vulnerability index, while the bottom half includes all but one of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states [wealthy countries],” they said.“This is primarily due to the tremendous variation in countries’ adaptive capacity, as no such trends are evident from the exposure or sensitivity indices.” And the countries that have done the least to cause climate change appear to be the ones that can expect their fisheries to be the worst affected by it.“A negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon emissions, and the clustering of states at different levels of development across the vulnerability index suggests growing barriers to meeting global commitments to reducing inequality, promoting human well-being and ensuring sustainable cities and communities,” the researchers wrote.

273	5	A majority of the public recognise the climate crisis as an “emergency” and say politicians are failing to tackle the problem, backing the interests of big oil over the wellbeing of ordinary people, according to an eight-country poll.The survey, which comes before what is expected to be the world’s biggest climate demonstrations on Friday, found that climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy, in seven out of the eight countries surveyed. In the US it comes third behind terrorism and affordable healthcare.Nick Lowles, from UK-based anti-racism group Hope not Hate, which commissioned the survey, said the findings showed that the public were “way ahead” of politicians in recognising the scale of the climate crisis. “They understand the scale of the problem and want governments to take the strong and decisive action that this emergency requires.”Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time.As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency.The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people.The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here.He said the crisis would have a huge impact on racism, division and conflict in future years unless it was tackled now.“As an organisation dedicated to bringing communities together and challenging the politics of division, we believe that our leaders must take swift action on climate change so that environmental pressures do not become a source of hostility, anger and competition in our societies.”The poll surveyed more than 1,000 people in the UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, Brazil, France, Poland and the US.It found that at least three-quarters of the public think the world is facing a “climate emergency”, with climate breakdown at risk of becoming “extremely dangerous”.The overwhelming majority in each country – 74% in Britain – said they were already seeing the influence of the climate crisis in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, and around two-thirds describe it as a direct threat to ordinary people in their country.The poll reveals widespread alarm that the crisis is on the brink of spinning out of control, with 64% in the UK agreeing with the statement “time is running out to save the planet” – the figure was 70% in Germany, 74% in Brazil and 57% in the US.It also found that few people believe their governments are doing enough – only 23% in the UK, 20% in Germany, 23% in Brazil and 26% in the US agree that ministers are taking sufficient action.The results will put pressure on world leaders gathering for the climate action summit in New York next week. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for heads of government to bring plans – not words – to address the climate emergency ahead of a 2020 deadline for countries to raise their national targets under the Paris agreement. The treaty signed in 2015 obliged governments to keep temperatures well below 2C and to strive for 1.5CThe poll found that most people called for radical measures to cut emissions – including building more wind turbines and solar panels, providing more charging points for electric cars, and investing to create jobs in clean industries.They also wanted governments to be tougher on big polluters and to force them to pay for the damage they caused, although the public are sceptical this would happen, with at least two-thirds suggesting politicians put the interests of big oil and gas corporations before those of local communities.The poll also found support for tougher measures to cut emissions, including a halt to coal mining and an end to oil and gas drilling, as well as increased taxes on frequent fliers.The findings come just a day before millions of people are expected to take to the streets for the global climate strike. Walkouts and demonstrations are expected in cities on every continent except Antarctica and adults, businesses and trade unions have been urged to join.Laurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said the findings in the poll underlined the growing support for immediate radical action.“This poll reconfirms what the growing numbers of people striking for climate action are saying: We’re worried, we know we can do more, leaders, we need you to step up and unite behind the science.”
83	4	"This century's sea level rise from climate change could be halved if nations meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C), scientists have said. Meeting this target — instead of reaching 5.4°F [3°C] of warming — might lower average global sea level rise from 9.8 inches (25 cm) down to 5.1 inches (13 cm). London-led researchers modelled the effect of melting glaciers and ice sheets on sea level rise by 2100 under various possible warming scenarios.The team found that limiting warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C) would reduce losses from the world's glaciers by 50 per cent and the Greenland ice sheet by 70 per cent.Their findings for Antarctica, however, were less clear, with present uncertainties in competing ice losses and snow gains making future predictions difficult. Meanwhile, a second set of researchers has warned that 5.4°F (3°C) of warming could end up seeing sea levels rise some 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) each year by 2100. Exceeding this tipping point, they warned, could stop us halting sea level rise for centuries — even with optimistic future advances in atmospheric carbon removal.  This century's sea level rise from climate change could be halved if nations meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2.7°F [1.5°C], scientists have said. Pictured: icebergs float down the Sermilik Fjord in south-east GreenlandThe Antarctic ice sheet is Earth's largest land-based ice reservoir.The complete melting of the just Antarctic peninsula alone could increase the global mean sea level by 9.4 inches [24 centimetres].Predicting the future of the Antarctic ice sheet is difficult at present, however, as there are still many uncertainties around the extent to which snow fall in the sheet's interior is counteracting ice loss at its edges. As a result, Dr Edwards and colleagues' modelling revealed no clear difference in the fate of the Antarctic ice sheet under the different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios they explored.'Coastal flood management must therefore be flexible enough to account for a wide range of possible sea level rise, until new observations and modelling can improve the clarity of Antarctica’s future,' Dr Edwards said.'Ahead of COP26 [the UN Climate Change Conference] this November, many nations are updating their pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement,' said climate modeller Tamsin Edwards of King's College London.'Global sea level will continue to rise, even if we halt all emissions now, but our research suggests we could limit the damage.'If pledges were far more ambitious, central predictions for [average] sea level rise from melting ice would be reduced from 25 cm [9.8 inches] to 13 cm [5.1 inches] in 2100.Furthermore, she added, there would be 'a 95 per cent chance of being less than 28 cm [9.8 inches] rather than the current upper end of 40 cm [15.7 inches].'This would mean a less severe increase in coastal flooding.'Since 1993, the melting of ice on land has been responsible for around half of global increases in sea level, with this contribution expected to grow as the world warms.(The rest of the sea level rise is largely a product of the oceans themselves as expanding as they increase in temperature.)Previous predictions of sea level rise had been based on older emissions scenarios and were limited in their ability to explore uncertainty in the models of the future because they were limited in the number of simulations they ran.In their new work, Dr Edwards and colleagues updated the climate scenarios and collected a more complete picture of the sources of melting land ice that could contribute to global sea level rise.'We used a larger and more sophisticated set of climate and ice models than ever before,' explained Dr Edwards.Her team, she added, combined 'nearly 900 simulations from 38 international groups using statistical techniques to improve our understanding of uncertainty about the future.'London-led researchers modelled the effect of melting glaciers and ice sheets on sea level rise by 2100 under various possible warming scenarios. The team found that limiting warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C) would reduce losses from the world's glaciers by 50 per cent and the Greenland ice sheet by 70 per cent. Pictured: icebergs in south-east Greenland's Sermilik FjordThe new approach still found a challenge in the Antarctic ice sheet — the land's largest ice reservoir which is believed to be melting at an increasing rate.'Antarctica is the ""wildcard"" of sea level rise: difficult to predict, and critical for the upper end of projections,' Dr Edward noted.In fact, the team's modelled revealed no clear difference in the fate of the Antarctic ice sheet under the different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios they explored.They attribute this to current uncertainties in the competing processes of ice loss at the coasts and the snowfall accumulation at the cold interior that helps to replenish the sheet's lost ice.The researchers did, however, model a worst-case scenario for Antarctica — one in which there is significantly more melting than snowfall resulting in five times the loss of ice from the sheet.'In [this] pessimistic storyline, where Antarctica is very sensitive to climate change, we found there is a 5 per cent chance of the land ice contribution to sea level rise exceeding 56 cm in 2100 even if we limit warming to 1.5°C [2.7°F],' Dr Edwards said.'Coastal flood management must therefore be flexible enough to account for a wide range of possible sea level rise — until new observations and modelling can improve the clarity of Antarctica’s future.'In the other study, climate expert Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and colleagues found that curbing warming to 3.6°F (2°C, an alternative Paris Agreement target) would maintain Antarctic ice loss (pictured) at current ratesIn the other study, climate expert Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and colleagues found that curbing warming to 3.6°F (2°C, an alternative Paris Agreement target) would maintain Antarctic ice loss at current rates.However, their modelling indicated that under a 'business-as-usual' scenario — with current levels of fossil fuel emissions leading to a 5.4°F [3°C] warming — ice loss will increase substantially from 2060.This, they warned, could trigger increases in sea level of 0.2 inches [0.5 cm] each year come 2100. After this rapid sea level rise threshold has been crossed, modelling suggested, theoretical approaches to remove CO2 from the atmosphere could only slow sea-level rise over the coming centuries, not halt it entirely.The researchers' results will be used to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment report, which is to be published later this year. The full findings of the two studies were published in the journal Nature.The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:1)  A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change3) Goverments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science"
579	4	Warming oceans have forced tens of thousands of marine species to abandon their tropical homes along the equator and relocate to cooler waters, a new study reveals.Researchers, led by the University of Auckland, found a mass exodus of nearly 50,000 species including fish, mollusks, birds and corals that have moved poleward since 1955.In other words, scientists say, species that can move are moving to escape warming surface temperatures that currently average 68F (20C).The findings show that rising temperatures are making tropical regions unbearable for native species, but these creatures are relocating to subtropical waters that are also warming.   Warming oceans have forced tens of thousands of marine species to abandon their tropical homes along the equator and relocate to cooler waters, a new study revealsThe study is just another stark warning of how climate change is impacting the creatures that also call our planet home.  Senior author Mark Costello, a professor of marine biology at the University of Auckland, told AFP: 'Global warming has been changing life in the ocean for at least 60 years.''Our findings show a drop of about 1,500 species at the equator.'This will continue throughout the century, but the pace will depend on how we reduce—or not—greenhouse gas emissions.'Researchers, led by the University of Auckland, found a mass exodus of nearly 50,000 species including fish, mollusks, birds and corals that have moved poleward since 1955The team found a total of 48,661 species have moved south over three 20-year periods up to 2015.The number of species attached to the seafloor, including corals and sponges, remained somewhat stable in the tropics between the 1970s and 2010, according to the study.However, some have been found beyond the tropics, suggesting they are also trying to escape warming waters.Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research who was not involved with the study, said: 'In geological history, this has occurred in the blink of an eye.'To see such changes occurring so rapidly is something quite alarming.''One of the big questions is `Will coral reefs as ecosystems and corals as species be able to move north or south enough fast enough to adjust to a changing climate?´The team found that poleward migration was more pronounced north of the equator, where oceans have warmed more quickly than in the southern hemisphere. David Schoeman, a professor of ecology at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, said: 'The 'missing' tropical species are likely following their thermal habitat as subtropical waters warm.'Fossil records show that the same thing happened 140,000 years ago, the last time global surface temperatures were as hot as they are now.The mass exodus is not just affecting the ecosystem, but also some 1.3 billion people living in coastal tropics who rely on these marine animals for a source of food.The latest study echoes the finds from a team at the University of Exeter (pictured) that found at least 25 percent of marine mammals are classified as threatened. The paper, published in March, also notes that 98 percent of all marine mammal species are at some level of risk in 56 percent of the ocean A recent review article in Nature estimated that the maximum catch potential of tropical fish stocks in so-called exclusive economic zones—200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from the coast—would decline 40 percent by mid-century if global warming continues unabated.Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University not involved in the study, said: 'Such changes 'can have a really huge impact on some of the most vulnerable human communities around the planet.'  The latest study echoes the finds from a team at the University of Exeter that found at least 25 percent of marine mammals are classified as threatened. The paper, published in March, also notes that 98 percent of all marine mammal species are at some level of risk in 56 percent of the ocean.Following this detailed review, researchers determined the shocking declines are a result of climate change, fisheries, pollution and other forms of human activity.On June 23, 1988, a sultry day in Washington, James Hansen told Congress and the world that global warming wasn't approaching - it had already arrived. The testimony of the top NASA scientist, said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley, was 'the opening salvo of the age of climate change.'Thirty years later, it's clear that Hansen and other doomsayers were right. But the change has been so sweeping that it is easy to lose sight of effects large and small - some obvious, others less conspicuous.FILE - In this Dec. 5, 2017 file photo, smoke rises behind a destroyed apartment complex as a wildfire burns in Ventura, Calif. In the 30 years since 1988, the number of acres burned in the U.S. by wildfires has doubled. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)Earth is noticeably hotter, the weather stormier and more extreme. Polar regions have lost billions of tons of ice; sea levels have been raised by trillions of gallons of water. Far more wildfires rage.Over 30 years - the time period climate scientists often use in their studies in order to minimize natural weather variations - the world's annual temperature has warmed nearly 1 degree (0.54 degrees Celsius), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the temperature in the United States has gone up even more - nearly 1.6 degrees.'The biggest change over the last 30 years, which is most of my life, is that we're no longer thinking just about the future,' said Kathie Dello, a climate scientist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. 'Climate change is here, it's now and it's hitting us hard from all sides.'Warming hasn't been just global, it's been all too local. According to an Associated Press statistical analysis of 30 years of weather, ice, fire, ocean, biological and other data, every single one of the 344 climate divisions in the Lower 48 states - NOAA groupings of counties with similar weather - has warmed significantly, as has each of 188 cities examined.The effects have been felt in cities from Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the yearly average temperature rose 2.9 degrees in the past 30 years, to Yakima, Washington, where the thermometer jumped a tad more. In the middle, Des Moines, Iowa, warmed by 3.3 degrees since 1988.South central Colorado, the climate division just outside Salida, has warmed 2.3 degrees on average since 1988, among the warmest divisions in the contiguous United States.When she was a little girl 30 years ago, winery marketing chief Jessica Shook used to cross country ski from her Salida doorstep in winter. It was that cold and there was that much snow. Now, she has to drive about 50 miles for snow that's not on mountain tops, she said.'T-shirt weather in January, that never used to happen when I was a child,' Shook said. When Buel Mattix bought his heating and cooling system company 15 years ago in Salida, he had maybe four air conditioning jobs a year. Now he's got a waiting list of 10 to 15 air conditioning jobs long and may not get to all of them.And then there's the effect on wildfires. Veteran Salida firefighter Mike Sugaski used to think a fire of 10,000 acres was big. Now he fights fires 10 times as large.'You kind of keep saying 'How can they get much worse?' But they do,' said Sugaski, who was riding his mountain bike on what usually are ski trails in January this year.In fact, wildfires in the United States now consume more than twice the acreage they did 30 years ago.The statistics tracking climate change since 1988 are almost numbing. North America and Europe have warmed 1.89 degrees - more than any other continent. The Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern, the land faster than the ocean. Across the United States, temperature increases were most evident at night and in summer and fall. Heat rose at a higher rate in the North than the South.Since 1988, daily heat records have been broken more than 2.3 million times at weather stations across the nation, half a million times more than cold records were broken.FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2015 file photo, a young girl wades in the water outside of Fatou Faye's home in Diamniadio Island, Saloum Delta in Senegal.

She said when the power goes out, it gets unbearable, adding: 'Be careful what you ask for.'The AP interviewed more than 50 scientists who confirmed the depth and spread of warming.Clara Deser, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that when dealing with 30-year time periods in smaller regions than continents or the globe as a whole, it would be unwise to say all the warming is man-made. Her studies show that in some places in North American local - though not most - natural weather variability could account for as much as half of warming.But when you look at the globe as a whole, especially since 1970, nearly all the warming is man-made, said Zeke Hausfather of the independent science group Berkeley Earth. Without extra carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, he said, the Earth would be slightly cooling from a weakening sun. Numerous scientific studies and government reports calculate that greenhouse gases in the big picture account for more than 90 percent of post-industrial Earth's warming.'It would take centuries to a millennium to accomplish that kind of change with natural causes. This, in that context, is a dizzying pace,' said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.Others cautioned that what might seem to be small increases in temperature should not be taken lightly.'One or two degrees may not sound like much, but raising your thermostat by just that amount will make a noticeable effect on your comfort,' said Deke Arndt, NOAA's climate monitoring chief in Asheville, North Carolina, which has warmed nearly 1.8 degrees in 30 years.Arndt said average temperatures don't tell the entire story: 'It's the extremes that these changes bring.'The nation's extreme weather - flood-inducing downpours, extended droughts, heat waves and bitter cold and snow - has doubled in 30 years, according to a federal index.Jessica Shook poses for a photo at the winery where she works in Salida, Colo., on April 30, 2018.

(AP Photo/Peter Banda)The Northeast's extreme rainfall has more than doubled. Brockton, Massachusetts, had only one day with at least four inches of rain from 1957 to 1988, but a dozen of them in the 30 years since, according to NOAA records. Ellicott City, Maryland, just had its second thousand-year flood in little less than two years.And the summer's named Atlantic storms? On average, the first one now forms nearly a month earlier than it did in 1988, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.The 14 costliest hurricanes in American history, adjusted for inflation, have hit since 1988, reflecting both growing coastal development and a span that included the most intense Atlantic storms on record.'The collective damage done by Atlantic hurricanes in 2017 was well more than half of the entire budget of our Department of Defense,' said MIT's Kerry Emanuel.Climate scientists point to the Arctic as the place where climate change is most noticeable with dramatic sea ice loss, a melting Greenland ice sheet, receding glaciers and thawing permafrost. The Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the world.FILE - In this Aug. 29, 2017 file photo, Javier (no last name given) catches a carp in the middle of Brittmoore Park Drive in west Houston after the Addicks Reservoir overflowed due to days of heavy rain after Hurricane Harvey.

(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP)Alaska has warmed 2.4 degrees annually since 1988 and 5.4 degrees in the winter. Since 1988, Utqiagvik (oot-GAR'-vik), Alaska, formerly known as Barrow, has warmed more than 6 degrees yearly and more than 9 degrees in winter.'The temperature change is noticeable. Our ground is thawing,' said Mike Aamodt, 73, the city's former acting mayor. He had to move his own cabins at least four times because of coastal erosion and thawing ground due to global warming. 'We live the climate change.'The amount of Arctic sea ice in September, when it shrinks the most, fell by nearly one third since 1988. It is disappearing 50 years faster than scientists predicted, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University.'There is a new Arctic now because the Arctic ocean is now navigable' at times in the summer, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center.The vast majority of glaciers around the world have shrunk. A NASA satellite that measures shifts in gravity calculated that Earth's glaciers lost 279 billion tons of ice - nearly 67 trillion gallons of water - from 2002 to 2017. In 1986, the Begich Boggs visitor center at Alaska's Chugach National Forest opened to highlight the Portage glacier. But the glacier keeps shrinking.FILE - In this July 21, 2017 file photo, researchers look out from the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica as the sun sets over sea ice in the Victoria Strait along the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File)'You absolutely cannot see it from the visitor center and you haven't in the last 15 or so years,' said climatologist Brian Brettschneider of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica have also have shriveled, melting about 455 billion tons of ice into water, according to the NASA satellite. That's enough water to cover the state of Georgia in water nearly 9 feet deep.And it is enough - coupled with all the other melting ice - to raise the level of the seas. Overall, NASA satellites have shown three inches of sea level rise (75 millimeters) in just the past 25 years.With more than 70 percent of the Earth is covered by oceans, a 3-inch increase means about 6,500 cubic miles (27,150 cubic km) of extra water. That's enough to cover the entire United States with water about 9 feet deep.It's a fitting metaphor for climate change, say scientists: We're in deep, and getting deeper.'Thirty years ago, we may have seen this coming as a train in the distance,' NOAA's Arndt said. 'The train is in our living room now.'
229	3	“LABELLING BASED on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric,” said Hester Peirce, a straight-talking commissioner at America’s main financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in June. She was taking aim at the scoring systems that purport to assess firms’ performance based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Yet love them or hate them, ESG scores are becoming ever more important in the world of investing and capital markets. At least $3trn of institutional assets now track ESG scores, and the share is rising quickly.In America and Europe some politicians, bosses and investors want to shift away from measuring corporate performance based mainly on shareholder returns. Climate change is another catalyst. Christine Lagarde, the new head of the European Central Bank, thinks the institution should consider using monetary policy and bank supervision to fight climate change—a shift that would involve assessing which firms are dirtier than others. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has championed better disclosures by firms on climate change. Chris Hohn, the head of TCI, a London-based hedge fund famous for its hard-headed approach, has outlined plans to vote against the directors of companies that fail to reveal their carbon emissions.All this is fuelling demand for ESG ratings, which create a single score from disparate non-financial indicators, such as a firm’s carbon emissions or the share of its board members who are female. Using teams of analysts, whizzy software and data from companies, ratings firms collect ESG information and convert it into a single score. Some customers of ESG ratings are seeking to gain an investment edge; others want their money to benefit society as well as themselves. But as Ms Peirce’s criticisms suggest, the ratings are not yet ready for the weight they are being asked to bear.The most obvious sign of this is that, unlike credit ratings, ESG scores are poorly correlated with each other. ESG-rating firms disagree about which companies are good or bad. The Economist has compared the scores of two big ESG-rating systems, updating an analysis done by the IMF earlier this year (see chart). It shows at best a loose link between the two measurement systems. The same lack of correlation holds even when the E, S and G scores are considered separately, according to the IMF. Small wonder, then, that it found no consistent difference between the performance of ESG funds and that of conventional ones.Moreover, ratings are often based on business models rather than businesses themselves. It does not matter what firms are selling, as long as it is done sustainably. Tobacco and alcohol companies feature near the top of many ESG rankings. And many funds marketed on their green credentials invest in Big Oil.The scoring systems sometimes measure the wrong things and rely on patchy, out-of-date figures. Only half the 1,700-odd companies in the MSCI world index reveal their carbon emissions. Some ratings penalise non-disclosure—with strange results. In FTSE Russell’s ESG rating Tesla, an electric-vehicle maker, does worse than firms that make gas-guzzlers. (FTSE Russell says it rates the sustainability of a firm’s output with another score.) And because bigger firms are better able to afford disclosure, they tend to get better ESG scores. ESG raters say they are tweaking their methods to remove such biases. But even when figures are disclosed, they may be too out-of-date to be useful.One hope is that the boom raises standards. Bigger firms are getting involved, which could help. On November 21st S&P Global, a credit-rating agency, bought the ESG ratings arm of RobecoSAM, an asset manager. Moody’s, a competitor, purchased Vigeo Eiris, an ESG data outfit, in April. In 2017 Morningstar, a research firm, acquired a 40% stake in Sustainalytics, another ESG rater. MSCI, an index provider, has been building up its ESG-scoring expertise. Simon MacMahon of Sustainalytics expects scoring systems to converge over time. The definition of ESG is so broad, he says, that raters may be trying to capture different things.For now investors who use ESG indices often look past the headline scores—and even, in some cases, create their own ESG ratings. Issues that they find particularly relevant, such as the flood risks faced by an insurer’s corporate clients, may be buried because ESG ratings average many disparate data points, says Jessica Alsford of Morgan Stanley, a bank.If ESG data do eventually become more accurate and consistent it will become harder for bosses and fund managers to engage in “greenwashing”—massaging indicators without truly changing hue. And investors will be able to pursue more varied and sophisticated ESG targets, says Maria Elena Drew of T. Rowe Price, an asset manager. Big insurers, for example, which are heavily exposed to extreme weather events, will be able to invest their capital in a way that hedges against climate risks. But for now the ESG rating industry is still in its infancy and Ms Peirce’s criticisms, though blunt, ring true.■Sign up to our new fortnightly climate-change newsletter here
804	4	"But today, as she looks to move again with her husband, her requirements have changed.   ""It is profoundly a different wish list. A place where we have [running] water, where we are not... having bags packed in case fires evacuate us,"" said Nichols. In the last few years, Nichols says the California wildfires and poor air quality make living there unappealing -- and downright scary. But she says nearly everyplace she looks to move to is experiencing some element of climate risk. And a new analysis by Redfin, a real estate brokerage, reveals more Americans are moving into areas that face the highest climate risks than ever before.   Redfin analyzed data from ClimateCheck, a real estate climate risk assessment provider, and the US Census, which showed that of the top 50 US counties facing climate risks in heat, storms, drought, flood and fire -- the majority saw an increase in population over the last five years. Counties with homes facing the highest heat risk saw populations increase by an average of 4.7% over the last five years. Counties with homes facing high drought risk saw population growth of 3.5%, fire risk counties grew by 3%, flood 1.9%, and storm 0.4% over the last five years. Meanwhile, places with relatively low climate risks have experienced population declines. The 50 counties with the lowest number of homes facing heat risk, for example, saw a population loss of 1.4% in the last five years, according to Redfin. Counties around New York City and Chicago -- both in states that were already leading the US in population decline -- only lost more people during the pandemic when homebuyers left metro areas in exodus, according to Redfin. ""Counterintuitively, people are moving to places with higher climate risk,"" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. ""And it seems like climate, although it's something that people care about, is at the bottom of the list or it's not the top priority."" For example, migration to Wasatch County, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City, is up almost 15% in the last five years. But Wasatch County has the third-highest fire risk in the US, with 96% of the homes there at risk, according to Redfin. The area became even more popular in the last year amid the pandemic, with people looking for affordability, more space and proximity to the outdoors. ""2020 saw some of the worst wildfires we've ever seen in Utah,"" said Ryan Aycock, agent and market manager for Redfin in Salt Lake City. ""I don't necessarily believe that it's going to slow down the people moving into the area. It's still extremely affordable. It's still a very desirable place to live compared to a lot of places."" Affordability appears to be a big factor. Of the 50 counties with the largest share of homes facing high heat and storm risk, more than half had a median sale price below the national average of $315,000, Redfin found.'Nothing will deter them'  Williamson County, Texas -- part of the Austin metro area -- has the highest heat risk in the US, yet it's the county with the biggest growth in population, at 16.3% since 2016, according to Redfin. ""People live in San Francisco or New York for the most part because it's where they are able to advance their careers the most, but now Austin is starting to rise as a tech hub and Austin has climate risk,"" said Fairweather. It's also where people are buying their second homes -- followed by Florida, where homebuyers are taking advantage of lower taxes, said Scott Durkin, CEO of Douglas Elliman.""I think people continue to put [climate risk] in the back of their minds. I think there are people that will do anything to be on the ocean and the coast of Florida and nothing, nothing will deter them,"" said Durkin.That's despite a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season last year. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a 60% chance of an above-normal hurricane season again this year, with Florida often a target. Still, home sales in Palm Beach and Miami, are up 270% and 133%, respectively, since last year, according to Douglas Elliman.   During the pandemic-fueled red-hot housing market, many buyers waived home inspections to beat out other buyers, according to Durkin. However, in climate temperate areas, Durkin advises against that. ""If you've got something that has the elements of the strong weather or... subject to heavy winds and waves breaking and beach erosion, you have to really think twice. You may want to get the inspection on the way in before you even negotiate, just so you know for yourself,"" said Durkin. As for Nichols, she wants to be out of her Los Angeles home in a matter of months. ""It's no longer a question of, 'Where do we want to live?' The question has become, 'Where can we live in relationship to what's happening there climate wise?'"" said Nichols. "
584	4	"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has donated hundreds of millions to green charities. Photo / APAmazon founder is donating US$791 million to green charities but it will take more than money to help the planet.         If you had a billion dollars and wanted to do something about climate change, what         would you do? For a handful of people, that is not a rhetorical question. An Instagram post earlier this month from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — announcing he had scattered US$791 million ($1.12 billion) across various climate charities — is the latest in a trend that includes Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. And there's more on the way — Bezos's donations are ""just the beginning"" of his US$10 billion Bezos Earth Fund.        But the interesting thing about this exercise is that, even for the most privileged minds on the planet, it is not obvious how to approach the task. Is it better to invest in technologies that may take years to mature — or to spend money on clean energy in developing countries, which can cut pollution immediately? Or perhaps political spending is the most effective approach, to push policy in a climate-friendly direction? Or would you just start building sea walls to prepare for the inevitable?Each billionaire takes their own tack. Gates has gone down the technology route, backing projects that range from nuclear fusion to molten-salt batteries. He has also invested his time in writing and talking about the subject, and has a book on climate change coming out next year. Bloomberg has focused on the political side, including spending more than US$170 million ($242 million) on a campaign to close coal-fired power plants; its success is part of the reason US carbon emissions have fallen in recent years.Bezos is the most recent arrival to this club and his approach has also been the blandest. He cut five cheques of US$100m to five of the biggest, most established green groups in the US and distributed smaller amounts to a few others, including U$30 million for research into storing carbon in plant roots.It's a nice gesture, but it feels like exactly that — the sort of cheque-writing exercise that middle-class Americans usually save for the end of the year to maximise tax deductions. For Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, routinely celebrated as one of the most disruptive innovators on earth, his climate donations are distinctly lacking in either disruption or innovation.Recent events at Amazon make Bezos's giving look a bit defensive. In September 2019, employees began staging walkouts to protest the company's climate policies, creating a major image problem. Some of the employees' demands have been met — Amazon adopted a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.It is also buying tens of thousands of electric vehicles and promises that half of its shipping operations will be carbon-free by the end of this decade. And the company has purchased naming rights to a Seattle sports stadium and called it — in case you missed the point — the Climate Pledge Arena.But none of this quite masks the fact that Amazon has been much slower to act on climate than other tech rivals such as Google and Microsoft. Its carbon emissions are still vast: in 2019, Amazon emitted 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (including its offices, warehouses and delivery vehicles). That's more than the country of Sweden.Matthew Nisbet, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who studies this area, says Bezos is now the largest single source of climate giving in the world — creating a ""giant climate change halo"". But that halo is not always merited, he says: such large gifts could pose a conflict of interest for environmental charities, which might otherwise be more critical of Amazon's environmental record. (The recipients of Bezos's grants all deny this, saying they have strict policies to avoid any conflict of interest.) Even if Bezos is not trying to buy off his critics or placate his employees, there is one clear shortcoming in his approach: he has thrown money at the problem, but hasn't apparently matched that with strategy. Nor has he spoken or written much about the issue — at least not when compared with other climate billionaires.Contrast his recent 160-word Instagram post with the thousands of words written by Gates. Likewise, Bloomberg is highly invested in his climate work — and can be seen trudging around the UN climate conferences every year, giving slightly jet-lagged speeches.Indeed, looking back at Bezos's speeches and interviews in recent years, there are hints that the Amazon boss's real passion is for something else entirely — getting off this planet altogether. A lifelong space obsessive, he invests about $1bn a year in his space company, Blue Origin, and has described it as the ""most important work I'm doing"".His vision is that humans will one day inhabit space, living in big orbiting colonies. ""We will have to leave this planet,"" he has said, pointing to our growing population. His idea is that heavy industry will also move into space, leaving some light manufacturing behind on Earth — along with any humans who want to stay. But Bezos himself hopes to be on that rocket ship. Despite the grand ambitions of the Bezos Earth Fund, would you really trust the planet to someone who is already thinking of leaving it behind?Written by: Leslie Hook© Financial Times"
713	4	BRUSSELS — In what may be a seminal moment in the global effort to fight climate change, Europe on Wednesday challenged the rest of the world by laying out an ambitious blueprint to pivot away from fossil fuels over the next nine years, a plan that also has the potential to set off global trade disputes.The most radical, and possibly contentious, proposal would impose tariffs on certain imports from countries with less stringent climate-protection rules. The proposals also include eliminating the sales of new gas- and diesel-powered cars in just 14 years, and raising the price of using fossil fuels.“Our current fossil fuel economy has reached its limit,” the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said at a news conference in Brussels.The effort, pushed by the European Commission, the E.U.’s bureaucracy, makes the 27-country bloc’s proposal the most aggressive and detailed plan in the world to reach a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, proposing big changes during this decade. To force the issue, Brussels has committed in law to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases 55 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.The negotiations over the legislative package will be closely scrutinized well beyond Europe as a glimpse into whether and how a diverse set of countries, with democratically elected leaders from across the political spectrum, can pivot an economy away from fossil fuels — and provide cushions for those most affected.The European proposal, which some environmental activists say still does not go far enough, raises the bar for the United States and China. President Biden has said that he wants the United States to be a leader in efforts to address climate change.A White House official said on Wednesday afternoon that it was reviewing the European Commission’s proposals and broadly welcomed the idea of a carbon border tax. Congressional Democrats took a preliminary step on Wednesday toward a similar tax, which they called a “polluter import fee” also intended to reduce emissions.  The United States has promised to reduce emissions 40 to 43 percent by 2030. Scientists have said the world needs to halve emissions by then, which would require history’s biggest polluters, namely the United States and Europe, to make the sharpest, swiftest cuts.Britain, which will host COP-26, the international climate talks, in Glasgow in November, has pledged a 68 percent reduction. China, currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon, has said that it aims for emissions to peak by 2030, and it is under pressure to set a more ambitious target before the Glasgow talks.China announced it would launch on Friday a long-awaited national carbon market, which once implemented would be the world’s largest by volume of emissions. Under the plan, power companies would be allotted a fixed quota of carbon emissions each year, which they could buy and sell depending on their needs.The detailed proposals from the European Union mark only the start of what promises to be a difficult and bruising two-year negotiation among industry, 27 countries and the European Parliament on how to reach the 55 percent reduction.But coming before the talks in Glasgow, the proposals represent an effort by the European Union to assert global leadership in what must be a multilateral effort to reduce global emissions sufficiently to avert the worst effects of climate change.“The E.U.’s policy package for stabilizing our climate is the most comprehensive of its kind to date,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Weather extremes around the world clearly illustrate that strong action is key now if we want to limit costs and risks, and secure a safe future for all.”At the heart of the European road map is increased prices for carbon. Nearly every sector of the economy would have to pay a price for the emissions it produces, affecting things like the cement used in construction and the fuel used by cruise ships. Proposed taxes on imports of goods made outside the European Union, in countries with less stringent climate policies, could potentially invite disputes at the World Trade Organization.There are geopolitical implications. The cross-border carbon tax proposal could have the greatest impact on goods from Russia and Turkey, mainly iron, steel and aluminum, according to data analyzed by the Centre for European Reform. The impact on U.S. exports to Europe would be far smaller, according to the analysis.The proposals, if passed, would see the last gasoline or diesel cars sold in the European Union by 2035; require that 38.5 percent of all energy be from renewables by 2030; increase the price charged for carbon emitted to make the use of fossil fuels increasingly expensive; and financially assist those most affected by potential price increases.The carbon border tax could not only shake up global trade and invite disputes over protectionism, but it could also create new diplomatic fault lines ahead of the Glasgow talks.The gathering is an important moment for big polluting nations to show what they will do to address the emissions of greenhouse gases that have set the world on a path to dangerous warming. All eyes are on targets set by the United States and China, which currently produce the largest share of greenhouse gases.Although the European Union produces only about 8 percent of current global carbon emissions, its cumulative emissions since the start of the industrial age are among the world’s highest. But as a huge market, it also sees itself as an important regulatory power for the world and hopes to set an example, invent new technologies that it can sell, and provide new global standards that can lead to a carbon-neutral economy.“Europe was the first continent to declare to be climate neutral in 2050, and now we are the very first ones to put a concrete road map on the table,” Ms. von der Leyen said.Some analysts said that while the carbon border tax would impose new tariffs on imports, the proposals did not do enough to help developing countries shift their economies away from fossil fuels. Others said that the proposed tax on jet fuel applies only to flights inside the European Union, and leaves 60 percent of fuel sales exempt.Andrew Murphy, aviation director at the advocacy group Transport & Environment, said that “by not removing the tax exemption for flights outside of the E.U. it still lets the majority off the hook.”The Commission’s executive vice president, Frans Timmermans, who is in charge of the environment and Europe’s “Green Deal,” admits the difficulty of the challenge. “We’re going to ask a lot of our citizens,” he said. “We’re also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.”The E.U. goal of 55 percent, increased by law in June from 40 percent, has prompted significant pushback from industry, lobbying groups and some member countries, especially in poorer Central Europe, that have been more traditionally reliant on fossil fuels. So the Commission has tried to build in gradual markers for industry, including free carbon credits for a decade and many millions of euros in financial aid.One of the key proposals announced on Wednesday is a revision of Europe’s carbon market, known as the Emissions Trading Scheme, under which major carbon producers like steel, cement and power industries pay directly for their carbon emissions.The hundreds of pages of proposed laws — which the Commission has called “Fit for 55,” a slogan that some have joked would better suit a yoga studio — will be sharply debated and inevitably amended before becoming binding on the 27-member bloc.There are concerns that the poor will pay an inequitable share of the cost of decarbonization and that it will be seen as an elite project, prompting more political backlash from populist parties and groups, like the 2018 “yellow vest” protests over a climate-related increase in French gasoline prices.That was a warning echoed by Pascal Canfin, the French head of the Parliament’s environment committee, who cautioned that extending the carbon market to heating and fuel could set off protests. “We experienced it in France,” he said. “It gave us the yellow vests.”But the proposals also include a Social Climate Fund, raised from these new taxes, that could provide up to 70 billion euros (about $83 billion) to help governments help the people who are most affected.The European Union is “the first large economy in the world to start translating climate neutrality ambition into real-world policy action,” said Simone Tagliapietra of Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank. “But if there is one principle that should be guiding the negotiations over the next two years, this certainly is the principle of climate justice.”Mr. Timmermans said that “the onus is on the Commission to prove that this leads to solidarity and to fairness in this transition.”He added: “If we can prove that, I think the resistance will be less. If we fail to prove that, I think the resistance will be massive.”Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Somini Sengupta from New York.

739	4	A collection of leading health and medical journals called this week for swift action to combat climate change, calling on governments to cooperate and invest in the environmental crisis with the degree of funding and urgency they used to confront the coronavirus pandemic.In an editorial published in more than 200 medical and health journals worldwide, the authors declared a 1.5-degree-Celsius rise in global temperatures the “greatest threat to global public health.” The world is on track to warm by around 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100, based on current policies.“The science is unequivocal; a global increase of 1.5°C above the preindustrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse,” the authors wrote. “Indeed, no temperature rise is ‘safe.’”Although medical journals have copublished editorials in the past, this marked the first time that publication has been coordinated at this scale. In total more than 200 journals representing every continent and a wide range of medical and health disciplines from ophthalmology to veterinary medicine published the statement. The authors are editors of leading journals including The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.In the editorial, they raised concerns not only about the direct health consequences of rising temperatures, including heat-related mortality, pregnancy complications and cardiovascular disease, but also the indirect costs, including the effects that soil depletion could have on malnutrition and the possibility that widespread destruction of habitats could increase the likelihood of future pandemics.The editorial urged wealthy countries to go beyond their targets and commit to emissions reductions that are commensurate with their cumulative, historic emissions. It also called on them to go beyond their stated goals of $100 billion for climate resiliency plans in developing nations, including funding for improving health systems.“While low and middle income countries have historically contributed less to climate change, they bear an inordinate burden of the adverse effects, including on health,” said Dr. Lukoye Atwoli, the editor in chief of the East African Medical Journal and one of the co-authors of the editorial, in a statement. “We therefore call for equitable contributions whereby the world’s wealthier countries do more to offset the impact of their actions on the climate.”Sue Turale, the editor in chief of the International Nursing Review and a co-author of the editorial, said in a statement, “As our planet faces disasters from climate change and rising global temperature, health professionals everywhere have a moral responsibility to act to avoid this.”The publication comes ahead of a busy few months of climate and environmental conferences. The U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to meet this month in New York City, the U.N.’s biodiversity summit will meet in October in Kunming, China, and the U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP, in Glasgow in November.A growing body of research has shown that extreme weather events worsened by climate change are contributing to a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Earlier this year a study found that around a third of heat-related deaths worldwide could be attributed to the extra warming associated with climate change. And this summer, hundreds of Americans have died in extreme weather events, including more than 600 during the weeklong record-breaking heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that climate scientists say would have been “virtually impossible without climate change.”

117	3	The wings of the nightingale — famed for its beautiful birdsong — are shrinking in response to climate change, a study has found.This change will make its long migrations to Africa more arduous and threaten its very survival, scientists have warned.Male nightingales, in particular, are known to sing for hours on end each night during the breeding season.However, this song may become harder to hear, with nightingale numbers having fallen dramatically over recent decades largely due to global warming.Scroll down for videoThe wings of the nightingale — famed for its beautiful birdsong — are shrinking in response to climate change , a study has found. This change will make its long migrations to Africa more arduous and threaten its very survival, scientists have warnedThe nightingale breeds in Europe and parts of Asia, migrating to sub-Saharan Africa every winter.In the UK alone, nightingale populations have fallen by 90 per cent in the last 50 years — with numbers of singing males now down to only around 5,000.Various factors have been blamed for the decline, including browsing deer that are eating them 'out of house and home' and development of the birds' former nesting grounds.Other reasons include less coppicing — the cutting back of trees to stimulate growth — and changes to nightingale wintering grounds.Now, a study has found that warmer temperatures have made their wings get smaller — a trend that has also been seen in other bird species.'There is much evidence that climate change is having an effect on migratory birds, changing their arrival and laying dates and their physical features over the last few decades,' said zoologist Carolina Remacha of the Complutense University of MadridFrom an analysis of twenty years of data on the birds, her team found that natural selection driven by climate change is causing the nightingale to evolve shorter wings, which could make them less likely to survive their annual migration.A comparison of wing shape variation and survival in two populations of nightingales from central Spain found the bird's average wing length has decreased relative to its body size.Shorter-winged birds were less likely to return to their breeding grounds after their first round-trip to Africa.Male nightingales, in particular, are known to sing for hours on end each night during the breeding season. However, this song may become harder to hear, with nightingale numbers having fallen dramatically over recent decades largely due to global warmingThe researchers linked changes in wing length and reduced survival to a phenomenon known as the 'migratory gene package'.This predicts adaptations related to migration — including a long wingspan, higher resting metabolic rate, larger clutch size and shorter lifespan.These are controlled by a set of connected genes, so selective pressures on one trait also affect the others.In recent decades, the timing of spring has shifted in central Spain and summer droughts have become longer and more intense.This has left nightingales with a shorter window in which to raise their young.This means the most successful birds may be those that lay smaller clutches of eggs — giving them fewer young to care for.If natural selection is favouring smaller clutches, it may simultaneously push nightingales away from all of the linked traits in the 'migratory gene package.'Evolving smaller clutch sizes and inadvertently also gaining shorter wings and, therefore, a reduced chance survival is an example of what experts call 'maladaptation' Evolving smaller clutch sizes and inadvertently also gaining shorter wings and, therefore, a reduced chance survival is an example of what experts call 'maladaptation'.This is where organisms' responses to changing conditions end up being harmful instead of helpful.'If we are to fully understand how bird populations adapt to new environments in order to help them tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is important to call attention to the potential problems of maladaptive change,' Dr Remacha said.Scientists have long known that individuals from a given animal species tend to be smaller in warmer parts of their habitat.However, only recently was it conclusively determined that climate change was also triggering shrinking body sizes, with a US team reporting in December that migratory birds in North America have shrunk over the last 40 years.The discovery was based on an analysis of more than 70,000 migratory song birds that had been collected after fatal building strikes in Chicago and Michigan.Slightly larger than a robin, nightingales were first noted in Anglo Saxon times though fossilised remains date them back to as long as 100,000 years ago.The full findings of the study were published in the journal The Auk: Ornithological Advances.A recent study in Canada found that over the last century, the beetles in the region have shrunk.By looking at eight species of beetle and measuring the animals from past and present they found that some beetles were adapting to a reduced body size.The data also showed that the larger beetles were shrinking, but the smaller ones were not. Around 50 million years ago the Earth warmed by three degrees Celsius (5.4°F) and as a result, animal species at the time shrunk by 14 per cent. Another warming event around 55 million years ago - called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) - warmed the earth by up to eight degrees Celsius (14.4°F).In this instance, animal species of the time shrunk by up to a third. Woolly mammoths were a victim of warming climate, shrinking habitat and increased hunting from a growing early-human population which drove them to extinction - along with many large animalsShrinking in body size is seen from several global warming events.With the global temperatures set to continue to rise, it is expected the average size of most animals will decrease. As well as global warming, the world has seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of large animals. So called 'megafauna' are large animals that go extinct. With long life-spans and relatively small population numbers, they are less able to adapt to rapid change as smaller animals that reproduce more often.
349	0	Human society under urgent threat from loss of Earth’s natural life.’ ‘The planet has seen sudden warming before, it wiped out almost everything.’These are some of the headlines that bombard us at ever-increasing rates.Each day new reports and household names such as David Attenborough warn of “irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies”. The United Nations says we have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe. We are also amidst the world’s sixth mass extinction, the worst since the time of the dinosaurs.This reality is taking its toll on our mental health, especially among younger people who are understandably losing hope for their futures on a hotter planet. We are seeing the rise of what is known as climate or ecological grief. This grief summarises feelings of loss, anger, hopelessness, despair and distress caused by climate change and ecological decline.We are facing a state of continual unfolding loss, compounding impacts on our psyches. It could be loss of animals and plants we hold dear or lifestyles we have grown accustomed to such as eating whatever we want whenever we want. As the time length between loss and impacts shorten, personal recovery times reduce. At the same time there is anxiety about what is still to come.Yet there is no way to do justice to the threats we face without it being scary and provoking anxiety. How do we face up to these warnings without falling into apathy, denial or being evangelically optimistic? How do we find a way to confront our climate and ecological reality and yet respond in a meaningful, purposeful way?Former UN climate chief Cristiana Figueres has argued the only way we can save the planet is with relentless, stubborn optimism. This is the kind of attitude that many of us are culturally trained to adopt, to keep looking on the bright side and remain hopeful.Climate change and environmental movements have long been criticised for trying to motivate the population through negative narratives and doomsday scenarios. It is obvious how such framings can turn people off or at worse encourages a state of denial. As a result, we have seen much of the movement shift in recent years towards more positive narratives of climate hope and telling stories of change.People also need agency to act to avoid feelings of apathy and hopelessness.Acknowledging this, the last decade has seen a focus on what the individual can do to tackle climate change in their own life. This has largely resulted in a politically passive eco-modern citizen that is more concerned with energy-efficient technologies, light bulbs and recycling than dissent, protest and structural change. Personal guilt comes to the fore when the virtuous lists and sustainable resolutions are not kept up with, and the issue is again pushed out of mind.What is less encouraged is to make space for sorrow and grieving for losses already occurring at a rapid rate in the natural world.Eco-psychologist Joanna Macy teaches useful frameworks for facing up to disturbing realities and finding capacity for action. First there is the gratitude stage, which focuses our attention on those aspects of life and the world that nourish us. Then there is a stage that honours the pain that we are experiencing. The third and fourth stages relate to exploring new possibilities and finding practical actions to take.The second stage of “honouring the pain” is one that is often skipped over, as we naturally seek to protect ourselves from negative feelings. But making space for grief can help us confront the reality we face head on, and instead of just looking on the bright side, find a way to move forward.It would seem that more of us are starting to acknowledge and accept our climate grief. By doing so we create new ways of connecting to one another, to mourn for what we all love and are losing day by day.Having studied and worked on climate change professionally for over 15 years now, I have increasingly noticed this grief emerge within myself.I have noticed that my own self-defences are starting to show cracks. More accurately, my intellectual and rational understanding of climate change has shifted to much more of an emotional and personal one.There have been several instances lately where the impacts of climate change have hit me hard and unexpectedly. Perhaps this is because I am now a father or because scientific projections I learned about 15 years ago are now unfolding quicker than imagined.I am not alone. I have had numerous conversations where colleagues have broken down about the losses unfolding, whether it’s the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, the fire ravaged forests of Tasmania, the fish deaths in the Murray, or more localised impacts.In March I went to my local train station to watch 500 schoolkids gather to commute to Melbourne for the big school strike. I was surprised that I found myself moved to tears and overcome with emotion, and that I wasn’t alone among the other adults there.Last month I found myself crying when a platypus appeared in the creek down from our house. Standing on the bridge with my two young boys we watched it swim in a creek that has been tirelessly regenerated by the local friends group over at least 15 years. A creek, which for the past 150 years, flowed through a highly degraded landscape decimated by goldmining and agriculture.What I find curious is that both these instances were essentially positive, inspiring moments. Yet they seemed to bring forth sadness or internalised grief that had been buried out of sight. But they provoked a different kind of hope, a hope stemming from witnessing the power of activated groups.There are many reasons to feel that we are at a critical turning point. A turning point where we can create a positive vision for the future and are engaged in shaping it, rather than feeling disempowered and watching as an inevitable future of loss unfolds.We are seeing a dramatic rise of nonviolent protest movements around the world such as the Extinction Rebellion, the New Green Deal in the US and the School Strike movement led by the dynamic Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. Such movements are healthy as they give us an awakened sense of agency that goes beyond personal guilt for our own carbon intensive vices.More and more institutions are adopting climate emergency language. The UK and 446 local governments across the world have now declared a climate emergency. This is the ripple effect in action, the result of several local councils in Australia moving first.US climate activist Bill McKibben argues that the most important thing one can do to tackle the climate crisis is stop being an individual and to take action together.But to truly tackle the climate and extinction crisis we also need to give ourselves permission to grieve, personally and collectively. We can use grief to galvanise what is most important and bring forth new visions.Then we need to be empowered, to be fearless and take action. One of the most important ways to take action is to vote for what matters most and to vote for parties which have clear policies to address climate change.For Australians we have that chance on 18 May.Rob has worked on climate change for more than a decade for government, universities and not-for-profit organisations
718	4	"The Climate Change Commission has released its draft plan on what New Zealand needs to do to meet its emissions obligations - and it includes some drastic cuts. Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - GettyRNZThe first official report from the Climate Change Commission has found the government needs to further reduce emissions to meet its obligations under the Paris Agreement.The just-released report sets three new targets: a 2 percent reduction on 2018 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, 17 percent by 2030, and 36 percent by 2035.Commission chair Dr Rod Carr said the advice is ambitious but realistic and makes a clear case to government for taking immediate and decisive action on climate change.""As a country we need transformational and lasting change to meet our targets and ensure a thriving Aotearoa for future generations.""The good news is that our analysis shows there are technically achievable, economically affordable and socially acceptable paths for Aotearoa to take,"" he said in a statement.But Dr Carr said the government needed to move faster, and to support business, the agriculture sector and the community to do the same. ""There are a few actions that are critical to meeting our targets: electric vehicles, accelerated renewable energy generation, climate-friendly farming practices and more permanent forests, predominantly natives,"" he said.Climate Change Minister James Shaw said the release of the draft advice was a significant milestone in the Government's response to the climate emergency.""There are two things that stand out from the draft advice - first, that action will be required across all sectors of the economy, and second that meeting our targets is affordable and possible with existing technology,"" he said in a statement.Shaw said a series of Cabinet-level decisions will need to be made about how to reach net-zero carbon emissions and reduce biogenic methane.""But when I look at the strategic policy direction the Commission has set out, I am more confident than I have ever been that it can be done.""Shaw said acting now will allow New Zealand to set an example to the rest of the world in terms of how to make a transition to a net-zero carbon economy.""I look forward to hearing what people have to say in response to the draft advice and then working with my colleagues across Government to build a low carbon future for Aotearoa,"" he said.The commission's advice includes:The draft advice is now open for consultation until 14 March and final advice will be released before 31 May.The Government has pledged to release an Emissions Reduction Plan before the end of the year after receiving the final advice, which will set out how the first three emissions budgets will be achieved."
150	5	OPINION: Warm, dry, healthy homes are better for the people they shelter. There’s fresh air and it’s easy to keep warm in winter (or cool, in summer), without using lots of greenhouse-gas emitting energy. Those homes are better for the environment too, because they can be built with far less embodied carbon (think less concrete and steel; more timber). We already have the knowledge and technology to build houses that use radically less energy to heat and cool - 90 per cent less. With climate change driving more, and more intense weather events, we need to plan for heatwaves as well as plunging winter temperatures. We can look across the ditch to see what happens when air-conditioning loads cause power consumption spikes during heatwaves. It’s not just homes. Around the world, there are public and commercial buildings built to the Passive House standard that maintain comfortable indoor temperatures year-round with a fraction of the energy required by modern buildings in New Zealand. There are schools and kindergartens, fire stations, office and apartment blocks, shopping malls and hospitals. Building better new buildings and fixing those that already exist is an essential part of meeting New Zealand’s carbon emission targets. It’s also one of the few pathways that is actually profitable. It’s not difficult and it doesn’t rely on fixes that doesn’t yet exist (unlike cows that don’t burp methane). READ MORE: * Real estate responsible for 40 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions: Report * The New Zealand Green Building Council calls for new buildings to be rid of gas and coal  * First Kiwi passive house: Seventh winter without heaters  Here’s a roadmap for how to use Government stimulus spending to create healthier, higher quality, more durable buildings. We need a blend of policy decisions, industry partnership, setting an example with public buildings, incentivising developers and investing in training. The first basic and essential step is fixing the Building Code. Government should commit to raising the minimum standards for new buildings in achievable steps over time, thereby clearly signalling to industry what they need to work towards. As part of this, simplify the heating performance metric so that buildings can be easily compared. Further, give councils the legislative power to require or incentivise buildings above Code minimums (which are typically seen as a performance target rather than the reality that they set the standard for the worst house you can legally build). Second, Government should commit to demonstrating what is possible by substantially raising the bar with new public buildings. This should especially apply to social housing, which, thanks to a small line in the Healthy Homes Standards, may be cheaper to build to a certified Passive House standard compared to the Code minimum. This is because fixed heating units, for example heat pumps, would not be required as houses would stay warm enough without them. In a multi-story apartment block, hundreds of heat pumps are a considerable expense. It is often cheaper to achieve higher performance levels in larger buildings, whether apartment or office blocks or other commercial or public buildings, compared to single-family homes. That’s possible because critical mass was reached in two areas. First, designers and developers can choose from readily available, high-performance building components at a range of price points. Second, those industry professionals have upskilled and know how to design, specify and construct high-quality, high-performance buildings that are a pleasure to learn, work, shop or live in. The Government can hasten those tipping points by investing in industry-led training programmes that improve the skills of architects and designers, quantity surveyors, engineers and builders; and encouraging local manufacturers to retool and expand, so they can produce world-class building components right here in New Zealand. Currently, many of the high-performance doors, windows, building wraps and heat recovery ventilation systems are imported. That adds delay, risk and cost to building projects and it unnecessary. We can do it ourselves. This roadmap has been proven. Brussels, capital of Belgium and the EU, until recently had the dubious distinction of some of the worst buildings in Europe. It’s now world leading. It’s done that by providing seed funding, involving industry and demonstrating the value and feasibility of high-performance buildings. Passive House got backed early on because of its commitment to modelling energy use design stage, using a software package called PHPP. That’s crucial, because it gives designers, contractors and owners certainty about what will be delivered. And if there’s a performance gap, it’s cheap to fix at design stage, compared to on a building site or after it’s been built. The city of Brussels kicked this programme off but, over a period of years, the market made it their own and a lot of innovations came out of the private sector. It’s worth noting too that the Brussels programme also required high design values, environmentally friendly materials, water efficiency and close to zero emissions. We have an opportunity to do this in New Zealand, particularly as the Government considers its infrastructure investment decisions accelerated by Covid-19. We can build back better. *Jason Quinn is a building scientist and designer of passive houses.

74	4	In the heat of COVID-19 and climate change, it’s too easy to forget what flourishing feels like.On the first day of summer, Siberia and I were the same temperature. In Verkhoyansk, roughly 3,000 miles northeast of Moscow, a searing week ended in an afternoon hotter than any before recorded north of the Arctic Circle. Half a planet away in New England, a thermometer under my tongue gave the same reading: 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. In a human, this is the clinical threshold for a fever.We had also been too hot for too long, Siberia and I. Most days since mid-May, I have lived in a body a degree or two and occasionally three above normal. Siberia is even more pyretic, averaging more than nine degrees above the 20th-century norm from January onward. Russian friends sent photos of berries flushed ripe a month early. Dark clots of mosquitoes stuck on window screens. In places, the land itself is wobbly and out of joint, as melting permafrost opens large slump pits and gullies. By May, tundra peat was burning. The boreal forests broke into wildfires. These conflagrations are now the worst that Russia has seen, blazing on toward autumn.The heat across northern Eurasia is uncanny but not mysterious. Our atmosphere, saturated with the carbon of burned fossil fuels, is becoming that of a prehuman time, one last present on Earth 3 million years ago. The poles are warming at about twice the rate of temperate regions, making Siberia’s current climate anomalies the future of those regions too. Such transformations crack open ecological worlds and the lives within them. Given the scale and implication of events in northern Eurasia, calling this season the Summer of Siberia would not be hyperbole.Read: America is being pummeled by disastersYet it is my malady, not Siberia’s, that rules conversations and headlines. I am too hot because of a persistent case of COVID-19, what its sufferers have begun calling “long COVID.” Mine is one case among millions, a pace of infection that, like distant wildfires, will roar into fall. So perhaps it is no wonder that, from America, Eurasia’s heat feels like an abstraction. Siberia and its inhabitants are far; much suffering is close. How do we take in the ruptures of a burning world when our own bodies are alight?My body has been alight for months now. From within this illness, I have come to think that Siberia and I endure more than a coincidence in temperature. Our fevers are stoked by related patterns of economic production, patterns both relatively new and seemingly inevitable. And my corporeal fire says something about how a continental fire can go unseen, offering a lesson in the implications of duration: how as a condition lingers, its origins or significance grow harder to see. Long COVID and climate change are alike in this: live ill for long enough, and the absence of health threatens to become normal.Two summers ago, I was in Russia, on a comma of rocky Bering Sea beach called Napkum Spit. It was August, the turquoise water free of ice and full of spotted seals. Far off, a gray whale spouted, its breath tracking a shimmering mist against the horizon.North and south from this place, Indigenous kin and culture are nourished by hunts of grey and bowhead whales. For Yupik and Chukchi, peoples whose ancestors have lived along the Bering Sea for thousands of years, whales’ flesh is food, their beings woven into the necessities and ceremonies of daily life. I was on Napkum Spit because of a different kind of whaling. My work as a historian had led me to the logbooks of the New England fleet, which began killing Bering Sea cetaceans in the 1840s. These sailors hunted whales for oil and baleen, to light homes and brace corsets where I now live, in Rhode Island, and all along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. I wanted to see what marks remained in this whaling ground.   I expected something tangible, even monumental. In 50 years, the Yankee fleet killed tens of thousands of whales. Around that loss, the Bering Sea ecosystem transformed, likely feeding more squid and fish in the ecological spaces once home to bowheads and grays. But these species were inaccessible to Yupik and Chukchi. By the 1880s, famine claimed families, then whole villages, many also suffering from epidemic diseases transported north by wooden ships.Had I lived in Rhode Island then, I would have lit whale-oil lamps at dusk, with baleen cinching my ribs, and seen nothing of that suffering. A hundred and twenty years later, to one recently arrived on Napkum Spit from New England, the traces of commercial whaling were imperceptible still. There were no hulking shipwrecks, or graves, or mounds of whale skulls, only that single whale spout on the horizon. The memorial to market killing is absence. The Yankee fleet ceased harrowing the waters off Siberia by 1900, yet bowhead and gray-whale populations are still shy of their former plenty. The only Bering Sea I have ever seen, the only one I can experience, would have seemed eerily bereft in 1840.That same year, I visited an abandoned mining town to the southwest. Shakhtyorsky was a Soviet creation, wrested from the tundra’s green sedges. A vein of lignite coal ran under the hills; miners, or shakhtyory, came here to peel away dirt, permafrost, and stone, then haul out fuel by the black, dusty ton. At its peak, the town was coated in a thin layer of grime, exhaled from the mines and the generators that powered heavy equipment. Coal dust stunted plant growth; coal heaps leached acid into streams. All around Shakhtyorsky, the process of extraction left the earth hollow and pocked. In miniature, it did the same to human lungs. Years of breathing sulphur and black dust caused coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, or black lung; in severe cases, lesions in the lung tissues necrotized, leaving empty, dead cavities. Yet had I flipped a switch powered by Shakhtyorsky coal in 1970, or 1980, I would have seen no sign of the scarred lands or bodies behind the light.Read: America’s coal consumption is in free fallNapkum Spit and Shakhtyorsky are alike in this: they are monuments to how, in the 19th and 20th centuries, people of comparative wealth could consume parts of the Arctic—as they consumed Indian cotton, Caribbean sugar, Middle Eastern oil, South American bananas, and dozens of other products from distant parts of the world—at a remove from the costs of their manufacture. Long before COVID-19 turned grocery stocking and Amazon delivery into dangerous work, consumption was healthier at a distance. And that severed use from consequence. If most Americans now pay little heed to Siberia’s burn, perhaps it is because recent history has made material plenty and heedlessness coincident. Wealth is freedom not just from bearing the consequence of using up the world, but from paying attention to it.That might have worked 200 years, ago, a century ago, even a lifetime ago. Today, the speed and intensity of 21st-century life erodes the space between the costs of production and the benefits of consumption. What starts far off in the Arctic—or in China, or anywhere—does not remain there. Or, put another way, the same dynamics that warm Siberia also warm me.There are many examples of this, how burning trees and fossil fuels alter the composition of the atmosphere while moving people and, with them, viruses. Modern agriculture, which turns petroleum into fertilizer, concentrates sites of possible infection and transmission between livestock and humans. Industrialization replaces animal homes with human ones, and with markets for fauna such as the bats that gave us this coronavirus. As loggers turn forests into furniture, they push more species into new intimacy with people. Deforestation also emits billions of tons of carbon each year. That carbon warms the planet more; a warmed planet forces more animals to move, which makes viral transfer more likely.Siberia’s wildfires are deforestation at an immense and terribly efficient scale. This year, about 50 million acres of forest and grasslands have already burned, more than a Greece’s worth of plant life blown into a pall of smoke so massive it now sits over Alaska and Washington State. A month of such burning releases as much carbon dioxide as a small country—Portugal, or Sweden—does in a year. No summer on record has seen less ice in the Arctic Ocean; the greatest losses are north of Russia’s baking landmass, in the Barents and Laptev Seas. Ice at the poles anchors the stability of our climate. Even if we pay it no heed, this hot summer in Siberia is shifting the terms of what normal is out from under us all.   Playing host to the coronavirus for three months has made me think about normalcy—its shifty character, how it plays with my sense of time—and the drive to pretend that things are at stasis, despite all evidence indicating turmoil. My case of COVID-19 was never acute; I was not on a ventilator or even close, nor do I have the harsher ills of many long-haulers, who report roving pain, memory loss, tachycardia. My experience of the virus has not been an event so much as a shift, erosion rather than earthquake. The most enduring symptom is a corporeal heat wave that shows no more sign of fully lifting than the warmth in northern Eurasia. As the weeks drag on, the hale clarity of my normal self is receding. Perhaps this is just what I am now: weaker, wan, soggy-brained.An amazing and terrible thing about being human is how quickly we adapt to circumstances unthinkable just years, or months, or weeks in the past. The marine ecologist Daniel Pauly calls this the problem of “shifting baselines”: assuming that observations this year or this decade represent life at its most flourishing. A whaler fresh to the Bering Strait in 1850 saw thousands of bowheads; 50 years later, a new sailor might have assumed that the species was naturally scarce. A miner who came to Shakhtyorsky in 1980 would never breathe air free of coal dust. In April I assumed I could wake each morning and work ’til evening; now I route my days around my body’s weather. People born in Siberia early this century have watched summers warm dramatically. Their children may never know it otherwise; unless carbon emissions halt, this year’s average temperature in Siberia will likely be the norm at the century’s end.Read: This is your life on climate changeThe danger of acceptance is in how ill it leaves bodies and the places they live. I am not well, at 99.8 degrees, or 99.2, or 100.1, even if those are the temperatures I experience more days than not. The swaths of Siberia choking in smoke are not well, nor are their people. But the very slowness, the week-in, week-out constancy of climate change or enduring infection, is lulling. It is tedious to tell people I am still sick. Sustaining alarm at a thousand people dying in a day is more difficult in August than it was in April. Siberia is too hot, still, but it has not exceeded the record of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit set in July. A 98-degree afternoon in Verkhoyansk is now not an event; it is just a day. The phenomenal becomes mere background.  As summer tips toward autumn—an autumn in which there will be too little sea ice and too much virus—I do not want to forget the possibilities of my April self, or of Siberia without fire, or of whales by the tens of thousands. The need to build a society that cares for all, that does not let some hide in the safety of distance, has never been more acute. The habits of wealth need reconditioning to account for the real costs of consumption. These are forward-looking projects. My experience of this virus makes me think, however, that we should not forget a longer view, one able to see how the conditions of 2020 are not inevitable. The line of heat that connects my body and Siberia has existed for only a few centuries. It is not inevitable. Thinking past it, as this summer of our many discontents moves into fall, requires a kind of split imagination: to conjure moments of past flourishing, and a future where we might flourish again.

40	5	"North America is witnessing the largest pine-beetle epidemic in recorded history. Temperature rises are more than likely to blame, but why is it so hard to admit that? A Mountain Pine beetle is seen during the examination of trees in the White River National Forest near Vail, Colorado. (AP)DILLON, Colo.--Dan Gibbs keeps dead beetles in the back of his beat-up Chevy Silverado. He has a wooden block with beetles impaled on it, each insect about the size of a grain of rice. He's got vials of embalmed beetles and their larvae. He carries around pieces of wood that show what those tiny beetles do to a mature lodgepole pine: They drill deep into the trunk and infect the tree with a fatal fungus that stains its wood blue.Gibbs isn't a scientist. He's a commissioner for Summit County, a high-altitude slice of Colorado that's gaining fame as a ground zero, of sorts, for an epidemic that has devastated pine forests across North America. Twenty years ago, the mountainsides around Dillon were a lush green; these days, they're gray with needle-less trees.The pine-beetle epidemic provides perhaps the most visual evidence of climate change in the United States. But that evidence, while arresting, remains circumstantial. Scientific studies linking the factors that drove the epidemic to rising global temperatures haven't convinced everyone, let alone prompted people here to forsake fossil fuels.It isn't just the dead trees. Here, near the headwaters of the Colorado River, the snow is melting earlier--and there's less of it. Summers are drier. Threats of wildfire and water shortages have grown, changing lives and livelihoods in Colorado and across the West.Still, it's not simple to draw a bright line from observable phenomena to climate change. For some policymakers, the lack of clarity is frustrating. Mounting evidence that the planet is warming and that human activity is to blame hasn't generated any sort of political momentum for action, even as, in places like Dillon, forests are dying in plain sight.As people here struggle to understand the beetle epidemic, the term ""climate change"" has become so inflammatory that few even utter it. It's also unclear to residents what, exactly, they would accomplish by reducing their fossil-fuel use. Without a more far-ranging plan of attack on a national--indeed, international--scale, all that people in Dillon and places like it can do is adapt to changing circumstances.Gibbs keeps beetles in the back of his pickup to teach people about forest health, not to start a conversation about climate change. (And he, like almost everyone in the mountains, drives a gas-guzzling truck.) ""Does climate change play a role in it? For sure, I think,"" Gibbs said of the pine-beetle epidemic. But, he added, ""I think scientists are still really studying it.""DEEP IN THE FORESTJohn Mack has a saying: ""These trees are dead; they just don't know it."" Along a back road to a campsite in Rocky Mountain National Park, the chief of resource stewardship at the park points out seemingly healthy trees covered in ugly, popcorn-shaped masses, a lodgepole pine's natural response to the mountain pine beetle. A healthy tree can forcefully push burrowing beetles out, but many of Colorado's pines are water-stressed and aging. Beetles have mass-attacked them, an onslaught that can overwhelm even healthy trees, Mack says.North America is witnessing the largest pine-beetle epidemic in recorded history. From Canada's Yukon Territory to New Mexico, pine trees by the hundreds of millions are succumbing to a fungus that the beetles carry. The pine needles of infected trees first turn a violent red, then they fall, and, finally, the dead tree topples over. Year by year, communities have watched a scourge advance across mountainsides and through neighborhoods, trees turning from green to red to gray. The beetles now attack 12 pine species, from the high-elevation whitebark pine to the lower-elevation ponderosa and piñon. The blight has devastated 3.3 million acres in Colorado alone since the 1990s.Beetles kill, die off, and regenerate, all of which is part of a lodgepole pine forest's natural life cycle. But human activity helped set the stage for the current epidemic. Decades of fire suppression have left the West with dense stands of vulnerable, elderly trees. Climate has also played a role. Frigid winters that usually kill the beetles have become, over the past 20 years, the exception rather than the rule. Earlier snowmelt and longer summers have altered the beetles' range and life cycle; they now attack pines at higher altitudes and latitudes, and they reproduce twice a year instead of once. Earlier springs and a series of dry years have also weakened trees, turning them into ideal beetle food.Among the scientific community, a consensus is growing that changes in climate have propelled the outbreak. Jeff Mitton, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Colorado (Boulder), has been studying the mountain pine beetle for more than 30 years. There's no doubt in his mind that climate change has driven the infestation.""The question is, why has this gotten so much worse?"" Mitton said, with the placid gaze of a man used to thinking about long stretches of evolutionary time. ""The beetles are out six weeks to two months earlier because springtime temperatures are warmer."" Mitton connected the epidemic to other changes observed in American landscapes, from melting glaciers to shifting agricultural regions to increases in global temperatures.But the evidence that Mitton and his colleagues are piecing together has yet to persuade many people in the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service, let alone the average Coloradoan, that climate change has driven the pine-beetle epidemic. ""There's a lot of discussion"" about whether climate change influenced the epidemic, said Cal Wettstein, the Forest Service's incident commander who coordinates the regional response to the epidemic. ""Of course, I'm not an expert on it. It's possible that it might be a factor. It's not the driving factor.""Mack says, ""There's no question that we're seeing changes in different aspects"" of ecological life at Rocky Mountain National Park. But he warned that the shifts aren't ""the dramatic effects that people tend to associate with climate change.""Mack and Wettstein remain focused on dealing with an immediate consequence of the outbreak: keeping people and infrastructure safe from falling trees. Wettstein estimates that 100,000 dead trees will fall every day for the next 10 years in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. A falling tree could kill a hiker, take out a power line, or block a back road.It's tough to connect an ecological phenomenon to a single factor. It's also tough to predict the local manifestation of global warming in a mountainous state that sees a lot of weather variation. ""I think that what's uncertain are the details,"" said professor William Bowman, director of the lab that Mitton and others use for studies of ecology and climate change. ""What I see is not so much disagreement over whether climate change will occur; it's how it will be manifest.""Coloradoans have noticed that species are shifting their ranges, snows are melting earlier, and--particularly this year--warm weather is coming mighty early. Set aside the polarized climate-change debate, and you'll find communities dealing with a set of conditions that aren't obviously linked to rising global temperature and that don't, on a day-to-day basis, constitute a catastrophe. They're not yet seeing evidence that could spur action on carbon emissions. But if the climate models are correct, the changes that Coloradoans are already experiencing herald a very challenging future for the West.The best way to view the effects of climate change in Colorado, it turns out, is from a car. Take Interstate 70 west from Denver toward Glenwood Springs, and you'll move from the Great Plains to high-altitude pine forest in an hour. As mountains unfurl and you drive into areas dense with lodgepole pines, the full visual impact of the epidemic asserts itself. New growth and untouched species amidst the devastation don't make the skeleton pines any less spooky.The steep descent into Dillon presents perhaps the most dramatic sight on the highway. Cars shoot through the Eisenhower Tunnel, bored straight through solid mountainside, and pop out into a valley where in some places 70 percent of the trees are dead. Residents of Summit County have been grappling with a changing forest for almost a decade, and that has meant wrestling with fear, confusion, misinformation, apathy, and a sense of helplessness. In some ways, their experience is a microcosm of the larger climate-change debate.A bum knee doesn't stop Howard Hallman, an earnest man kitted out in the Colorado uniform of fleece vest and sturdy boots, from clambering over the land that separates I-70 from Straight Creek. On one side of the stream, the mountainside is designated wilderness; on the other, it's designated roadless, making it almost impossible to drive tree-removal equipment in. A wildfire on either side could send dirt and debris tumbling into Dillon's only water source, but there's little residents can do--legally or logistically--to protect the creek.""We have human habitat, we have housing, we have recreation, so we can't really let things run their course,"" Hallman said. Like a lot of Coloradoans, he worries that the dead trees heighten fire risk. Scientists dispute the extent to which beetle-kill trees affect fire behavior, but laypeople and experts alike are certain of one thing: In a dry year, the forest will burn. And this year looks to be extremely dry.Hallman's community group, the Forest Health Task Force, worked with the Forest Service to clear-cut a 60-acre patch near Straight Creek, hoping to mitigate the fire hazard. The patch of bare ground looks pathetically small measured against the surrounding mountains.From the brewpub where the task force meets each month, patrons can look out the window and see the Dillon Reservoir. The fact that the towns of Dillon, Frisco, and Silverthorne lie clustered around a reservoir that none of them can draw water from is a testament to the quirks of Western water appropriation. Constructed in the 1960s by Denver Water, the public utility for the state's capital, the Dillon Reservoir is Denver's property. Runoff from snows that blanket Summit County flows into the reservoir and then courses through the mountains for 70 miles to the sprawling metropolitan area on the plains. Summit County snowmelt that doesn't get siphoned off to local towns, Denver, or Colorado Springs eventually joins the Colorado River, the primary water source for close to 40 million people across the western United States.The Forest Health Task Force long ago concluded that the pine-beetle outbreak can't be stopped. The citizens, environmentalists, politicians, and fire-service and water-utility officials who make up the group spent part of their May meeting talking about the threat that falling trees pose to infrastructure. They spent most of their time talking about drought.""What we have now is a very dry year. It could possibly be a very, very serious drought,"" said Steve Swanson, head of the nonprofit Blue River Watershed Group. In a voice so soft that listeners strained to hear him, Swanson laid out what was on everyone's mind.As of early April, Colorado's snowpack was 48 percent below average. Conditions haven't been this dry since 2002, the year made notorious by the Hayman fire, the largest in state history. That inferno burned more than 138,000 acres in the hills southwest of Denver and clogged the Cheesman Reservoir with an ashy slurry. The Western Forestry Leadership Coalition estimates that direct costs, rehabilitation, and other indirect costs of the fire topped $200 million. Ten years later, the rehabilitation effort is ongoing.Colorado's 30 largest forest fires on record have all occurred since 1996, and state data suggest that fires have been growing in size as well as frequency. As this story went to press, New Mexico was fighting the largest forest fire in its history, a 46,000-acre blaze was burning in northern Colorado, and an 8,000-acre fire was spreading in southwest Colorado, near Durango.At the meeting, Gibbs made a pitch for establishing ""defensible space"" around homes: a cleared area that stops fire from leaping from treetop to rooftop, or from bushes to front stoop. Defensible space is standard practice in Southern California, but it's not something Colorado policymakers and homeowners have thought much about until recently.In Summit County, people are adjusting to a new normal. Longtime environmental stressors such as the pine beetle, drought, and wildfire have become more prevalent. Even people who believe that those changes are linked to rising global temperatures have a sense that bringing up climate change only polarizes and confuses the discussion.Dan Schroder, director of the Colorado State University Extension in Summit County, heads a program that educates the community about fire risk and explains what's killing all the trees. But he'd rather not drag climate policy into it.""I'm in the camp where climate change is happening, and it's something that we need to address and think about as we move forward,"" Schroder said. ""But in order to engage with the general public, that sort of remains somewhat inflammatory, or a bit of a conflicting idea. So I tend not to engage that term 'climate change.' ""Hallman came to Colorado in 1972 to work as an engineer at the molybdenum mine up in Climax. He has been working as an environmental consultant since the late 1980s, but he's not a climate-change expert. He's a guy who cares about the outdoors and who's hungry for information about the changes he's seeing around his home. He's also worried that a confusing, sustained debate over whether the Earth is warming and why can only mean political paralysis.""We have people who are saying, well, it doesn't exist, and not only it doesn't exist, but if you believe it exists, you are somehow--you are at least a socialist, if not a communist,"" Hallman said. ""So that's not a good starting point.""""When it comes to allocating funding, like at the local level, if you have the misinformation ... how are you going to have the political will to take the actions that are necessary?"" he asked. Another task-force member, Breckenridge-based environmental consultant Brad Piehl, feels the same way. ""People need more facts. They need to sit down and talk about it,"" he said.Mitton and other scientists might argue that those facts are already present, but at the local level, there is still room for doubt. People are watching new growth sprout around the dead pine stands. They know they live in a dry state. And even those who believe that reducing carbon emissions is necessary, like Hallman and Piehl, know that unless a majority of Americans feel that the same way, the national action needed to start that reduction isn't going to happen.Locals can't do anything to stop the pine beetle's spread, just as they can't do anything, as individuals, to slow global carbon emissions. The way the pine-beetle outbreak will affect fire and water behavior remains murky, just as it's unclear how climate change will ultimately affect people's behavior about fire and water in the West. Advocates anticipate that more wildfires or water shortages could help convince people that climate change is here, and that it's a problem. But by the time scientists have proven the changes and everyone else has accepted them, more of us will already be living with the fallout.""We're slowly, and maybe without even realizing it, adapting,"" said Lisa Dale, assistant director for parks, wildlife, and lands at the Colorado Natural Resources Department. The people in charge of managing the state's natural resources are dealing with climate factors even if they don't call their problem ""climate change,"" she said.One of Colorado's U.S. senators, Mark Udall, has for years pointed to the beetle epidemic as the kind of evidence that conclusively shows climate change is occurring in plain view. But his and other lawmakers' efforts to move the needle on climate policy have gone nowhere.""To a large degree, our nation's parks are the canary in the coal mine when it comes to on-the-ground effects of a warming climate,"" Udall said at a 2009 hearing on climate change that the Democrat held at Rocky Mountain National Park with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. At the time, Udall pointed to ""trees killed by a bark-beetle epidemic that has been exacerbated by a warming climate.""Three years later, Udall is still calling Colorado's forests ""canaries in the coal mine for the effects of a warming climate."" In a statement released by his office last week, the senator said, ""We need to look into understanding the very real impacts that affect the health of our resources and our ability to protect them.""Udall supported the Senate draft of a highly contentious bill to ""cap and trade"" carbon emissions. After a mad scramble for votes, the legislation barely based the House in the summer of 2009. It soon bogged down in the Senate--largely because of coal-state Democrats' fears that the legislation would damage their local economies and open them to political attack.Their fears were justified. Scores of House Democrats lost their seats when opponents and interest groups pounded them with their cap-and-trade vote, along with votes on health care reform and other Democratic priorities. Even some who had opposed cap-and-trade fell victim.""Candidly, I think the Republicans--who were in the minority--saw the opportunity to use this bill to make inroads,"" said Rick Boucher, who represented a district in Virginia's coal country for 28 years before losing his seat in 2010. Attack ads hammered swing-district Democrats like him for their cap-and-trade votes, Boucher said. He was particularly vulnerable because he chose to try to help craft a bill that would strike a balance between regulating emissions and protecting industry back home--the very thing we expect responsible lawmakers to do. ""It was a factor in my race,"" Boucher said.Since the cap-and-trade bill faltered, Congress has shown little inclination to act. The Republican Party seems more dug in on the matter now than ever, with most GOP lawmakers publicly doubting evidence that human activity is warming the planet, opposing any regulation that would curb fossil-fuel use, or both.The party's standard-bearer, presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, openly distanced himself from the science of climate change in remarks to donors in Pittsburgh last fall. ""My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us,"" Romney said.Even Colorado Republicans in Congress, who see sickly forests on a regular basis, refuse to tie the beetle infestation and drought to human activity and resist the idea of regulating carbon emissions.In May 2012, GOP Rep. Scott Tipton held a field hearing on the bark beetle in Montrose, in the southwest part of the state. At the hearing, he blamed ""federal obstruction"" and mismanagement of Colorado's forests for the beetle epidemic and called for more timber extraction to thin aged pine stands. Federal mismanagement, Tipton maintains, is the primary driver of the beetle outbreak.He says that the climate has been changing throughout history and that there's still debate over the role human activity has played in current shifts. ""We've got to be responsible,"" the lawmaker said, when reached by phone at his office in Washington. ""We've got to be able to create jobs; we've got to be able to provide energy."" Even if the United States and Europe both stopped emitting carbon for the next 25 years, the difference would soon be made up by other nations, Tipton said.Rep. Mike Coffman, another Colorado Republican, said: ""Climate change is naturally occurring. What influence do we have over that, we certainly need to look into, but that's subject to debate.""Tipton and Coffman (and Romney, for that matter) have plenty of company. Fifty-two percent of Americans believe that the effects of global warming have already set in, according to a March Gallup Poll, down from a high of 61 percent in 2008. Forty-one percent believe that the climate is changing because of natural causes, compared with 53 percent who blame human activity. The number of people who say that human activities are the primary cause of global warming has dropped 8 percentage points since 2003.While the debate rages on, the climate of the Rockies continues to transform, with consequences that will reverberate nationwide. Stream flow in the Colorado River basin is expected to decrease over the next 50 years, purely as a result of precipitation and temperature changes, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The median projection anticipates a 9 percent decrease from the historical mean by 2060, said Carly Jerla, a co-manager for the Colorado River Basin water supply and demand study. ""There will be more extreme highs, more extreme lows,"" she said, ""all trending toward a lower, decreased overall mean."" Over the same period, the bureau predicts that the human population dependent on the Colorado River for drinking water will rise from the current 40 million people to between 49.3 million and 76.5 million.Significant economic effects could follow. Experts warn that changes could disrupt a thicket of local and regional water-rights agreements and necessitate expensive infrastructure changes. Agriculture across the West could experience a major hit as growing conditions change and water supplies shift. In mountain towns, such as those in Summit County, the omnipresent recreation industry may have to cope with less-than-epic snowfall.Despite the alarming predictions, communities in Colorado and elsewhere don't yet feel that they're living the future that climate models predict. A full-throated call for action in Washington seems unlikely, no matter how often advocates try to provoke one.""We have to have a two-pronged approach,"" said Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat whose district is primarily the city and county of Denver. ""If you just try to deal with the practical issues without the underlying cause, then over time, the situation on the ground is only going to worsen for our state. ... From a congressional standpoint, what we should be doing is trying to steer our public policy so we move away from fossil fuels.""Right now, Colorado's congressional delegation is working to address the effects of the beetle outbreak--not the changing climate that's helping drive it. But Boucher said he believes that Congress, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, should again attempt to act to regulate carbon emissions, because EPA can't create a ""buffer against economic disruption"" like Congress can. The threat of EPA regulation-by-fiat could help build bipartisan consensus for action--if only there were consensus that the problem exists in the first place.For now, the political cost of action remains too high and the economic incentives for taking drastic measures too low. Until that dynamic shifts, supporters of climate-change policy will have to marshal their facts and continue to point to episodes such as the beetle infestation to try to convince those on the fence. Scientists worry that by the time evidence becomes undeniable and political will has amassed, it will be too late for reducing emissions to make any difference. Many worry that the tipping point for action has already passed.To cope with a changing climate, communities from Denver to Dhaka need to do two things. Adapt, step by step, to the new normal, and move, step by step, away from burning fossil fuels. Little incentive exists to make punishing changes to the economy while the evidence of climate change remains opaque to so many people. But by the time the evidence overwhelms us, millions of trees will be rotting on the ground. We want to hear what you think about this article.

The Post and other ""true believers"" ignore or ridicule a growing body of evidence rebutting their beliefs.Most bad weather -- from hurricanes, which have been few this season, to tornadoes -- are unwelcome by those in their paths, but these weather phenomena have existed for centuries.Both sides seem to agree that CO2 levels are elevated, but they don't agree on whether that will cause dangerous climate change, including rising temperatures and turbulent weather.The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) argues, ""The human effect is likely to be small relative to natural variability, and whatever small warming is likely to occur will produce benefits as well as costs.""[pullquote]Yet the climate change cultists continue to focus on melting polar ice caps and ""displaced"" polar bears as part of their emotional appeal for government to ""fix"" the problem. Now comes a report in the UK Daily Mail that ""eminent scientists"" have observed a record return of the Arctic ice cap as it grows by 60 percent in a year, covering with ice almost 1 million more square miles of ocean than in 2012.In 2007, the BBC reported that by 2013, global warming would leave the Arctic ""ice free.""Oops!Just how silly this is getting is an assertion by some activists that the current tensions in Syria might be linked to climate change. That's not as harebrained as a newspaper report in January 1933, which said, ""Yo-Yo Banned in Syria, Blamed for Drought by Moslems.""The Syrians of 1933 actually believed the up and down of a toy yo-yo affected the weather. If it went down and sprang right back up, rain. If it went down and didn't spring up, drought. Police reportedly patrolled the streets, confiscating the toy. Ridiculous? Not as ridiculous as some of the junk science coming out of climate research circles today.Last March, the Daily Mail reported that global temperatures are about to drop ""below the level that the (computer) models forecast with '90 percent certainty.'""Marc Morano, a former staff member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (whose web page climatedepot.com offers numerous scientific articles debunking climate change), emails me: ""As a long observer of the global weather movement, I can say that the events of 2013 (have) been one of the most devastating to the movement. Both poles have record expanding ice. Global temperatures have failed to rise for 15 plus years, sea level rise is failing to accelerate, tornadoes are at record lows, hurricanes are near record low activity ... 2013 may be the year in which man-made global warming fears enter the dustbin of history.""I doubt it. Too many people have too much invested in perpetuating this fiction. Billions of dollars and other currencies have been diverted into ""green"" projects in a Chicken Little attempt to stop the sky from falling. The BBC reports it as fact in virtually every story it does on the environment. Ditto the American media. Most media ignore evidence that counters climate change proponents.Former Vice President Al Gore has made a personal fortune promoting the cult of global warming, a cult being partially defined as a belief system that ignores proof contrary to its beliefs. Perhaps the climate change counter-revolutionaries should adopt the yo-yo as their symbol and send Gore and his apostles a box of them.(Readers may e-mail Cal Thomas at tcaeditors@tribune.com.)"
684	4	"OPINION: As 2020 rolls around, the Australian wildfires herald the start of a new decade. New Year's Day, although I didn't know it at the time, was tinted with this reminder as my friends and I watched clouds of smoke curl into the valley of Le Bons Bay, Canterbury. We didn't actually know what it was - some of us suspected a fire further up the hill. I don't think any of us really thought it could be smoke from all the way over the ditch until we got back into cellphone range and realised this was true. The wildfires have devastated 6.3 million hectares, an area of land similar to the size of the entire island of Ireland. It has taken the lives of 28 people, directly impacted 480 million animals, and forced the evacuations of thousands from their homes. We, the richer, ""more developed"" part of the world, thought we were untouchable by the effects of climate change. The impacts of the western world's intensive carbon emitting were always thought to be felt the most in countries far away from us - like Bangladesh or the Pacific Islands - who contribute the least to global carbon emissions.  I'll admit that even I thought I was perfectly safe in my nice Christchurch home in little New Zealand. These horrific bushfires have changed that. They have shown climate change does not discriminate. This decade, climate change will touch everyone personally.

Fake figures claiming that 183 people accused of intentionally starting bushfires had been arrested have been spread across the internet and are giving denialists that single thread in a curtain of facts to cling on to. However, Victoria police have responded that there is no evidence that the bushfires were caused by arson. Funny that. Mother Earth has thrown us a curve ball, and now it's on us as to how we respond. I was really hoping we'd see some leadership, setting the bar high as to how we react to climate-induced crises and how we will curb our emissions from now on.  I was (unsurprisingly) furious with Scott Morrison's response; watch the cricket, forget the death toll and dawdle around supplying volunteer firefighters with more supplies. Furthermore, members of Australia's Parliament are refusing to acknowledge the role climate change has played in drying the bush and triggering prolonged droughts, all of which provided the perfect storm for this catastrophe. Morrison has set the lowest, most disgraceful bar when it comes to acting on climate change. Now I can only pray that it's not going to be a game of limbo with other world leaders. In a way, this fire is like the smoke I saw in Le Bons Bay. It's a warning of what is to come.  If we ever needed a sign or a warning or a trigger, let this be it. Instead of 2020 being the year we burn, let it be the start of the decade the world chooses to act. Especially those in the western world, who have for far too long been reaping the benefits of high rates of emissions while letting impoverished, often historically colonised countries feel the blows.  What we have is not good enough. It is our responsibility to turn this around.  I want to tell future generations about how we - the world - saw the fires, and they were the last disaster we let happen. I want to tell them that we realised the damage we had done and gone about reducing its impacts and bringing them the world they live in now. I want them to be happy and healthy in their world. I do not want to tell them that the world saw the smoke and did nothing to put out the fire. Mia Sutherland is an organiser of School Strike 4 Climate NZ."
800	2	Climate Explained is a collaboration between The Conversation, Stuff and the New Zealand Science Media Centre to answer your questions about climate change. If you have a question you'd like an expert to answer, please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz. How much climate variability have humans dealt with since we evolved and since we started settling (Neolithic times)? How important was migration to human survival during these periods? The climate always fluctuates as variation in the Sun's heat reaching Earth drives glacial-interglacial cycles. Over the past 420,000 years there have been at least four major transitions between ice ages and relatively warmer interglacial periods. Modern humans emigrated from Africa to populate the rest of the globe between 120,000 and 80,000 years ago, which means our species has had to adapt to many massive climate transitions.

The Last Glacial Maximum from 26,500–19,000 years ago coincided with a large drop in atmospheric CO₂ and a 4.3C cooling globally. Low temperatures turned much of the world's water into ice and expanded glaciers. This lowered sea level by up to 130m compared to today. This exposed continental shelves, joined land masses and created extensive coastal plains, such as Beringia that connected Russia to North America, and Sahul that connected Australia to New Guinea. After a brief warming period, the Northern Hemisphere returned abruptly to near-glacial conditions around 12,900 years ago that lasted 1,300 years. Known as the Younger Dryas, this period recorded climate cooling up to 15C and giant ice sheets again advanced. The end of the Younger Dryas was just as sudden, marked by a rapid warming up to 10C in few decades. The most recent period of climate instability was the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. Cold conditions between 1580 and 1880 were characterised by a 0.5–4C cooling and expanding mountain glaciers in the European Alps, New Zealand, Alaska and the Andes. What climate change meant for humans Despite our impressive capacity to adapt to a broad range of environments, humans have a preferred environmental envelope in which we thrive. These conditions would have been characterised by a mix of open, savanna-type woodlands, wetlands and rocky habitats. Dense, humid rain forests made access to resources difficult, whereas deserts were often too dry to provide enough food and materials. Climate conditions during the Last Interglacial could have encouraged waves of human expansion out of Africa when a humid and warm climate promoted vegetated corridors through Eurasia. The subsequent cooling period connected land masses that had previously been separated by oceans and provided opportunities for human travellers to access Sahul from the Indonesian archipelago. The entrance into America from Asia via Beringia was more difficult because humans only reached there during the Last Glacial Maximum when a massive ice sheet blocked the new land bridge. During that time, human populations declined and contracted to small refuges until the climate in eastern Beringia began to warm again 17,000–15,000 years ago. This warming created newly accessible pathways along the Pacific Northwest coast, followed by another ice-free corridor that formed 3,000 years later as the ice sheet retreated. Because of the cold temperatures and scarcity of food at this time, humans needed to improve their hunting efficiency by targeting large animals to maximise food return. In the Southern Hemisphere, modern humans had already been living in Australia for 30,000–40,000 years prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, so such drastic cooling and drying probably pushed human populations to decline and retreat into smaller refuges nearer to reliable sources of fresh water where game animals also gathered. Following the Last Glacial Maximum, modern humans continued to spread across North America. The warmer and wetter climate in the Southern Hemisphere also helped human migration into South America. At the same time the Younger Dryas in the Northern Hemisphere forced populations either to return to a nomadic lifestyle or seek refuge in a few hospitable areas. After the harsh conditions of the Younger Dryas, the first evidence of agriculture emerged in various parts of the world. The peopling of remote Oceania between 3,500 and 730 years ago required oceanic journeys of thousands of kilometres across the Pacific, eventually to the temperate and subantarctic waters of New Zealand. Although these migrations are not clearly related to any of the earlier climate-change events, the wind patterns at the time were particularly favourable for sailing. But the Little Ice Age could have reduced population size and pushed early Māori settlement northward. The Little Ice age probably hit people in the Northern Hemisphere much harder. The cold climate caused widespread crop failures, famines and population declines. During the last five years alone, the Earth is already ~1.1C warmer than 150 years ago and temperatures are expected to be +4.5C warmer than today by 2100. Today we are experiencing the warmest climate since our species started peopling the globe. Climate fluctuations that used to take millennia are now occurring in less than 100 years, affecting fresh water availability, food supply, health, and environmental integrity. Past climate changes set the stage for people to demonstrate immense adaptability and resilience by developing new skills, farming techniques, trading patterns and political structures, but most importantly by leaving their old, unsustainable ways of life behind.

668	4	"Climate change means a quarter of Auckland's buildings will face flood risk and the city's poorest communities will be hit hardest, according to a ground-breaking assessment. Auckland's poorer southern suburbs will be hit not only by hotter, drier weather over the next century, but will have the least ability to adjust or escape the change. The wind will weaken, and change direction, bringing new pollution risks, while up to 2.5 per cent of the land area could be threatened by rising sea levels. The research by Auckland Council, presented at the city's Climate Change Conference, said while much remains unknown, some solutions are clear.   READ MORE: * Climate change strike: Auckland principals threaten students with truancy * Climate change costs are hitting households through insurance premiums * New Zealand sea level rise: Councils' $8b climate change warning The work paints for the first time a picture of how a New Zealand city will be affected by climate change over the next century. It builds on research released last year by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), which showed the number of ""hot days"" above 25 degrees Celsius, could quadruple by 2110, accompanied by drier weather, but more extreme rainfall and extreme heat spells. The forecasts are based on life continuing much as it is now, with no major interventions, as the effect of those is unknown. The new research takes the forecast climate changes, and in a ""risk assessment"" looks at how they will play out across the city's varied urban and rural communities and landscapes. Those at most risk are the poorest southern communities in the local board areas of Mangere-Ōtāhuhu, Ōtara-Papatoetoe, Manurewa and Papakura, and some in the west. By 2110 the southern communities will have 90 extra ""hot days"", 10-20 more than the Auckland average, and the make-up of the communities will heighten the impact. ""The 10-15 extra hot days (and 25 in the south and north) are just over a decade away,"" said the council report. ""It is unlikely that society will have the opportunity to adapt and acclimatise to these changes within this period without some intervention.   ""Extreme heat events can have a catastrophic effect on the population, particularly those that are chronically ill, socially marginalised or with reduced capacity to adapt."" The report includes a Heat Vulnerability Index for Auckland, blending the nature of the local climate changes, with the ability to adapt or lessen the impact. Those most at risk from heat-related death are women, those living alone or without vehicles, ethnic minorities, low-income households and those with poor quality housing or chronic illness. Death and illness during high heat has been linked closely to those with underlying health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and chronic renal disease. Those factors are considered to put Māori and Pacific people at heightened risk.  The vulnerability assessment doesn't include the role of ""social infrastructure"" in lessening the impact of extreme heat events, such as greenspaces, and community facilities as well as places of worship and cafes.  The report says those amenities improve community cohesion, which helps the vulnerable.   ""Prioritising preservation and increase of greenspace in these areas could considerably improve the heat vulnerability of the population,"" the report noted. Overseas studies have found a link between low heat-related death and illness and areas with greater tree shade, and less ""hard surface cover"" such as concrete and paving. The report said building standards will need to improve. ""If the building legislation remains unchanged under a changing climate, properties will be increasingly susceptible to overheat."" Mayor Phil Goff told Stuff  Auckland needs to do more to tackle climate change. Goff said while Auckland was committed to buying only non-polluting buses from 2025, individual behaviour needed to change ""Pushing mode change in transport to get people onto non-polluting (electric) rail, light rail and busways where buses are electric or hydrogen-powered - we have got to totally change the way we live, in a more compact city,"" he said. Goff called for the Government to accelerate sales of electric vehicles, by offering subsidies. ""For every one electric car, we're importing 64 diesel SUVs and in 20 years time those cars will still be on the road and still causing carbon emissions."" Auckland Action Against Poverty co-ordinator Ricardo Menéndez March said there was an ""infrastructure deficit"" in south Auckland which had created ""geographical inequity"".  ""What we have seen in our organisation, when there has been extreme weather events, the need to cover financial hardship due to deprivation of power or high electricity costs are greater,"" Menéndez March said.  ""Councillors and Members of Parliament need to start redistributing funding to south Auckland if they are to address these injustices."" AIR QUALITY AND SOCIETAL IMPACTS Risks related to the quality of the air Aucklanders breathe are expected to be magnified for the young and elderly, and poorer communities. The analysis points to what is already known about who is most affected by asthma, with the crossovers of concentrations of Māori and Pacific communities, those with poor quality housing, poor access to healthcare and higher unemployment.  Those most likely to adapt to the impacts of worsening air pollution, are those well-off enough to be able to improve home ventilation, live away from high-polluting busy roads, and have clean heating as well as good access to healthcare. Auckland's mean annual temperature by 2110 is expected to rise by between 1.4C and 3.3C  according to a 2018 study - less in the west, more in the east - and with the biggest change in autumn. On the upside, warmer winters will mean less need for heating and less pollution from woodburners. Frosts will become rare except for higher ground in the Waitakere and Hunua Ranges. The bad news is that humidity will rise, with more days in which the air feels oppressive. That could promote mould growth inside homes. There will be fewer rainy days, but more spells with rain of more than 40mm for consecutive days. The magnitude of the wettest days of the year is expected to increase, in the south east by more than 25 per cent. The change in the rain pattern could have a knock-on effect on air quality. ""The regularity of rainfall was reported to be more important than rainfall intensity as a mechanism for removing atmospheric pollutants,"" said the analysis. Climate change has been found to be a prominent influence in increasing forest fires, such as those that occurred across Europe, Russia and North America in 2018. ""Forest fires over the Waitakere Ranges would cause large plumes of carbonaceous particulate and gas to be emitted with the potential to seriously affect Auckland's air quality.""     LESS WIND, NEW DIRECTION Falling wind speed and a change in wind direction could remove protection Auckland has enjoyed from air pollution. ""Auckland's air is diluted by a reliable south-westerly wind from the relatively unpolluted Southern Ocean - however this is predicted to change,"" said the analysis. Climate projections forecast increasing frequency of wind from the north-east. This would blend with a long established decline in the number of windy days Aucklanders experience. Over the past 50 years, the number of days where wind speeds top 10 metres a second has more than halved from 30 in 1966 to 11 in 2012. Lower wind speeds would carry less salt and fewer particulates across Auckland, but in localised areas would also be less effective in dispersing any pollution. More north-easterlies may also carry more emissions from shipping across the city. A 2017 study in Auckland found an increase in sulphur dioxide and heavy metals from the diesel fuel burned by ships, when north-easterlies blew. ""These increases have been most evident close to the port in Auckland's densely populated city centre."" Lower wind speeds could also allow more pollutants to build up, higher-up in the atmosphere. Even Auckland's planning rules enabling higher density housing and discouraging sprawl will have mixed impacts. The analysis found health could suffer from higher pollution if the focus on higher density housing in the existing area, supported by public transport, is not delivered. A possible flipside though is a 2018 study which found taller buildings can lift localised air pollution concentrations due to lower winds clearing the bad air. SEA LEVEL RISE AND BUILDINGS  Three of the eight new reports will not be released for weeks, on key areas such as the impact on buildings, and the localised effects of sea level rise. A brief summary of the impact on the built environment shows 23 per cent of Auckland buildings, or 127,593, would be exposed to flood hazards, with 16,000 at risk of floor flooding in a one-in-100-year flood, with the city's paved surfaces and roads affecting the volume, speed and path of water in heavy rain. Sea level rise could hit up to 2.5 per cent of Auckland's land area, 80 per cent of coastal ecosystems and 6 per cent of dairying land. Council parks near shorelines will be threatened, amounting to as much as 7.5 per cent of council-owned green space.  Underground utilities and transport routes especially near coasts are thought to be highly exposed.  TERRESTRIAL SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS ""Concern and uncertainty"" is the headline remark in the analysis of effects on Auckland's flora and fauna. ""The majority of studies do indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity. ""However we have not identified any qualitative studies on how Auckland's indigenous species and ecosystems are likely to respond to the threats associated with climate change."" One 2017 study found 42 per cent of 48 indigenous ecosystem types had at least one risk factor making them more susceptible to harm from climate change. That rose to 58 per cent if climate change accelerated the spread of kauri dieback and myrtle rust. By 2110  one study expected stream temperatures during Autumn could be 4 degrees higher, pushing some species closer to lethal limits, and accelerating growth rates of some aquatic plants, to perhaps nuisance level.   Rising sea levels will hit coastal habitats, particularly areas such as mangrove stands, unable to migrate further up the shore. Auckland Council hopes that ideas that emerge from the three-day conference winding-up on Wednesday, will feed into its climate action plan due to go out for public consultation in the next months."
500	3	"We're already familiar with some of the more evident effects of global warming such as melting glaciers and more extreme weather events. But few people are aware of some of the other, less obvious - and completely surprising - impacts of our changing climate, which could have a serious impact on the way we live. 1. Airplane turbulence will get worse Unfortunately, we can expect air travel to become even more stressful - thanks to the effects of climate change.A recent study by researchers at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom looks into the relationship between clean-air turbulence and anthropogenic climate change. Using the popular flight corridor between Europe and the United States as an example, they examined various strengths of turbulence and how each will change in the future if carbon dioxide levels were to double.The results showed that severe turbulence is likely to dramatically increase by up to 149 percent as a result of stronger wind shears within the Earth's jet streams. These are narrow, fast-flowing, meandering westerly currents found near the tropopause, which are frequently used by commercial airlines as a means of saving time and fuel.2. Icebergs will clog up shipping lanes No ship has been struck by an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean since the Titanic sunk in 1912 and the International Ice Patrol was subsequently formed. But patrol workers are likely going to get a lot busier soon. In early April, more than 400 icebergs clogged up shipping lanes in the North Atlantic, forcing ships to take detours of up to 400 nautical miles - wasting significant time and fuel in the process.While icebergs are common in these waters, their number and timing is unusual. Experts say climate change could be to blame. The icebergs begin their journey after breaking off a glacier in Greenland, which is influenced largely by winter weather, especially storms accompanied by strong winds. Rising temperatures also lead to the melting of ice sheets, causing more chunks of ice to break off and float into the open ocean.3. Lightning will strike more frequently Heat energy acts as a form of fuel for storm clouds. So as global temperatures continue to rise, we can also expect more active thunderstorms.Although there are a number of downsides to this phenomenon - including a probable increase in wildfires - lightning actually produces a powerful chemical reaction that can be beneficial for Earth's atmosphere.Lightning creates a special form of a greenhouse gas called nitrogen oxide, which indirectly regulates other potentially harmful greenhouse gases, like ozone and methane. 4. Volcanic activity could increase You would be forgiven for thinking that climate change and volcanic activity are completely unrelated phenomena. But the workings of our planet are interconnected in suprising ways. In places like Iceland, volcanoes and glaciers have coexisted for thousands of years. However, as glaciers melt due to rising temperatures, the pressure on the Earth's mantel decreases, which in turn increases magma amounts while reducing stress on a volcano's magma chambers. This leads to higher volcanic activity, along with the travel chaos that often follows.There is a historic precedent to this prediction: 12,000 years ago, Iceland was covered by a glacier as thick as 2 kilometers. When that glacier abruptly melted due to a warming trend, a huge surge in volcanic activity followed.5. We'll become angrier Even our mood isn't immune from climate change. Researchers in social psychology have long highlighted the link between warmer climates and higher levels of impulsive behavior and even violence. This has been shown in regions closer to the equator - if global temperatures continue to rise as expected, we could also begin to see behavioral changes in areas further north. In addition to having to contend with warmer weather, there is also evidence that climate change will further fuel global conflict by adding stress on natural resources like food and water. 6. The ocean will get darker We can expect our oceans to gradually become murkier as the effects of climate change become more apparent over time.While climate change is often associated with higher temperatures and drought, it is also expected to increase annual rainfall in some areas of the world. This will create faster-flowing rivers, which in turn churns up more silt and debris before this water meets the ocean. This phenomenon has already been observed along the coast of Norway, where the ocean water has become increasingly darker due to an increase in precipitation and melting snow.7. Allergies will worsen As if getting angrier wasn't enough: If you're one of the many people who suffer from springtime allergies, you should probably start stockpiling your medication.Warmer temperatures also mean longer and earlier blooming seasons for allergy-triggering plants like dandelions and ragweed. Pollen counts are likely to double over the next three decades in the United States - and ""sneezing season"" will also kick off in the future as soon as the first week of April. 8. Animals will shrinkThis one may take a bit longer to become apparent - but the development of smaller mammals has been a common evolutionary response to past global warming events.During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, around 50 million years ago, mammals were ""dwarfed"" after global temperatures rose 5 and 8 degrees Celsius.Like all examples of evolution, the reason for this shrinking comes down to basic survival: As nutrients become more scarce due to rising temperatures and drought, larger animals struggle more than their smaller counterparts to fulfill their nutritional needs.  9. Desert soil may erode Believe it or not, deserts are actually teeming with life - also in the form of bacterial colonies. These colonies grow so large, in fact, that they form strong layers known as ""biocrusts"" that prevent soil erosion. But different kinds of bacteria thrive in different temperature ranges. So as the climate continues to change quickly, these bacteria could find it difficult to adapt. If desert soil could becomes more prone to erosion, it would not be fertile enough to support plants and feed animals. 10. Ant behaviour will change Ants play a more important role in the planet's ecosystem than you may realize. In spite of their status as a pest, ants helps plants by controlling other insects, circulating vital nutrients and turning over the soil, among other things. But ants appear to be ill-equipped to handle the rising tempertatures caused by climate change. A study carried out at Harvard Forest in Massachusetts revealed a susceptibility of ants to even slight temperature increases, with the most important seed-dispersing species essentially shutting down and retreating to their underground nests until conditions improved.  "

The name means ""The Great Blueberry.""Chuathbulak is a tiny village of less than 100 people that exists off the road system. The only way to get there is by boat or plane in the summer, and by plane or driving on frozen rivers and the tundra during the winter. Like many rural Alaska Native communities, Chuathbulak doesn't have a hospital, and its two grocery stores mostly stock food that doesn't spoil because it has to be flown in. Fresh produce, like oranges or lettuce, is a rare treat. And food there typically costs four times as much as in the Lower 48 — which is what Alaskans call the rest of the US states except for Hawaii.Read more: Forest fires in Alaska: A ticking climate time bombThough some in the local population have swapped the traditional sod houses and dog teams for frame homes, snowmobiles, motorboats and all-terrain vehicles in recent decades, most still fish, hunt and forage for their food. Just as their ancestors did.Hunter is among them, and says the traditional way of life also helps keep her grocery bills low. But she is starting to notice climate change impacting a well-practiced routine. Summers are hotter, and winters are getting warmer. Hunter said in past years, the salmon would come up first through the Kuskokwim River in June and the berries would be ready for picking in August. But now the berries are ripening earlier, overlapping with the fishing season. That means people have to fish and harvest fruit at the same time in order to store enough food for the winter.""It's a little difficult to do both at once,"" Hunter told DW. ""[You have to] worry about your fish and then [have to] think of your berries.""Elders predicted climate changeThis summer's heat wave was another sign of climate change. It sent temperatures up to 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in early July — a first in places such as Alaska's biggest city, Anchorage. When Enakenty Sallison, who lives in Bethel, one of western Alaska's hub towns, went fishing during the spell of intense heat, he found dead salmon. ""I didn't know why they were dying until I read this article saying the heat wave was what was killing them,"" Sallison said.Following media reports of further sightings in a tributary of the Yukon River, north of Bethel, biologists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the University of Alaska Fairbanks began to research the die-off. But some in western Alaska say climate change is not a surprise. Many have heard the elders passing down stories about climate change and how to prepare for it. Hunter remembers an elder coming to her school when she was a teenager and saying ""down states weather"" would come up here to Alaska.""I wonder how he [knew] this stuff even though he couldn't read,"" she said. ""Sure enough, we're having the weather that he's talking about.""She worries that the changing weather will make it harder for her grandchildren to fish and hunt, and that it will become even more challenging to travel in the winter as the ice freezes later and is no longer as thick. Read more: Alaska's sea ice loss means boom in polar bear tourismSearch and rescue groups, usually made up of volunteers from local villages, are already seeing the consequences of higher temperatures — 2016 was the warmest winter on record for Alaska, and 2018 the second warmest. This year, four people died in the southwest of Alaska driving their snow machines into open water or falling through thin ice. Bethel Search and Rescue volunteer Mark Leary recovered some of the bodies.""People are, they have to, [push] the envelope of safety so that they can start traveling by their own means,"" Leary said. He says airports are becoming ever more crowded as people turn to planes to get to bigger hubs, like Bethel, where they can find medical help or shop for groceries not available in the village stores. Thinning ice, shifting communitiesErosion is another big challenge in western Alaska, where most communities have been established near a river or on the Bering Sea coast, close to their main food source. Though erosion isn't new, as the ocean warms the sea ice that acts as coastal protection is weakening. And that means the shoreline is creeping closer to established villages. The thawing permafrost also destabilizes the ground beneath homes.Read more: Climate change: A village falls into the seaNewtok, a coastal village that's vulnerable to ocean storms, is already moving its 350 residents 14 kilometers (9 miles) away.

Tribal leaders are also starting to consider a move.""I think it's time to start preparing. It's coming, there's no way about it,"" Warren Jones, one of the village's leaders and the main advocate for moving, told DW. ""We have to relocate to better ground.""With the 2018 National Climate Assessment — a report drafted every four years and sent to the US Congress and president — stating that Alaska is at the front lines of climate change, and Alaska Natives poised to feel the brunt of our warming world, Jones hopes more villages will consider following Newtok's lead.In the meantime, tribal leaders in southwest Alaska have been meeting with state government officials and local organizations to draft a climate adaptation plan. While she waits for the outcome, Teresa Hunter plans to adapt in her own way, by bartering her berries for more salmon. Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

298	0	OPINION: Whatever option councillors choose to restore our beloved central library, “the city’s living room” as some call it, there is one thing they should not do: privatise the building. This isn’t a question of ideology. It’s simply the wrong way to harness the city’s commercial energy, and would work out badly for ratepayers. In their latest report to councillors, city council staff say a developer “may be willing to purchase the existing library building, remediate it and lease council the space”. As someone who spent several years covering such deals as a reporter in Britain, I would strongly advise against this. It would be a kind of permanent public-private partnership (PPP). Wellington is already having to watch one PPP go horribly wrong, in the form of Transmission Gully. More generally, such deals always run up against one core problem: a lack of control when faced with an unpredictable future. In the UK, I reported on PPP schools, where private firms built and ran school buildings on 30-year leases. Often the school’s principal would, some years down the track, decide that they wanted to open up the building after hours for adult education night classes. At which point the private operator would say, ‘’No, you can’t – that’s not in the contract.’’ Or they would say, ‘‘Yes, you can – for a very large fee.’’ READ MORE: * Ratepayers set to foot the bill for proposed $200 million Wellington central library upgrade * New Wellington mayor Andy Foster resolute the Central Library should be repaired  Once you have given a firm a decades-long (or permanent) contract to control a building, you have that worst of all possible situations: a private monopoly. If you haven’t anticipated a particular change you want to make, they have you over a barrel. This is especially relevant for a library, a complex, multifaceted building that is likely to change what it does – and how it does it – many times in the coming decades. Just look at Christchurch’s extraordinary new library, with its music studios and children’s play areas alongside traditional bookshelves. How different it is from a city library in the 1980s! It is simply impossible to predict all such changes in a contract signed today – and if the council tried to write in a vague ‘’option to make unspecified changes’’, the resulting cost would be exorbitant. Council staff suggest privatisation would be “more flexible”, but it would in fact be the precise opposite. One counter-argument is that public bodies frequently rent office space. But offices are generic, easily changed, tangential to the actual business done within. A library is a centrepiece of a city, a building and purpose intimately entwined. It can’t be easily shifted. So the council needs complete control over it. Council staff also hope that privatisation would “free up funding”, but if you sell a building and lease it back, all you are doing is shifting the moment you pay for something, not reducing the amount. And because, as above, you pay over the odds for unanticipated changes, it ends up costing you more anyway. Borrowing – which the council can generally do more cheaply than a developer – is a better route to financial flexibility. None of this is a criticism of private enterprise. In the case of the British PPP schools, the contractors were simply doing what the contract allowed. And we want vibrant commercial energy in many corners of our city: in shops, housing developments, film studios. But the public sector often finds it hard to harness that energy well, and can only do so from a position of control. Mayor Andy Foster seems to understand this: he said last week that he wants the private sector’s “skill and knowledge … in terms of their thoughts about how we do this job, not in their ownership of the building”. That’s exactly the right approach, and I hope he sticks to it. The library has always had a commercial element, in the form of Clark’s Café – but on a lease from the council, not as the owner. Nikau is a similarly vibrant commercial addition to Te Ngākau/Civic Square. As the Norwegian politician Jens Stoltenberg once said, “The market is a good servant, but a bad master.” The city council needs to restore our wonderful library, a beautiful piece of civic life, from a position of strength – and bring in the private sector where needed.

765	4	"OPINION: When Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg inspired a millennials' global movement – students striking for climate-change action to 'save the future' – she posed a rhetorical question: Why should her generation be forced to study when ""the most important facts given by the finest scientists are ignored by our politicians"". Those last words of hers, ""ignored by politicians"", ought to be resonating with MPs, mayors and councillors everywhere who fancy getting re-elected.    In New Zealand, as well as in many of the other 40 industrialised countries, climate action to curb global warming and restore some hope in the future is either very slow to get off the ground or just not happening. The planet, meanwhile, gets hotter by the year, firestorm hot. But there's a groundswell in New Zealand for a radical policy shift, a groundswell that could turn into a storm-surge of public concern. READ MORE: * The NZ council leading the way in determining who pays for climate change * Climate strike: Students will soon realise lasting change is hard to come by * Climate change: Why are we striking? * Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern met with student climate change protesters in Wellington When high school students skip class and take to the streets, the issue must be compelling – and it is. Trouble is, there are many ways to address it. An underlying impediment straight off is New Zealand's environmental framework, legal and institutional. It needs overhauling if we are to responsibly tackle the causes and consequences of global warming and sea-level rise.   The Resource Management Act provides woefully little direction to councils about how to tackle coastal erosion and flooding, and councils themselves – 63 of 78 councils front the sea – are basically doing their own thing through their own district plans on the basis of what they can afford and how far politically they can go. More than a few councils lack appropriate expertise and financial resources, and there is inconsistency across the country.          Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been clear about her desire for action. In 2017, she said: ""We will take climate change seriously . . . I am determined that we will tackle it head-on.""  But coalition government is often a mishmash of policy trade-offs, and the promised climate legislation, envisaging new institutions like a Climate Change Commission, is a long time coming. Dismayingly, it is merely a first step, the curtain raiser for real nuts-and-bolts climate action that will be necessary if we are to challenge the business-as-usual ethic. Halfway through its three-year term, the government has yet to reveal a final version of the new legislation. In the UK, similar legislation went through the House of Commons 10 years ago (490 votes for, three against) to set Britain on a pathway of lowering carbon emissions. Could the same cross-party support happen here? It needs to. Britain's carbon dioxide emissions have been tracking downwards ever since, which is what five-year rolling carbon budgets and targets – and proper carbon charging, not shonky Ukrainian credits – can do.    Without budget constraints and a heftier price on carbon emissions, New Zealand's attempt to limit carbon dioxide emissions has been tracking in the opposite direction. Whereas our rise in greenhouse gases may be excused because they amount to just a fraction of one per cent of global emissions, the fact is a quarter of global GHGs are generated by countries emitting under one per cent. Responsibility starts at home. The UK not only got a jump on us in carbon-emission reduction; it is way ahead in terms of coastal hazard preparedness. It has produced 22 coastal management plans covering all of the England and Wales coastline, with explicit policies on building new sea walls, upgrading existing ones, establishing rules and coastal setbacks for vulnerable low-lying areas, and providing for retreats. In New Zealand, only Auckland Council and the Hawkes Bay's partnership of councils have got anything comparable to the British coastal policies. Mind you, in Britain the responsibility for managing coastal hazards lies with the central government, not with the local authorities. In New Zealand, coastal hazard management is divided between territorial authorities (city and district), which are responsible as far as the high tide mark, and regional councils and a few unitary ones, which have responsibility seawards of high tide. A central government takeover of coastal management is not being actively discussed in public, but it's the kind of radical policy shift that might need to happen if New Zealand is to solidly prepare for coastal erosion and flooding from an invading sea. Low-lying coastal areas, at the mercy of a rising sea and increased storminess, are at the frontline of climate change. The coast, where most of us live, is also the frontline with the most to lose. There's drama, socially and economically – think of Granity in the Buller District, Haumoana in Hawkes Bay, Christchurch's eastern suburbs and South Dunedin. Since the 1990s, New Zealand has been found wanting on climate action. Central government stands accused of doing too little too slowly and being too inclined to leave the tough decisions to the next generation. From the 1990s, we took our place at United Nations climate summits and ratified accords from Copenhagen, Kyoto and Paris. We might have thought we were doing out bit. We weren't. Twelve years a councillor (Otago Regional Council and Dunedin City Council), I decided not to stand at the last election. Instead, I wanted to write a book, The Invading Sea, about what I predict will be the standout environmental issue of the 21st century.   In the grip of global warming, wildfires, droughts and weather extremes will continue to stalk humanity, but Earth's surface is 70 per cent water and the combination of a warming ocean and melting ice sheets will cause sea levels to rise through this century and probably the next. I recently became a grandfather for the first time. My grand-daughter could see in the 22nd century. Every grandparent, especially those in a decision-making role, should reflect on what they are doing – or what they could do – to make the future safer for their descendants. Whereas prior generations were unaware of climate change or blithely ignored the signals, future generations will be powerless to stop it unless governments like ours take action.   You can't blame teenagers today for rising up and taking to the streets to influence decision-makers in government and councils. Someone's got to get radical about climate change.

348	5	When it comes to the political will and leadership needed to drive the world towards a sustainable future, I’m a pessimist. Time and time again, I’ve heard rhetoric from politicians focusing on short-term goals at the expense of planning for the future. In 2021, the mainstream media promote responsible journalism and take a hard line with climate deniers. Many journalists hold governments to account over climate change goals. However, hard scientific data is often still manipulated and cherrypicked by politicians. I’ve spoken to many and liken the experience to walking through treacle.Does their bland decision-making have to do with the structure of democracy itself, with its short electoral terms and lack of incentives for incumbent politicians to make hard and binding decisions for the decades ahead?As I look around and see New Zealand’s highways, jammed with huge diesel trucks and ever-increasing numbers of petrol-powered SUVs and cars, I feel dread. It doesn’t have to be this way. What is it about living on a finite planet that humans either don’t or won’t understand, after all the studies and warnings show that continuing in this way leads to the inevitable collapse of the planet’s ecosystems?When you look at the true cost of the damage to the atmosphere, politicians’ claims that action on carbon reduction is too expensive become bizarre. When we burn fossil fuels, we’ve never factored in the ultimate cost of the damage to the atmosphere caused by excess CO2. In many countries, if you pollute a waterway, you have to clean it up or pay a substantial fee for the damage – that cost has to be factored in to the cost of running your business. In the case of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, you can do that for little or no upfront and immediate cost. Are we offended by people polluting waterways because it is literally in your face whereas CO2 is a transparent gas?For most of the last few decades I have been disappointed with the lack of action on carbon emissions reductions by politicians. But on the other hand, I’m very optimistic when it comes to the extraordinary ingenuity of human beings. We already have the tools to combat climate change. The last two decades have seen massive advances in renewable energy electricity generation to the point where these sources are now cheaper than equivalent coal-burning power plants, even before the cost of damage to the atmosphere is taken into account. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that, in 2019, almost 30% of OECD electricity was met by renewable sources including hydro, solar, wind, biomass and geothermal.Crucial to the urgent transition towards a low carbon future will be the skills and experience of engineers. Over the years I’ve spoken to many groups of engineers, including oil and gas engineers, about climate change. You’d think that a climate scientist talking to a gas engineer would lead to an argument, but that has not been my experience.Those same gas and other engineers who have been so maligned by the green movement have the vital skills needed in a new sustainable economy.Their skills are transferable to an economy making widescale use of “green hydrogen”, for example. Green hydrogen, produced by electrolysis of water using excess electricity derived from wind and other renewable energy sources, is already being used in steelmaking, energy storage and transport in Germany and a number of other countries.When I talk to people about this technology and its possibilities, they are astonished. They wonder why they have never heard of it. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has been around a long time – I remember first seeing it decades ago. Why hasn’t it been used? Several reasons come to mind, including conspiracy theories about the oil companies, but to me there is a simple answer. It’s because products made from fossil fuels appear to be so much cheaper than sustainable alternatives; the true cost of the climate emergency is never factored in when the products are sold to customers.So what is the true cost of the damage to the atmosphere when you emit a couple of tonnes of CO2 into it, perhaps during a longhaul flight between Auckland and London or by running a diesel-powered SUV for a year? There are a lot of different answers to that question depending on whether you ask an economist, politician, engineer or a climate scientist.If you ask a chemist how, and how much it would cost, to remove a tonne of CO2 from the atmosphere, they would probably throw up their hands in horror, come up with a figure of NZ$1,000 per tonne and a very complex apparatus. A climate scientist would reply to the question with another, like, “How much do you think the 2020 wildfires in Australia, California, Colorado, Siberia and the Arctic cost?” And a New Zealand economist would quote the current carbon price on the New Zealand emissions trading scheme site, which in early 2021 was about NZ$37 per tonne. To me that sounds ridiculously cheap, measuring in crude economic terms the cost of the damage by carbon emissions into our only atmosphere.We’ve been blinkered into thinking that there are no alternatives to fossil fuels for running an economy and society. But engineers and economists can point to several alternatives, and we need to adopt the ones that provide a sustainable future in this decade. A new field has emerged which has come to be known as “transition engineering”, where engineering and scientific principles are used to provide systems which do not compromise the ecological, societal and economic systems that future generations will depend on.Engineering solutions will be especially valuable in tackling the rapidly growing emissions from transport. Worldwide, liquid fuels like petrol and diesel for cars and trucks, jet fuel for aviation and bunker fuels for shipping accounted for more than 20% of total CO2 emissions in 2016. Growing at a faster rate than any other sector, transport poses a major challenge to reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. To keep global temperature rise within a range that averts the worst climate impacts, IPCC and other climate modelling show transport emissions must decline. Transitioning to zero-emission transport is crucial. Solutions include clean fuels, improved vehicle efficiency, changes to how we move people and goods, and building sustainable cities.Electrification eliminates tailpipe emissions of CO2 and particles that damage our lungs. It harnesses the potential to decarbonise the power grid. There is no doubt that reducing carbon emissions to avert disastrous impacts of climate change will be a gigantic undertaking. No single solution to this problem exists. It will require concerted effort from all parts of society, above all governments, but also engineers, scientists, economists, teachers and farmers. We can feel optimistic of the rapidly emerging technologies available to help reduce carbon emissions, among them hydrogen generation and storage from surplus electricity, synthesis of sugars from CO2 and water, information and nanotechnology, bioengineering and educational science to name a few. The challenges ahead are formidable but I truly believe that, given the will and with concerted action, human beings are more than capable of building a sustainable future.Dave Lowe is an atmospheric chemist and a lead author of the 2007 Nobel Prize-winning IPCC Fourth Assessment Report on climate change. This essay is an edited extract from his book The Alarmist: Fifty Years Measuring Climate Change (VUP, NZ$40)
346	5	THE Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body set up under the auspices of the United Nations to produce a global consensus on the science and economics of climate change, reports once every six years. On May 4th, it published the third tranche of its fourth report. The first two tranches, on the science of climate change and its impact around the world, made for depressing reading. Climate change was getting worse, mankind was responsible, and most regions—especially the poorer bits of the world—were going to suffer. The third tranche, by contrast, was upbeat. Climate change may threaten mankind, but mankind has a good chance of averting it—if it puts its mind to it.Some greenhouse-gas emissions, as the IPCC points out, can be cut at no cost at all—through straightforward measures such as improving insulation and binning wasteful incandescent light bulbs. Such measures could both save people and companies money, and save the planet from a chunk of carbon emissions. At present, they don't bother to do much, because electricity bills are not threatening enough; but governments might take a hand. The European Commission, for instance, is planning to ban incandescent light bulbs in two years' time. Such measures could make a difference, given that lighting accounts for 17% of global power consumption.In other areas, low-carbon technologies would be more expensive than conventional ones—but not necessarily exorbitant. In power generation, for instance, the biggest single source of carbon, the cost of wind and solar power has fallen sharply over the past couple of decades to the point where, in favourable locations, wind power can compete, in price terms, with more conventional forms of energy. Better still, the cost is likely to fall further. Wind turbines are going to go on getting bigger, and thin-film technology is likely to bring down the price of producing solar panels.Coal, as the IPCC recognises, remains a big challenge. It is enjoying a revival, partly because gas is expensive, and partly because coal supplies are widely distributed around the globe at a time when big energy consumers are keen to reduce their dependency on oil from politically volatile places such as the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela. Coal is the dirtiest fuel; but there are a number of projects to capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal and store them under the earth's surface. If that can be done on a large scale and at reasonable cost (a big if), it offers a quick fix for a sizeable proportion of emissions.But to bring such technologies to market, the cost of generating energy from fossil fuels will have to rise or the cost of generating energy from clean sources will have to fall, or both. That can be achieved by taxing carbon or subsidising clean energy, or both. Subsidies for clean energy are rising. George Bush, uncomfortable with anything that looks like a carbon tax and happy to pass round the pork, has been throwing money at companies investing in clean energy. Some European countries, such as Germany, have outdone him in their hurry to give taxpayers' money to renewables. Economists are uncomfortable with such measures, because history suggests that governments are bad at picking winning technologies; but these subsidies are certainly creating a demand for clean energy which should help bring down the price in the long run.The more important question, though, is whether the world is prepared to tax carbon. Europe is the only major power that prices carbon. It does so through its Emissions-Trading Scheme (ETS). Polluters are given tradable carbon credits up to a set level, and have to buy more if they want to emit more. This scheme has established a carbon price—though, thanks to some cunning footwork by national governments and industries, which overestimated emissions and thus persuaded the European Commission to over-allocate credits, the price is currently close to zero. That's not much use. The IPCC reckons that a carbon price of $20-50 by 2020-30 is needed to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at 550 parts per million. That is a level which some (but not all) scientists think reasonably safe: it would, says the IPCC, limit the increase in temperature to 2.8-3.2°C. To achieve this, it would have to be applied globally. Europe's price is moving in the right direction. The European Commission, angry with national governments and industries which, in its view, pulled a fast one in the first phase of the ETS, has slashed national allocation plans for the second phase, in 2008-12. The 2008 price has therefore risen, and hovers not far below €20 ($27).Even in the United States, there are signs of movement towards the idea of pricing carbon. California has legislated binding emissions reductions, which it plans to implement through a European-style cap-and-trade system. That means a carbon price. Threatened with the possibility of a patchwork of state-wide systems, many corporations have come to support the idea of a federal system. There is now a handful of competing bills in Congress that would legislate such a system; and most of the serious candidates for the 2008 presidential race agree with this idea.Whether America would really accept a price on the level that the IPCC envisages remains far from clear. Another big uncertainty is how the developing world, wary of anything that would limit its entitlement to grow, could be persuaded to buy into this idea. Yet there are some grounds for the upbeat tone of the IPCC's report.
376	0	"The Tokoroa SPCA has been dealt yet another blow after being forced to permanently close its op-shop. It comes amid financial and staffing troubles and follows a longline of issues plaguing its rescue centre.  That includes the 2016 drugging of a manager by a volunteer who became infatuated with her, two lengthy closures in 2018 following a major ringworm outbreak and management health issues, and weeks of closure in 2019 due to “unexpected"" staffing issues. The op-shop in Rosebery St closed prior to the Covid-19 lockdown with a sign advising customers that it would not reopen ‘[un]til further notice’. But following staff leaving and poor profits, northern region general manager Jen Radich has now confirmed it will remain shut permanently. READ MORE: * SPCA investigating after puppies dumped and drowned in bag at river * Horse waiting at SPCA for a home for four years takes record for longest stay animal * Continuous closures plague Waikato animal shelter  “The store was simply not financially viable and did not raise enough funds to justify staying open,” she said. “All SPCA op-shops were closed for many weeks throughout the recent Covid-19 pandemic resulting in a multi-million dollar shortfall for the charity, so we are very focussed on ensuring our limited resources go towards those op-shops likely to deliver revenue to support all our centres nationally. “Keeping the Tokoroa op-shop open was not going to be sustainable going forward.” She said any funds raised through SPCA op-shops were reinvested to provide animal care across all of its centres. With the Tokoroa op-shop making less than $5,000 profit annually, Radich said its closure has had little impact. “We are always happy to receive any donations though. They can be sold via one of our other stores to support animals across the country,” she said. She said the shop closure was not a sign that the SPCA’s main centre in Giles St was also set to close. “There are no current plans to close [the] Tokoroa centre,” she said. “We’re...always grateful to receive items for animal care at the centre and welcome offers of volunteer support at the centre as well.” Despite it remaining, it too has undergone a few changes with all adoptions now done via the SPCA’s website.  “As SPCA is now one organisation nationwide, new standardised processes were introduced throughout the recent pandemic. Online adoptions proved extremely popular,” Radich said. “Due to the success of the online adoptions process, all adoptions continue to be initiated via the SPCA website. “Further, we encourage people to look at animals available for adoption at neighbouring centres as we are often able to facilitate collection from a different centre to the one the animal is currently based.” She said the majority of SPCA op-shops throughout the country have reopened following the pandemic."
778	4	This article is part of our latest Museums special section, which focuses on the intersection of art and politics.About 66 million years ago, a giant asteroid hit the Earth, transforming climate so severely that approximately three-quarters of all species went extinct. Now, said Michael J. Novacek, senior vice president and provost of science at the American Museum of Natural History, “we’re kind of the asteroids.”As that human impact becomes an increasingly urgent — and increasingly politicized — subject, the museum is focusing its efforts to explore climate change in a way that emphasizes the science, not the controversy. Its approach includes continually updating its climate-related exhibits and planning to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day with a themed festival in April.There is “a comprehensive full-court press that we’re bringing to this,” said Ellen V. Futter, president of the museum. Its efforts to educate the public on climate change amount to “a lot of leverage, institutionally,” she added, “and we think that’s our role. We do have a civic mission.”That mission is never more clear than in the museum’s Rose Center for Earth and Space, where an immense, interactive climate-change wall dominates the Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth. Although the hall has had a climate-change display since its opening in 1999, the museum overhauled it extensively in 2018.Instead of a huge wall graphic, the hall now has what looks like a television screen for a giant. Made up of 36 tiles, each a 55-inch, high-definition digital monitor, the wall features imagery from NASA and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration along its upper surface. While you gaze at the floating continents from a voyaging astronaut’s perspective, you see a series of rotating statements informing you of facts like, “Human-caused carbon dioxide is warming our climate.” “We really envisioned that this would serve as the billboard for the climate-change exhibit,” said Lauri Halderman, the museum’s vice president for exhibition.But while most billboards remain static, the wall evolves. A few months ago, the museum added new images and material, including references to the so-called Camp Fire of 2018, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. The staff also incorporated NASA data about how much leaf coverage was gained and lost worldwide between June 2000 and June 2018. Now that 2019 end-of-year reports are available, the wall will reflect them as well.The goal, said Rosamond Kinzler, the museum’s director of science education, is to take the research findings and “really put that evidence in the hands of the visitors.”It is completely in their hands at the interactive stations lining the wall’s bottom edge. Each station has labeled panels with embedded buttons, dials and levers that will cause graphs, charts, maps and vivid images to appear low on the climate wall screens, directly in front of the viewer.“There’s so much noise around climate change that’s political noise, not scientific noise,” Ms. Halderman said. To make the science clear, “we were working to find many different ways to communicate.”The stations are grouped into three categories. “How Climate Works” explains subjects like the greenhouse effect, the oceans’ influence and the distinction between weather and climate. A climate quiz invites you to test your knowledge.“Our Warming World” illustrates the unfolding crisis. You use a lever to move through a graph of global temperatures over 140 years; slide another lever, and your view travels north or south over an image of the globe, where bright orange spots light up, revealing where climate change is most significant. Press buttons, and you see data on the relative effects of natural and human factors.Perhaps the most disquieting section is “Consequences of Climate Change,” which features “before and after” images of affected sites worldwide. An aerial photograph of Greenland in 2016 shows lakes and rivers that were not there in 2014 — that is how fast the ice is melting. If you turn a dial labeled “How Will Our Lives Change,” you see a graphic present a succession of possible outcomes, like disease spread, food shortages and political instability.But, Dr. Kinzler cautioned, “what will happen is related to what humans choose to do, which is frankly less about the science and more about societal questions and policy.” This is where hope creeps in. The display specifies the risks if warming continues unabated, but a video also explains local efforts like the NYC CoolRoofs initiative, a plan to reduce carbon emissions by painting rooftops with a heat-reflective white coating.Opposite the wall, another interactive exhibit documents how climate changed before human intervention. It includes a model of a Greenland ice core — a kind of 110,000-year-old time capsule — as well as objects like a glacial rock from Central Park.Climate research also appears in other areas of the museum. “Worlds Beyond Earth,” a new Hayden Planetarium show that opened in January, shows how studying other planets’ atmospheres provides clues to climate change here. And the Hall of Biodiversity, which includes a model of an African rain forest, illustrates how climate change affects ecosystems.All these departments will play a role in EarthFest. Scheduled for April 18, four days before Earth Day, the festival will offer “a mix of science, art, performance, participatory experiences and hands-on activities,” said Alonso Teruel, assistant director of public programs. “Everything will be climate change oriented.”Science presentations will include a planetarium-focused program and a new museum video highlighting the developments and challenges since Earth Day 1970. For young visitors, EarthFest will host Superhero Clubhouse, a Brooklyn organization whose Big Green Theater program helps elementary school students write original plays on environmental themes. The celebration will also incorporate Identification Day, an annual opportunity for visitors to bring in fossils and nature specimens, which experts will analyze for signs of climate change. The museum will show off some of its own rarely seen collections, as well as live creatures like spiders and other arthropods.“Insects tell an incredible story about climate change — where did they live and why,” Mr. Teruel said.Adult visitors can learn even more about insects’ roles on May 6, when the museum’s SciCafe, a monthly program of cocktails and conversation, will feature Mexican research on how the climate-driven spread of fruit flies affects an endangered fruit: the avocado.While the museum will present all these programs as science, not advocacy, its intent is to inform the public of the future’s possible risks — and rewards.“I like to say this is the most important century of the environment in the history of the human species,” Dr. Novacek said. “This is really the pivotal point in our evolution.”
740	5	"David Attenborough says climate change is ""our greatest threat in thousands of years"".  Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Reuters Humanity has wound back the climate clock 50 million years in just a couple of centuries, according to a new study.Between 2030 and 2040 our climate will match that of the mid-Pliocene - 3 million years ago - and by 2150, we'll be well on our way to recreating the Eocene, scientists in the US have claimed.Fifty million years ago temperatures spiked about 13degC hotter than they are now.If Earth warms by just 2degC, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, according to another global report in October.  ""The Arctic was occupied by swampy forests like those found today in the southern US,"" says the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This assumes greenhouse gas emissions keep rising as they have been in the past few decades.""In the roughly 20 to 25 years I have been working in the field, we have gone from expecting climate change to happen, to detecting the effects, and now, we are seeing that it's causing harm,"" said Jack Williams, professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.""People are dying, property is being damaged, we're seeing intensified fires and intensified storms that can be attributed to climate change. There is more energy in the climate system, leading to more intense events.""If significant efforts were made to decrease emissions, such switching to renewable energy, we could turn things around, the study says. Life has also proven to be extremely resilient, it adds. Prof Williams notes that many countries are moving away from fossil fuels toward more sustainable sources of energy. But more needs to be done, he says. ""We've seen big things happen in Earth's history - new species evolved, life persists and species survive. But many species will be lost, and we live on this planet.""These are things to be concerned about, so this work points us to how we can use our history and Earth's history to understand changes today and how we can best adapt.""The study findings built upon work Prof Williams first published in 2007, which compared possible future climates to historical climate data from the early 20th Century. "
809	5	"The levels of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere rose to a new record high last year, the UN's weather organization said on Thursday.According to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, there is also no sign of a reversal of this trend.The organization said the increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are a driving force for long-term climate change, rising sea levels and extreme weather events.Since 1990, the WMO has recorded a 41 percent increase in the warming effect of greenhouse gases. The increase in CO2, the main long-lived greenhouse in the atmosphere, is caused by human activities like burning coal and other fossil fuels.The global average concentrations of carbon dioxide reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, an increase both from 2016 and 2015.WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement that the window of opportunity to stop climate change ""is almost closed.""""The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth,"" he said.The data released by the WMO comes after an October report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which showed that net CO2 emissions must reach zero around 2050 in order to limit temperature increases. A temperature increase of under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) would reduce the consequences of global warming for humans and ecosystems.Both the reports will be the foundation for the UN climate change negotiations, which will take place in Katowice, Poland from December 2-14.The negotiations aim to set down the guidelines for the implementation of the Paris Climate Change agreement, which aims to keep the global temperature increase as close as possible to 1.5 degrees.""There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere,"" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova in a statement. ""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases."""
922	3	"NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have been collecting images of our planet using satellites since 1972. The mission's most recent satellite, Landsat 9, launched in September this year, is equipped with two instruments that capture imagery and together provide experts with data about crop health, irrigation use, water quality, wildfire severity, deforestation, glacial retreat and, urban expansion.The Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) detects visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared light in nine wavelengths, the combination of which can give experts more information about things beyond what the human eye can observe, like the health of vegetation, or the strength of a wildfire.The satellite's other instrument, Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), observes thermal radiation in two wavelengths to measure Earth's surface temperatures and its changes, and can help experts track plant health.""Landsat 9's first images capture critical observations about our changing planet and will advance this joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey that provides critical data about Earth's landscapes and coastlines seen from space,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. ""This program has the proven power to not only improve lives but also save lives. NASA will continue to work with USGS to strengthen and improve accessibility to Landsat data so decision makers in America -- and around the world -- better understand the devastation of the climate crisis, manage agricultural practices, preserve precious resources and respond more effectively to natural disasters.""The first pictures show locations around the US, including Detroit in Michigan beside Lake St Clair, the intersection of cities and beaches on the changing Florida coastline, and observations from Navajo Country in Arizona ""that will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and manage irrigation water,"" NASA said.The snapshots also provide data about the changing landscapes of more of the world's crucial habitats, including the Himalayas in High Mountain Asia and the coastal islands and shorelines of northern Australia.Landsat 9 has several improvements on its predecessors: It transmits data with higher radiometric resolution back down to Earth, allowing it to detect more subtle differences over darker areas like water or dense forests. Landsat 9 can differentiate some 16,000 shades of a given wavelength color, while Landsat 7, the satellite being replaced, detects only 256. ""First light is a big milestone for Landsat users -- it's the first chance to really see the kind of quality that Landsat 9 provides. And they look fantastic,"" said Jeff Masek NASA's Landsat 9 project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center. Landsat 8 will remain in orbit, and together, the two satellites will report on changes to Earth every eight days. "
274	1	The move to rescind environmental rules governing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, brings to 84 the total number of environmental rules that the Trump administration has worked to repeal. Officials at the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies have called the regulations burdensome to the fossil fuel industry and other businesses. Half of those environmental rollback attempts, like the new methane reversal, will undercut efforts by previous administrations to reduce emissions and fight climate change. Many of these efforts have been challenged in the courts; whether the administration will succeed in achieving all of its goals is far from certain. Here are some of the most significant climate-related reversals:One critical effort by the Trump administration was its announcement in 2017 that it would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. The process of withdrawing cannot be completed until 2020, but the move sent a strong signal to the world that Mr. Trump, who has scoffed at climate science, would be taking action at many levels of government to reverse climate policies created during the Obama administration.Thursday’s decision to remove restrictions on methane leaks from oil and gas wells is only one administration effort on behalf of fossil fuel producers. Burning natural gas produces half of the carbon dioxide that burning coal does, but methane, the chief component of natural gas, has a powerful effect on climate change. Though it does not persist in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide does, it has 80 times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide during 20 years in the atmosphere. The Obama administration had passed many rules to reduce methane leaks. An early effort by the E.P.A. under the former administrator Scott Pruitt to reverse Obama-era rules on leaks from new oil and gas wells was declared illegal by the courts in 2017. Transportation is the United States’ biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel efficiency standards were a signature Obama administration proposal for reducing those emissions, as well as other air pollution created by vehicles. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed freezing antipollution and fuel-efficiency standards for cars. The proposal puts the administration on a collision course with California, which sets its own stringent tailpipe standards — and even with automakers, who wish to avoid the complexity of dealing with two car markets with different emissions standards.The Clean Power Plan, President Obama’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by regulating carbon dioxide from existing fossil-fuel-powered electricity plants, was a big target for Mr. Trump, who campaigned in coal country on a promise to revive the ailing industry. He called for the E.P.A. to dismantle the Clean Power Plan in 2017. The planned substitute, unveiled in June as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, is the administration’s most sweeping plan to extend the lives of coal-burning plants and shore up the mining industry — an industry more threatened by economic change than regulation.In December 2017, President Trump embarked on the biggest land protection rollback in United States history when he squeezed two national monuments in Utah by some two million acres. The move shrank Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, and reduced Grand Staircase-Escalante by about half. The two monuments had received protection in the Obama and Clinton administrations. Subsequent reporting on the Bears Ears decision showed that it was guided by hopes for oil drilling.Similarly, the Trump administration is rushing to clear the way for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.The Trump administration has said it will allow offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all coastal waters of the United States, including the California coast, the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, as part of its “energy dominance” agenda. The decision reversed an Obama administration ban. It also repealed offshore drilling safety regulations put in place after the Deepwater Horizon spill. The administration delayed the release of its formal proposal, however, after a federal judge decision declared the initial executive order about the plan unlawful. The fossil fuel industry and other businesses have long bristled at the Endangered Species Act, which can restrict their ability to mine, drill and conduct other activity where threatened flora and fauna can be found. Earlier this month, the administration said it would change the act in ways that will make it harder to protect wildlife from climate change and other threats. The changes would make it easier to remove species from the endangered list, would allow a protection decision to be influenced by economic assessments, and make it more difficult to factor in effects of climate change that may be decades away. Even before that, however, the Interior Department opened nine million acres of Western land to oil and gas drilling by weakening habitat protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled bird beloved for its elaborate mating dance.For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.
959	5	"Human societies will soon start to experience adverse effects from manmade climate change, a prominent economist has warned.Prof Richard Tol predicts the downsides of warming will outweigh the advantages with a global warming of 1.1C - which has nearly been reached already.Prof Tol is regarded by many campaigners as a climate ""sceptic"".He has previously highlighted the positive effects of CO2 in fertilising crops and forests. His work is widely cited by climate contrarians.""Most people would argue that slight warming is probably beneficial for human welfare on net, if you measure it in dollars, but more pronounced warming is probably a net negative,"" Prof Tol told the BBC Radio 4 series Changing Climate.Asked whether societies were at the point where the benefits start to be outweighed by consequences, he replied: ""Yes. In academic circles, this is actually an uncontroversial finding.""But it is controversial for climate contrarians, who often cite Professor Tol's work to suggest that we shouldn't worry about warming.Matt Ridley, the influential Conservative science writer, said he believed the world would probably benefit from a temperature rise of up to 2C.""I think we probably will see 1.5 degrees of warming. The point is most people think 2C is when it turns catastrophic. That's not right. The literature is very clear; 2C is when we start to get harm. Up until then we get benefit,"" he said. ""We've got a greening in all ecosystems as a result of CO2. We've got about 11% more green vegetation on the planet than 30 years ago, much of which is down to the CO2 fertilisation effect.""On fertilisation Matt Ridley refers to unpublished work by Professor Ranga Myneni from Boston University. But he told BBC News Lord Ridley had accurately quoted his research on the impacts of current CO2 levels, but was unduly complacent about future warming. ""I am worried about how this work is being interpreted, by Lord Ridley. In my opinion, [CO2 fertilisation] benefit of greening is not worth the price of all the negative changes,"" he said.Richard Tol from Sussex University believes discussion over the impacts of a 2C temperature rise is largely irrelevant as the world is likely to warm by between 3-5C, because politicians at the forthcoming Paris climate summit won't be willing or able to make the scale of cuts needed to keep temperature rises under 2C.He says a rise of 4C would be undesirable but manageable for Europe and all nations rich enough to cope with the costs of adaptation. The best way of combating climate change, he told BBC News, was to maximise economic growth.Tim Lenton, professor of Earth systems science from Exeter University, told us this was a highly optimistic prognosis under a 4C rise.""The land surface of central Europe would be quite a lot more than 4C warmer on average, changing potentially the pattern of seasonality over Europe. ""We would have lost the summer Arctic sea-ice, [and] would have sea-ice cover radically thinned in winters. ""We're seeing already that appears to have some connection to changes in the pattern of weather and weather extremes and the changes in the distribution of rivers and river flows.""We might then speculate about how intense Mediterranean drying might drive... movements of people. It would be a very different Europe.""Johan Rockstrom, director of the Resilience Centre at Stockholm University, warns that the further we go above 2C, the more we risk triggering irreversible effects.""What takes us to 6C is not carbon emissions, it is biosphere response. Will we be able to maintain the natural carbon sinks in the permafrost, in the rainforests, in the boreal forests, in the wetlands and in the coastal regions? Because that's where the big stores are. ""We emit nine gigatons of carbon per year from our burning of fossil fuels, but there's a 100 gigatons lying just under the Siberia tundra. You have many-fold larger stores of carbon in the topsoil of tropical soils, or under the ice in the Arctic. ""If we don't manage the living ecosystems well enough they could start biting us from behind.""Changing Climate is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday, 16 November"

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced on Monday that he will commit a whopping $10 billion to fight climate change as part of a new initiative.The money, which will be doled out in grants via a new fund known as the Bezos Earth Fund, is one of the largest individual donations made so far to fight the effects of climate change. The fund will start issuing the grants this summer, Bezos said in the Instagram post announcing the news.The Amazon CEO, whose net worth is over $120 billion, said that ""climate change is the biggest threat"" to Earth and the money he's donating will ""fund scientists, activists, [non-government organizations] — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.""""We can save Earth,"" Bezos continued. ""It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.""Bezos has made other philanthropic moves in the past, including the announcement of a network of free preschools in low-income communities in 2018, according to the New York Times. In 2017, he tweeted that he was looking for philanthropy ideas to assist people in the short run. Separately on Monday, a new study was published that said extreme weather events caused by climate change could result in an economic recession ""the likes of which we've never seen before.""Similar studies have also been published in recent months that have tied in extreme weather and climate-related events to negatively impacting the economy. A study circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research in August suggested that ""virtually all"" nations will be negatively affected by climate change by 2100 if they do not abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement.In June, the United Nations Human Rights Council published a report that warned of a potential ""climate apartheid,"" splitting the planet between the wealthy and the rest of the world who will be ""left to suffer.""A separate study published in April 2019 warned of the startling economic dangers that pollution from plastic in the oceans could cause – perhaps as much as $2.5 trillion.Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over man’s impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change."
170	5	"Although industrial countries produce the lion's share of greenhouse gases globally, countries of the Global South are the ones facing the brunt of global warming — and they often have the least resources to adapt to changing weather patterns and rising seas.Mozambique is among such countries. Recurring droughts and floods destroy entire harvests, further threatening already precarious food security. One in four people already suffers from malnutrition, according to the World Food Programme. Increasingly intense tropical cyclones, torrential rains and rising sea levels threaten cities and villages along the country's coast, where 60 percent of Mozambicans live. Seven of the 11 major cities are located along the seaside.The impacts of climate change are being felt daily in these coastal cities — which is why their mayors have taken adaption into their own hands as part of a growing movement of mayors who are stepping up their game to fight climate change.Read more: Politicians think globally, act locally to fight global warmingBanking on natureIn the Quelimane Municipality for example, which lies in the center of Mozambique's coast, mayor Manuel de Araujo has invested in mangroves.""Sea level rise and erosion are a huge problem in my city as we have less and less land available for agricultural use,"" de Araujo explained to DW at the Resilient Cities conference in Bonn, Germany.""The mangroves are our first line of defense against the sea,"" He has traveled to Germany along with other mayors of coastal cities to share their best practices in how to make communities more resilient with limited resources.One important factor in most adaption projects is to involve the local community, de Araujo points out. This is especially the case in the mangrove project, as citizens usually cut mangroves to use the wood for cooking and to build houses.By involving local residents and informing them about the role of mangroves for the local ecosystem and economy through radio programs as well through church, women's and youth groups, he hopes they will protect the trees instead.""In my city, the number-one source of income is fishing,"" de Araujo said. It's important to understand that by cutting mangroves they are destroying the ecosystems where prawns and fish grow.""""When they see that fisheries increase, there is a big motivation for them to protect mangroves.""Read more: Protecting paradise on a budgetShoring up homesTagir Carimo, mayor of Pemba municipality in the north of the country, agrees that education is one of the most important aspects of making communities more resilient.In his city's plan to adapt to climate change, a key part of it is informing people and local politicians about the impacts of global warming so they understand which measures need to be implemented.Otherwise, ""people will just build their houses and then rainwater will wash them out,"" he said.Together with the Mozambique Costal Cities Adaption Program (which is funded by USAID), the cities of Pemba and Quelimane developed prototypes of resilient homes. They can be built with local materials, but are sturdier than traditional houses which are usually made of mangrove wood, mud and palm leaves.The resilient homes have raised foundations to withstand floods, reinforced walls and steel roofs to weather cyclones.So far, funding has only sufficed for 12 pilot houses. But since local carpenters and other workers were invited to participate in the project, the mayors have noticed that elements of the resilient houses are incorporated elsewehere.People replicate the parts they can afford, he says. ""Some people might build their houses on a higher foundation but don't have enough money for the steel roof; others are inspired by the reinforced walls,"" explained de Araujo.""It's still better than what they had before.""A positive side effect of this project is that local carpenters learned new skills that created opportunities for them to generate additional income, he added.Another aspect of strengthening homes is ensuring that they are not built in the most vulnerable parts of the city, for example in flood areas and seafront zones.Read more: Extreme weather: 'Africa is most vulnerable'To that end, Pemba's mayor Carimo has developed a ""vulnerability map"" which can be used to advise residents on where and how to build their houses.In reality, the advice isn't always taken up, he admits, because especially poor people who are new to the city move to informal settlements.Building alliancesYet, even with the most creative and innovative ideas, there is only so much local politicians can do with limited financial and human resources, the mayors asserted.Therefore, a vital part of their fight against climate change is also about building alliances with local, national and international networks — and in attracting donors.Read more: Climate finance: Footing the bill for a global crisisPemba has an annual budget of $2 million per year to fix roads, pay wages, and so on. ""It's not enough to face a challenge like climate change, that's why we are focusing on international networks and finding a twin city with similar problems to connect and learn,"" said Carimo.With a huge smile, he added that his town is in the most beautiful part in Mozambique, in case anyone attending the conference would like to invest.The coastal cities have organized themselves into a compact: the Mozambique National Association of Municipalities (ANAMM), to increase their impact and make their voices heard on a national level.And the government has begun to listen, said Eduardo Nguenha, secretary general of ANAMM.""The Paris Climate Agreement was signed by countries — but at the end of the day, it's local governments that design and implement tools, it's very much a bottom-up approach,"" Nguenha said at the cities conference.""Now, the national government comes to us so they have something to report back to their international partners,"" he concluded."
173	3	The following is a transcript of President Biden’s remarks about climate change and Hurricane Ida after he toured damage from the storm in neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey on Tuesday.Chuck, thank you very much. As the old joke goes, my father were here, he’d say thank you, and my mother were here, she would say, “Who are you talking about?”Look, folks, let me begin by saying I wish every American could walk down this alley with me to see and talk to the people who have been devastated, just talk to them. None of them were shouting or complaining. Every one of them were thanking me as if it was something special — I mean it sincerely — that I was here and hoped that we’d be able to do something.This is America, where I am standing right now. These are the people, whether it’s Scranton or Claremont or anywhere around the world — the country, who built this country. And it’s about time we step up. They’re always the first ones that are hurt and the last ones that are helped. But that’s not going to happen this time.The group I have standing with me led by Chuck Schumer and your — Congresswoman, is this your district? Oh, it’s Grace’s district. I want to thank her personally for her gumption, the way she’s fought and hollered and fought so hard for all the people in this alley. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.But that goes for everybody here. And look, folks. You know, I want to thank governor for — and Leader Schumer and Kirsten — I should say Senator Gillibrand — and Congresswoman [Grace] Meng and [Representative Carolyn B.] Maloney and [Representative Gregory W.] Meeks, Mayor [Bill] de Blasio for being here. You know, it’s not — how can I say this? Sometimes some very bad things happen that have a tendency to bring out the best in a people and a country.And I think what people are seeing across this country, from the wildfires in California and the Far West, which I’m heading to in a couple days, all the way to, down in Louisiana in the Gulf, where I was a couple days ago, to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, to a lesser extent, Delaware, to a lesser extent, and New York.People are beginning to realize this is much, much bigger than anyone was willing to believe. And the whole segment of our population denying this thing called climate change. But I really mean it.Sometimes my mother used to say out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it. Well, I think we’ve all seen, even the climate skeptics are seeing that this really does matter. And it’s not just whether or not people who are just trying to get by in these homes, in these alleys here, working their butts off, do well.It’s people in high towers along the shore who find that as this rain and all this change takes place in the groundwater, the buildings are actually beginning to tilt. Hundred-story buildings — this goes so far beyond what anybody’s willing to speak to up to now.We just finished surveying some of the damage in the neighborhood, here in Queens. And earlier today, we were in the Raritan Valley in New Jersey, which also got badly, badly hit. Walking these neighborhoods, meeting the families and the first responders, seeing how folks are doing after this destruction and pain and another devastating storm, is an eye-opener.The people who stand on the other side of the fences who don’t live there, who are yelling that we are talking about and interfering with free enterprise by doing something about climate change — they don’t live there. They don’t live, they don’t understand. And you know, last week, right here, in so many other communities, these waves crashed through the streets here, testing the aging infrastructure and taking lives. More lives were taken here than down in Louisiana.Let me say that again. They had over 20 inches of rain. They had 178-mile-an-hour winds, gusts. And more lives were taken here than down in Louisiana. And you know, you all saw the harrowing images of stories and families trapped in flooding basements and struggling to survive. Well, you didn’t have to — you just go along this valley. I’m sure the press has done that.My message to everyone grappling with this devastation is: We’re here, we’re not going home till this gets done. I really mean that. We’re not leaving. We’re going to continue to shout as long as it takes to get real progress here.Folks — and we have to take some bold action now to tackle the accelerating effects of climate. If we don’t act — now I’m going to be heading, as Chuck knows, as the senator knows, I’m going to be heading from here to Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP meeting [United Nations Climate Change Conference], which is all the nations of the world getting together to decide what we are going to do about climate change. And John Kerry, the former secretary of state, is leading our effort, putting it together.We are determined, we are determined that we are going to deal with climate change and have zero emissions, net emissions by 2050. By 2020, make sure all our electricity is zero emissions. We’re going to be able to do these things. But we’ve got to move. We’ve got to move. And we’ve got to move the rest of the world. It’s not just the United States of America.And so, folks, this summer alone, communities with over 100 million Americans — 100 million Americans call home — have been struck by extreme weather. One in every three Americans has been victimized by severe weather. The hurricanes along the Gulf, the East Coast, up through this community. And I saw the human and physical cost firsthand, as I said, in Louisiana.But, governor, you called Phil Murphy — Governor Murphy — so many leading with urgency and action are saying enough, enough. And there’s not a single request I’m aware of — there may be something — that we haven’t signed off on, that we haven’t signed off yet.And here’s the deal. The New York Fire Department, the New York Police Department, the Sanitation Department and other first responders, they’re leading with incredible, incredible courage. Two linemen have been killed in trying to make sure we have [inaudible].And, folks, the evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here, it’s not going to get any better. The question: Can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse.And when I talk about building back better — and Chuck is fighting for my program, for our program on the Hill — when I talk about building back better, I mean you can’t build to what it was before this last storm. You got to build better so that if the storm occurred again, there would be no damage. There would be.But that’s not going to stop us, though, because if we just do that, it’s just going to get worse and worse and worse. Because the storms are going to get worse and worse and worse. And so, folks, we’ve got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red.The nation and the world are in peril. And that’s not hyperbole. That is a fact. They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living in it real time now.We can look around the wreckage and the ruins and the heartbreak from so many communities to feel it. You don’t understand, you can feel it, you can taste it, you can see it. Precious lives lost in Louisiana and New Jersey and New York. Families living in shelters, subway stations flooded, decaying infrastructure pushed beyond the limits, lives and livelihoods interrupted once again. We’re working closely with the governors and mayors and members of Congress and community leaders.On Sunday, I immediately approved the disaster declaration of Governor [Kathy] Hochul to rush federal assistance to where it was needed — here. FEMA’s working intensively with state and local officials, assessing the damage and mobilizing resources.One of the things I want to thank Chuck for, as leader of the Senate: He has helped mobilize state, local and federal. When they’re all working together, that’s when things happen positively.The health and human services secretary is working with the state to ensure folks on Medicare and Medicaid get the emergency care they needed. They’re going to make sure it’s equitable so that the hardest hit, including lower-income folks, communities of color and the elderly and the most vulnerable, get help and get it first. They are the ones in the greatest need.And there’s much to be done in working around the clock in all these critical needs and areas. Look, I say to anyone who can hear this if this is broadcast: If you need help, please go to disasterassistance.gov. Or call 1-800-621-FEMA. 1-800-621-3362. We can get you help now.And I know these disasters aren’t going to stop. They’re only going to come with more frequency and ferocity. As I said, I’m working in Congress to pass two important pieces of legislation that this man here is honchoing through the Congress for me.The bipartisan plan to modernize our physical infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our power transmissions, our distribution lines. How many bridges I just went through in New Jersey that had been overflowed by the river? The river’s gone higher than the bridges, having done damage to them.My “Build Back Better” plan with key investments to fight climate change, cutting emissions and make things more resilient. Each dollar we invest, every dollar — we raise a city block by two feet, flood-proof power stations, sanitations, reduction in the buildup of kindling in our forest, installing electrical lines underground rather than overhead — saves us six dollars for every single dollar we spend to do those things.Because the next time disaster strikes, the flood is contained, the fire doesn’t spread as widely, and power stays on. Not to mention those investments save lives, homes and create good-paying union jobs.I hosted 56 heads of state in Washington. And I pointed out, we’re talking about climate change, and I said I think of one word when I think of climate change: jobs. Good-paying jobs. Each of these things requires a good-paying job, not $7 or $12 or $15, but $45, $50 an hour plus health care. That’s what is needed. And so, folks — and also, Wall Street, not too far from here, acknowledges that if we spend the money on these things, we’re going to grow the economy, increase employment.You know, the fire in Oregon sent smoke all the way to the Atlantic. A storm in the Gulf, as you have now figured out, can reverberate 10 states away. Supply chains and crop production get interrupted, driving up costs, devastating industries all over America. This is everybody’s crisis. Everybody’s crisis.And let me just say, again: The fact is that the damage done on the West Coast, which I’ll be heading to, they’ve already burned five million acres to the ground. That’s bigger than the state of New Jersey, if I’m not mistaken. Five million acres. And you see it by the smoke that ends up coming over the East Coast.Folks, we’re all in this. It’s about time we stopped the regional fights and understand helping somebody make sure there’s no fewer fires in the West warrants helping people in this alley make sure they’re not flooded.And by the way, it’s not just the flooding. I’ll end with this — not just the flooding. Flooding ends up overrunning sanitation systems. And it causes disease. People get sick, and it’s serious, serious business. So we’ve got a lot of work to do.Again, it’s good-paying jobs. We can put the economy back on a path to real growth. But in the meantime, we’re going to save a whole hell of a lot of people’s lives, and we’re going to save a whole hell of a lot of money.God bless you all. Let’s get this done.

Speaking with Sky News, Mr Albanese said he hoped that collaboration continued beyond the pandemic and into other policy areas such as climate change.""Since 2013 there’s no plan to deal with climate change and that’s one of the things that I hope happens arising out of this, just as we were talking about listening to the medical experts,” the Labor leader said.“I think we should listen to science, much more on issues like climate change, and I hope that the government takes its newfound respect for science and expert advice and puts it into practice in other policy areas.”"
86	5	Scientists warn that if global emissions are not curbed parts of the world will experience larger and more frequent extreme waves over the next 80 years.Using thousands of modeled ocean wave extremes from the past century, along with two alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios, the team found the frequency of these events could increase by 10 percent.A warming world is creating stronger storm winds that are triggering the massive waves and as a result, the 100-year events may begin to occur every 50 or even 20 years instead.Extreme waves can reach heights of 65 feet, which is as high as a stack of four double-decker buses, and would affect 60 percent of the world's coastline - primarily the Southern Ocean. Scroll down for video Scientists warn that if global emissions are not curbed parts of the world will experience larger and more frequent extreme waves over the next 80 yearsThe stark warning comes from a team at the University of Melbourne, who shared in a statement: ‘Our new research suggests that by the end of the century the magnitude of extreme wave events will have increased by up to 10 percent over extensive ocean regions, and the frequency of storms that generate extreme waves will have increased by five to 10 per year.’‘This may not sound like a big increase, but it means that almost 60 percent of the world’s coastline will experience larger and more frequent extreme waves.’Researchers also make note of the 290 million people that live below the 100-year flood level, which is an area that has at least one percent probability of flooding every year.‘An increase in the risk of extreme wave events may be catastrophic, as larger and more frequent storms will cause more flooding and coastline erosion,’ reads the blog post by the researchers. Using thousands of modeled ocean wave extremes from the past century, along with two alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios, the team found the frequency of these events could increase by 10 percentThe team used data from thousands of modeled ocean wave extremes that they collected over the past century.The extremes came from global wave models based on wind forces generated from seven different global climate models.These were then compared to two alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios - one where emissions are quickly rising and the other they are curbed. Not only did the results show a 10 percent in extreme wave frequency, but the largest increase of wave size and most occurring was found in the Southern Ocean, which will have an impact on most Pacific coastlines. Pictured are waves in the Southern OceanNot only did the results show a 10 percent in extreme wave frequency, but the largest increase of wave size and most occurring was found in the Southern Ocean, which will have an impact on most Pacific coastlines.'Importantly, the unique approach we have applied means that we can estimate future wave extremes with a higher confidence than previously possible., shares teh team.'Our analysis considers the whole globe, but the impacts of tropical cyclones on future wave heights aren’t well understood yet and are an area of ongoing study.'Global sea levels could rise as much as 1.2 metres (4 feet) by 2300 even if we meet the 2015 Paris climate goals, scientists have warned.The long-term change will be driven by a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica that is set to re-draw global coastlines.Sea level rise threatens cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives.It is vital that we curb emissions as soon as possible to avoid an even greater rise, a German-led team of researchers said in a new report.By 2300, the report projected that sea levels would gain by 0.7-1.2 metres, even if almost 200 nations fully meet goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.Targets set by the accords include cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of this century.Ocean levels will rise inexorably because heat-trapping industrial gases already emitted will linger in the atmosphere, melting more ice, it said.In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2°F).Every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimetres (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300.'Sea level is often communicated as a really slow process that you can't do much about ... but the next 30 years really matter,' lead author Dr Matthias Mengel, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Potsdam, Germany, told Reuters.
41	5	"The GOP is ceding important ground by tolerating and encouraging denialism on this critical topic. Mitt Romney's remarks on NBC's Meet the Press earlier this month rankled environmental activists hoping for a bipartisan approach to climate change. ""I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet,"" the Republican presidential nominee told David Gregory. ""I'm in this race to help the American people."" The comment was meant as a dig at some of President Obama's more high-flying rhetoric from the 2008 campaign, but it also laid bare a significant difference in outlook between the parties: When it comes to the issue of climate change, Republicans have taken a decidedly unrealistic tack.The available evidence overwhelmingly suggests that climate change is real; that extreme weather events are increasing, likely due to climate change; and that this dynamic will have an impact on American national-security interests, if it hasn't already. This year's curiously hot summer was accompanied by the worst drought that the U.S. has experienced in 50 years -- a phenomenon that not only hurts Americans, but is having ripple effects throughout the world as crops wither and food prices increase in nations that can barely afford the price shocks. But the GOP's leading political figures have not been raising the alarm about the connection.That's unfortunate -- both for the GOP and for America. While the GOP has traditionally held an electoral advantage on national-security issues -- something that apparently will not be the case in this year's election -- its stance on environmental issues also could have a decidedly negative impact on American national security.Climate change denialism remains a powerful current within the Republican party, and is a stance honored by most of the candidates who sought this year's GOP presidential nomination. Though Romney argued for reductions in carbon emissions when he governed Massachusetts, he changed his tune on the campaign trail. He said at one point that he thought the world was getting hotter, but added, ""I don't know that, but I think that it is."" As to human contributions, Romney allowed, ""It could be a little. It could be a lot."" On another occasion, Romney stated outright, ""My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.""Meanwhile, the evidence that climate change is a real and pressing problem continues to mount. Not only do heat records continue to fall, butthe extreme weather events that we have seen with increasing regularity furtherunderscore the problem. As James Hansen, who directs the NASA Goddard Institutefor Space Studies, wrote recently about a new analysis he conducted of six decades of temperature data, ""our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change."" Events that can be attributed to climate change, according to his research, include the deadly heat wave that gripped Europe in 2003, the heat wave that rocked Russia in 2010 and caused spontaneous fires, and the droughts that have hit Texas and Oklahoma.This is not a ""soft"" issue that should be of concern only to environmentalists. Climate change can be destabilizing in international affairs, a fact that the Department of Defense is now trumpeting. As the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report notes, climate change contributes to food and water scarcity, provoking or exacerbating mass migrations, and amping up conflicts over resources. The report states, ""While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.""We have seen this dynamic at play in recent years. The global food crisis of 2008was destabilizing, causing unrest in the Middle East, Africa, and South America; and this summer's drought will similarly be felt throughout the world. As Robert Thompson, who studies food security at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs, recently said, ""What happens to the U.S. supply has an immense impact around the world. If the price of corn rises high enough, it also pulls up the price of wheat. I think we are in for a very serious situation worldwide."" The full impact the drought will have throughout the globe remains to be felt, but we can already see world food prices rising.Some prominent Republicans have admirably tried to reframe the debate within theparty by arguing that climate change should be seen as a national security problem. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham co-wrote a New York Times op-ed with John Kerry in 2009 arguing in favor of climate-change legislation; Inside Energy, a prominent newsletter examining federal energy policies, notes that former Virginia senator John Warner has also argued that ""climate change is a national security issue because it could spawn global conflicts that could require a response by the U.S. military.""It is past time for Republican leaders to come around to this reality, and for candidates to formulate a fact-based approach to this significant problem. Environmental issues and national security ones are increasingly intertwined, with climate change the leading edge of this connection. It isn't clear that Republicans will lose electoral support if their environmental policies have a second-order consequence of making the U.S. less safe, though they may (already, some evidence suggests that failure to appeal to environmentally-minded voters is costing the GOP). What is clear, though, is that ignoring climate change won't make it go away -- and that America will be worse off if Republicans fail to act."
66	4	“Each degree of warming causes way more fire than the previous degree of warming did. And that’s a really big deal.”On a hot July evening last year, a rancher tried to use a hammer and stake to plug a wasp’s nest. The hammer slipped, a spark flew, and a patch of dry grass ignited, according to the Los Angeles Times. Within minutes, the brush fire fed on bone-dry conditions and became too big to control.It soon merged with another blaze and became the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest wildfire in California’s history. It burned almost half a million acres, or roughly 720 square miles, before it was finally extinguished four months later. It killed one firefighter and injured four.Californians may feel like they’re enduring an epidemic of fire. The past decade has seen half of the state’s 10 largest wildfires and seven of its 10 most destructive fires, including last year’s Camp Fire, the state’s deadliest wildfire ever. A new study, published this week in the journal Earth’s Future, finds that the state’s fire outbreak is real—and that it’s being driven by climate change. Since 1972, California’s annual burned area has increased more than fivefold, a trend clearly attributable to the warming climate, according to the paper.The trend is dominated by fires like the Mendocino Complex Fire—huge blazes that start in the summer and feed mostly on timberland. Over the past five decades, these summertime forest fires have increased in size by roughly 800 percent. This effect is so large that it is driving the state’s overall increase in burned area.Read: The simple reason that humans can’t control wildfiresWhy are summertime forest fires so much more likely? Because climate change has already redefined the seasons in Northern California. Since the early 1970s, summers in Northern California have warmed by about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees Celsius) on average. A few degrees may not sound like much, but heat has an exponential relationship with forest fire.“Each degree of warming causes way more fire than the previous degree of warming did. And that’s a really big deal,” Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University and an author of the paper, told me. Every additional increment in heat in the environment speeds up evaporation, dries out soil, and parches trees and vegetation, turning them into ready fuel for a blaze. For that reason, Williams said, hot summers essentially overpower anything else happening in Northern California. Even during a wet year, an intense heat wave can choke forests so that it is as though the rain never fell.And it matters that heat is prompting this 800 percent explosion in forest fire—because among the many ways climate change might be messing with the environment, extra heat is among the simplest and most obvious. “Heat is the most clear result of human-caused climate change,” Williams said.In other words, the climate models say that Northern Californian summers should be getting hotter as climate change takes hold. And that’s exactly what the data show—and exactly what’s driving an unprecedented outbreak of forest fires.But this outbreak of climate-addled fires is limited to summertime fires in forests; it does not extend to other types of environment or other times of the year, the paper cautions. Williams and his colleagues found that the amount of burned non-forest area—such as Southern California’s shrub and grassland—has not significantly increased.Read: What it’s like to get caught in a wildfireAnd while autumn wildfires such as the deadly Camp Fire dominate the news—and while there is some evidence that they may be getting larger—there is still not enough data to say that any increase is statistically significant. But the climate models do suggest that autumn fires across California will get more common as climate change continues to wrack the state.“Revisit this in 20 more years, and we’ll almost definitely be saying, ‘Yeah, fall fires have the global-warming fingerprint on them.’ But right now we’re still emerging from the range of natural variability,” Williams said.Don Hankins, a professor of geography at California State University at Chico, told me that he wanted to see more data before agreeing with the paper’s results. And he said that some large-scale changes to the landscape—such as the suspension of seasonal burns by indigenous people—may be producing the rise in fire.Williams agreed that climate change is not the only potential driver of increased fire in the state. Over the past century, Americans have gotten better at suppressing fires, meaning that easily burnable fuels may be accumulating in the state’s forests. But he said that even if fires are burning through that excess fuel, the effects of climate change are much clearer in this study, during this time frame. That’s because the fundamental relationship between excess heat and additional fire never changes in the study’s data; the correlation is “just as strong for the last 20 years as for the first 20 years,” he said. That suggests that across the five decades, the forests have remained the same. Only the air temperature has changed.There may be a day when the forests do change. Williams recently asked some of his students to simulate the survival of the state’s forests forward to the end of the century under a worst-case carbon-pollution scenario. They couldn’t do it. “It’s basically impossible,” he said. The state gets so hot that “in the 2070s, you have individual years where a quarter to a half of all the forest area in California is burning.”But that couldn’t happen: By then, there will be no more forest left to burn. Fires will have finished clearing all of California’s woods. The once-mighty Californian forest will have given way to scrub, grassland, and desert—types of ecosystem that can rebound quickly after a wildfire, or that never burn at all.It’s not a foregone conclusion that all of California’s timberlands will vanish, Williams said. It depends on how we reduce carbon pollution now and in the years to come. The future of the state’s forests, it seems, is up to us.
240	3	"Only 10% of global energy utility companies are expanding their renewable energy capacity at a faster rate than their gas or coal-fired capacity. That is the main finding of a study by Galina Alova from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford.The study, published in research journal Nature Energy, found that of the 3,000 utilities studied most remain predominantly invested in fossil fuels. And of those prioritizing renewable energy growth, 60% had not halted expansion of their fossil fuel portfolios.The companies with the slowest transition tended to be larger and from outside Europe, Alova told DW. ""The renewables-prioritizing cohort of utilities that I identified comprises companies that are overall larger and own a larger market share in the countries where they operate, compared to the other companies,"" she said. ""The key issue is that the majority of these companies continue in parallel to expand their fossil fuel-based capacity, although they do so at a slower rate.""Read more: Germany's coal imports down, but still crucialHer research highlights a gap between what is needed to tackle the climate crisis and ""the actions being taken by the utility sector,"" she added. These companies face the risk of carbon lock-in, given that a third of their fossil fuel capacity has been added in the last 10 years, so is here to stay for decades. ""Unless it is retired early, it will render significant shares of their portfolios stranded,"" Alova said.""Although there have been a few high-profile examples of individual electric utilities investing in renewables, this study shows that overall, the sector is making the transition to clean energy slowly or not at all,"" she said.Alova believes inertia in the electricity industry is one key reason for the slow transition.The report found that 10% of utilities favored growth in gas-fired power plants, dominated by the US utilities exploiting the country's shale gas reserves, followed by Russia and Germany. ""Renewables and natural gas often go hand in hand,"" Alova said, adding that companies often choose both in parallel. ""So, it might be just in media reports we are getting this image of investing in renewables, but less coverage on continued investment in gas."" It might also be the case that gas is viewed as a transition fuel, relatively less carbon emitting and providing load-balancing services to intermittent renewables generation, Alova said.Dave Jones, senior electricity analyst for independent climate think tank Ember, agrees with Alova that utilities have hindered the transition by ""misunderstanding the future of gas."" Utilities have a mindset to build big centralized power plants, replacing a coal power plant with a gas power plant, he said. ""Fortunately, most of the gas hype across the world is now dying down, as wind and solar now provide cheaper options for generating electricity,"" Jones said.Over a fifth of Europe's energy was generated by solar panels and wind turbines in the first half of 2020, according to a report by Ember. Denmark came out on top, generating 64% of its energy from these renewable sources, followed by Ireland (49%) and Germany (42%).In Ember's half-year review released in July, renewables exceeded fossil fuel generation for the first time ever, producing 40% of the EU's power, with fossil fuels contributing 34%. However, globally only a tenth of all energy was generated by these sources during the first half of 2020. Last year saw the use of coal to generate electricity around the world fall by a record 3%. In part due to COVID-19, coal generation in the first half of 2020 again broke records with a drop of 8.3%. In the EU, the drop was higher, as coal energy generation fell by nearly a third.With many projects delayed by the pandemic, the global capacity to produce electricity from renewable sources is predicted to drop by up to 13% overall this year according to the International Energy Agency.Utilities have been slow to understand how quickly wind and solar would drop in price, and also how quickly governments would want to move away from coal. ""Many utilities have been caught off guard by the speed of the transition, and have suffered financially ever since,"" said Jones. The world this year has generated one-tenth of its electricity from wind and solar, double from the 5% in 2015, and that increase has led to a fall in market share of coal generation, Jones added. Valentina Kretzschmar from consultancy Wood Mackenzie says BP's recently announced strategy has created a new industry benchmark. BP plans to increase investment in its low-emission businesses, including renewable energy, by tenfold in the next decade to $5 billion (€4.5 billion) a year, while cutting back oil and gas production by 40%.In July, Royal Dutch Shell won a deal to build a wind farm off the coast of the Netherlands, while France's Total has agreed to make several large investments in solar power in Spain and a wind farm off Scotland. Total also bought an electric and natural gas utility in Spain. Shell has said it will delay offshore oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea.US giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, however, have been slower than their European counterparts to commit to climate goals.""I have seen a substantial shift between companies in the fossil fuel clusters toward renewables,"" Alova said. ""This signals that the companies that have been growing fossil fuel portfolios in the earlier time periods might be switching to renewables more recently."""
545	4	A new study suggests that giant bears, sloths, and saber-toothed cats died because warming temperatures cocked the gun, and people pulled the trigger.South America was once a land of giants. Its plains and forests were home to elephant-sized ground sloths, mace-tailed armadillos the size of a car, and huge creatures that resembled humpless camels. Hunting them were a large subspecies of jaguar, sabre-toothed cats, and the gigantic short-faced bear, several times heavier than a grizzly. All of these giants—the aptly named megafauna—are now gone. Why?In the 1930s, Junius Bird, an American archaeologist in the mold of Indiana Jones, found a clue in an innocuous rock shelter near the southernmost tip of Chile. Within it, he uncovered ancient knives, spear points, arrowheads and other stone tools, together with the bones of large animals like horses and lumbering ground sloths. Those discoveries, in what is now known as Fell’s Cave, were among the first to suggest that prehistoric humans hunted the megafaunal menagerie to extinction.Paleontologists would soon level the same accusation at early humans from other continents, where titans like mammoths and woolly rhinos also disappeared. Meanwhile, South America remained neglected. It wasn’t clear when the continent’s giants disappeared, or why. “Traditionally, it’s been this mystery area,” says Alan Cooper form the University of Adelaide. But it’s a mystery that his team, including climatologist Chris Turney and evolutionary biologists Jessica Metcalf and Ross Barnett, have come closer to solving.By analyzing the DNA from bones and teeth recovered from sites around Fell’s cave, the team showed that many other animals went extinct alongside the horses and sloths that Bird discovered. These included a species of llama and a giant subspecies of jaguar.During the process, they used carbon-dating to check how old the fossils were. “We noticed that the dates coming back were grouping together quite tightly,” says Cooper. The llama and jaguar, along with the ground sloth, saber-toothed cat, short-faced bear, and South American horse all lived until around 12,300 years ago, and then disappeared. It was as if they had simultaneously crashed into an invisible wall. They all existed, and then they all didn’t. Why?Humans seemed like unlikely culprits. Archaeological evidence from other caves show that people were living in southern Chile by at least 14,600 years ago, and co-existed with the megabeasts for a couple of millennia. “You’ve got humans knocking at the gates of Patagonia well before the extinction,” says Cooper. “It’s not a blitzkrieg. It’s anything but.”A changing climate was a more likely suspect. The team noticed that the giant beasts went extinct a few centuries after a prolonged cold spell that gripped Patagonia between 14,400 and 12,700 years ago. As the glaciers retreated and temperatures rose, the giant beasts disappeared. “That’s a clear signal. Humans arrive. It gets cold. Nothing happens for 2,000 years,” says Cooper. But once temperatures started climbing again, “bam, the megafauna are dead very quickly.”While South America was going through its cold spell, North America was warm. And when the south heated up, the north cooled. The two sister continents see-sawed in climate but in both cases, the big animals disappeared during the warming stints. “It’s as close as you can get to a replicated experiment,” says Cooper. “Cold equals okay, warming equals death.”Why did warming climates doom the megafauna? It’s not clear, but Cooper has some guesses. The rising temperatures brought summer droughts, variable rainfall, and other weather anomalies. They also fueled the rapid growth of forests, which broke up the open habitats that these large animals were used to.And within that changing landscape, there were people, armed with bows and spears. They may have grown faster, or roamed over greater distances. Their populations could have boomed. They might have found it easier to kill the megafauna, which had been herded into ever narrower ranges. And in a newly fragmented world, there was no way for distant populations of hunted beasts to replace those that had been hunted out.This fits with a growing sense from other parts of the world that neither climate change nor humans was solely responsible for killing the megafauna. Instead, they acted synergistically. “Warming might be the magic ingredient that activates or accelerates our natural destructive tendencies,” says Cooper. “Or cold shuts us down.” Either way, climate change cocked the gun, and people pulled the trigger.“The evidence from the fossil record demonstrates the rapidity with which extinctions can occur and ecosystems can collapse when species are squeezed by multiple stressors that limit their ability to track habitat changes,” says Elizabeth Jeffers from Oxford University. And “these processes—rapid climate warming and habitat fragmentation by humans—are occurring today,”Thanks to us, the world is getting warmer, and large animals like elephants and rhinos are dying out. These are typically regarded as independent crises, caused by greenhouse gases and poaching respectively. But maybe the death of today’s giants is partly driven by the same warming-related strife that doomed their prehistoric counterparts. “It becomes really pressing to work out what aspects of warming allow humans to be that much more destructive than normal,” Cooper says.
968	3	"Scientists have found a clever new way of measuring ocean warming, using sound waves from undersea earthquakes. The researchers say the ""hack"" works because sound travels faster in warmer water.The team looked at sonic data from the Indian Ocean emitted by tremors over a 10-year period.As the seas have warmed due to global heating, the scientists have seen the sound waves increase in speed.Their new method shows the decadal warming trend in the Indian Ocean was far higher than previous estimates.Having accurate information on the warming of our oceans is critical for climate scientists.They understand that around 90% of the energy trapped in our atmosphere by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the seas.But having precise temperature measurements, in multiple locations and depths, is a huge challenge. The deployment of around 4,000 autonomous devices called Argo floats that capture temperature information has helped enormously, but there are big gaps in our knowledge.This is especially true in relation to what's happening in the waters deeper than 2,000m. But now a team of researchers has developed a very different approach that exploits the fact that the speed of sound in seawater depends on temperature.The idea was first proposed and trialled in the late 1970s using sound waves generated by scientists.However, concerns over the impact of these sounds on marine mammals and rising costs saw the idea abandoned.The new approach involves using the naturally produced sound waves that occur when an underwater earthquake strikes. The scientists examined data from over 4,000 tremors that occurred in the Indian Ocean between 2004 and 2016. The team then looked for pairs of ""repeaters"", earthquakes with almost identical origins and power. By measuring how long these slow-moving signals took to travel across the waters from Indonesia to a monitoring station on the island of Diego Garcia, they were able to work out the changes in temperature for the whole of the ocean over the 10-year period. ""It takes sound waves about half an hour to travel from Sumatra to Diego Garcia,"" lead author Dr Wenbo Wu from the California Institute of Technology told BBC News.""The temperature change of the deep ocean between Sumatra and Diego Garcia causes this half-hour travel time to vary by a few tenths of a second.""Because we can measure these variations very accurately, we can infer the small changes in the average temperature of the deep ocean, in this case about a tenth of a degree.""The author says the system has some major advantages, as it is able to provide a large-scale average temperature along the 3,000km path from Sumatra to Diego Garcia, which reduces the influence of local fluctuations, essentially making it more accurate over the ocean as a whole.The method is also quite cheap, as it uses data that's already being gathered, and is sensitive to temperatures deeper than the current restriction of 2,000m.In their research, the scientists showed that warming in the Indian Ocean over the decade that they studied was greater than previously estimated. However, the paper has some important caveats.""It is important to emphasise that this is a result that applies to this particular region and this particular decade,"" said Dr Wu.""We need to apply our method in many more regions and over different time frames to evaluate whether there is any systematic under- or over-estimation of the deep-ocean trend globally.""It is much too early to draw any conclusions in this direction.""To make the idea work on a global scale, the scientists will need access to more underwater receivers.Right now, the research team is working with data collected by a hydrophone network operated by the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which is listening for underwater nuclear explosions. These hydrophones pick up signals from many of the 10,000 shallow submarine earthquakes that occur globally every year, explained Dr Wu.""All this data contains information on the temperature change of the deep ocean â it is just waiting for us to extract it.""The study has been published in the journal Science.

547	4	Climate skeptics aren’t generally more science illiterate than everyone else, according to a new poll.The most hopeful news in Tuesday’s big Pew report on climate change and partisanship isn’t particularly uplifting, honestly. The research agency found that 70 percent of Americans believe that climate scientists should have a “major role” in the country’s climate and energy policy. This is roughly like 70 percent of Americans saying they believe seismologists should have a say in the nation’s earthquake policy.And after that vote of support, confidence in the field drops off. Less than a third of Americans think climate scientists understand the causes of climate change very well. Less than a fifth think they understand the best ways to address it. But most Americans, across both parties, do credit climate scientists with at least a fair amount of confidence to act in the public interest.These were all findings of the Pew Research Center’s 1,100-person poll of Americans on their feelings not just about climate change but on the whole bundle of climate and energy issues. The poll’s headline number is that 48 percent of Americans correctly understand the Earth to be warming due to human activity. This number has recovered to 2006 levels, when it stood at 50 percent. It fell below 40 percent following the election of Barack Obama.The report also confirms that Republicans and Democrats—especially on the parties’ respective right and left wings—hold differing views on climate change. But it finds that, especially on the left, these views are modestly moderated by someone’s understanding of general science. In other words, a Democrat with a high amount of science knowledge (including on health and biological concepts) is more likely to correctly state that humans are causing climate change than a Democrat with low science knowledge. Whereas being highly educated or having a high amount of science knowledge doesn’t make Republicans any more likely to say the same.Generally, Democrats and Republicans performed about the same on the study’s tests of scientific literacy that did not ask about the climate. “Thus, it could be the case that people’s political orientations are an anchoring point for applying their knowledge—rather than the other way around,” says the report.“Pew is more than just a public polling firm. They generate knowledge that is relevant to scholarly opinion,” said Dan Kahan, a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School who researches how group identification shapes public understanding of risk. He praised the study’s comprehensive evaluation of its respondents’ scientific literacy, something he said is rare for polls on climate issues.“It is very striking how sharp the polarization is on climate change issues and even on some energy issues, like fracking and nuclear, but then not on things like solar,” Kahan told me. “That can mean that people don’t really have the same level of interest in solar energy as they do on the issues that are polarizing them.”The Pew study found that more than 80 percent of Americans support expanding wind and solar energy. Somewhat counterintuitively, Kahan said that this broad support may mean politicians can’t build campaigns around them: Because wind and solar are so popular, support for them is unlikely to shape people’s decisions about whom to vote for.“That may just mean that [the public] is not intensely interested in it,” he said. “People tend to fixate on issues that are really divisive.” Many people support campaign-finance reform, for instance, but political-science research indicates few people make voting decisions based on it.That said, these healthy majorities haven’t translated into party platforms yet—at least on a national level. Hillary Clinton’s energy plan is far more amenable to renewable energy (and also far more specific) than Donald Trump’s. But some state-level Republican leaders have been praising renewable energy lately, and all 10 of the congressional districts supplying the most wind power are GOP-controlled.Here are a few more interesting factlets from the Pew study:

560	0	Boris Johnson has faced his share of blame for the country’s death count. But the British system was failing long before the coronavirus struck.Faced with the coronavirus pandemic, Britain’s leaders asked their people to do three things, captured in one pithy slogan: “Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.”On the first of those edicts, Britons largely followed through. Main streets, town centers, and public spaces were mostly abandoned, and the government pulled together a far-reaching job-protection program, ensuring that those who feared losing their jobs felt safe enough to not go to work.To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. The second request was more unusual. During the pandemic, Britain was the only major country in the world to make protecting its National Health Service a central goal. Signs and placards went up outside people’s homes, declaring their appreciation. The words Thank You NHS can now be seen on sidewalks and soccer jerseys, in children’s bedrooms and even, until recently, the windows of 10 Downing Street. In part, this worked. The NHS adapted to the crisis at extraordinary speed, creating the emergency capacity required to deal with the surge of patients. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from the hospital after contracting COVID-19, he said that Britain was winning its battle against the disease because the public had “formed a human shield around this country’s greatest national asset,” the NHS.On the third count, however, the country did not succeed, certainly compared with almost any other developed nation. Britain did not save as many lives as others. It had the money, the tools, and the wherewithal to respond as well as any, yet more of its people died than anywhere else in Europe. Britain has not been alone in its failure to prevent mass casualties—almost every country on the Continent suffered appalling losses—but one cannot avoid the grim reality spelled out in the numbers: If almost all countries failed, then Britain failed more than most.The raw figures are grim. Britain has the worst overall COVID-19 death toll in Europe, with more than 46,000 dead according to official figures, while also suffering the Continent’s second-worst “excess death” tally per capita, more than double that in France and eight times higher than Germany’s. It did not protect its oldest and most vulnerable, who died in nursing homes in appalling numbers. It allowed the disease to spread throughout the country rather than isolating it in one area. It failed to close its borders in good time, abandoned contact tracing too early, set targets that were missed, designed government programs that didn’t work, and somehow contrived to let the three most senior figures overseeing its pandemic response, including the prime minister, catch the very virus they were fighting. Now it faces the worst recession of any developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is once again taking a gamble by easing its lockdown at a relatively early stage.Read: The meaning of Boris Johnson’s illnessMuch of the focus has been on Johnson: an apparent manifestation of all that has gone wrong in Britain, a caricature of imperial nostalgia, Trumpian populism, and a general lack of seriousness. Yet this was not simply an issue of inept political leadership, inept or otherwise: Johnson stuck closely to a strategy designed and endorsed by the government’s experts, leaders in their fields and respected internationally. Even if the prime minister did make serious mistakes, the country’s issues run far deeper. The British government as a whole made poorer decisions, based on poorer advice, founded on poorer evidence, supplied by poorer testing, with the inevitable consequence that it achieved poorer results than almost any of its peers. It failed in its preparation, its diagnosis, and its treatment.As prime minister, Johnson must accept that Britain’s failures are his as well. Still, the difficult truth is that the country’s failures clearly go beyond Johnson. They were collective, multilayered, and deadly. The most difficult question about all this is also the simplest: Why?To try to answer that question, I spoke with leading politicians, including a former prime minister and five former cabinet ministers; three experts who either sit on the government’s scientific advisory committee for responding to pandemics, SAGE, or have briefed it during the crisis; half a dozen influential officials working in Downing Street and the NHS; and specialists associated with the government’s response, including professors of epidemiology, mathematics, history, and psychology. I also interviewed diplomats and officials from Britain and other European governments to understand what assessments were being made outside the country. Those in sensitive positions mostly asked for anonymity to be able to speak frankly.What emerges is a picture of a country whose systemic weaknesses were exposed with appalling brutality, a country that believed it was stronger than it was, and that paid the price for failures that have built up for years.At the start of 2020, Britain had been through 10 years of austerity following the 2008 financial crash—another great international crisis that hit the country harder than almost anywhere else. The NHS was stretched and fragmented, its lines of authority and responsibility tangled by years of regulatory tinkering. Outside London, the country’s economy was unproductive and poor, and its elderly-care system an unreformed national disgrace. The civil service, which believed itself to be the best in the world, had become a shadow of its former self, almost entirely shorn of the ability to act operationally or think strategically, its center hollowed out, weak, and ineffective. The country itself seemed divided and angry, unable to agree on a unifying national story.But step back and an even bleaker image is revealed. In the past two decades, the list of British calamities, policy misjudgments, and forecasting failures has been eye-watering: the disaster of Iraq, the botched Libyan intervention in 2011, the near miss of Scottish independence in 2014, the woeful handling of Britain’s divorce from the European Union from 2016 onward. As one senior British government adviser put it to me, “We’ve had our arse handed to us recently.”When the pandemic hit, then, Britain was not the strong, successful, resilient country it imagined, but a poorly governed and fragile one. The truth is, Britain was sick before it caught the coronavirus.Like America, the country failed to live up to its reputation as a pillar of pandemic readiness. But unlike America, Britain’s political leadership stuck closely to the script experts had drawn up for it—and the country still struggled. In remarks echoed, though perhaps not as colorfully, by politicians, officials, and diplomats, one figure close to Johnson told me of his experience at the heart of the government machine these past few months: “It’s a fucking disgrace.”Britain’s pandemic story is not all bad. The NHS is almost universally seen as having risen to the challenge; the University of Oxford is leading the race to develop the first coronavirus vaccine for international distribution, backed with timely and significant government cash; new hospitals were built and treatments discovered with extraordinary speed; the welfare system did not collapse, despite the enormous pressure it suddenly faced; and a national economic safety net was rolled out quickly.It is also too early to say precisely why, epidemiologically, Britain suffered more deaths than other comparable countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Some government officials and experts I spoke with—including a senior adviser to the leader of one of the best-performing countries in Europe—said that Britain may have just been unlucky in the number of holidaymakers it had returning from the wrong places at the wrong times. Britain is also more densely populated than almost any other country in Europe, with its preeminent city and busiest airport. Like a Silk Road port at the time of the plague, London is a 21st-century global hub unlike anywhere else in the region. It is no coincidence that the British capital and New York have been among the two worst-affected cities in the world.Today, the scale of infection in Britain has been brought into line with that of the rest of Europe. The primary concern now being raised in London is the prospect of a second spike in Europe rather than Britain—which may or may not prove hubristic in time. Either way, one cannot definitively judge the overall success or failure of a country’s response for months, or even years, to come. The final verdict will be influenced by when a vaccine is found—if at all—as well as each country’s ability to bounce back socially and economically. Already, according to conversations I had with officials inside 10 Downing Street, the government believes that the economic recovery will soon be more important to the public’s perception of British competence than the death count.Yet no one I spoke with, Johnson friend or foe, claimed that Britain’s response to date could reasonably be described as anything other than disappointing—too many people have died for it to be anything else. One influential U.K. government official told me that although individual mistakes always happen in a fast-moving crisis, and had clearly taken place in Britain’s response to COVID-19, it was impossible to escape the conclusion that Britain was simply not ready. As Ian Boyd, a professor and member of SAGE, put it: “The reality is, there has been a major systemic failure.”The majority of those I spoke with—even those close to Johnson and the government’s effort to contain the pandemic—agreed that, in hindsight, the prime minister and his most senior health and scientific advisers made serious missteps. Most also agreed that on top of poor decisions was poor management as parts of the system became overwhelmed and, as one senior U.K. official involved in the government’s pandemic response said, simply collapsed. The civil service appeared unprepared for the scale of the task: One official close to Johnson told me that the Cabinet Office—the department that coordinates with all others for the prime minister—went through multiple organizational restructures during the pandemic, signaling its lack of readiness. The senior U.K. official recounted how, in some meetings, staffers had to tally total COVID-19 case counts on their smartphones based on figures scribbled on whiteboards hastily dragged into Downing Street, because the country lacked a well-connected data system. “It’s obvious that the British state was not prepared for” the pandemic, this official told me. “But, even worse, many parts of the state thought they were prepared, which is significantly more dangerous.”When the crisis came, too much of Britain’s core infrastructure simply failed, according to senior officials and experts involved in the pandemic response. Expert advisory committees proved too slow and ponderous, with not enough dissenting voices; crisis-response cells could not cope and had to be bypassed; the Cabinet Office buckled under the strain; the NHS had no adequate way of sharing data; authorities could not meet the sudden need for mass testing; the Foreign Office could not get people home fast enough; the Department of Health could not design a contact-tracing app that worked; the government overall could not sufficiently procure key pandemic equipment; and Downing Street generally gave the impression of lurching from one crisis to another.“People will look back and say, ‘Could we have done it earlier?’ and with the power of retrospectroscope, which is an infinitely powerful instrument, the answer to that is, probably,” Mark Walport, who like Boyd sits on SAGE, told me. But Walport said this was not the fundamental issue of the crisis. “Many of the challenges that we’ve had are not, as it were, about policy advice or the science advice; they are questions about resilience.”Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most influential adviser, has used the analogy of the human immune system to explain what he believes is wrong with the British state, which he says has become too static. The immune system, Cummings argues, has no plan or central control; it is adaptable, and therefore stronger. He is only half right. The human immune system actually has two parts. There is, as Cummings correctly identifies, the adaptive part. But there is also an innate part, preprogrammed as the first line of defense against infectious disease. Humans need both. The same is true of a state and its government, said those I spoke with—many of whom were sympathetic to Cummings’s diagnosis. Without a functioning structure, the responsive antibodies of the government and its agencies cannot learn on the job. When the pandemic hit, both parts of Britain’s immune system were found wanting.By the time Johnson chaired his first emergency coronavirus meeting, on March 2, Britain had officially recorded 39 cases. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, had been subject to a brutal lockdown, while other places had experienced epidemics of their own. Northern Italy was about to become the first European disaster zone.Yet in London, officials insisted there was no need to panic. Britain, it seemed, had time to ready itself, lagging a few weeks behind Italy, and was well prepared to weather the storm: The country was ranked second in the world for its preparedness against biological threats, behind only the United States, and had spent years preparing for a pandemic. It had the institutional structures in place to advise the prime minister, the health system to handle an outbreak, and the expertise to arrive at the right decisions.The true extent of Britain’s outbreak at that point, we now know, was likely much worse than the official figures, with cases brought back to the country from multiple parts of the world—seeds planted in the fertile soil of a heavily populated, globally connected economy.On March 3, journalists—including me—were called into Downing Street for a briefing setting out Britain’s strategy. Government advisers made clear that although they had not given up hope that the virus could be contained internationally, Britain could not do so alone. The country’s experts told us then that any steps taken to slow the spread of the disease domestically needed to be timed intelligently, to ensure that they covered the peak of the crisis. If a lockdown were ordered too early, it would suppress the disease and save lives in the short term, but only delay the inevitable outbreak, and potentially make it worse by pushing it into the winter, a time when flu-related illnesses also peak, or to a point when public willingness to endure such severe social-isolation measures had run its course. This remains a concern. The government’s job, as its leaders saw it, was to ensure that the most vulnerable members of society were protected and that the spread slowed to ensure that hospitals could cope.This was not the response among Asian countries, which experienced outbreaks before Britain but nevertheless sought to permanently defeat the virus. South Korea, for example, instituted widespread testing, alongside a contact-tracing regime to keep the disease at bay until a vaccine could be found. Many others in the region adopted masks en masse. Travel restrictions were put in place. Lockdowns, large and small, were implemented.Read: The U.K.’s coronavirus ‘herd immunity’ debacleLike much of the Western world, Britain had prepared for an influenza pandemic, whereas places that were hit early—Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan—had readied themselves for the type of respiratory illness that COVID-19 proved to be. “There was a bit too much exceptionalism about how brilliant British science was at the start of this outbreak, which ended up with a blind spot about what was happening in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, where we just weren’t looking closely enough, and they turned out to be the best in the world at tackling the coronavirus,” a former British cabinet minister told me.The focus on influenza pandemics and the lack of a tracing system were compounded by a shortfall in testing capacity. According to a report on the government’s handling of the pandemic by Lawrence Freedman, a war-studies professor emeritus at King’s College London, Britain’s original plan was overwhelmed by the speed of the pandemic, which it did not fully understand until it was too late—an account supported by the experts I spoke with. If there had been more testing capacity, not only would the government have stood a better chance at tracing those with the disease, but it would have been better informed about the spread of the virus in general, and may therefore have ordered the lockdown earlier. Even doing so by a small amount of time would have made a difference. Neil Ferguson, one of the country’s leading epidemiologists, told lawmakers in June that Britain’s death toll could have been halved had the lockdown, which began March 23, been imposed a week earlier (though this was not SAGE’s advice at the time).Still, this narrow focus on when recommendations were given, and whether it was the best advice, runs the risk of appearing to absolve Johnson of blame—if the system is at fault, then no one person could have salvaged it. And his insistence that he was following experts’ advice masks the inherently political choices all leaders must make in times of crisis. Other leaders, supported by other systems, arrived at better decisions more quickly than Britain. On March 10, restrictions began to be imposed in Berlin, a decision that Freedman concludes was a significant factor in Germany’s overall success. Leaders in France and Italy enacted more stringent restrictions in their cities and countries, and suffered fewer deaths.One of the central criticisms of Johnson’s leadership—expressed to me in multiple conversations—is not a refusal to accept the truth (the charge of many international observers, including Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, lumping him in with populists such as Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro) but a failure to challenge his experts’ strategy. It was the prime minister’s duty to question the scientific advice, to demand more. This is not a critique made solely in hindsight: On March 12, Rory Stewart, a former Conservative lawmaker who took on Johnson for the party leadership last year, set out the reasons Johnson needed to follow Merkel’s lead. “The key thing to understand in any emergency response is that you need to make a judgment,” he said then. Stewart said Johnson needed to take responsibility and argued it was “deeply, deeply unfair” to claim that Britain followed the experts’ plan, not his own.To a large extent, Johnson’s hope and trust in his advisers was understandable: A Downing Street official asked me to imagine the outrage if the prime minister had been accused of overruling scientific and medical advisers early in the crisis. Still, Johnson’s strategy throughout was one that his hero Winston Churchill raged against during the First World War, when he concluded that generals had been given too much power by politicians. In the Second World War, Churchill, by then prime minister and defense secretary, argued that “at the summit, true politics and strategy are one.” Johnson did not take this approach, succumbing—as his detractors would have it—to fatalistic management rather than bold leadership, empowering the generals rather than taking responsibility himself. (Of course, Johnson’s hospitalization in April also had an impact, something even his detractors, among them Tony Blair, told me cannot be discounted when trying to measure the government’s performance.)Had Johnson not challenged his advisers because he was told what he wanted to hear—that locking down the economy was not necessary? Was Johnson, part libertarian, part optimist, simply too instinctively skeptical of draconian limits on individual freedom to impose them? “It was a mixture of poor advice and fatalism on behalf of the experts,” one former colleague of Johnson’s told me, “and complacency and boosterism on behalf of the PM.”Read: The coronavirus is more than just a health crisisWhat it all adds up to, then, is a sobering reality: Institutional weaknesses of state capacity and advice were not corrected by political judgment, and political weaknesses were not corrected by institutional strength. The system was hardwired for a crisis that did not come, and could not adapt quickly enough to the one that did.Over time, Britain’s NHS has come to represent the country itself, its sense of identity and what it stands for. Set up in 1948, it became known as the first universal health-care system of any major country in the world (although in reality New Zealand got there first). Its creation, three years after victory in the Second World War, was a high-water mark in the country’s power and prestige—a time when it was a global leader, an exception.Of course, neither Britain nor its health-care system is exceptional anymore, at least in this regard. Every developed country in the world, apart from the United States, has a universal health-care system, many of which produce better results than the NHS.Yet from its beginnings, the NHS has occupied a unique hold on British life. It is routinely among the most trusted institutions in the country. Its key tenet—that all Britons will have access to health care, free at the point of service—symbolizes an aspirational egalitarianism that, even as inequality has risen since the Margaret Thatcher era, remains at the core of British identity. It is impossible to entirely disentangle modern Britain from the NHS, or vice versa. The country, so often lumped together with the U.S. as economically “Anglo-Saxon,” has a slice of socialism at the heart of its national life, largely left alone by governments of all persuasions.More recently, the NHS has been at the center of every election for at least a generation, a main character in the fight over Brexit, and finally, the linchpin in Britain’s battle to contain the pandemic. In asking the country to rally to the NHS’s defense, Johnson was triggering its sense of self, its sense of pride and national unity—its sense of exceptionalism.Before the coronavirus, the NHS was already under considerable financial pressure. Waiting times for appointments were rising, and the country had one of the lowest levels of spare intensive-care capacity in Europe. In 2017, Simon Stevens, the NHS’s chief executive, compared the situation to the time of the health service’s founding decades prior: an “economy in disarray, the end of empire, a nation negotiating its place in the world.” Britain had come full circle, he seemed to be saying. A rebirth was needed. Instead, the country entered a rolling political crisis over Brexit, ending in Johnson’s elevation to the premiership and election victory in December 2019. Then came the pandemic.When Italy’s hospitals quickly became overwhelmed in early March, there were serious concerns that the NHS would meet a similar fate. Extraordinary measures would be required to make space for the coming crisis. The question now troubling experts is: at what cost?In early April, the first of England’s seven new “Nightingale” hospitals—named after Florence Nightingale, the pioneering Victorian nurse—was opened in a conference center in East London, ready for the expected surge in patients. The hospital was built in nine days with space for 4,000 beds and opened by Prince Charles to much acclaim, restoring the belief that the country could still act with speed. Medical students were pushed into service, retired NHS staff were called back in, and an army of volunteers was recruited to help hospitals function. Existing hospitals were hastily redesigned, nonessential operations were canceled, and the public was urged to avoid overburdening the system where possible. By early May, such was the success in creating additional capacity that the government announced that the Nightingale hospitals would be wound down and put in “hibernation” after barely being used.Read: A Brit’s advice for the U.S. health-care systemYet this apparent victory—of sparing the NHS the fate that met Italy’s hospitals—may have been pyrrhic. According to Freedman’s report, the effort to increase capacity potentially deterred people who needed urgent treatment but did not want to burden the health system. Others who required treatment might have been denied it because the focus had quickly shifted to COVID-19. The consequences may be serious and long term, but the most immediately tragic effect was that creating space in hospitals appears to have been prioritized over shielding Britain’s elderly, many of whom were moved to care homes, part of what Britain calls the social-care sector, where the disease then spread. Some 25,000 patients were discharged into these care homes between March 17 and April 16, many without a requirement that they secure a negative coronavirus test beforehand.In effect, Britain was rigorously building capacity to help the NHS cope, but releasing potentially infected elderly, and vulnerable, patients in the process. By late June, more than 19,000 people had died in care homes from COVID-19. Separate excess-death data suggest that the figure may be considerably higher. According to a report by the International Long-Term Care Policy Network, a London-based research body, Britain has recorded more deaths from COVID-19 as a percentage of its nursing-home population than any other country in Europe, apart from Spain. A cross-party parliamentary report was more cutting: Sending patients into care homes without testing them for COVID-19 was an “appalling error” and an example of the government’s “slow, inconsistent and at times negligent” approach to social care.This tragedy is an example of Britain’s systemic failures of governance, according to leading health experts and former cabinet ministers I spoke with, an indictment of the country’s short-term, centralized government apparatus. Britain failed to foresee the dangers of such an extraordinary rush to create hospital capacity, a shift that was necessary only because of years of underfunding and decades of missed opportunities to bridge the divide between the NHS and retirement homes, which other countries, such as Germany, had found the political will to do.Ultimately, the scandal is a consequence of a political culture that has proved unable to confront and address long-term problems, even when they are well known. The NHS remains the pride of the country, but it is kept separate from the largely private social-care sector. In 1948, this made sense, when child mortality and diseases such as tuberculosis were the chief health concerns, and life expectancy stood at 66 for men and 70 for women (today it is 80 and 84, respectively). When the pandemic gripped Britain, these two systems came into conflict. The NHS was protected and given priority, leaving care homes in the lurch.Britain is far from unique in seeing the disease rip through its care homes. Yet this should not distract us from the reality that, just as other political leaders made better choices than Johnson did, other health systems, such as Germany’s, which is better funded and decentralized, performed better than Britain’s. Those I spoke with who either are in Germany or know about Germany’s success told me there was an element of luck about the disparity with Britain. Germany had a greater industrial base to produce medical testing and personal protective equipment, and those who returned to Germany with the virus from abroad were often younger and healthier, meaning the initial strain on its health system was less.However, this overlooks core structural issues—resulting from political choices in each country—that meant that Germany proved more resilient when the crisis came, whether because of the funding formula for its health system, which allows individuals more latitude to top up their coverage with private contributions, or its decentralized nature, which meant that separate regions and hospitals were better able to respond to local outbreaks and build their own testing network. Also unlike Britain, which has ducked the problem of reforming elderly care, Germany created a system in 1995 that everyone pays into, avoids catastrophic costs, and has cross-party support. The reforms, although far from perfect, have provided the “foundations for a system that has been able to adapt and respond to changing circumstances,” according to the British health think tank the Nuffield Trust—exactly what has not happened in Britain.A second, related revelation of the crisis—which also exposed the failure of the British state—is that underneath the apparent simplicity of the NHS’s single national model lies an engine of bewildering complexity, whose lines of responsibility, control, and accountability are unintelligible to voters and even to most politicians. In a number of conversations for this piece, the NHS’s byzantine nature was likened to the spiderweb of regulatory bodies tasked with monitoring Britain’s financial sector in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. That system was hailed as world leading but failed when called upon, and much of the regulatory burden has since been centralized.Britain, I was told, has found a way to be simultaneously overcentralized and weak at its center. The pandemic revealed the British state’s inability to manage the nation’s health: to create a funding model that does not solely promote efficiency, to rise above short-term problems and tackle the problem of old-age care, and to mend the broken system of accountability that runs through so much of British public life. Throughout the NHS’s existence, British governments, both Conservative and Labour, have found the political will to tinker with it, but rarely to tackle its long-term challenges, fearful of losing votes. The NHS did not fail, but the system overall did—and people died as a result.Britain’s unwillingness to address systemic problems is not confined to health care. Since at least the 1970s, growing inequality between comparatively rich southeast England (including London) and the rest of the country has spurred all parties to pledge to “rebalance the economy” and make it less reliant on the capital. Yet large parts remain poorer than the European average. According to official EU figures, Britain has five regions with a per capita gross domestic product of less than $25,000. France, Germany, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden have none. If Britain were part of the United States, it would be anywhere from the third- to the eighth-poorest state, depending on the measure.Britain’s performance in this crisis has been so bad, it is damaging the country’s reputation, both at home and abroad. According to one senior British official, who has decades of experience and who does not serve Johnson, there was a sense of shock internationally that Britain had so obviously fallen short, a feeling echoed along the corridors of power in Westminster. Inside Downing Street, officials believe that the lessons of the pandemic apply far beyond the immediate confines of elderly care and coronavirus testing, taking in Britain’s long-term economic failures and general governance, as well as what they regard as its ineffective foreign policy and diplomacy.Read: The coronavirus is never going awayThe reaction in Downing Street is a reminder that the Johnson program is revolutionary in instinct, aspiring to do far more than tinker, and Reaganite in its desire to overturn the status quo and usher in a new political zeitgeist that is more assertive on the world stage and more dynamic at home. Whether one believes the government or its self-perception does not change its intention to be transformative. One Johnson adviser told me the government would be remembered for “restructuring the British state.”Read: Boris Johnson can remake Britain like few before himThe trouble for the prime minister is that although the pandemic might reinforce the belief that Britain’s problems are deep and structural, his handling of it may serve to undermine the country’s consent for him to pursue the kind of program he says is necessary. And the scale of the task itself is enormous. “We need a complete revamp of our government structure because it’s not fit for purpose anymore,” Boyd told me. “I just don’t know if we really understand our weakness.”In practice, does Johnson have the confidence to match his diagnosis of Britain’s ills, given the timidity of his approach during the pandemic? The nagging worry among even Johnson’s supporters in Parliament is that although he may campaign as a Ronald Reagan, he might govern as a Silvio Berlusconi, failing to solve the structural problems he has identified. As Blair and others pointed out to me, it is not just in the big calls that Johnson, his scientific advisers, and the system have been found wanting, but in day-to-day governance as well: the ability to get children back to school, open restaurants, protect the economy, and roll out a working contact-tracing system. The prime minister indicated the kind of big-thinking optimism that he believes is necessary with a recent speech detailing his plans to bring Britain out of its pandemic slump with a Rooseveltian New Deal. Yet what did it amount to? Little more than a mishmash of existing projects—a speech and a plan that seemed to confirm Johnson’s own critique about the country’s systemic failure to think big and act boldly.Britain is, of course, not alone in being beset by structural problems, failures of governance, and periodic crises. France, Italy, Spain, and the EU as a whole have obvious and lasting dilemmas that have not been addressed. And the United States is divided by racism and inequity. Britain’s international reputation may also dramatically shift if it discovers and shares a working vaccine while avoiding the worst of a second wave. This is not a story of pessimistic fatalism, of inevitable decline. Britain was able to partially reverse a previous slump in the 1980s, and Germany, seen as a European laggard in the ‘90s, is now the West’s obvious success story. One of the strengths of the Westminster parliamentary system is that it occasionally produces governments—like Johnson’s—with real power to effect change, should they try to enact it.But just because other countries screw things up does not mean Britain’s problems aren’t real and serious, and just because the country has recovered in the past does not mean it will again. It has been overtaken by many of its rivals, whether in terms of health provision or economic resilience, but does not seem to realize it. And once the pandemic passes, the problems Britain faces will remain: how to sustain institutions so that they bind the country together, not pull it apart; how to remain prosperous in the 21st century’s globalized economy; how to promote its interests and values; how to pay for the ever-increasing costs of an aging population.Read: Boris Johnson and the optimism delusionIf Britain is to solve them, it needs to up its game or be left behind; to realize it is no longer “world leading” in as many fields as it thinks, and that its problems run far deeper than whichever crop of politicians is in charge. “The really important question,” Boyd said, “is whether the state, in its current form, is structurally capable of delivering on the big-picture items that are coming, whether pandemics or climate change or anything else.”Britain was sick before the crisis hit. If it is to survive the next one intact, it has to address its underlying health conditions.
986	5	The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is now at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”.Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. There is no sign of these emissions starting to fall rapidly, as is needed.The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth.The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.Greenland has lost almost 4 trillion tonnes of ice since 2002. Mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps are also losing ice rapidly as glaciers shrink. A third of the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ice is already doomed.Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai.As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America.Huge cost drops have seen renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and solve difficult problems such as aviation and farming.The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream.Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating hydrogen, will also be needed.This article was amended on 20 September 2019 to correct an error in the figure given for the rate of Greenland’s ice loss. The correct amount is 4 trillion tonnes of ice lost since 2002.
98	5	By Fiona Macrae for the Daily Mail  Published:  09:21 AEDT, 28 September 2013   |  Updated:  22:54 AEDT, 29 September 2013    277View  commentsClimate change scientists warned yesterday that the Earth is set for more heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and low-lying islands as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.But despite these dire predictions, they admitted global warming is likely to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years.In its first report for six years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that global warming is ‘unequivocal’ – and it is ‘95 per cent certain’ that human activity is the ‘dominant’ cause.Scroll down for video  Enlarge         The IPPC reported revealed that it is 'extremely likely' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming. It claims a rise in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (right) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century. But the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely 'paused' over the past two decades (left)The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century (right). In many midlatitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986-2005 period (left)UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: ‘The heat is on. Now we must act.’ But others questioned the credibility of the predictions, pointing out that the IPCC’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘pause’ in rising world temperatures.Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘The IPCC has taken a huge gamble. ‘Unless global temperatures begin to rise in the next few years, the IPCC is very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility.’ The 36-page summary of the report was released yesterday after four days of intense negotiations between officials from 110 countries and scientists behind closed doors in Stockholm. It states that each of the past three decades has been progressively warmer than any preceding decade since 1850 and, in the Northern Hemisphere, 1983 to 2012 is likely to have been the warmest 30-year period in the past 1,400 years.   CO2 concentrations have increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions, claims the IPCC. The ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification Ocean acidification is determined by a decreases in pH. The pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era, according to the reportIt also claims that it is ‘extremely likely’ that man is responsible for ‘more than 50 per cent’ of the temperature rises seen since 1951. But the report summary offered little detailed evidence to back up that claim.The most controversial part of the 2,000-page report, which will be released in full on Monday, is the one that addresses why the rise in global average surface temperature has ‘paused’.The report acknowledges that temperature rises have dropped from 0.12c per decade since 1951 to just 0.05c per decade since 1998 – despite record amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. Critics say this shows that carbon dioxide is not as damaging as had been claimed and several governments called for references to the slowdown to be amended or even removed from the report. In fact, the slowdown is acknowledged more prominently than it was in draft versions, with the IPCC saying that much of the ‘missing’ heat is stored deep beneath the sea, preventing it from contributing to temperatures at surface level.Volcanic eruptions and changes in the sun’s activity are also thought to have contributed.Scientists say they are confident in the computer programs they use to model the effects of carbon dioxide on the planet – they just can’t predict random events such as volcanic eruptions. They say that such pauses in warming occur regularly through history, the slowdown is only temporary and climate change remains a pressing threat.For the first time, the IPCC also makes a short-term forecast, saying that temperatures will rise between 0.2c and 0.6c between now and 2035.By the end of the century, the global average temperature could rise by 4.8c. This is lower than the previous worst case scenario of 6.4c but scientists stress it is still enough to have an ‘enormous’ impact on the planet. The lowest predicted temperature increase has also been scaled down from 1.1c, to 0.3c – however, they claim achieving this would require rapid and drastic cuts in emissions.Melting ice and an expansion of water as it warms could drive sea levels up by up to 32 inches by the end of the century – 40 per cent more than previously predicted.The IPCC also says it is ‘very likely’ that the Gulf Stream, which brings heat north from the tropics and keeps Britain warmer than it would be otherwise, will slow down. This could stop the temperature rising for ten or 20 years in Britain but would be unlikely to make the country much colder.The IPCC has revised down its estimate of how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide, saying that a doubling of levels in the atmosphere would raise temperatures long-term by between 1.5c and 4.5c. The previous lower limit was 2c.The report says it is ‘extremely likely’ – or at least 95 per cent certain – that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the main cause of rising temperatures since the Fifties.That level of certainty is up from 90 per cent in the report in 2007 and 66 per cent in 2001.The world’s biggest environmental charities, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, called for immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. David MacKay, of the Department of Energy & Climate Change, said reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is unlikely to be enough.  Instead, it is ‘very likely’ we will need to embrace new technologies such as artificial trees that actively suck carbon out of the atmosphere. The findings of the report and two that will follow will feed into treaty talks in Paris in 2015.Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘This strengthens the case for international leaders to work for an ambitious, legally binding global agreement in 2015 to cut carbon emissions.’David Bull, of Unicef, said: ‘Scientists are more certain than ever that climate change is real. How we choose to act now will make a vital difference to the lives of today’s children and of future generations.‘If we fail, our children will carry the devastating burden of our inaction.’Scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report. They say it will 'very likely' exceed that observed during 1971-2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets During the longest period calculated (1901-2012), almost the entire globe experienced surface warming. The report said that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal'. However, the report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years The authors of the latest IPCC report have clearly been stung by the barrage of criticism over the past few years.For while they are more confident than ever that mankind is changing the climate, several of the gloomier predictions from the previous 2007 analysis are toned down.Some of the changes reflect the science and growing sophistication of computer models. But other parts of the report appear to have been written in direct response to climate change sceptics. This follows huge embarrassment when claims that most Himalayan glaciers would vanish within 25 years were exposed as nonsense.Himalayan glaciers: Scientists have already withdrawn claims that they would vanish in 25 years IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said that ‘human failing’ led to the predicted date being brought forward by 300 years. In fact, the claim had been lifted from a report by the WWF. The latest report simply says that the world’s glaciers will shrink by between 15 and 85 per cent by the end of the century.One of the biggest differences between yesterday’s report and the 2007 version comes in a key figure, used to work out how much temperatures will respond to the extra greenhouse gases pumped into the air by factories, farming and cars. Six years ago, the IPCC estimated that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures between 2c and 4.5c.The latest update tones down that effect, known as the ‘equilibrium climate sensitivity’. Now the same increase in CO2 will lead to a rise of between 1.5c and 4.5c, the IPCC says. In 2007, the IPCC gave a range of estimates for temperature increases by the end of the century – from 1.1c above the 1850 levels to a whopping 6.4c hike.The new report is more measured, predicting increases between 0.3c and 1.7c if carbon emissions are halted almost immediately, and 2.6-4.8c if they are unchecked.There are other changes.In 2007, the authors of the report predicted that tropical storms would be more intense and frequent under a climate change future. Today, they are far less confident – and say there is only a ‘more likely than not’ chance of more intense tropical storms in North America and the Western North Pacific.As was widely anticipated, the report acknowledges that global warming has slowed down since the exceptionally hot year of 1998 – but adds that 15 years is not long enough to make any firm conclusions about this apparent pause. There is also a reference to the Medieval warm period – a time between 950 and 1250 when temperatures were similar to the late 20th century. However, the authors say this warming did not take place as coherently across seasons and regions as the current phase of global warming.  Many of the predictions and measurements are more gloomy. Sea levels are now predicted to rise more quickly and carbon dioxide concentrations in the air are now the highest they have been for 800,000 years. In 2007, the levels were at a 650,000-year high.
970	4	"The global response to the Covid-19 crisis has had little impact on the continued rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).This year carbon emissions have fallen dramatically due to lockdowns that have cut transport and industry severely. But this has only marginally slowed the overall rise in concentrations, the scientists say.The details are published in the WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin. This highlights the concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are the cumulative result of past and present emissions of a range of substances, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Through the Paris Agreement, countries are trying to reduce emissions of these pollutants which are generated through, for example, the burning of fossil fuels.These greenhouse gases trap heat close to the Earth's surface, driving up temperatures. This planetary warming threatens global food supplies, makes weather events - such as tropical storms and heatwaves - more extreme and increases the risk of flooding caused by sea level rise.CO2 levels are measured in parts per million (ppm) - an indication of their overall atmospheric abundance.According to the WMO, the global average in 2019 was 410.5ppm, an increase of 2.6ppm over 2018. This was larger than the increase from 2017 to 2018 and bigger than the average over the past decade.Thanks to lockdowns in early 2020, carbon emissions fell by 17% at their peak, but the overall effect on concentrations has been very small.Preliminary estimates suggest that CO2 will continue to increase this year but that rise will be reduced by 0.08 to 0.23ppm. This falls within the 1ppm natural variability that occurs from year to year. ""We breached the global threshold of 400 parts per million in 2015, and just four years later, we crossed 410 ppm, such a rate of increase has never been seen in the history of our records,"" said WMO secretary general, Prof Petteri Taalas.""The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph. We need a sustained flattening of the curve,"" he said.While there isn't an overall figure for 2020 concentrations, individual monitoring stations show that the rise has continued this year despite the pandemic. Monthly average CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa in Hawaii - a key atmospheric monitoring station, where carbon dioxide data is gathered - were 411.29ppm in September 2020, up from 408.54 the previous year.Similarly, at Cape Grim in Tasmania, another key air pollution measurement station, September 2020 saw CO2 concentrations reach 410.8ppm - up from 408.58 in 2019.While there are no details of methane levels for 2020, concentrations of that gas also went up in 2019.Methane concentrations increased by more than the average over the past decade, although the increase was slightly lower than in previous years.More than half of the methane emitted comes from human activities such as raising cattle, growing rice and drilling for oil and gas. Concentrations of nitrous oxide grew by about the average of the past decade. Emissions come from agriculture, energy and waste management. This gas damages the ozone layer as well as contributing to global warming. While the Covid-19 pandemic hasn't slowed down the increase in concentrations of all these warming gases in the atmosphere, the decline in emissions in the early part of this year shows what's possible. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change,"" said Prof Taalas. ""However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero [balancing out any emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere] through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  ""The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally.""Meteorologists expect CO2 levels to vary by 1ppm between years due to natural fluctuations in the climate - for reasons other than human releases of carbon."
218	4	Many of the world’s most revered vineyards may face the choice of diversifying the grape varieties they grow or risk harvesting smaller and smaller crops, as climate change brings less favourable conditions.Even if the world manage to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions causing average global temperatures to rise as the Paris agreement outlines – limiting global warming to 2C – then the regions of the world suitable for growing wine grapes could shrink by as much as 56 per cent.Currently humanity is not on course to meet that target. Emissions over 2019 were 4 per cent higher than when the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, and the United Nations has warned that current trends put the planet on course for a 3.4C temperature rise over the next 80 years.A new study warns that under a potential scenario of 4C of warming, 85 per cent of lands suitable for vineyards would no longer be able to produce good wines because the grapes are extremely sensitive to the changes in temperature and season brought by climate change.“In some ways, wine is like the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture, because these grapes are so climate-sensitive,” said Benjamin Cook from Columbia University and the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies, co-author of the study.But all hope is not yet lost. “There are still opportunities to adapt viticulture to a warmer world,” said Professor Cook. “It just requires taking the problem of climate change seriously.”Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereThe study suggests wine producers could look at diversifying their crop by “reshuffling” grape varieties. Such a move could halve the potential losses of wine-growing regions under 2C of warming, the authors say.The team suggests crop diversity could be key to making agriculture more resilient to climate change, and said wine grapes offer a unique opportunity to test this assumption. Wine grapes are both extremely diverse – there are more than 1,100 different varieties planted today, growing under a wide range of conditions – and they are well-documented, with harvest data stretching back centuries. The researchers – led by Ignacio Morales-Castilla at the University of Alcalá in Spain and Elizabeth Wolkovich at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver – focused on 11 varieties of grape: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chasselas, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Monastrell (also known as Mourvedre), Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah and Ugni Blanc.For the 11 varieties, the team used vintner and researcher archives to build a model for when each would bud, flower, and ripen in winegrowing regions around the world under three different warming scenarios: 0, 2, and 4C of warming. Then they used climate change projections to examine which regions those varieties would still be viable in the future.Losses were unavoidable under both warming scenarios, due to shifting temperatures and seasonal changes which would affect conditions while the varieties were ripening. These factors would considerably impact the wines’ quality. But the team found that “by switching these varieties around, you can reduce losses by a significant amount”, said Professor Cook.With 2C of global warming and no attempts at adaptation, 56 per cent of the world’s wine-growing areas may no longer be suitable for growing wine. But if wine producers switch to varieties more suitable for the changing climate, only 24 per cent would be lost. For example, in France’s Burgundy region, the authors suggest heat-loving Mourvedre and Grenache could replace current varieties such as Pinot Noir. In Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot could also be replaced with Mourvedre.Implementing such major cultural changes in areas steeped in rich viticulture history would be a significant challenge, as would the legal position – strict rules govern the grapes used in wines sold as coming from particular regions.However, some change is already afoot. For example, in Bordeaux, where Cabernet Sauvignon dominates blends, just a handful of grapes including Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec were previously permitted to be used. But this changed in July 2019. Bordeaux wineries reportedly authorised the use of four new red grapes to combat temperature increases in Bordeaux. They are: Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa.“Conversations in Europe have already begun about new legislation to make it easier for major regions to change the varieties they grow,” said Dr Wolkovich. “But growers still must learn to grow these new varieties. That’s a big hurdle in some regions that have grown the same varieties for hundreds and hundreds of years, and they need consumers who are willing to accept different varieties from their favourite regions.”The scientists said cooler wine-growing regions such as Germany, New Zealand and the US Pacific Northwest would be relatively unscathed under the 2C scenario. These areas could become suitable for warmer varieties like Merlot and Grenache, while varieties that prefer cooler temperatures, such as Pinot Noir, could expand northward into regions not currently suitable for growing wine.Wine-growing regions that are already hot now – such as Italy, Spain, and Australia – faced the largest losses, because they are already limited to planting the warmest varieties.The variety-swapping was less effective at higher amounts of global warming. With 4C of warming, planting climate-specific varieties reduced losses from 85 to 58 per cent – about a third.The researchers note that management practices like increased irrigation and using shade cloths can also help to protect grapevines, but only at lower levels of warming.Ultimately, the effectiveness of any strategy depends on growers having the options and resources to adapt at a local scale, and on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting warming globally, the authors said.The research is published in the ​Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
439	3	"Cutting the speed of ships has huge benefits for humans, nature and the climate, according to a new report. A 20% reduction would cut greenhouse gases but also curb pollutants that damage human health such as black carbon and nitrogen oxides. This speed limit would cut underwater noise by 66% and reduce the chances of whale collisions by 78%.UN negotiators will meet in London this week to consider proposals to curb maritime speeds. Ships, of all sorts and sizes, transport around 80% of the world's goods by volume. However they are also responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions thanks to the burning of fuel.Shipping generates roughly 3% of the global total of warming gases - that's roughly the same quantity as emitted by Germany.  While shipping wasn't covered by the Paris climate agreement, last year the industry agreed to cut emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. This new study, carried out for campaign groups Seas at Risk and Transport & Environment builds on existing research that suggests that slowing down ships is a good idea if you want to curb greenhouse gases. The report though also considers a range of other impacts of a speed cut such as on air pollution and marine noise. As ships travel more slowly they burn less fuel, which means there are also savings in black carbon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The last two in particular have serious impacts on human health, particularly in cities and coastal areas close to shipping lanes.The report found that cutting ship speed by 20% would cut sulphur and nitrogen oxides by around 24%. There are also significant reductions in black carbon, which are tiny black particles contained in the smoke from ship exhausts.Cutting black carbon helps limit climate warming in the Arctic region because when ships burn fuel in the icy northern waters, the particles often fall on snow, and restrict its ability to reflect back sunlight, which accelerates heating in the Arctic region. The study also says that a 20% cut in speed would reduce noise pollution by two thirds - while the same speed limitation would reduce the chances of a ship colliding with a whale by 78%.""It's a massive win, win, win, win,"" said John Maggs from Seas at Risk.""We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature,  we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money.""It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling.""Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London. Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions.One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it.  Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down.""Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,"" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner.But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade.""Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,"" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate.  ""We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships.""What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions. Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming. ""The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,"" said John Maggs.  ""We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future."""
347	5	Thursday is Earth Day, a day that a decade or two ago transitioned from being a weirdo-hippie celebration to being an opportunity for businesses to sell things made out of wood instead of plastic. There’s probably a term for the tipping point at which something goes from a national joke to a national marketing opportunity, but if there is, I don’t know it.This quick flip was useful for politicians uninterested in addressing the central threat the Earth faces. Instead of there being a day when Americans are reminded that the world is warming and that the effects and scale of that warming are unclear, there is a day in which people can talk about how good trees are. Trees are good; no offense to trees. But it’s a lot harder to sell things that are focused on addressing the buildup of gas in the atmosphere than it is to sell a thing that will protect a sea turtle. So the latter gets a lot of attention and the former less so.I’ve found over the years that there is a pretty widespread lack of familiarity with how climate change actually works and what contributes to it. So, in the interest of selling nothing more than a subscription to a newspaper, I decided it was worth putting together something of a primer on the subject, centered on how it is measured.The natural place to begin is by explaining how the warming process works.If you live in a house in a cold-weather climate, you are probably aware that your attic is insulated. That’s to keep heat in your house and prevent it from escaping into the outside air. The Earth is not similarly insulated, so heat often radiates off the planet’s surface and into space.Sometimes, though, that heat radiates into the atmosphere, where it is absorbed by one of the countless gas molecules floating around up there, a layer of protection that has an insulating effect. Some of those molecules, excited (literally) by the absorbed energy, then release the energy back out. Sometimes it’s released up toward space. Sometimes it strikes another molecule. And sometimes it heads back toward Earth.This is oversimplified, but you get the point. Heat headed for space ends up being redirected back toward the Earth. And the more molecules floating around in the atmosphere, the more likely it is that one will absorb heat before it escapes and the more likely it is that the heat will be aimed back down.That’s the most basic element of warming. There are knock-on effects: Warming air holds more water vapor which can absorb more heat, warming temperatures can thaw permafrost that then releases methane into the atmosphere. But the central issue is the buildup of those gas molecules.Scientists track the density of those molecules in the atmosphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has an online tool that shows the densities of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and sulfur hexaflouride in the atmosphere. In the past several decades, each has climbed higher.You’ll notice we flagged a particular point on the methane graph. Methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas, one that traps more radiation than carbon dioxide. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “the comparative impact of CH4″ — methane — “is 25 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period.” So remember that September 2006 point on that graph for later.It’s important to note that the measurements above track global concentrations. If a molecule of carbon dioxide is released in Paris, it contributes to that total as surely as one released in Pittsburgh. Over the past 60 years, the amount of carbon dioxide released by the United States as a percentage of the global total annually has decreased as other countries, particularly China, have seen big increases in emissions. (The data below come from the Global Carbon Atlas.)This is why climate change is a global problem. Curtailing emissions entirely in the United States would neither remove the existing molecules from the atmosphere or mean that no new molecules would be added. It’s why activists and politicians targeting the issue have embraced international compacts such as the Paris climate accord in an effort to instantiate international rules aimed at cutting emissions across the board. The goal, at the very least, is to slow the rate at which gas is emitted into the atmosphere.So let’s look at the sources and types of emissions in the United States. EPA data for 2019 show that most of the emissions in this country come from transportation and electricity generation: burning gasoline in cars and burning coal in power plants, both of which release carbon dioxide (among other things). Carbon dioxide made up more than three-quarters of emissions in 2019. (Notice that agriculture makes up 10 percent of emissions. We’ll come back to that, too.)If you’d looked at the EPA’s website in 2016 (which you still can, thanks to the Internet Archive), you’d have seen that electricity generation was a larger contributor to carbon dioxide emissions than transportation by a 37 percent to 31 percent margin. Now, those percentages have flipped: Transportation is responsible for 35 percent of carbon dioxide emissions and electricity generation only 31 percent.One reason for that is the change in how electricity is generated in the United States. Until 2009 or so, coal was the most common generation method for producing electricity in power plants. But then that changed. Natural gas became much cheaper and it burned more cleanly than coal, releasing far less carbon dioxide. So electricity-generating facilities began switching over.In the past 20 years or so, the amount of electricity generated from natural gas and renewable sources (wind, solar and hydroelectric) has climbed. The amount produced by nuclear plants has held steady. Coal generation has plunged.A key driver of that dynamic was the surge in hydraulic fracturing. About 20 years ago, oil drillers figured out how to extract vast amounts of oil and gas from shale deposits underground: drill down and then sideways, injecting water at high pressure into the hole. The rock shatters and gas and oil are released. Areas of North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas boomed and the market was suddenly saturated with natural gas.After holding steady for decades, natural gas production in the United States began to surge in about 2006.Natural gas is primarily methane. Remember that first graph showing the increase in atmospheric methane beginning in the same period? That’s not a coincidence. While natural gas burns more cleanly, a lot of it can escape into the atmosphere at drilling sites.It’s a reminder of how complex this all is. Consider that shift in carbon dioxide emissions between electricity production and transportation. The electricity production emissions have dropped (thanks to the transition away from coal) but transportation emissions have recovered after the recession a decade ago. That’s a key reason the Biden administration has recently targeted emissions from automobiles.Then there’s that chunk of emissions from agriculture. There are a lot of jokes about how cows contribute to climate change but — cows contribute to climate change! The amount of nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere is a function of practices such as fertilization. That methane, though, is from what the EPA tenderly refers to as “part of [animals’] normal digestive process,” meaning flatulence and belching. Pools of manure also contribute to methane emissions.We come to the question that many have asked recently: Does eating less meat help the planet? The answer to that is similar to the answer to a lot of environment-related questions. It does, a little. But scaled up? If lots of people eat less meat or drive less? If they drive cars that emit less carbon dioxide? If they get their power from wind turbines? If that becomes the norm not just here but in China and India?All of a sudden, the picture changes.
138	4	"Sky News Digital Editor Jack Houghton says the world has allowed China, which is the “single largest emitter” of CO2 on earth, to increase its emissions indefinitely and “no one is protesting it”.Mr Houghton pointed to how Australia emits 550 megatons of CO2 per annum whereas China will be allowed to “increase the amount of CO2 they churn into the air by 2900 megatons by 2030”.“Labor was in support of that, it was the Paris Agreement, the world signed up to that”.“We’ve allowed the single largest emitter to increase their emissions indefinitely and no one’s protesting”.Mr Houghton told Sky News host Chris Kenny if the climate change alarmists really want to fight this cause then “go to the UN and argue for these other big emitting countries to rapidly reduce their share"". “The science says it’s the totality, it’s not a geocentric emission tally in Australia which is causing climate change.”Image: News Corp Australia"
576	4	"Professor James Renwick says climate change should be treated with much more urgency.Science Reporter, NZ HeraldA leading climate scientist has welcomed a new 20-year Government ""roadmap"" that singles out climate change as an environmental research priority for New Zealand.But Dr James Renwick, of Victoria University of Wellington, argues the issue could have been treated with much more urgency in the discussion document, which is now out for consultation.In the paper, released late last week by the Department of Conservation and Ministry for the Environment, climate change was noted as posing a ""very significant"" impact to the environment, with effects cutting across ""almost every aspect of environmental and conservation research"".At least 2C of warming this century was likely to influence species, habitats, ecosystems, biodiversity, biosecurity, water quality and availability, land use, and primary production.Climate-related sea level rise would affect coastlines, and changes could be expected in the frequency and severity of natural hazard events, including extreme weather, drought, frosts, wild fires and flooding.For climate change - one of 12 key research areas identified - the goals were summarised as ""New Zealand understands the pathways that can lead to a low-carbon economy that will support its international commitments"" and ""The impacts of climate change on the environment, economy and society are effectively managed through planned adaptation and risk reduction"".The document set out a range of research questions, emerging ideas and capability needs, spanning from innovative techniques to slash methane emissions from ruminant animals, to risk-mapping and improved policies.But Renwick, who is travelling the country in a speaking tour raising awareness around climate change, said where the document was ""less impressive"" was the language around the scope and urgency of the issues.""It talks about a future with 'relatively intact' natural ecosystems and about the 'trade-offs' between environmental protection and economic growth,"" he said.""A recognition that the economy is a component of the environment does not come through in this document.""He noted the document pointed to a roadmap for the next two decades, by which time the globe's budget of carbon emissions to keep warming below 2C would be spent, at present emissions rates.""Yet, the first 20-year vision given under the climate change theme is New Zealand understands the pathways that can lead to a low-carbon economy that will support its international commitments, as if we have 20 years to work out what to do.""Significant action needed to begin immediately, and emissions had to start coming down as soon as possible, he said.""While the Government has an Emissions Trading Scheme and is investing in agricultural emissions research, there is no hint that the country's total emissions are decreasing, or are expected to decrease at any time in the coming 20 years.""Other major research areas pointed out were freshwater, coastal, land, urban and marine ecosystems, biosecurity, informatics, modelling and monitoring, and new and emerging technologies.The roadmap would help build a strategic approach to environmental science in New Zealand, and help core government departments set research priorities and influence future funding proposals.""Robust science and evidence underpins good decisions about how we care for our nature,"" said Conservation Minister Maggie Barry, lead minister for the project.""We need to be thinking ahead to what issues we're going to face, and also take a fresh look at how to deal with problems like introduced predators and weeds.""An independent Strategic Advisory Group, led by the Prime Minister's chief science adviser, Sir Peter Gluckman, helped develop the paper alongside Ministry for the Environment and Department of Conservation staff.The New Zealand Association of Scientists (NZAS) meanwhile said it was a ""positive step"" for the Government.""The fact that they have developed and released the Conservation and Environment Roadmap first points to the importance of this sector to New Zealand,"" its president, Dr Craig Stevens, said.""The roadmap is, however, very high level so it remains to be seen how it will actually influence front-line science.""""This is compounded by its release being out of sync with the National Science Challenges which support significant activity and leadership in this area - it will be another three years before these have any significant re-focus.""Dr Cate Macinnis-Ng, a senior lecturer in biological sciences at the University of Auckland, said she welcomed the ""broad scope and wide coverage"" of the document.New Zealand had a number of pressing environmental challenges, specifically freshwater issues, invasive pests and ongoing soil degradation.""On the positive side, the roadmap also highlights some of the opportunities in the environmental space including new technologies and matauranga Maori,"" Macinnis-Ng said.""Better integration of matauranga Maori and tikanga Maori into environmental assessment and management has huge potential for improving environmental and social health for all New Zealanders.""We all have a stake in the environmental wellbeing of our country and I encourage everyone to contribute to the consultation.""• Feedback was welcomed on the discussion paper, available on the Ministry for the Environment and Department of Conservation websites, until September 7. Meetings would be held in Auckland, Hamilton, Lincoln, Dunedin and Wellington next month."
335	0	Magazine pushes climate change narrative by honoring teen activist; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'Teen activist Greta Thunberg said Saturday that climate change critics are getting “desperate” after a cartoon depicting her being sexually assaulted was printed on bumper stickers in Canada.The image on the stickers, which circulated last week, depicts a naked woman from the back and a pair of hands pulling on her braids while engaged in an apparent sexual act. The name “Greta” is printed across the woman’s lower back.The logo for X-Site Energy Services, a Canadian oil and gas services company, is printed on the bottom.“They are starting to get more and more desperate...,” tweeted the 17-year-old Thunberg. “This shows that we’re winning.”X-Site General Manager Doug Sparrow told Canada's City News that he has received hundreds of complaints about the image, but claimed the company was not involved in making the sticker.“It’s not from X-Site or any employee; someone has done this,” Sparrow said. “That’s all I know.”Police in Red Deer, Alberta, the town where X-Site is based, opened an investigation into the sticker, which they initially called “distasteful.”Investigators ultimately determined the sticker did not constitute a criminal offense since it did not meet the elements for child pornography or depict a non-consensual act that would be considered a direct threat to the person, police said in a news release.      Thunberg, from Sweden, marches with other demonstrators as she participates in a school strike climate protest in Bristol, England, on Friday. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)      Michelle Narang, an Alberta resident, called out the sticker on social media last week. She told HuffPost Canada that a friend in the oil industry sent her the image, which had been circulating at job sites.The image has since been condemned by many on social media, including Leela Sharon Aheer, Alberta's minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women.“The graphic ... is completely deplorable, unacceptable and degrading,” Aheer tweeted. “This is not what our province stands for. Whoever is responsible should be ashamed and apologize immediately. I stand with Albertans against this horrendous image.”Thunberg, who has become a symbol for action against climate change, led a peaceful march on Friday through the southwestern British city of Bristol, where thousands of young people joined the Swedish activist.In a speech, Thunberg said “nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises by our elected officials.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.
940	3	"The sea is slowly swallowing Josephine Lagi's home. Her family has lived in the Solomon Islands for generations - watching as their island falls to the whim of a changing climate. The rising seas are stealing their beaches and threatening life as they know it. Everything is changing for the worse, but they're adapting. READ MORE: * Full coverage: guest editor Mia Sutherland's stories * Humanitarian visa proposed for climate change refugees dead in the water * 'Looking after family': Our aid efforts for our Pacific neighbours * Government considering experimental climate change visa  * Study: Pacific youth more at risk of suicide than any other group * Editorial: Kiribati might one day become a nation of refugees Lagi and her family are among many Pacific Islanders who are choosing to ""mitigate and adapt"" to the effects of climate change rather than flee. They're building sea walls to combat the rising sea levels because leaving their small island home would be ""the final resort"". ""This is the birth place of our ancestors and our forefathers and is being handed down from generations. And so moving away from home would be a challenge."" She explained her parents have seen the most consistent, threatening changes. But since moving to Wellington to complete her studies, the landscape she sees upon her return home every year is a vast contrast to the memories from her youth. ""[From] when I was little... the structure of the coastline is quite different to now when we go back home."" If the time comes and they're forced to leave their increasingly uninhabitable home, at least they'll know they did all they could to try and mend their island broken by climate change. In recent years, a number of Pacific Islanders have been overwhelmed by the effects on their homes in Kiribati and Tuvalu and sought refuge in New Zealand on the basis of climate change. However, the 2015 and 2017 cases, which gained global attention, were all denied. Though commonly used, the notion of 'climate refugees' isn't deemed an appropriate or accurate term for those forced to leave their homes due to the effects of climate change. ""They might be described as 'climate displaced' people, or 'climate migrants', but not 'refugees',"" according to Vernon Rive, an environmental lecturer from Auckland University of Technology. Dr Darren Brunk, a humanitarian specialist from Oxfam New Zealand, described using the term 'refugee' for this situation as fitting ""the very round peg of climate migration into the square hole of the Refugee Convention"".  While Lagi herself doesn't find issue with the term, she understands the connotations usually associated with it, and explained society's reaction to refugees may influence islanders' opinions of it. ""Being referred to as a climate refugee is okay, but just be considerate of the situation, some people may or may not want to be referred that way,"" she said.  Rive believes the rejection of the term revolves around many islanders not wanting to be seen as victims, instead they would prefer to be viewed as ""people wishing to retain a strong sense of self-determination, agency and sovereignty over their home lands and waters"". This sense of self-determination is reflected by many communities' drive to adapt. Dr Brunk has witnessed the adaptation efforts in various parts of the Pacific. He explained: ""They want us here in New Zealand to know that they don't want us talking about this through the refugee lense, but through an adaptation lense."" But if the effects of climate change worsen, simply adapting won't be a viable option. Rive believes ""internal displacement or internal relocation"" might be the solution for ""the short [to] medium term"". He explained, this type of relocation could be made available to ""some countries in the Pacific with higher land, but probably not... available for all Pacific nations (notably, Kiribati and Tuvalu)."" Though not ideal, Lagi understands the need to relocate in the event of a climate emergency. ""We [might] have no choice but to move out and seek refuge elsewhere."" If that is the case, she hopes there will be laws protecting Pacific Islanders living in other countries."
160	3	"Using CAMS' Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) data, scientists estimated that CO2 emissions from fires in the Arctic Circle have increased by more than a third, compared to 2019, with 244 megatonnes of carbon produced from January 1 to August 31, 2020. By comparison, 181 megatonnes of carbon were produced for the whole of 2019. Most of the increased wildfire activity took place in Russia's Sakha Republic, scientists said, ravaging millions of acres of land, and causing a spike in CO2 emissions.""Last summer we discovered from our data that there was very persistent fire activity in the Arctic circle, particularly in the Siberian Arctic,"" Mark Parrington, senior scientist at CAMS, part of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, told CNN. ""What's been different this year is that we saw through the second half of July and the first couple of weeks of August, a very large cluster of fires burning very far into the Arctic circle and Siberia,"" he said. Hazardous smoke plumes from the blazes covered an area equivalent to more than a third of Canada, scientists said. The peak of the Arctic fire season was in July and early August, the data showed. Sakha Republic and the remote Russian Chukotka region saw ""above average"" daily total wildfire intensity in August. Fires in the Eastern Federal District of Russia between June and August emitted approximately 540 megatonnes of carbon dioxide -- overtaking the previous total highest emissions dataset, recorded in 2003.Though experts said the fires' ignition sources were uncertain, some fires earlier in the season are thought to have been so-called ""zombie fires"" -- blazes also known as holdover fires -- which can burn at low temperatures underground, and could have been alight during the winter.The fires are a symptom of how the climate and the environment are changing in the Arctic, Parrington said.""We've known for quite a few years now that the rate of change of temperature and climate variables in the high northern latitude is faster -- two to three times faster -- than the global average,"" he said. ""What we're seeing now is that these fires are symptomatic of that: It's warmer, dryer, so the vegetation and fuel is in the right conditions, and so when these fires are being ignited, they are able to burn for a long period of time uninterrupted, and grow as well,"" he said. ""Depending on the meteorology at the time, the huge amount of smoke and pollution that these fires produce doesn't necessarily stay there -- it is subject to long range transport,"" Parrington added. This could prove hazardous to both local populations and those further afield: Wildfire smoke contains a number of pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and solid aerosol particles.""You can see smoke heading out across the Arctic Ocean, you can see it heading out to North America,"" Parrington said. ""Pollution and smoke doesn't know about international boundaries, those fires can affect a much larger population, thousands of kilometers away,"" he added. The Arctic Circle is not alone in experiencing problem wildfires -- CAMS noted that a large portion of the southwestern United States has been ravaged by wildfires because of heatwave conditions, with California experiencing widespread fire activity. The fires, mostly situated in California and Colorado, are thought to have been caused by lightning, according to the monitoring service. Meanwhile, large plumes of smoke have been observed moving eastward across the Great Lakes, towards the North Atlantic. "
748	3	The second in a series of articles on the impact of global warming on the worldLIKE MOST Malawians, Wema Kaloti lives off the land. She grows maize on her family plot in Kamwendo, a village in the south of the country. But farming is getting harder as rainfall grows erratic. “Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little,” she says, glancing at the sky. Yields have dwindled. A hectare that once produced 20 sacks of maize now brings in seven. “There is not enough to sustain ourselves.”Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. GDP per capita is lower in just five other states. Fully 71% of Malawians earn below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day. The bulk of the labour force work in agriculture. Improving Malawians’ lot, therefore, depends on making farming more productive or developing better ways of making a living. Both tasks are made more difficult by climate change.Malawi is especially vulnerable to rising temperatures and mercurial rainfall. Most farmers in the country are smallholders. Four in every five grow maize. Almost all of them rely on a single rainy season. If it is disrupted, their livelihoods are at risk.And disruption is on the way. Research summarised by Future Climate for Africa (FCA), a research consortium, points to two trends. The first is rising temperatures. By 2040 there may be more than 100 days a year above 30°C, compared with about ten today. The second is that while there may be fewer rainy days in the future, when it does rain, it is more likely to pour. This is a recipe for floods, droughts and shorter rainy seasons.This sort of weather is already increasingly common. In 2015 there were both drought and floods, and a year later further drought. Maize production fell by 30% in 2015, then an additional 12% in 2016, when 6.7m (out of a country of 18.1m) needed food aid. In 2018 Lake Chilwa, in south-east Malawi, dried up completely. Residents of Chisi Island, in the middle of the lake, no longer needed canoes to reach the mainland.In Zomba district, the region that includes the lake and Kamwendo village, climate change has had profound effects on the economy. Maize yields have slumped as the onset of the rainy season has moved from early October to mid-November. Rice fields near Lake Chilwa have flooded. Livestock farming has become harder with less water and feed. Around Lake Chilwa, the drying of the lake forced 7,000 fishermen to seek work elsewhere, mostly on Lake Malawi, which covers a fifth of the country.It is not just climate change that is hurting farming. A growing population has meant dwindling farm sizes; today the average plot is 0.8 hectares, less than the area of a football pitch. Their soils are being degraded because they are farmed too intensively, and often using damaging practices. Nearly 40% of agricultural land has soil that is too acidic for decent yields. Malawian maize farmers get only 11-28% of the potential yield from the crop, according to the World Bank. Widespread deforestation, often by desperate farmers who need to sell wood for extra income, has made it harder to manage water flows.There are some efforts afoot to adapt to climate change while improving land management. In Kamwendo, Ms Kaloti is part of a “farmer field school” supported by the Food and Agricultural Organisation, a UN agency. Farmers like her are experimenting with faster-growing varieties of maize and growing banana trees in gullies to lessen the effects of floods.At Lake Chilwa, Sosten Chiotha of the University of Malawi has been leading a similar project. Farmers have doubled yields by improving the soil through mulching and using seeds that can grow in a shorter rainy season. Tree-planting has helped to protect rice fields from drowning. Solar-powered fish-dryers have quickened the process of preparing tiddlers for market. Mr Chiotha has set up a “weather chasers” WhatsApp group to raise awareness of incoming storms.There is, however, a danger that adaptation schemes will never be enough to help Malawian farmers escape poverty. “Ultimately there are too many small-scale farmers,” says Pamela Kuwali of the Civil Society Agriculture Network, an NGO. She argues that the government—and aid donors who account for the bulk of public spending in many areas—need to do more to increase the 4% farmland that is irrigated for commercial use. Instead policy is a mess. A ban on exporting maize hinders trade in the crop. A fertiliser subsidy scheme takes up most of the spending on agriculture.Irrigation would leave farmers less at the mercy of the rains. But it has its own issues. Lake Malawi feeds the hydro-power stations that provide more than 90% of the country’s electricity. In 2015 these stations lost two-thirds of their capacity due to droughts, leading to widespread blackouts. This hampered irrigation schemes as well as businesses in the cities of Lilongwe and Blantyre. Malawi’s power sector is “massively exposed to fluctuations in the lake level,” says Declan Conway of the London School of Economics.Mr Conway is one of the academics in the Future Climate for Africa project. It is trying to produce more accurate modelling of Malawi’s climate, with the hope that it will help policymakers plan. But, Mr Conway acknowledges, it can be hard to get politicians to see climate change as an immediate threat.One hope is that voters may push them to stop ignoring it. Afrobarometer, a pan-African outfit, says that the share of Malawians who are aware of climate change (78%) is the joint second-highest of the 34 African countries it polled. A separate survey by Afrobarometer in 2018 found that 81% of Malawians said conditions for agricultural production were getting worse. Such views seem to be correlated with poor opinions of the government.Yet Malawians are not just angry at their own government. “There is so much hypocrisy around climate change,” says Isaac Ali, an official in Zomba. “Donor countries give us money to plant some trees, but they keep polluting.” It is too much to expect Malawi to carry the burden for changes it did not cause, he argues. “They’re using poor countries to cleanse their own sins.”
288	3	A few years ago, I was sitting in the book-lined study of an elegant condo with a view of downtown Washington, interviewing a former senior Koch Industries lobbyist about his job. I asked him what got him up in the morning when he worked for Koch. He gave me a one-word answer: “Carbon.”At the time, I had been reporting for years on Koch Industries, one of the largest and most confusingly complex private companies in the world. Its annual revenue is larger than that of Facebook, Goldman Sachs and U.S. Steel combined, and it makes everything from gasoline to nitrogen fertilizer to nylon, paper towels and windows. For all this complexity, one business inside Koch Industries remains more important than the rest — processing and selling fossil fuels.David Koch, who died Friday at the age of 79, is best known as a major funder of right-wing political causes, from tax cuts to deregulation, an enthusiastic patron of the arts and a man-about-town. But to his critics, his most lasting political legacy might very well be the rapidly warming world that he has left behind.Koch Industries realized early on that it would be a financial disaster for the firm if the American government regulated carbon emissions or made companies pay a price for releasing carbon into the atmosphere. The effects of such a policy would be measured over decades for Koch. The company has billions of dollars sunk into the complex and expensive infrastructure of crude-oil processing. If a limit on greenhouse gas emissions were imposed, it could dampen demand for oil and diminish the value of those assets and their future sales. The total dollar losses would likely be measured in trillions over a period of 30 years or more.In the face of this political problem, David Koch and his brother Charles built a political influence machine that is arguably unrivaled by any in corporate America.Construction on the Koch political machine began in the 1970s, after Charles Koch took over the family company. He and David began funding and orchestrating a political project to restrain government power in the United States through lobbying, think tanks and political donations. The effort accelerated in the 1990s after a Senate committee, following a long investigation, accused Koch Industries of stealing oil from Native American reservations where the company was operating. That experience convinced David and Charles Koch that they needed to have a stronger presence in Washington to fend off their critics.The machine reached full fruition in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president. The machine is so effective because it is multifaceted. In addition to one of the largest registered corporate lobbying offices in the country, located about two blocks from the White House, there is a constellation of Koch-funded think tanks and university centers. They all convey a consistent message: that government programs can only cause more harm than good and that market forces alone must shape human society. And their work is bolstered by a private network of donors that David and Charles Koch assembled over the years, a network that gives donations at levels rivaling a political party.Finally, Koch controls a “boots on the ground” army in the form of Americans for Prosperity, a network of employees and volunteers who knock on doors, attend rallies to protest climate change legislation, and visit the offices of any lawmakers who seem likely to cross Koch Industries on the issue.This machine has been employed to great effect to ensure that no government action is taken to control greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 1990s, President George H.W. Bush made it clear that he would support a treaty to limit carbon emissions. The Republicans even had a market-based solution to tackle the problem, a system called “cap and trade” that put a price on pollution and allowed companies to buy and sell the right to pollute. Cap and trade had been used to great effect to reduce power plant pollution and acid rain. But in 1991, the Cato Institute, a Koch-funded think tank, held a seminar in Washington called “Global Environmental Crises: Science or Politics?” This was part of a decades-long effort to cast doubt about the reality of climate change. David Koch worked tirelessly, over decades, to jettison from office any moderate Republicans who proposed to regulate greenhouse gases. In 2009, for example, a South Carolina Republican, Representative Bob Inglis, proposed a carbon tax bill. Koch Industries stopped funding his campaign, donated heavily to a primary opponent named Trey Gowdy and helped organize teams of Tea Party activists who traveled to town hall meetings to protest against Mr. Inglis. Some of the town hall meetings devolved into angry affairs, where Mr. Inglis couldn’t make himself heard above the shouting. Mr. Inglis lost re-election, and his defeat sent a message to other Republicans: Koch’s orthodoxy on climate rules could not be violated.Mike Pence, who was then a congressman in Indiana, and others soon signed a “carbon pledge” circulated by Americans for Prosperity, which effectively prohibited the government from putting a price on carbon emissions. Those efforts and others effectively derailed the effort to pass a cap and trade plan for greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, the level of atmospheric carbon concentration hovered around 387 parts per million. In the decade since, levels have surpassed 400 parts per million, the highest level recorded in human existence.Since the 2016 election, and in the face of more urgent scientific warnings about climate change and a growing popular movement for action, the Koch network has tried to build a Republican Party in its image: one that not only refuses to consider action on climate change but continues to deny that the problem is real. Just this week, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, dismissed data about climate change by pointing out on Twitter: “It’s summer.” In doing so, he reflected the politics of a party — and a world — that has been profoundly shaped by David Koch.

411	0	The prime minister’s announcement on Tuesday that the Department for International Development (DfID) will be merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has been met with widespread anger and disappointment among UK aid charities.Stephanie Draper, the CEO of Bond, a UK network for international development NGOs, said the announcement on Tuesday, during the coronavirus pandemic, couldn’t have come at a worse time.“We are facing the biggest global pandemic in our lifetime, and we need a globally respected, independent Department for International Development that has the relevant expertise to ensure Covid-19 is tackled worldwide, as well as a secretary of state for international development able to champion the needs of the world’s poorest people in our global response.“Scrapping DfID now puts the international response to Covid-19 in jeopardy and, at a time when we need global cooperation, risks a resurgence of the disease both abroad and here in the UK.”She added that keeping an independent DfID is the best way to ensure aid is spent on “helping those most in need, delivers impact for the British taxpayer and remains untied to our political interests”.“Yet today, without any process or consultation, and against the recommendations of both independent aid scrutiny bodies as well as the UK’s development and humanitarian sector, the government has decided to put our aid budget in the hands of those will little expertise in global health systems, humanitarian response and disease prevention and eradication.“Make no mistake, this decision will do nothing but hurt the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.”Romilly Greenhill, the UK director of the advocacy group ONE, said the merger was the wrong decision and “is a loss for global Britain and the world’s poorest people”.“It’s perplexing that the government chose the middle of a global pandemic to merge these two departments.“DfID is recognised internationally for its expertise in making the world a healthier, safer and more prosperous place. Abolishing it will harm us all. Time and again it’s been shown that the FCO does not have the experience or capacity to do this well.”She added: “This is not the right decision if Britain is to truly be a global player in addressing challenges such as Covid-19. A global pandemic requires a global response – driven by those with real expertise in fighting disease and extreme poverty. Capitals around the world will be dismayed that the UK appears to be stepping back from global leadership at the very moment it is needed most.”Mark Sheard, the CEO of World Vision UK, said the announcement was “shocking evidence of the UK putting its own economic interests above saving lives”.“The terrible irony is that global Britain has today shrunk following years of an anti-aid agenda taking root at the heart of government.“While cross-governmental coordination is absolutely necessary, this should not be done at the expense of aid quality, for which the world’s poorest will pay the price. It has already been warned that Covid-19 could set back global poverty levels by 30 years. The end of an independent DfID will drive us even further backwards.”He added that giving the foreign secretary oversight of aid would mean less transparency, effectiveness and accountability, “and risk money being diverted to address UK foreign policy interests rather than alleviating poverty”.“Diverting funds from the world’s poorest communities under the guise of taking back control in the UK would be a dereliction of our responsibility as a nation.”Sheard said he was “deeply concerned” about what will constitute aid under this new department – the Foreign, Commonwealth the Development Office – which is expected to be formed in September. “The definition of aid must not be diluted, and it must not become a weapon of foreign policy.”Danny Harvey, the executive director of Concern Worldwide (UK), meanwhile, said the merger “sends a worrying signal that the eradication of poverty is no longer the primary aim of UK aid”.“By fusing aid with the national interest, we risk leaving the most vulnerable behind and undermining some of the great progress that has been made. Established 23 years ago, DfID is widely respected and consistently outstrips the FCO in independent reviews for both transparency and aid impact. DfID has championed development initiatives on gender equality, health, nutrition, education and building resilience to climate change,” she said.“As the number of people facing severe food insecurity is set to double this year due to the pandemic, this is not the time for the UK to renege on our values of compassion and common humanity. Maintaining an independent DfID is the best way to ensure UK aid goes to helping the most vulnerable communities to survive and recover from Covid-19.”Patrick Watt, Christian Aid’s director of policy, public affairs and campaigns, called the merger “an act of political vandalism”.“Stripping the Department for International Development of its independence and folding it into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office threatens a double whammy to people in poverty, and to our standing in the world.”He said without an independent DfID, the UK’s ability to help tackle poverty, and the impacts of the climate crisis and conflict, will be reduced. “The UK has a moral responsibility towards the world’s poorest.”Daniel Willis, campaign manager for Global Justice Now, was blunter. He said the merger was “a terrible decision that takes us back two decades to when UK aid was subservient to the interests of British business”.“It’s bad news for the fight against global poverty, and good news for suppliers of corporate drinks parties in foreign embassies,” he said.“No-one who believes that UK aid can have a positive impact in the world thinks this is a good idea. Just last week, MPs urged the government to abandon this merger on the grounds that it would destroy the effectiveness and transparency of UK aid.”The merger signalled “a conscious shift to a development model based on a hollowed out state that is forced to rely on corporate partners to function at home and abroad”. He added: “DfID has been far from perfect, but its formal independence from the Foreign Office has offered some protection from aid money being treated as a slush fund for business interests. Now that’s been swept away – Empire 2.0 here we come.”Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children, said the merger was “a flawed decision that flies in the face of commitments made in the government’s manifesto”.“During the biggest humanitarian crisis in a century, when the Covid-19 pandemic is reversing hard won gains in child and maternal health, education, and poverty, this is a baffling and deeply damaging move. It will weaken the UK’s ability to provide for the world’s poorest children at a time when they need the UK’s support and solidarity.”Watkins said a cabinet minister for international development must be retained “to ensure that humanitarian considerations are heard at the highest level of government”, and the government must “move immediately” to protect the focus and quality of aid now spent through the Foreign Office.Sacha Deshmukh, the executive director of Unicef UK, said the merger risked damaging the UK’s international standing.“The UK’s global leadership on international development, which saves lives every day and is critical to our standing around the world, should not be lost among the broader range of goals that fall under other foreign policy objectives.“The timing of this merger means particular attention will need to be paid to the vital DfID-funded programmes around the world that are responding to the current crisis and are already facing unprecedented threat and disruption.”Deshmukh’s words were echoed by the chair of the International Development Committee, Sarah Champion, who feared the merger would jeopardise the UK’s “world-leading” humanitarian work.“The international development committees review showed it is abundantly clear that DfID is an incredibly strong and well-respected department internationally. DfID offers a vital lifeline for so many people struggling around the world and is well-respected by NGOs on the ground, literally saving lives. We cannot lose sight of why we support other countries with official development assistance; we help children access quality education, we boost healthcare facilities, we ensure people access justice and security.“DfID’s work considerably increases the UK’s clout on the world stage – amplifying our voice in multilateral organisations and extending our diplomatic influence in country.”She added: “We have received extensive evidence that merging foreign affairs departments and aid departments erode international reputations, and actually are so costly and disruptive there is very little benefit. In the cases of Canada and Australia, the mergers have not improved the quality of aid, and we have heard that the reorganisations eroded their soft power.“Merging these departments may seem attractive short-term with possible administrative efficiency gains, but in the long run, we will have shot ourselves in the foot on the world stage.”
626	3	Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite has linked the drought and current bushfire crisis to global warming.The Member for Kingsford Smith told Sky News Labor would do better than the Morrison government by being “serious” about climate change by “actually developing a policy which this government doesn’t have”. “Bushfires are raging throughout the country,” Mr Thistlethwaite said. “We’re in the worst drought in our nation’s history and our farmers are really struggling. “Climate change is affecting Australian people at the moment and many people believe this government is not doing enough.”
333	5	As countries in the Global North move past the peak of the novel coronavirus pandemic and start to gradually reopen their economies, the talk of a “Green New Deal” and a “green” post-COVID-19 recovery is gaining pace in Western liberal and progressive circles. Politicians, experts, commentators and activists from the United States to the United Kingdom and Australia are arguing in unison that their governments should view the pandemic as a wake-up call to improve their relationship with the environment and take constructive steps to tackle climate change. While the recipes they offer for achieving a “green” recovery differ in detail, they appear to share one important feature: a tendency to ignore the global nature of the climate crisis, the nuanced and lived experiences of the Global South and the Global North’s role in creating an unfair system that marginalises the environmental groups, peoples and ideas in the South.Indeed only a few of the dozens of articles published on the prospects of a post-coronavirus “green” new deal talk of the irreparable harm the actions of rich industrialised countries have caused, and continue to cause, in the Global South. Some mention internationalism only in passing, seemingly to avoid accusations of Trumpian parochialism, while others argue – often as an afterthought – that the positive effects of European and American green new deals would eventually trickle down and be felt in the poor, developing countries that are on the front lines of the climate crisis. None of these articles, meanwhile, suggests the West should take responsibility for its past crimes or argue for climate reparations.One article on post-coronavirus economic recovery even suggests that US President Franklin Roosevelt’s new deal, a set of policies and programmes he implemented to reinvigorate the US economy after the Great Depression of the 1930s, should be used as a starting point for a modern “green new deal”. The article, however, predictably does not mention Roosevelt’s many imperial crimes and the direct role he played in decimating Haiti’s resources and exposing the island nation to the worst effects of climate change.While climate change poses a threat to everyone living on this planet, its harmful effects are not distributed evenly among countries and communities. Island nations and low-income countries across the world, from the Maldives and Haiti to Bangladesh and Madagascar, bear the brunt of environmental destruction and man-made and corporate-driven global warming. What do these countries have in common? They are all former colonies or prefectures of major Western powers. The climate breakdown we are witnessing today is being felt the hardest in countries where colonisation decimated natural resources, altered infrastructures and compromised traditional ways of living that respect the environment. Colonisation caused record greenhouse emissions, contributed to the heating of oceans (which pave the way for stronger storms) and resulted in unprecedented pollution. Moreover, it led to a loss of indigenous knowledge about environmental protection as well as long-lasting institutional and economic weaknesses that make it harder for formerly colonised nations to combat the deadly consequences of global warming. This is why climate change cannot be addressed with green new deals and green recovery plans that do not acknowledge the colonial roots of the ongoing crisis. This is why the international community needs to have a serious discussion about climate reparations.As the Global North continues its efforts to contain COVID-19 and restart economies decimated by coronavirus lockdowns, the Global South is not only trying to withstand this unprecedented public health crisis with significantly less resources, but is also gearing up for new climate catastrophes. The full economic consequences of the coronavirus for the Global South are not yet fully realised. Many of the countries most prone to the effects of climate change, however, are already heading into recession because they cannot export their goods or welcome tourists due to the pandemic. Moreover, the Atlantic hurricane season is officially here. This year, scientists predict that there will be up to 19 named storms. They also forecast that 6-10 storms could become hurricanes (bearing winds that reach 120km/h or higher). According to recent research, the increasing severity of tropical hurricane seasons is directly linked to climate change. This is more than many climate change-prone, low-income nations can realistically bare. The loss of power and destruction to the infrastructures these storms can cause could potentially worsen hygiene conditions, make social distancing practically impossible and contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in affected countries. The Global North is responsible for the deadly two-pronged crisis many countries in the Global South are currently facing. Green new deals and green recovery plans cannot work until former imperial powers take responsibility for their past crimes and pay retributions to the nations they exposed to the worst effects of climate change.This is why, despite their seemingly “global” ambitions, the proposals for “green” new deals coming from Europe and the US do not excite many in the Global South. As a new and more vicious hurricane season starts with the Caribbean islands in its direct range, and India and Bangladesh count their losses after being struck with yet another deadly cyclone, people on the actual front line of climate change are finding it hard to be enthusiastic about proposals that solely focus on developed nations and completely ignore their plight.A new imperial master plan that offers no compensation or hope to the countries that are experiencing the worst immediate and long-term effects of climate change cannot resolve the unprecedented crisis the world is facing today. The only way for a better, healthier and more prosperous future for all is through a truly global climate stabilisation and resilience plan that includes reparations to former colonies that are struggling to withstand a crisis that they played little role in creating. If environmentalists and policymakers in the West fail to see this, millions in the Global South will continue to lose their lives and livelihoods to climate change and the world will lose precious time in responding to the economic, social and environmental devastation looming on the horizon. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.
890	2	Forty million people were under heat alerts Tuesday across the Central and Southern United States as a hot and sultry air mass led to dangerously hot conditions.Houston hit 100 degrees Sunday and Monday, Dallas has reached 101 on three days since Friday, and Oklahoma City saw a high of 103 degrees Monday. Some locations set daily records for high temperatures.It’s an impressive heat wave, but it’s nothing compared with what Europe endured two weeks ago when all-time national records fell in at least half a dozen countries. What’s more, few all-time daytime high temperature records are being broken.Then why does it feel so awful?Heat waves in Europe are seldom accompanied by the humidity we get in the United States. Our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean opens the doors to sauna-like moisture streaming northward unimpeded, bringing the sultry mugginess over wide swaths of the Deep South and Southern Plains this time of year, along with the East Coast on occasion.The oceans are absorbing more than 90 percent of the extra heat from global warming, with dramatic increases observed in ocean heat content in recent decades. This in turn can make more moisture available for weather systems.Right now, the Gulf is running about a degree Fahrenheit above average this season, which means the adjacent air can hold even more moisture — 3.2 percent more, in fact.Heat alone is bad, but accompanied by tropical moisture is brutal, since it increases the heat index.The heat index is essentially a “feels like” temperature that takes temperature and humidity into account. Heat places more strain on your body if it is accompanied by high humidity, since it inhibits the body’s ability to perspire and cool down. Beads of sweat evaporate from our skin and extract thermal energy, taking heat out of our body and making us feel cooler.As the air warms, it can hold more water. However, when the air is already near saturation, it can’t hold much extra water. So even though we’re still sweating, the air isn’t allowing the sweat to evaporate as quickly. That’s when our body temperatures start to warm to dangerous levels.The ongoing heat wave is concerning because the overnight lows have remained unusually high, on top of dew points running in the 70s.Galveston, Tex., has seen a heat index of 95 degrees or greater every hour since noon last Wednesday. The heat index was over 100 degrees for 42 hours straight ending at 2 a.m. Saturday. Last Thursday the heat index there hit 117. And Galveston hasn’t seen a dew point below 75 degrees at any point during August.At night, there’s no respite. That’s what makes these conditions downright dangerous, since the human body needs some relief to be able to stave off heat-related illnesses.The hot and humid conditions occurring now in parts of the United States place more strain on the human body than the heat wave in Paris did. That’s because Paris had a dew point of 51.8 degrees (giving a relative humidity of 16 percent) when they hit the 109.2-degree air temperature, an all-time record for the city.So, despite much lower temperatures here in the States, the heat indexes are markedly higher because of the humidity. (It’s important to remember that few, if any, residences in Paris have air conditioning, while it’s ubiquitous in the U.S. Deep South.) With the current heat wave here, we have between 2.3 and 2.8 times more water in the air, compared with Paris’s peak heat day.As the climate continues to warm, the prospect of increasingly humid heat waves will increase. That will make heat indexes worse. Moreover, an increase in soil moisture, often spurred by agricultural use, can add even more moisture to the air.Let’s take New Orleans. Since 1970, its dew points have been increasing an average of 0.053 degrees per year. That sounds insignificant, but that corresponds to a 2.6-degree increase today, compared with 1970. And that means there’s 9.7 percent more moisture in the air now, on average, than there was in 1970.That has enormous implications for increasing heat indexes in the Big Easy.In New Orleans, the overnight summer lows are warming 280 percent faster than daytime highs. That makes warm, humid nights unbearable. That’s the killer with these heat waves. And it’s only getting worse.A study published in Environmental Research Communications last month by researchers at the Union of Concerned Scientists hints at an alarmingly hot future across the U.S.“By the mid-21st century (2036—2065) … the annual numbers of days with heat indices exceeding 105 degrees are projected to triple,” said the study, which focused specifically on heat indexes rather than actual air temperatures.The group also estimated that, during the same time frame, a quarter of the United States would venture into “no analog” territory every year. In other words, 25 percent of the United States will be venturing into unprecedented heat-index territory regularly.Furthermore, the duration of extreme heat index events could double as global average surface temperatures and atmospheric water vapor both spike, according to the study. That means episodes like what’s been happening in Galveston will become increasingly common.
908	3	“THE one approach I will not accept,” said Barack Obama in June of Congress's faltering efforts to fight global warming, “is inaction.” Instead, the president instructed America's lawmakers to “seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels”. Yet the energy bill unveiled by the Democratic majority in the Senate on July 27th does nothing of the sort. Harry Reid, the majority leader, having earlier abandoned as hopeless an effort to limit America's emissions of greenhouse gases through a “cap-and-trade” scheme, is proposing nothing more substantial than subsidies for home insulation and trucks that run on natural gas. (The bill also removes the $75m cap on oil firms' liability for damage from offshore spills, in response to the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.) Mr Obama has said he will fight on for a weightier bill. But the prospects do not look good. Mr Reid complained that inveterate Republican opposition had prevented the Senate from taking up the cap-and-trade scheme passed by the House of Representatives last year. That is true: even Republican senators who had supported the idea in the past, such as John McCain and Lindsay Graham, had pointedly backed away from it in recent months.Most Republicans dismiss cap and trade as a job-killing stealth tax. They point out, rightly, that any measure that puts a price on carbon would raise energy bills—something they view as madness when the economy is so weak. Elections in November are likely to increase the Republicans' strength in Congress, and thus make the adoption of strict limits on emissions even more unlikely. But they are not the only sceptics. Many Democrats, especially from states with a lot of coal or wilting manufacturers, have long been unenthusiastic. Ten such senators wrote to Mr Reid in 2008 expressing grave misgivings about cap and trade. Some members of the House complain that their vote in favour of the scheme could cost them their jobs in November.Voters, by most pollsters' accounts, are becoming less energised about global warming. Earlier this year Gallup found that 48% of “moderate” Americans believe the seriousness of global warming “generally exaggerated”, up from 35% just two years before (see chart). Cap and trade (or “crap and tax”, as more excitable Republicans have called it) has become so controversial that Mr Reid now refuses to use the term, referring obliquely to controls on pollution.Even the president, environmentalists complain, has not done as much as he might have to push climate legislation forward, despite his stirring rhetoric. He deliberately left the details up to Congress—a mistake in the eyes of activists, who think he should have demonstrated his resolve by taking charge. There was none of the individual browbeating of recalcitrant congressmen that Mr Obama exercised with recent bills on financial reform or the extension of unemployment benefits. His advisers seem to have concluded that a climate bill was a non-starter given the parlous state of the economy, and concentrated on health care instead.That is quite a reversal for a man who declared, after he clinched the Democratic nomination for the presidency, “This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” Just last year, at the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen, Mr Obama promised to reduce America's emissions in 2020 to 17% below their level in 2005.The demise of cap and trade in Congress, however, does not call a complete halt to the administration's efforts to cut emissions. In 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act could be applied to greenhouse gases, and therefore that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should decide whether they posed a danger to public health. Last year the EPA concluded that they did. It is now working on regulations to mitigate the danger, to be applied to big, stationary sources of emissions such as power plants over the course of next year. The EPA is likely to set minimum standards of energy efficiency and to mandate the use of particular green technologies, among other things.Using the Clean Air Act, by the administration's own admission, is not the cheapest or most effective way to cut emissions. But officials at the EPA also say that they are prepared to use the law if Congress fails to act. And it is not the only tool at the president's disposal: different government agencies have the power to set fuel-efficiency standards for cars and energy-efficiency rules for appliances, for example. The severity of these regulations, by and large, is at the government's discretion.Many states are also pressing ahead with planned curbs on emissions. Ten north-eastern ones have already put a cap-and-trade scheme in place for utilities; several more in the West and Midwest have pledged to follow suit. California is particularly ambitious: it aims to pare its emissions back by 85% by 2050.Nicholas Bianco and Franz Litz of the World Resources Institute, a think-tank, have studied the potential to cut emissions under existing state and federal regulations. They conclude that if all the officials involved are ambitious, America could belch out 13% less by 2020.That is less than America pledged in Copenhagen, and also less than most scientists would like. And it is the optimistic scenario. In November's elections Californians will vote in a referendum on the repeal of the law underpinning the state's planned emissions cuts. In several other states, Republicans are running in noisy opposition to Democratic environmental initiatives. There are moves in Congress to repeal or defer the EPA's power to regulate greenhouse gases. And Mr Obama's administration will probably hesitate to ram through dramatic emissions cuts by decree, for fear of appearing undemocratic.Even if officials around America do promulgate fierce regulations, those will take some time to come into force, and are bound to be the subject of endless lawsuits. Moreover, such an approach will lead to a patchwork of different rules in different states, to the great expense and annoyance of many firms. Adding to the confusion and uncertainty will be the chance that a more sweeping federal law might eventually be enacted, if the political winds change once more. That may leave big energy firms regretting their opposition to cap and trade. As one old utility hand puts it, “There's a sense of ruefulness in the industry.” It is widely shared.
823	0	OPINION: Some stories are so unbelievable that, when you hear them, you think that surely someone has made this up.  But, on further examination, some details are so specific that they have to be true.  New podcast Deep Cover is one of these stories. It’s the tale of an FBI agent who goes undercover and infiltrates a biker gang, something that eventually leads to the invasion of a foreign country and the arrest of a dictator. The story begins when host Jake Halpern meets former FBI agent Ned Timmons, who has written a novel about his time undercover with a Detroit biker gang.

Timmons tells Halpern about his time undercover in 1980s Detroit, when he arrested a violent biker outlaw, who decided that rather than go to jail – he’d turn FBI informant.  Timmons goes deeper undercover with his informant ,infiltrating multiple gangs and hears lots of chatter about a drug smuggling syndicate, a massive drug warehouse and a source named Shine, who could be the key man in the operation.

925	3	A group of prominent scientists on Monday created a potential whiplash moment for climate policy, suggesting that humanity could have considerably more time than previously thought to avoid a “dangerous” level of global warming.The upward revision to the planet’s influential “carbon budget” was published by a number of researchers who have been deeply involved in studying the concept, making it all the more unexpected. But other outside researchers raised questions about the work, leaving it unclear whether the new analysis — which, if correct, would have very large implications — will stick.In a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, a team of 10 researchers, led by Richard Millar of the University of Oxford, recalculated the carbon budget for limiting the Earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above temperatures seen in the late 19th century. It had been widely assumed that this stringent target would prove unachievable — but the new study would appear to give us much more time to get our act together if we want to stay below it.“What this paper means is that keeping warming to 1.5 degrees C still remains a geophysical possibility, contrary to quite widespread belief,” Millar said in a news briefing. He conducted the research with scientists from Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, Switzerland and Norway.But the new calculation diverged so much from what had gone before that other experts were still trying to figure out what to make of it.“When it’s such a substantial difference, you really need to sit back and ponder what that actually means,” Glen Peters, an expert on climate and emissions trajectories at the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, said of the paper. He was not involved in the research.“The implications are pretty profound,” Peters continued. “But because of that, you’re going to have some extra eyes really scrutinizing that this is a robust result.”That may have already begun, with at least one prominent climate scientist confessing he had a hard time believing the result.“It is very hard to see how we could still have a substantial CO2 emissions budget left for 1.5 °C, given we’re already at 1 °C, thermal inertia means we’ll catch up with some more warming even without increased radiative forcing, and any CO2 emissions reductions inevitably comes with reduced aerosol load as well, the latter reduction causing some further warming,” Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany said by email.Any substantial revision to the carbon budget would have major implications, changing our ideas of how rapidly countries will need to ratchet down their greenhouse gas emissions in coming years and, thus, the very workings of global climate policymaking.Limiting the Earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures was the most ambitious goal cited in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It is of particular importance to vulnerable developing nations and small island states, which fear that they could be submerged by rising seas unless warming remains this modest.Discussion up until now, however, has largely focused on how to avoid the more lenient but still-quite-difficult target of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). That is both because 1.5 degrees C was widely viewed as infeasible and because considerably less research had focused on studying the achievability of the target.In 2013, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculated that humanity could emit about 1,000 more gigatons, or billion tons, of carbon dioxide from 2011 onward if it wanted a good chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees C — launching the highly influential concept of the “carbon budget.”The allowable emissions or budget for 1.5 degrees C would, naturally, be lower. One 2015 study found they were 200 billion to 400 billion tons. And we currently emit about 41 billion tons per year, so every three years, more than 100 billion tons are gone.No wonder a recent study put the chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C at 1 percent. Peters said that according to the prior paradigm, we basically would have used up the carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2022.That’s what makes the new result so surprising: It finds that we have more than 700 billion tons left to emit to keep warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius, with a two-thirds probability of success. “That’s about 20 years at present-day emissions,” Millar said at the news briefing.“These remaining budgets are substantially greater than the budgets that might have been inferred from the” IPCC, he added.The recalculation emerges, said study co-author Joeri Rogelj of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, because warming has been somewhat less than forecast by climate models — and because emissions have been somewhat more than expected.“The most complex Earth system models that provided input to [the IPCC] tend to slightly overestimate historical warming, and at the same time underestimate compatible historical CO2 emissions,” he said by email. “These two small discrepancies accumulate over time and lead to an slight underestimation of the remaining carbon budget. What we did in this study is to reset the uncertainties, starting from where we are today.”Pierre Friedlingstein, another author of the study and a professor at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, added at the news briefing that “the models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions. … So, therefore, they derive a budget which is much lower.”The new research, thus, seems to potentially empower a critique of climate science that has often been leveled by skeptics, doubters and “lukewarmers” who argue that warming is shaping up to be less than climate models have predicted.But Rahmstorf, for one, finds this to be part of the problem. “They appear to have adjusted the budget upward based on the idea that there has been less observed warming than suggested by the climate models, but that is not actually true if you do the comparison properly,” he wrote, citing the need to measure the warming of the Arctic properly and account for the effect of aerosols.In the meantime, the result could be a lot of confusion, says Oliver Geden, who leads the EU Division for the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.“First, it is quite unusual that scientists say that the state of the climate is better than expected, that a recalculation of the remaining carbon budget gives us more breathing room, not less,” Geden said in an email. “Second, it is far from clear that the authors’ method/results will form a new scientific consensus, given that some researchers are already voicing objections. A significant carbon budget recalculation should not come as a surprise, but for many policymakers it will.”Rogelj said the study did not explicitly consider whether the carbon budget for 2 degrees Celsius would also be larger, but, nonetheless, it surely rises substantially, too, if the analysis is correct.Nonetheless, even with the new revision, the latest research finds that keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C will be quite hard. “Even with the largest estimates of the remaining carbon budget, this path is extremely challenging, starting reductions immediately and then reducing emissions to zero over 40 years,” Millar said at the press event.Overall, the dispute raises questions about how widely the carbon-budget concept has proliferated — and just how much we actually understand it.“It goes to show, this carbon-budget approach is still much more, let’s say, immature scientifically than what we often assume,” Peters said.Read more at Energy & Environment:Trump says ‘we’ve had bigger storms’ when asked about Harvey, Irma, and climate changeThe Everglades have always been hit by hurricanes.

978	3	"In part one and two of our special investigation into the health of New Zealand's rivers, Newshub examined what exactly is polluting our waterways, and what is being done to try to protect and save them.In part three we look at what effects climate change could have on the health of our rivers, and analyse if we've already reached the tipping point for overall decline in waterway health.One of the biggest problems facing our rivers, especially those in areas of New Zealand facing drought such as the Canterbury plains, or a noticeable rise in temperature such as Waikato and Northland, is keeping the water flow cool.As we examined in part two of Newshub's report, Kiwi dairy farmers are undertaking a massive planting operation alongside the area of land immediately adjacent to waterways on their farms, known as the riparian area - and one of the many reasons these plants are important is because they help shade the water, keeping them cool.NIWA has worked with the dairy industry on best practice to protect rivers from getting warmer, and chief scientist of freshwater and estuaries Dr John Quinn says riparian planting is a key weapon in fighting to keep our rivers from heating up.""If we get riparian shade around small streams now it's one thing we can do to mitigate some of that impact by reducing the heating that's going to occur. ""But that's just the reality that if we carry on the way we are with climate change we're going to see less water in those areas that will have big impacts in both the agricultural system and on the stream system, it certainly exacerbates the problems we have with purification in both lakes and in rivers.""NIWA has predicted what river flow in New Zealand could look like by the end of this century, using data from current climate change projections.As you can see, rivers on the east coast of the South Island, Wairarapa, Hawke's Bay, Waikato, Auckland and Northland all face the possibility of having a 5 - 10 percent reduction in river flow by 2090.Alpine rivers however, especially those in the Southern Alps of the South Island, are projected to have a drastic increase in flow.On the projection, NIWA says: ""In a warmer world New Zealand is exposed to more westerly airflow from the Tasman, and few easterlies. This would bring more precipitation to the Southern Alps in particular, resulting in higher river flows in rivers with alpine sources. This is seen quite vividly as Canterbury's major rivers become wetter on average while their shorter nearby rivers tend to dry. The largest decline, in percentage terms, centres on parts of Hawke's Bay.""NIWA say there is a 20 - 100 percent projection of decreased river flow in some areas of Hawke's Bay and Banks Peninsula in Canterbury.There are obviously thousands of agriculture businesses in those areas expected to see a reduction in river flow - not just dairy farming, but beef, lamb and a myriad of other land based industries.Warmer temperatures will kill off vital insect populationsDairyNZ water scientist Dr Tom Stephens told Newshub he believes one of the biggest threats to our waterways is rising temperatures.""The biggest way of removing oxygen from our waterways is simply by heating them up. And if you raise the water temperature of a waterway on top of removing the oxygen carrying capacity, it actually directly impacts on our high value insect species, the stonefly and the mayfly.""If a stream rises above 20 degrees, those species will disappear. They undergo mortality, what we call extinction, and yet those species are critical sources of food for our fish, and they're also critical to grazing algae and keeping that under control.""The larger the waterway - the harder it is to coolNIWA's Dr John Quinn says that while riparian planting can help protect smaller streams from heating up, the problem becomes more complicated the larger the waterway gets.""So clearly, if you can shade out the stream you reduce the temperature which is one of the things that is making algal blooms grow more quickly, and the light which makes them grow.""We've done experiments on different scales that show that that really does work, but once streams get bigger - beyond 10 to 15 metres - it becomes more and more challenging to shade, to use shade to control.""Dr Stephens agrees that protecting these larger waterways from the heat of the sun is incredibly important. New Zealand's longest river, the Waikato, is also one our widest, and in certain areas has seen a stark decline in health. He puts this down to insect populations, which are incredibly important to river health.""One of the biggest reasons why we don't have the insect diversity we need and we want in our community in the Waikato waterways is that they're too hot.""Algal growth can be important to insect health, particularly in shallow streams, when we're talking about a deep river or a hydro lake it's slightly different, because the algal growth isn't attached to the bed, it's the free floating stuff, it's what we call phytoplankton. ""Because you can't shade the lake, or a river that's larger than five metres wide, you just can't get enough shade on it to control for that algae. ""So climate change looks set to have a drastic impact on the health of our waterways, and it would appear science can only do so much to protect them. Discussions need to be happening now about how best to tackle this problem before it spirals beyond control and the rivers on the Canterbury Plains and Hawke's Bay dry up for good.The Selwyn River in Canterbury looks to have almost dried up already - and a major investigation needs to be done to find out why. If too much water has been taken out of the Selwyn to irrigate agricultural-based industries, which has been suggested, then surely the Government must get involved to stop this from happening to other rivers.So have we reached a tipping point for overall river decline in New Zealand?Dr Mike Joy teaches environmental sustainability at Massey University and says the shocking state of the Selwyn River in particular should be a wake-up call for all New Zealanders.""There's certainly some basket cases like the Selwyn. It's a bad example of just decades of putting the wrong things in the wrong place and now, it's coming home to haunt us. ""If you take the whole country then nearly all of our rivers are in perfect condition where they start off, in a conservation state they're fantastic pristine rivers as good as anywhere in the world, but it's the bottom ends that are the problem.""It could take generations for our rivers to recoverDr Kevin Simon teaches freshwater ecology at Auckland University. He believes we've not reached the tipping point yet, but we are very close.""Could it be saved? Sure. It certainly could be made better. It will take a long time and a very large amount of effort.""So I think that one of the big questions is how much effort are we going to require to repair some of these systems to make them better and how long should we be thinking about in terms of timeframe for recovery. ""It could be very well in order of talking about decades or generations.""Is 'polluter pays' part of the answer?Dr Joy shares Dr Simon's views but is perhaps less optimistic of a positive outcome for our rivers.""The majority of our rivers are in decline, they're getting worse, they're not even stable.""They're all of the rivers that are in pastoral catchment, nearly all of them are getting worse and so there's no sign, we're doing nothing that's going to reduce it unless we get some kind of a handle on reducing intensification and we have to do something about polluter pays.""So until we do that, until we actually start making some change and not just talking about it then we're just going to have continuing decline of our water quality.""We have to face up to the fact that we've made a mess and actually do something about it.""Dr Stephens paints a far more positive picture.""I wouldn't say that the rivers are getting worse as such. If you look at the latest trend reporting by NIWA and the Waikato Regional Council, indicators for sediment are improving, indicators for phosphorus are improving, indicators for algae in our hydro lakes are improving. ""There isn't a hydro lake where the algal growth is worsening, not in the last 10 to 20 years.""Tomorrow, in part four of Newshub's special investigation into the health of New Zealand's waterways, we'll examine the blame game and finger-pointing that has ramped up over the decline of our river health - and ask whether it is time for all parties, organisations and industries to have a frank and urgent discussion about how they can best work together to save them."
681	0	A conservation officer in Canada who was fired for refusing to kill two black bear cubs has won a protracted legal battle over his termination.“I feel like the black clouds that have hung over my family for years are finally starting to part,” Bryce Casavant told the Guardian. “But the moment is bittersweet – my firing should have never happened in the first place.”Casavant was dispatched in 2015 to a mobile home park near the British Columbia town of Port Hardy, where a female black bear was rummaging through a freezer of meat and salmon.Under the province’s policy, Casavant shot and killed the mother, but decided not to harm the cubs, who residents told him hadn’t been spotted eating food or garbage.“Instead of complying with the kill order, he took the cubs to a veterinarian who assessed them and transferred them to the North Island Recovery Centre,” the court documents read. The two cubs were eventually released back into the wild.But because of his refusal to follow orders, Casavant was suspended and then fired.Casavant spent years fighting his termination at various levels of provincial courts, and this week, the BC court of appeals found in his favour.“I kept fighting so that I could clear my name. I’ve long stood for public service, honour and integrity. It’s how I was raised and how I’ve raised my daughter,” said Casavant, who previously served in Afghanistan in the Canadian military. “I really feel that I was targeted.”While the judgment does not reinstate him as a conservation officer, Casavant said that the decision was a “vindication” of his costly legal battle, which pit him against two provincial governments and his own union. Conservation officers have long been aware of a tension between public safety and the management of “garbage bears”. Earlier this year, however, First Nations community members in British Columbia protested the planned killing of a grizzly bear that had been spotted eating garbage. Instead, they lobbied the government and conservation service to relocate the bear. The bear was successfully moved to a new location, but it was subsequently shot and killed.In January, the conservation group Pacific Wild, which works with Casavant, found that more than 4,500 bears had been killed by conservation officers in the province over the last eight years, including 4,341 black bears.“[British Columbia] isn’t a shooting gallery for government employees,” Casavant wrote in the report. “It’s unreasonable to believe that, including juvenile bear cubs, over 4,000 black bears were killed ‘as a last resort’.”
106	3	"Photos taken a decade and a half apart show the change in snow in California. Photo / NASANasa Earth has released a series of satellite photographs showing the transformation of one of the most famous mountain ranges on Earth.The comparison photographs taken over the past 15 years show the gradual ""drying"" of the magnificent Sierra Nevada mountains in America's west.While the region is known for its extreme ""boom and bust"" cycles, Nasa says the mountains have ultimately seen less snow accumulation in recent years.This time-lapse series of images shows springtime snow-covered area on the Sierra Nevada from 2006 to 2021. The depth and breadth of the seasonal snowpack  depends on whether a winter is wet or dry. Wet winters, like 2006 and 2017, tend to stack up deep snowpack. pic.twitter.com/vgQsyAIZ78Alongside the comparison images, Nasa also posted a timelapse video of springtime in the snow-covered region, spanning a time frame from 2006 to 2021. The difference is stark, showing while there are still wet cycles, the dry cycles of the region are becoming harsher and more frequent.""The Sierra Nevada has seen less snow accumulation in recent years, a decline that plays a role in water management and response to drought,"" Nasa said in its tweet.The photos were all snapped at similar times each year, around April 1, which falls around halfway through the water year (October 1 to September 30), this is the time when the snowpack has usually peaked and is beginning to melt.These snow totals at the time are important for forecasts of spring and summer water supplies. Wet winters, like those in 2006 and 2017, tend to build a deep snowpack while the region reached historically low levels in 2015 after four years of hot and dry conditions.""Snow in the Sierra Nevada tends to be boom or bust, and much of it tends to come from atmospheric river events,"" McKenzie Skiles, a snow scientist at the University of Utah, told Nasa.""Over the past 10 years, there have been fewer boom years, while the dry years have been getting drier.""Benjamin Hatchett, a snow scientist at the US Desert Research Institute said these drier phases are expected to continue.""In the past few years, we have had prolonged, multi-week winter dry spells, and we expect more of them going forward in a warming world,"" he said.""The dry spells allow snow to start ripening earlier and melting to begin, especially if temperatures are above normal. During spring, warm and dry weather can help maintain rapid melting, especially if the snow surface becomes dirty and the albedo declines.""Both scientists are particularly concerned in changes in albedo, which is the brightness of the Earth's surface and how much light it is capable of reflecting, and the feedback this creates.Less snow results in fewer dark-coloured surfaces to absorb energy and can cause more snow to melt.A study published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science last year showed that 2000-2018 was the driest period in the US Southwest since the late 1500s. The past three years have continued the trend with 2021 shaping up to becoming the driest year in modern history for the region, and California's reservoir levels are dropping.""There are multiple drivers of the snow trends, and their roles vary and interact,"" said Hatchett. ""For instance, less frequent storms (drought years) mean there is less precipitation that can build a snowpack, and the corresponding increase in dry days means there are more opportunities to melt existing snow.With historic drought and extreme heat in the western U.S., 2021 is on track for another record-breaking year of devastating wildfires. Track them in our @nasa_eyes software using the ""carbon monoxide"" vital sign: https://t.co/SGpjRAaA3x pic.twitter.com/P2QsN1nLOD""Also, increases in temperatures on wet days reduce the fraction of precipitation falling as snow; increases in dry day temperatures help contribute to warming the snowpack to the melting point.""And humidity plays an important role in midwinter and spring melt events.""We are in a transitional period from the climate we expected – that is admittedly wetter than many other times in the past – into somewhat uncharted territory of a warmer world,"" Hatchett added."
504	5	"Victoria University geologist Professor Tim Naish is one of New Zealand's leading Antarctic researchers. Photo / SuppliedClimate change is already redefining coastlines and the weather here in New Zealand and around the world. How will it affect us and what can we do about it? Two of New Zealand's leading climate change experts, Professors Tim Nash and James Re wick of Victoria University, are heading out on the road this month on a nationwide speaking tour. They shared 10 facts people might not know about climate change.1Wellington has the longest continuous carbon dioxide record in the Southern Hemisphere.The measurement station at Baring Head at the mouth of Wellington Harbour (now run by Nita), and its predecessor at Maker on the coast west of the city, have been measuring carbon isotopes since the 1950s and carbon dioxide since the early 1970s.The only longer-running site is the famous Mauna Loa record in Hawaii, started by Charles Keeling in the late 1950s.2The last time we had a record cold year was 1909.Temperatures vary up and down from year to year, because of El Nino and La Nina events, or in association with other natural influences.But the background trend has been upwards for all of the last century and beyond.The warmest year in the observational record going back to the 1880s was 2015, and the previous record warm year was 2014.Meanwhile, 2016 looks set to be the new record warm year.The coldest year on record since 1880 is 1909, 107 years ago.Temperatures today are so much higher than they were then that even a huge volcanic eruption blocking out sunlight for months would not cool the planet back to early 20th century values.3 Almost 100 per cent of scientists are certain that global warming is human-induced.In the game of attributing global warming to humankind's use of fossil fuels, scientists are almost 100 per cent certain.The reason that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says ""the human influence on the climate system is clear"" with 99 per cent certainty is due to a technical rule -- they have agreed that ""cause and effect statements"" must allow for a slight uncertainty.The facts are that the present levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have not been seen for three million years on planet Earth.At that time the world was on average two to three degrees warmer, and global sea levels were at least 10m higher.The carbon we have been adding to the atmosphere has a chemical signature of fossil wood - coal, oil and gas. It is not from volcanic eruptions.Oxygen levels in the atmosphere have been declining as carbon dioxide levels have increased, due to the combustion of oxygen by burning fossil fuels. And finally the radiative effects of carbon dioxide and methane as powerful greenhouse gases has been known for more than a century.The physics is beyond question.Skeptics would do well to stop wasting their energy, and distracting the public and scientists by trying to deconstruct this scientific truth, and join the rest of humanity in helping figure out what to do about climate change.4 The tropics are expanding.The tropics hold most of the heat in the climate system, and as things warm, the tropical belt is expanding slightly.And, the atmosphere is getting deeper.The region of warmest tropical waters, north of Australia, where sea temperatures are above 28C, has got 20 per cent bigger in the past 60 years.Some of that warm water runs down the east coast of Australia and then across the Tasman to New Zealand.Sea temperatures have risen really fast off the southeast of Australia and near Tasmania, as the East Australian Current has strengthened.Some of that warm water may be heading our way.5 Ninety-three per cent of the heat and 24 per cent of the carbon dioxide from humankind's use of fossil fuels has gone into the ocean.While the ocean is slowing the pace of warming, putting gas and heat in the ocean has other unintended consequences.The ocean is warming, especially the Southern Ocean which is melting the edges of the Antarctic ice sheet, contributing to sea-level rise.As the ocean warms it also expands and this has caused half of the sea-level rise observed during the 20th and 21st centuries.Once the heat is in the ocean it will take centuries to remove it.This commits us to long term sea-level rise.6 The polar regions warm twice as much as the rest of the planet.This phenomenon, known as polar amplification, is a concern because 70 per cent of the world's fresh water is locked up in the polar ice sheets, and if it all melted it would lead to the equivalent of 60m sea level rise from Antarctic and 7m from Greenland.Powerful climate feedbacks, associated with sea-ice, are already expressing themselves in the Arctic, with Arctic ocean summer sea-ice expected to be all gone by as soon as 2050.The replacement of white ice with dark ocean absorbing even more heat is a powerful amplifier of regional atmospheric warming.The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed 0.5C per decade for the last 50 years -- the fastest-warming place on the planet -- and ice shelves are collapsing catastrophically.7 Global sea-level predictions might be on the low side.The latest science suggests that the contribution from Antarctic ice sheets may be underestimated in predictions of future sea-level rise to the end of the century and beyond made in the recent IPCC report.The new ice sheet melting models add as much as 80cm of additional sea-level rise to the upper bound projection of at least 1m by the year 2100 made by the IPCC.Of even more concern is that with 30cm of sea-level rise expected by 2050, the 100-year coastal flooding event will be happening every year in some parts of New Zealand, such as Dunedin city.8  The Paris Agreement is a huge ask.The Paris climate agreement was a major diplomatic success with the world's nations agreeing to limit global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.However, achieving the ambition of Paris is an enormous challenge.If each national pledge to reduce green house gas emissions is acted on this will limit global warming to about 2.7C.So even more action is required, and low-lying island countries and African nations have requested 1.5C be achieved as 2C is too much for them.More disturbing is that current policy settings, including New Zealand's, have us on target for 3.5C global warming.To achieve the 2C target, emissions must peak very soon and all emissions of carbon dioxide must be reduced to zero before the end of the century. Business as usual will have us at 2C by 2035.9 New Zealand's per capita emissions are well above the global average.We often hear that New Zealand's emissions are so small that we can't make any difference in the world.But every group of 4.5 million people in the world could say that.Per head of population, our emissions are in the top 10 globally.Although agricultural emissions are a big part of the story, the biggest growth in emissions in recent decades has been in transport and energy production/industry, so there are plenty of avenues for reduction.10  New Zealand is well placed to make significant greenhouse gas reductions by transferring to a low-carbon economy.Zero emissions of carbon dioxide by the end of the century can be achieved for all sectors of society and the economy except agriculture.Agriculture accounts for 50 per cent of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions and, while efficiencies are being made, these are being offset by increased production.Significant reductions require major economic trade-offs with livestock productivity, and given the dependence of our economy on the primary production sector, this is unlikely in the short term.A goal of 90 to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2025 is achievable through more wind, solar and hydro, and a national smart grid where distributed electricity generation can be fed in, as well as improving efficiency of existing generation.Arguably the biggest opportunity for reductions is in the transport sector, where a transition to more efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles, use of public transport and coastal shipping and rail transport for freight would greatly reduce emissions.New Zealand needs a functioning carbon pricing mechanism, whether that be a tax or emissions trading scheme that works to incentivise change.New Zealand is well placed to lead the way internationally to a thriving low carbon economy with all the co-benefits of energy security and independence, more livable cities, leaders in new green-tech industries powering economic growth, and increased sustainability and resilience to climate change.The recent report by the Royal Society lays out the opportunities for transitioning New Zealand to a low carbon society and economy.Napier: 6pm Wednesday, July 6, Century Theatre, MTG, 9 Herschell StreetPalmerston North: 7.30pm Thursday, July 7, Palmerston North Public Library, 4 The SquareChristchurch: 6.30pm Wednesday, August 3, C1 LT, Central Lecture Theatre Block, University of Canterbury, Arts RoadDunedin: 5.30pm.

198	4	"Food is one of society's key sensitivities to climate. A year of not enough or too much rainfall, a hot spell or cold snap at the wrong time, or extremes, like flooding and storms, can have a significant effect on local crop yields and livestock production. While modern farming technologies and techniques have helped to reduce this vulnerability and boost production, the impact of recent droughts in the USA, China and Russia on global cereal production highlight a glaring potential future vulnerability. There is some evidence that climate change is already having a measurable affect on the quality and quantity of food produced globally. But this is small when compared with the significant increase in global food production that has been achieved over the past few decades. Isolating the influence of climatic change from all the other trends is difficult, but one recent Stanford University study found that increases in global production of maize and wheat since 1980 would have been about 5% higher were it not for climate change. All else being equal, rising carbon dioxide concentrations – the main driver of climate change – could increase production of some crops, such as rice, soybean and wheat. However, the changing climate would affect the length and quality of the growing season and farmers could experience increasing damage to their crops, caused by a rising intensity of droughts, flooding or fires. The latest IPCC report predicted improving conditions for food production in the mid to high latitudes over the next few decades, including in the northern USA, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. Conversely, parts of the subtropics, such as the Mediterranean region and parts of Australia, and the low latitudes, could experience declining conditions. For example, across Africa, yields from rain-fed agriculture could decline by as much as 50% by 2020. Beyond this, if global temperatures rise by more than about 1–3°C, declining conditions could be experienced over a much larger area. The future course of global food production will depend on how well societies can adapt to such climatic changes, as well as the influence of other pressures, such as the competition for land from biofuel production. The IPCC concluded that in the poorer, low-latitude countries, climate change could seriously challenge the capacity to adapt for a warming of more than 3°C. The richer, higher latitude countries are likely to have a greater capacity to adapt and exploit changing climatic conditions.But we can't ignore the potential for ""surprises"" down the line. There are many uncertainties in such predictions. The world has not seen such changes in climate for millennia, and so it is impossible to know how our agricultural systems will react in the real world. For example, the complex interlinkages with the impacts of climate change on pests, diseases and pollinators, like bees, are largely unknown. Also, climate models have difficulty in accurately predicting the detailed local environmental changes that are important for food production, particularly weather extremes.A looming vulnerability is the world's fisheries, which provide an important source of protein for at least half the world's population. Fisheries are already stressed by overexploitation and pollution. Warming surface waters in the oceans, rivers and lakes, as well as sea level rise and melting ice, will adversely affect many fish species. Some marine fish species are already adapting by migrating to the high latitudes, but others, such as Arctic and freshwater species, have nowhere to go. The absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the oceans also has a direct impact on marine ecosystems through ocean acidification. But what does this mean for food security – the price and availability of food for the world's seven billion people? A 2011 Foresight report concluded that climate change is a relatively small factor here, at least in the short term, when compared with the rapid increases in global food demand expected in the next decade. On current projections, by 2050 there will be between one and three billion additional mouths to feed. As people become wealthier, they also demand more food and disproportionally more meat, which requires far more land and water resources per calorie consumed. When these factors are combined, it points toward a future of increasing and more volatile food prices. As was seen during the 2007–08 food price spikes, the poorest countries and communities will be hit first and hardest. The Foresight report concluded that international policy has an important role to play here – today, despite plentiful supplies of food globally, almost one billion people are undernourished. Finally, food production itself is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as a cause of environmental degradation in many parts of the world. Agriculture contributes about 15% of all emissions, on a par with transport. When land conversion and the wider food system are taken into account the total contribution of food may be as high as 30%. This means that to limit the long-run impacts of climate change, food production must become not only more resilient to climate but also more sustainable and low-carbon itself.• This article was written by Nicola Ranger of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian• This answer last updated: 10.07.12• Read about the project and suggest a question• Report an error in this answerRelated questions• What is the economic cost of climate change?• What is the Stern review?•  Which nations are most responsible for climate change?

966	3	"The Planet Earth-observation company has just released new imagery of the broken Milne Ice Shelf in the Arctic.Located on the northern margin of Canada's Ellesmere Island, the ice platform split on 30/31 July to form a free-floating bloc some 80 sq km (30 sq miles) in area.By 3 August, this berg, or ""ice island"", had itself ruptured in two, with both segments then seen to drift out into the Arctic Ocean. Ice shelves are the floating fronts of glaciers that have flowed off the land into the sea. Ellesmere Island was once bounded by extensive shelves that had melded into a single structure.At the beginning of the 20th Century, this covered 8,600 sq km. But by the turn of the millennium, a rapidly warming climate had reduced and segmented the floating ice cover to just 1,050 sq km. Further break-up events in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2012, and now in 2020, mean the shelf area is currently under 500 sq km.Milne itself now measures only 106 sq km. The pictures from the Californian Planet company come from its Dove satellites. The imagery was acquired on 26 July (""before"") and 31 July (""after"").Interesting to note are the numerous melt ponds that cover the surface of the shelf. The presence of such liquid water can be problematic for ice platforms. If it fills crevasses, it can help to open them up. The water will push down on the fissures, driving them through to the base of the shelf in a process known as hydrofracturing. This will weaken an ice shelf."
977	2	More $300 million in Southland roading revenue has been spent in other regions, and some proposed government emission reduction rules may entrench the inequity further, southern councils say. Environment Southland, Invercargill City Council and Southland District Council have prepared a joint submission to the Government’s Transitioning To A Low-Emissions And Climate- Resilient Future discussion document, which was open for consultation until November 24. The submission was tabled at an Environment Southland council meeting on Wednesday. The discussion document says New Zealand’s first emission reduction plan will set out the actions the country will take to meet the first emissions budget, put us on the path to meet the second and third, and transition to a low-emissions future in a way that is achievable and affordable. READ MORE: * 'Concrete details' needed to determine Southland's future after Tiwai: Minister * Environment Southland's plans to reduce emissions  However, the southern councils have sounded a warning that some initiatives mentioned in the document will not work in Southland, and a regional approach would be needed to implement others. The discussion document says transport is our second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. It proposes changing the way we travel, improving passenger vehicles and promoting a more efficient freight system, and wants to reduce emissions from freight transport by 25 per cent by 2035. The councils’ submission says Southland region has a large roading network and a large commercial fleet trucking product for processing and export over long distances. It has a structural roading revenue and expenditure mismatch, which since 2009/2010 has resulted in an average $39m annual revenue surplus which has been invested in other regions, or approximately $315 million in total. “Southlanders are already paying for the transport networks in Auckland and Wellington and these new proposals risks entrenching this inequity even further,’’ the submission says. The councils want the Government to consider a transition plan for older vehicles, the potential of a hydrogen plant using power from Manapouri, increasing the cycling network and the fact the only public transport in Southland is in Invercargill in its planning. Some strategies are mentioned to support low income households to transition to energy efficient heating, but the councils want the Ministry for the Environment to consider a regional approach for support. “Communities are coming under pressure from a range of directions which is impacting on affordability for households. The combined impact of inflation, increasing interest rates, forecast rises in water costs as a result of reform and the expected closure of a key industry at Tiwai, will reduce the ability of the Southland community to afford basic goods. This will occur at the same time that the effects of any proposed climate policies will be felt,’’ the submission says. The councils support the adoption of a regionalised approach to planting but warn that ‘’put simply, we cannot plant our way out of carbon change’’. Carbon farming would see the landscape of Southland rapidly change, impacting the economy, potentially increasing environmental degradation and soil erosion, and decreasing community wellbeing, it says. The focus of the approach presented in the discussion paper is to ‘cash-in’ on a high carbon price for short-term financial gain, irrespective of the ecosystem services provided by well-planned, co-ordinated and integrated planting, the submission says.

Together, they have developed a charter of ambitious, but practical action aimed at building a truly sustainable future.""Charles urged business leaders around the world to lend their support to the action plan.He told the One Planet Summit: ""Today, I am making an urgent appeal to leaders, from all sectors and from around the world to give their support to this Terra Carta – to bring prosperity into harmony with Nature, People and Planet over the coming decade.""I can only encourage, in particular, those in industry and finance to provide practical leadership to this common project, as only they are able to mobilise the innovation, scale and resources that are required to transform our global economy.""The Terra Carta offers the basis of a recovery plan that puts Nature, People and Planet at the heart of global value creation – one that will harness the precious, irreplaceable power of Nature combined with the transformative innovation and resources of the private sector.""The 17-page document features 10 action points and 85 recommendations for businesses to take and has already received support from the likes of Bank of America, AstraZeneca, BP, and Heathrow Airport."
831	4	Coronavirus-induced constraints on public and private budgets threaten the Paris Climate Agreement and its environmental goals embraced by a majority of countries on Earth Day four years ago.The economic dislocations caused by lockdowns imposed to contain the pandemic have drastically – and temporarily – reduced the world’s carbon emissions, particularly from cars, planes and manufacturing.Yet the challenge of reversing global warming looms large as ever, say climate experts who want governments and companies to use today’s large-scale social disruption as an opportunity to enact stimulus measures consistent with the Paris accord’s long-term targets.A report released this week by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) calls for economic recovery packages to align with climate objectives and “accelerate the shift to sustainable, decarbonised economies and resilient, inclusive societies”.The publication, which was planned well before COVID-19 took its deadly hold, acknowledges that “renewable energy technologies may be affected by pandemics just like other investments”.However, it states that the ongoing volatility of oil and gas markets not only makes the business case stronger for renewables but also suggests that fossil-fuel subsidies can now be reduced or redirected without increasing economic pain.Hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs have already been shed in what many economists believe is a global recession. Despite this contraction, IRENA insists the world should remain on the path to sustainability paved by $130 trillion invested in alternative energy by mid-century, while avoiding bailouts of unsustainable sectors.Ellie Johnston, climate and energy lead at Climate Interactive, says that the stark inequality and racial disparities highlighted by the coronavirus exacerbate the mounting toll from the crisis of climate change.“We don’t want to be setting ourselves up to go from crisis to crisis to crisis for humanity,” she told Al Jazeera. “This is a big opportunity to create demand for workers,” Johnston added about the “suite of policies and finance options” that could be activated in response to COVID-19.Climate Interactive, a nonprofit based in the United States which runs an online dashboard and simulation tool teaching people about the levers for pulling back climate change, cites New Zealand, Germany and Switzerland as model countries for equitably “multi-solving” coronavirus and environmental problems.The organisation is holding a series of Earth Day educational seminars to highlight the range of possible solutions for limiting average planetary temperature increase to two degrees Celsius, as envisioned by the landmark climate pact.Johnston said that – similar to the sorts of changes necessitated by the climate emergency – the coronavirus requires individuals to shift their behaviour rapidly on a large scale.“State and city leaders have stepped up,” Johnston added, explaining how local officials in the US have risen to the governance challenge in the perceived absence of a strong federal hand.It is not just COVID-19, “people also are losing their lives to climate change,” she said, about the Earth’s long-term crisis. “But, you don’t put that on an obituary.”Entrepreneurs from the private sector are among those troubleshooting both crises, and advanced technology may offer hope.Steve Oldham is CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian company piloting direct air capture methods for sucking carbon dioxide straight from the atmosphere. Even if all current emissions were knocked down to zero, a huge quantity of legacy emissions would still pose an enormous ecological threat.Oldham told Al Jazeera that, like coronavirus, the climate emergency affects everybody, “but you can’t see it until you touch it”.Starting with a large-scale plant for Occidental Petroleum in the US state of Texas set to launch in 2023, Carbon Engineering will “put it back in the ground from where it came in the first place”.People also are losing their lives to climate change, but, you don't put that on an obituary.Ellie Johnston, energy lead at Climate InteractiveThe company says the commercial facility will remove one million tonnes of emissions a year – the equivalent of 40 million trees absorbing the same greenhouse gas from the sky.Multinational oil and gas firms such as Royal Dutch Shell continue to enhance commitments to climate neutrality by 2050, adding to their interest in carbon offset techniques.But Oldham believes the pandemic will push back climate mitigation by several years, as governments and hard-hit sectors like energy and aviation become severely indebted, and capital expenditures dry up for diversification projects.He also emphasises how coronavirus has reached such a magnitude that many more US alternative energy workers lost their jobs in March – from wind-power technicians to solar panel installers – than even those haemorrhaged by the retail or construction industries.“People feel the effects of COVID-19: they can’t fly, can’t go to work, can’t go on vacation,” Oldham said. “This makes them much more determined to fix it. To me, that’s the fundamental difference, [by] disrupting our lives today.”Like other countries, China is flirting with the possibility of using coal-fired power plants for a much-needed economic boost. The superpower emits annually more than the European Union and the US combined, yet 71 percent of its existing coal fleet is more expensive to run than new on-shore wind or solar, Sriya Sundaresan, a senior analyst at Carbon Tracker, told Al Jazeera.In the EU, climate advocates want to ensure that the European Green Deal guides legislators in bringing back the economy from the brink, as well as “future-proofing” the environment.Richard Baron, executive director of the 2050 Pathways Platform, said, “Locking in the wrong infrastructure now would be devastating to long-term climate goals.” And a citizens’ assembly group in the United Kingdom has called the coronavirus a “test run” for greener lifestyles.Across the Atlantic, US President Donald Trump has taken the opportunity created by the coronavirus to unravel environmental regulations on vehicle emissions and mercury pollutants from coal plants.Meanwhile, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has heaped praise on Green New Deal ideas and looked at plans for a White House Office of Climate Mobilization.Paula DiPerna, a special adviser for disclosure nonprofit CDP, said that “nobody really has a blueprint to get out of [the coronavirus crisis]” and rectify the unprecedented set of circumstances caused by a “one-in-a-hundred-year pandemic”.But on the occasion of Earth Day, DiPerna told Al Jazeera that addressing climate change is indubitably a job creator and “the only growth industry in the world”.“You have to be a groundhog to think that America’s infrastructure shouldn’t be a priority,” she said of “climate-resilient” public works initiatives that may help battle both crises at once. “The science is compelling, so we ignore it at our peril.”
101	5	"Climate change negotiators met in Lima to discuss strategies to cut emissions. Photo / APSocial Issues Reporter, NZ HeraldClimate Change Minister Tim Groser says New Zealand faces ""a big challenge"" in making new commitments to cut emissions, following a global agreement in Peru at the weekend.Mr Groser said the Lima agreement, signed on Sunday night, laid the groundwork for a comprehensive deal in Paris next December, where world leaders plan to set binding emissions targets for all major countries for the first time.He said there was still a lot of work to do but it was positive that the ""mess"" witnessed at Copenhagen talks in 2009 had so far been avoided.Negotiators from 190 countries at the Lima conference agreed on a plan to fight global warming that would include all countries.Those countries, including New Zealand, must now report back in March, or soon after, with national plans for reducing emissions.The Lima deal requires bigger commitments from countries than their pre-2020 pledges. New Zealand has an emissions reduction target of 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.Mr Groser said making a greater commitment up to 2030 would be ""a big challenge"" for New Zealand because 80 per cent of its electricity already came from renewable sources.""Once you're that high it's difficult to find low-hanging fruit,"" he said.There were other obstacles.No solutions had yet been found by New Zealand researchers into reducing the emissions produced by agriculture.And forests in New Zealand, which captured carbon, would be harvested in the late 2020s and early 2030s, making it more difficult to cut carbon emissions which contributed to a warming atmosphere.""There's a lot of work to do but we'll come up with something and have a good story to tell,"" Mr Groser said.The minister said it was also difficult to set a target because the Lima deal had not established a legal framework for reducing emissions.Climate Change Minister Tim Groser. Photo / NZME.Green Party climate spokesman Kennedy Graham rejected Mr Groser's claim that there was no ""low-hanging fruit"", saying that similar agriculture-based countries had reduced their dairy herds.""That's an option, but you almost get shot in the temple if you say that in New Zealand because of the milk-to-China syndrome.""What was the United Nations conference in Lima about?Negotiators from nearly 200 countries were meeting to discuss how to limit carbon emissions and take other steps to prevent harmful climate change. Current agreements for limiting emissions expire in 2020, and new, binding targets for all countries will be set at a meeting in France next year.What was agreed?Negotiators agreed on a plan to fight global warming which would include all countries for the first time. Rich countries such as the US and developing economies such as China and India were expected to share the burden of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.How does it affect New Zealand?New Zealand, like all countries, will have to come up in the next few months with a new emissions target for the post-2020 period. The target must progress beyond its current target, which is cutting emissions by 5 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020."
355	5	For the past few years, the Harvard professor David Keith has been sketching this vision: Ten Gulfstream jets, outfitted with special engines that allow them to fly safely around the stratosphere at an altitude of 70,000 feet, take off from a runway near the Equator. Their cargo includes thousands of pounds of a chemical compound — liquid sulfur, let’s suppose — that can be sprayed as a gas from the aircraft. It is not a one-time event; the flights take place throughout the year, dispersing a load that amounts to 25,000 tons. If things go right, the gas converts to an aerosol of particles that remain aloft and scatter sunlight for two years. The payoff? A slowing of the earth’s warming — for as long as the Gulfstream flights continue.Keith argues that such a project, usually known as solar geoengineering, is technologically feasible and — with a back-of-the-envelope cost of under $1 billion annually — ought to be fairly cheap from a cost-benefit perspective, considering the economic damages potentially forestalled: It might do good for a world unable to cut carbon-dioxide emissions enough to prevent further temperature increases later this century.What surprised me, then, as Keith paced around his Harvard office one morning in early March, was his listing all the reasons humans might not want to hack the environment. “Actually, I’m writing a paper on this right now,” he said. Most of his thoughts were related to the possible dangers of trying to engineer our way out of a climate problem of nearly unimaginable scientific, political and moral complexity. Solar geoengineering might lead to what some economists call “lock-in,” referring to the momentum that a new technology, even one with serious flaws, can assume after it gains a foothold in the market. The qwerty keyboard is one commonly cited example; the internal combustion engine is another. Once we start putting sulfate particles in the atmosphere, he mused, would we really be able to stop?Another concern, he said, is “just the ethics about messing with nature.” Tall, wiry and kinetic, with thinning hair and a thick beard that gives him the look of the backcountry skier he is, Keith proudly showed me the framed badge that his father, a biologist, wore when he attended the landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. Now 53, Keith has taken more wilderness trips — hiking, rock climbing, canoeing — than he can properly recall, and for their recent honeymoon, he and his wife were dropped off by helicopter 60 miles from the nearest road in northern British Columbia. “It was quite rainy,” he told me, “and that ended up making it even better.” So the prospect of intentionally changing the climate, he confessed, is not just unpleasant — “it initially struck me as nuts.”It still strikes him as a moral hazard, to use a term he borrows from economics. A planet cooled by an umbrella of aerosol particles — an umbrella that works by reflecting back into space, say, 1 percent of the sun’s incoming energy — might give societies less incentive to adopt greener technologies and radically cut carbon emissions. That would be disastrous, Keith said. The whole point of geoengineering is not to give us license to forget about the buildup of CO₂. It’s to lessen the ill effects of the buildup and give us time to transition to cleaner energy.Beyond these conceivable dangers, though, a more fundamental problem lurks: Solar geoengineering simply might not work. It has been a subject of intense debate among climate scientists for roughly a decade. But most of what we know about its potential effects derives from either computer simulations or studies on volcanic eruptions like that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, which generated millions of tons of sunlight-scattering particulates and might have cooled the planet by as much as 0.5 degrees Celsius, or nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit. The lack of support for solar geoengineering’s efficacy informs Keith’s thinking about what we should do next. Actively tinkering with our environment — fueling up the Gulfstream jets and trying to cool things down — is not something he intends to try anytime soon, if ever. But conducting research is another matter.A decade ago, when Keith was among the few American scientists to advocate starting a geoengineering research program, he was often treated at science conferences as an outlier. “People would sort of inch away or, really, tell me I shouldn’t be doing this,” he said. Geoengineering was seen as a scientific taboo and Keith its dark visionary. “The preconception was that I was some kind of Dr. Strangelove figure,” he told me — “which I didn’t like.”Attitudes appear to have changed over the past few years, at least in part because of the continuing academic debates and computer-modeling studies. The National Academy of Sciences endorsed the pursuit of solar geoengineering research in 2015, a stance also taken in a later report by the Obama administration. A few influential environmental groups, like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, now favor research.In the meantime, Keith’s own work at Harvard has progressed. This month, he is helping to start Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, a broad endeavor that begins with $7 million in funding and intends to reach $20 million over seven years. One backer is the Hewlett Foundation; another is Bill Gates, whom Keith regularly advises on climate change. Keith is planning to conduct a field experiment early next year by putting particles into the stratosphere over Tucson.The new Harvard program is not merely intent on getting its concepts out of the lab and into the field, though; a large share of its money will also be directed to physical and social scientists at the university, who will evaluate solar geoengineering’s environmental dangers — and be willing to challenge its ethics and practicality. Keith told me, “It’s really important that we have a big chunk of the research go to groups whose job will be to find all the ways that it won’t work.” In other words, the technology that Keith has long believed could help us ease our predicament — “the nuclear option” for climate, as one opponent described it to me, to be considered only when all else has failed — will finally be investigated to see whether it is a reasonable idea. At the same time, it will be examined under the premise that it may in fact be a very, very bad one.Climate change already presents a demoralizing array of challenges — melting ice sheets and species extinctions — but the ultimate severity of its impacts depends greatly on how drastically technology and societies can change over the next few decades. The growth of solar and wind power in recent years, along with an apparent decrease in coal use, suggest that the global community will succeed in curtailing CO₂ emissions. Still, that may not happen nearly fast enough to avert some dangerous consequences. As Keith likes to point out, simply reducing emissions doesn’t reverse global warming. In fact, even if annual global CO₂ emissions decrease somewhat, the total atmospheric CO₂ may continue to increase, because the gas is so slow to dissipate. We may still be living with damaging amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide a half-century from now, with calamitous repercussions. The last time atmospheric CO₂ levels were as elevated as they are today, three million years ago, sea levels were most likely 45 feet higher, and giant camels roamed above the Arctic Circle.Recently, I met with Daniel Schrag, who is the head of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, an interdisciplinary teaching and research department. Schrag, who helped recruit Keith to Harvard, painted a bleak picture of our odds of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond levels considered safe by many climate scientists. When you evaluate the time scales involved in actually switching our energy systems to cleaner fuels, Schrag told me, “the really depressing thing is you start to understand why any of these kinds of projections — for 2030 or 2050 — are absurd.” He went on: “Are they impossible? No. I want to give people hope, too. I’d love to make this happen. And we have made a lot of progress on some things, on solar, on wind. But the reality is we haven’t even started doing the hard stuff.”Schrag described any kind of geoengineering as “at best an imperfect solution that is operationally extremely challenging.” Yet to Schrag and Keith, the political and technical difficulties associated with a rapid transition to a zero-carbon-emissions world make it sensible to look into geoengineering research. There happens to be a number of different plans for how to actually do it, however — including the fantastical (pumping seawater onto Antarctica to combat sea-level rise) and the impractical (fertilizing oceans with iron to foster the growth of algae, which would absorb more CO₂). Some proposals involve taking carbon out of the air, using either immense plant farms or absorption machines. (Keith is involved with such sequestration technology, which faces significant hurdles in terms of cost and feasibility.) Another possible approach would inject salt crystals into clouds over the ocean to brighten them and cool targeted areas, like the dying Great Barrier Reef. Still, the feeling among Keith and his colleagues is that aerosols sprayed into the atmosphere might be the most economically and technologically viable approach of all — and might yield the most powerful global effect.It is not a new idea. In 2000, Keith published a long academic paper on the history of weather and climate modification, noting that an Institute of Rainmaking was established in Leningrad in 1932 and that American engineers began a cloud-seeding campaign in Vietnam a few decades later. A report issued in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration called attention to the dangers of increasing concentrations of CO₂ and, anticipating Keith’s research, speculated that a logical response might be to change the albedo, or reflectivity, of the earth. To Keith’s knowledge, though, there have been only two actual field experiments so far. One, by a Russian scientist in 2009, released aerosols into the lower atmosphere via helicopter and appears to have generated no useful data. “It was a stunt,” Keith says. Another was a modest attempt at cloud brightening a few years ago by a team at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.Downstairs from Keith’s Harvard office, there is a lab cluttered with students fiddling with pipettes and arcane scientific instruments. When I visited in early March, Zhen Dai, a graduate student who works with Keith, was engaged with a tabletop apparatus, a maze of tubes and pumps and sensors, meant to study how chemical compounds interact with the stratosphere. For the moment, Keith’s group is leaning toward beginning its field experiments with ice crystals and calcium carbonate — limestone — that has been milled to particles a half-micron in diameter, or less than 1/100th the width of a human hair. They may eventually try a sulfur compound too. The experiment is called Scopex, which stands for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment. An instrument that can disperse an aerosol of particles — say, several ounces of limestone dust — will be housed in a gondola that hangs beneath a balloon that ascends to 70,000 feet. The whole custom-built contraption, whose two small propellers will be steered from the ground, will also include a variety of sensors to collect data on any aerosol plume. Keith’s group will measure the sunlight-scattering properties of the plume and evaluate how its particles interact with atmospheric gases, especially ozone. The resulting data will be used by computer models to try to predict larger-scale effects.But whether a scientist should be deliberately putting foreign substances into the atmosphere, even for a small experiment like this, is a delicate question. There is also the difficulty of deciding on how big the atmospheric plumes should get. When does an experiment become an actual trial run? Ultimately, how will the scientists know if geoengineering really works without scaling it up all the way?Keith cites precedents for his thinking: a company that scatters cremation ashes from a high-altitude balloon, and jet engines, whose exhaust contains sulfates. But the crux of the problem that Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program wrestles with is intentionality. Frank Keutsch, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Harvard who is designing and running the Scopex experiments with Keith, told me: “This effort with David is very different from all my other work, because for those other field experiments, we’ve tried to measure the atmosphere and look at processes that are already there. You’re not actually changing nature.” But in this case, Keutsch agrees, they will be.During one of our conversations, Keith suggested that I try to flip my thinking for a moment. “What if humanity had never gotten into fossil fuels,” he posed, “and the world had gone directly to generating energy from solar or wind power?” But then, he added, what if in this imaginary cleaner world there was a big natural seep of a heat-trapping gas from within the earth? Such events have happened before. “It would have all the same consequences that we’re worried about now, except that it’s not us doing the CO₂ emissions,” Keith said. In that case, the reaction to using geoengineering to cool the planet might be one of relief and enthusiasm.In other words, decoupling mankind’s actions — the “sin,” as Keith put it, of burning fossil fuels — from our present dilemma can demonstrate the value of climate intervention. “No matter what, if we emit CO₂, we are hurting future generations,” Keith said. “And it may or may not be true that doing some solar geo would over all be a wise thing to do, but we don’t know yet. That’s the reason to do research.”There are risks, undeniably — some small, others potentially large and terrifying. David Santillo, a senior scientist at Greenpeace, told me that some modeling studies suggest that putting aerosols in the atmosphere, which might alter local climates and rain patterns and would certainly affect the amount of sunlight hitting the earth, could have a significant impact on biodiversity. “There’s a lot more we can do in theoretical terms and in modeling terms,” Santillo said of the Harvard experiments, “before anyone should go out and do this kind of proof-of-concept work.” Alan Robock, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Rutgers, has compiled an exhaustive list of possible dangers. He thinks that small-scale projects like the Scopex experiment could be useful, but that we don’t know the impacts of large-scale geoengineering on agriculture or whether it might deplete the ozone layer (as volcanic eruptions do). Robock’s list goes on from there: Solar geoengineering would probably reduce solar-electricity generation. It would do nothing to reduce the increasing acidification of the oceans, caused by seawater absorbing carbon dioxide. A real prospect exists, too, that if solar geoengineering efforts were to stop abruptly for any reason, the world could face a rapid warming even more dangerous than what’s happening now — perhaps too fast for any ecological adaptation.Keith is well aware of Robock’s concerns. He also makes the distinction that advocating research is not the same as advocating geoengineering. But the line can blur. Keith struck me as having a fair measure of optimism that his research can yield insights into materials and processes that can reduce the impacts of global warming while averting huge risks. For instance, he is already encouraged by computer models that suggest the Arctic ice cap, which has shrunk this year to the smallest size observed during the satellite era, could regrow under cooler conditions brought on by light-scattering aerosols. He also believes that the most common accusation directed against geoengineering — that it might disrupt precipitation patterns and lead to widespread droughts — will prove largely unfounded.But Keith is not trained as an atmospheric scientist; he’s a hands-on physicist-engineer who likes to take machinery apart. There are deep unknowns here. Keutsch, for one, seems uncertain about what he will discover when the group actually tries spraying particulates high above the earth. The reduction of sunlight could adversely affect the earth’s water cycle, for example. “It really is unclear to me if this approach is feasible,” he says, “and at this point we know far too little about the risks. But if we want to know whether it works, we have to find out.”Finally, what if something goes wrong either in research or in deployment? David Battisti, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, told me, “It’s not obvious to me that we can reduce the uncertainty to anywhere near a tolerable level — that is, to the level that there won’t be unintended consequences that are really serious.” While Battisti thought Keith’s small Scopex experiment posed little danger — “The atmosphere will restore itself,” he said — he noted that the whole point of the Harvard researchers’ work is to determine whether solar geoengineering could be done “forever,” on a large-scale, round-the-clock basis. When I asked Battisti if he had issues with going deeper into geoengineering research, as opposed to geoengineering itself, he said: “Name a technology humans have developed that they haven’t used. I can’t think of any. So we can work on this for sure. But we are in this dilemma: Once we do develop this technology, it will be tempting to use it.”Suppose Keith’s research shows that solar geoengineering works. What then? The world would need to agree where to set the global thermostat. If there is no consensus, could developed nations impose a geoengineering regimen on poorer nations? On the second point, if this technology works, it would arguably be unethical not to use it, because the world’s poorest populations, facing drought and rising seas, may suffer the worst effects of a changing climate.In recent months, a group under the auspices of the Carnegie Council in New York, led by Janos Pasztor, a former United Nations climate official, has begun to work through the thorny international issues of governance and ethics. Pasztor told me that this effort will most likely take four years. And it is not lost on him — or anyone I spoke with in Keith’s Harvard group — that the idea of engineering our environment is taking hold as we are contemplating the engineering of ourselves through novel gene-editing technologies. “They both have an effect on shaping the pathway where human beings are now and where will they be,” says Sheila Jasanoff, a professor of science and technology studies at Harvard who sometimes collaborates with Keith. Jasanoff also points out that each technology potentially enables rogue agents to act without societal consent.This is a widespread concern. We might reach a point at which some countries pursue geoengineering, and nothing — neither costs nor treaties nor current technologies — can stop them. Pasztor sketched out another possibility to me: “You could even have a nightmare scenario, where a country decides to do geoengineering and another country decides to do counter-geoengineering.” Such a countermeasure could take the form of an intentional release of a heat-trapping gas far more potent than CO₂, like a hydrochlorofluorocarbon. One of Schrag’s main concerns, in fact, is that geoengineering a lower global temperature might preserve ecosystems and limit sea-level rise while producing irreconcilable geopolitical frictions. “One thing I can’t figure out,” he told me, “is how do you protect the Greenland ice sheet and still have Russia have access to its northern ports, which they really like?” Either Greenland and Siberia will melt, or perhaps both can stay frozen. You probably can’t split the difference.For the moment, and perhaps for 10 or 20 years more, these are mere hypotheticals. But the impacts of climate change were once hypotheticals, too. Now they’ve become possibilities and probabilities. And yet, as Tom Ackerman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, said at a recent discussion among policy makers that I attended in Washington: “We are doing an experiment now that we don’t understand.” He was not talking about geoengineering; he was observing that the uncertainty about the potential risks of geoengineering can obscure the fact that there is uncertainty, too, about the escalating disasters that may soon result from climate change.His comment reminded me of a claim made more than a half-century ago, long before the buildup of CO₂ in the atmosphere had become the central environmental and economic problem of our time. Two scientists, Roger Revelle and Hans Suess, wrote in a scientific paper, “Human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.”If anything could sway a fence-sitter to consider whether geoengineering research makes sense, perhaps it is this. The fact is, we are living through a test already.
205	4	Rising carbon dioxide emissions could cause a decline in the brainpower of workers around the world, according to new research.A new study by academics at University College London (UCL) found that higher amounts of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere could affect our memory, concentration and decision-making abilities.Raised CO2 in workplaces lacking proper ventilation is known to make employees more sluggish and less able to successfully complete tasks.And climate change is likely to make intellectual impairment a far more widespread problem in the decades ahead, according to the researchers.The UCL team said evidence indicated that “human cognitive performance declines with increasing CO2 levels”.They added: “Given the likelihood of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration by the end of the 21st century, direct impacts of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on human cognitive performance may be unavoidable.”Publishing their findings in Building Service Engineering, the researchers at UCL’s Energy Institute said attempts to minimise the impact was likely to change the way ventilation systems were engineered in buildings and transport systems.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereThe team made clear that research on raised CO2 and human cognitive performance was still in its infancy, but said the “global nature” of the potential problem meant more studies were needed.Earlier this year, a study by Yale School of Public Health found that air pollution caused a drop in intelligence levels.Although the conclusions were based on nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide tests in China, researchers made clear the connection between air pollution and cognitive capabilities had global implications.“Polluted air can cause everyone to reduce their level of education by one year, which is huge,” said Yale scientist Xi Chen.In May 2018, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere reached its highest level in recorded history, exceeding 410 parts per million (ppm) for the first time.
387	3	Every school in New Zealand will this year have access to materials about the climate crisis written by the country’s leading science agencies – including tools for students to plan their own activism, and to process their feelings of “eco-anxiety” over global heating.The curriculum will put New Zealand at the forefront of climate change education worldwide; governments in neighbouring Australia and the United Kingdom have both faced criticism for lack of cohesive teaching on the climate crisis. The New Zealand scheme, which will be offered to all schools that teach 11 to 15 year-old students, will not be compulsory, the government said.“One of the pieces of feedback we’ve got from teachers around the country is that they’re really crying out for something like this, because kids are already in the conversation about climate change,” said James Shaw, New Zealand’s climate change minister and co-leader of the left-leaning Green Party.“They’re seeing stuff on social media on a daily basis and none of it’s good news, and the sense of powerlessness that comes from that is extremely distressing.”Hundreds of thousands of school and university students around the world, including in New Zealand, walked out of their classes for a series of climate strikes during 2019, a year when scientists warned that climate change was an “existential threat to civilisation”.Young people feel betrayed and abandoned by older generations over their lack of action on the climate issue, and worry about it has increasingly sparked anxiety and depression, a group of British psychologists warned in September.A pilot of the New Zealand scheme, which ran in one school in the city of Christchurch in 2018, had led to the introduction of materials for the national roll-out that helped students process their emotions about the climate issue, Shaw told The Guardian.“Being in the conversation itself causes stress,” he said. By necessity, he added, students would “delve into the bad news” of the science explaining the climate crisis. But the resources had been bolstered with “quite an emphasis on talking through with students how they’re feeling about it,” he said.Materials created for teachers that were provided to the Guardian suggest students keep a “feelings thermometer” to track their emotions, learn how to change defeatist self-talk, and consider how their feelings could generate action and response.“It helps kids to see that it is a fixable problem and people are working on it, and there is something they can foresee for themselves in terms of their own futures,” said Shaw.Another tool in the curriculum helps students create and carry out an action plan on a particular environmental issue – such as creating an edible garden.The curriculum included text, video, and advice for teachers, the education minister Chris Hipkins said in a statement.“It explains the role science plays in understanding climate change, aids understanding of both the response to it and its impacts – globally, nationally and locally – and explores opportunities to contribute to reducing and adapting to it impact on everyday life,” he added.While the Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015, urges signatory countries to implement climate education, many countries who made the pledge have not fulfilled it, including New Zealand’s nearest neighbour Australia, according to the science publication The Conversation.While some parts of Britain have enacted their own climate literacy plans, there is not a nationwide curriculum to teach it. The Labour party urged such a policy last May.Italy will this year become the first country in the world to make sustainability and the climate crisis compulsory subjects for students, with material integrated into regular lessons, such as mathematics and geography.

I hope that decision makers in the US hear that call and take note.”The Prince of Wales, 71, who tested positive for coronavirus in March, previously urged members of the Commonwealth to come together to tackle climate change.He called on business and political leaders to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the crisis at the Davos summit back in January.Last month a study suggested the global lockdown will have a ""negligible"" impact on rising temperatures but a green recovery could avert dangerous climate change.Experts led by the University of Leeds found that lockdowns caused a fall in transport use, as well as reductions in industry and commercial operations, cutting the greenhouse gases and pollutants caused by vehicles and other activities.However the impact is only short-lived, with analysis showing that even if some measures last until the end of 2021, global temperatures will only be 0.01C lower than expected by 2030.The Press Association contributed to this report"

If the 2020 Auckland 1st XV rugby competition continues the way it commenced last Saturday, we are in for some wonderful rugby, sportsmanship, and school rivalry support that is a credit to the gameThe game between Auckland Grammar and Sacred Heart ( played at AGS ) epitomised school rivalry at its best . For those unable to attend, the match was televised live so the country was treated to a spectacle. Two superbly fit teams, producing top class attacking talent, matched with hard but clean defence. Seeing boys from either side helping an opponent to his feet after a punishing tackle made any old boy proud.Then there were the respective school support teams; each trying to outdo the other; but when either side was kicking for goal, complete silence; sportsmanship that could well be recognised by supposed more mature crowds around the country.Des Trigg, Rothesay Bay.The one whose head should roll now is Watercare chief Raveen Jaduram.

He looks at all aspects of the economy and includes its impact on everyday life.His column on Sunday set out clearly what the past decade's economic drivers were: more cows, more residents and more tourists. Our economy at the time under the National Party's nine year rule flourished, it seems but, as stated by Dann, pushed our environmental and infrastructure limits.Over the years we've watched, usually during the reign of National, this desire to push for economic gain by increasing migrant numbers (lowering workers' wages), but leaving infrastructure unchanged. Even under Jim Bolger when migrant numbers came in in their thousands over a very short time, schools and hospitals were just supposed to cope with what they had. We saw little, if any, money going into restructuring the country to cope with these sudden numbers. It was no different under John Key's government even though he showed an ability to talk the talk and align himself with the underdog.So it is pleasing to see Dann putting the challenge out there for the need to recharge our economy today.The world has changed. We have to question how we can contribute differently. This must include the hidden effects of climate change which is already making its impact on our lives.Emma Mackintosh, Birkenhead.The further occurrence of waterways and beaches on the East Coast being laden with forestry slash shows a contrasting attitude to the environment. As a waste product, forestry slash can be paralleled to dairy farm effluent or wastewater from cities and industry. If those sectors had a similar mass pollution event, there would be immediate and justified outrage. Yet, for some reason, forestry gets a free pass to keep polluting. It is not hard to see why: forestry is protected as the saviour to climate change hence a blind eye is being turned to this type of environmental vandalism.The local council is simply an apologist for this pollution, taking their sweet time to prosecute with no effect on improving practice. The government, and respective ministries, are absent without leave. Greenpeace and Fish and Game are ideologically silent. Surely forestry slash makes waterways and beaches degraded and unswimmable as well?The technical difficulty in dealing with slash is no excuse. No other industry can play the ""it's too difficult or expensive"" card with pollution.MP Boardman, Browns Bay.Pattrick Smellie argues that a merit of a wealth tax is that it addresses an inequity by allowing ""no escape"" from tax for people who generated wealth from otherwise untaxed sources (presumably capital gain). The illogicality of this argument is that a wealth tax would re-tax wealth which originated from already taxed sources, and thus doesn't address the inequity at all.If you consider that capital gain should be treated as income, then by all means argue for a capital gains tax. However, a wealth tax, which takes one person's assets simply because they have, and gives to another because they haven't, is nothing short of communism, and has no place in New Zealand.Carl Bergstrom, Glendowie.The Green Party's Poverty Action Plan proposing widespread welfare payment increases indicated the jobless would receive $325 weekly after tax. What message is that for unemployed youth, extended education and the workplace shunned, a life of idle bliss?Higher taxes would fund their proposals, certainly virtuous, but if implemented in entirety, a tipping point could arise impacting fiscal stability and job creation. Regarding jobs, recall the Greens' initiative to compromise the oil and gas sector with major job losses ensuing. A social priority more compelling than substantial welfare increases, the urgent need for state funded rental construction for the disadvantaged, an added bonus, the mass creation of jobs NZ so desperately requires.P.

One sip for shambolic, two sips for shambles, and, new today, three sips for shabby.Doug Hannan, Mt Maunganui.Winston Peters and John Roughan both have it wrong on that hot potato, light rail in Auckland.Winston has it wrong because he treats the proposal as only a route to the airport, whereas it has been promoted by the government as facilitating intensive housing along the corridor to the airport. He is right though that the airport connection would be better served by a spur extension of the current rail system, which would achieve a usable route to traveller destinations, unlike a slow light rail trip with multiple stops and traffic delays.Roughan has it wrong because he has effectively bought into light rail without considering all the above impediments and the need for a better alternative. He ignores light rail being costly and disruptive during and following construction without delivering adequate benefits.A better alternative would be to look at better ways of delivering bus services, including inner city routing development to address congestion. Even better would be enhanced light rail using a combination of tunnels and overhead sections, such as the Vancouver Skytrain, but can we stomach the cost of that?Marshall Piercy, Devonport.Regarding Saturday's Canvas article on our obviously smart and talented microbiologist, does it matter what colour her hair is or what shape her body is?

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.A growing share of Americans are concerned about the environment, and the big U.S. tech companies would seem to be in a position to lead the way on fighting climate change.They’re rich and staffed with smart people, and they have generally pledged to do more to reduce the carbon emissions that warm the planet.My colleague Somini Sengupta, who writes about climate change and used to cover the tech industry, walked me through confusing climate change terms and how tech companies and all of us can help slow global warming.Shira: What does it mean when a company pledges to go “carbon neutral” or “carbon negative?”Somini: A company will still produce carbon emissions, but it will offset that by doing things that absorb emissions from the atmosphere — like planting forests. Trees are great! They absorb carbon dioxide. At least some portion of Amazon’s and Apple’s climate action plans involve reforestation.But that’s not enough. Climate scientists say global emissions must be cut by half by 2030 if we stand a chance of averting the worst impacts of warming.How do tech companies contribute to climate change, and how are they helping?First, the industry uses lots of electricity, including for computer data centers. If much of that comes from coal, it creates a boatload of planet-warming emissions. This is a relatively easy problem to solve if companies use renewable energy, which is expanding fast and getting cheaper.Amazon, Google and Microsoft have also gotten attention for selling technology to help the oil and gas industry extract fossil fuels, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Google promised to stop.Other areas to watch: Can Apple, Amazon and Google compel manufacturers of their devices to reduce factory emissions and switch to cleaner energy? And can they reuse and recycle the materials inside of devices? In general, recycled materials are better for the environment.Then there’s the question of how much internet companies like Facebook are helping spread disinformation on climate science.Is it effective for companies to pick their own paths on climate change? What about governments?As a former technology reporter, this moment reminds me of when big U.S. tech companies didn’t want regulations on data privacy. They changed their privacy policies and promised to do better.It’s possible that big tech companies are again setting themselves voluntary targets to forestall national legislation, like on emissions standards. Both Britain and the European Union now require their countries to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. That’s bound to affect tech and every other industry.What can we do as consumers of technology?We can educate ourselves on what goes into the technology we buy, what the climate impacts are and how long a product might last.We can also think about what we buy in the first place. Making shiny new things contributes to global warming. So does shipping, delivering and returning stuff. We can help by making our existing products or devices last longer by replacing the battery or making a repair, or buying used.If you don’t already get this newsletter in your inbox, please sign up here.Instead of doomscrolling today, how about flopping on the sofa to take in great entertainment about … uh … nightmarish technology?Margot Harrison, a fiction writer and editor at the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, offered us three recommendations for works dealing with malevolent technology. Her latest novel, “The Glare,” was released this month. Also check out her recent essay in The New York Times.“Infinite Detail: A Novel” by Tim MaughanIn this 2019 dystopian novel, the only thing scarier than the all-pervasive presence of the internet is its abrupt disappearance. The story is told in alternating sections labeled “Before” and “After.” In the former, anarchist hackers unravel the web that holds us all; in the latter, they deal with the consequences of succeeding beyond their wildest dreams.While depicting many all-too-plausible extensions of control and surveillance technology, Maughan suggests that it’s impossible to take a simple stand for or against the machines with which our ways of life are already fused.“Feed” by M.T. AndersonThis was the book that convinced me that young adult fiction might be especially open to exploring technological anxieties because teens have never known a world offline.Anderson envisions a future in which everyone has an implant feeding them entertainment, social interactions and micro-targeted advertising. The concept isn’t new, but Anderson’s narrator has an unforgettable voice: Holden Caulfield with a near-lethal injection of swaggering early-aughts MTV.The “Nosedive” episode of “Black Mirror”No piece of fiction has channeled my personal anxieties about social media quite as effectively as this.In a near future in which people’s status and livelihood depend directly on the ratings others give them, a young woman makes a fatal series of small mistakes that zero out her social credit. It’s a nightmare that might convince you to put down the phone.The cyberattack deterrence isn’t working: To fight cyberattacks from China and Russia, the U.S. government for years has tried to name, shame and indict those behind them, and sometimes even counterattacked. But those punishments haven’t been sufficient to deter continued cyberattacks and disinformation operations, reported David E. Sanger, the Times national security correspondent.You can’t pry this phone out of my hand: Just about every tech company in the world considers India the emerging internet gold rush, but the companies are finding one big barrier: Many millions of Indians opt for basic cellphones over smartphones. This makes life harder for Netflix, Facebook and WeChat. The Chinese tech publication Abacus looks at why the basic cellphone in India is far more appealing than that Nokia you had in the early 2000s.Our national cake obsession didn’t last long: Five minutes ago, it was impossible to avoid surreal social media videos of cakes disguised as Crocs, pickles or human heads. Now the craze is dying, NBC News reported. Like any fun thing, weird cake was ruined because The Olds got into it. (I am An Old as well. I swear. It’s fine.)Please enjoy very good dog Spike romping in a meadow.

471	0	A multimillion-dollar plan to resolve Akaroa’s wastewater woes is dividing a Banks Peninsula community as a third set of proposals are publicly released. After more than five years, two rounds of consultation, and delays caused by faulty data, the Christchurch City Council has come up with four options to get rid of Akaroa’s treated wastewater. One resident says the proposal will destroy pristine farm land while another is looking forward to having a new native forest on her doorstep. Three of the proposals involve planting between 33 and 48 hectares of land with native trees and irrigating them with the treated wastewater at Robinsons Bay and Takamatua, or across the hill at Pompeys Pillar or Goughs Bay. READ MORE: * Akaroa aquifers being considered as a solution to village's wastewater woes * Akaroa's wastewater woes continue after multimillion-dollar idea scrapped * New proposal seeks to resolve Akaroa's wastewater woes * Faulty measurements delay Akaroa wastewater scheme  These options are estimated to cost between $54 million and $76m, which represents a cost of between $44,591 and $62,758 for each of the 1211 houses and businesses that will benefit from the scheme. Akaroa has 830 permanent residents. The fourth option involves putting the water into Akaroa Harbour via a 1.2-kilometre pipe, but this option is not supported by council staff or Ngāi Tahu, which sees the practice as highly offensive. However, it is the cheapest at between $45m and $52m. The preferred option is using land in Robinsons Bay and Takamatua (inner bays). Unlike the other two locations the council believes most landowners appear willing to negotiate. However, the council has said it will use the Public Works Act to acquire land as a last resort. The council says the inner bays scheme will create a new wetland and three new native bush areas, providing ecological, cultural, recreational and educational benefits. Two storage ponds with a combined water surface area of 8300 square metres are also planned for Robinsons Bay – about the size of a rugby field. But some Robinsons Bay residents are upset about the proposal. Chris Moore, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said a council document said 27,000sqm would be removed and cut out for the ponds, which was close to four rugby fields. “It’s going to completely ruin the nature of the valley.” The development will destroy pristine farm land in favour of native bush that is already in abundance in the area, he said. ”They never talk about the midges and the odour or likely influx of Canada geese.”  The council’s consultation document said there would be no odour from the ponds and midges could be attracted to the area, but it could effectively manage them.  Moore believes the entire wastewater scheme needs a rethink because 70 per cent of the total wastewater volume is made up of stormwater and groundwater. ”The wastewater scheme proposed is three times bigger than it needs to be if the pipes were replaced and the infiltration fixed or eliminated. ”We want the pipes fixed first and then an appropriately-sized plant installed.” He also wanted the water treated to a drinkable standard. Council staff admit there are high levels of stormwater and groundwater entering the pipes, but said it was about 61 per cent and true wastewater was about 39 per cent. Council water supply programme manager Bridget O’Brien said the council was working to resolve the problem and was repairing 1.5km of wastewater pipes, but most of the stormwater and groundwater was coming from private properties and was the responsibility of property owners to repair. She said New Zealand regulations do not yet allow for treated wastewater to be reused. Not everyone in the bay is against the scheme. Robinsons Bay resident Kathleen Reid, who lives next to the proposed scheme, said she was once against the project but has changed her mind. She supported the planting of native forests and believed they would be wonderful for the area, visually and environmentally. “I’ve done my homework on it and read everything, learnt everything there is about it. I’m a bigger picture person, climate change is a concern.” Time is running out for the council to find somewhere to put the treated wastewater. It had originally planned to keep sending it into the middle of the harbour through a pipeline, but Environment Canterbury declined the consent because of Ngāi Tahu opposition. The council’s existing consent runs out in October and the council has applied for permission to keep discharging until it has found an alternative. Submissions on the proposals open on Tuesday and close on August 23.
826	4	"A joint study by international climate scientists from Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Australia presents a bleak prognosis: Even if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are achieved and global warming is limited to maxiumum 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels, the climate system could still pass a devastating tipping point.""Human emissions of greenhouse gas are not the sole determinant of temperature on Earth,"" said Will Steffen, lead author of the study and climate researcher at the Australian National University and the Swedish research institute Stockholm Resilience Centre.""Our study suggests that human-induced global warming of 2 degrees Celsius may trigger other Earth system processes, often called 'feedbacks,' that can drive further warming — even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases,"" he said.The global average temperature in such a case would in the long term settle between 4 to 5 degrees warmer compared to pre-industrial levels, their study found.Sea levels would rise 10 to 60 meters (33 to 197 feet), flooding numerous islands and coastal cities such as Venice, New York, Tokyo and Sydney. Such major population centers would have to be abandoned.Scientists call this a ""hothouse Earth"" climate scenario.Read more: The global heat wave that's been killing usClimate domino effectIn the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the international research team analyzed the complete climate system of a 2-degree warmer world across several models.Interactions and chain reactions among melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, bacteria in the oceans and weakened carbon sinks were discovered.Read more: When nature harms itself — five scary climate feedback loopsAs a result of these feedback processes and tipping points that lead to abrupt changes in the climate system, forests and permafrost transform themselves from ""friends"" that store CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane into ""enemies"" that uncontrollably release stored emissions into the atmosphere.As such, the individual feedback processes could potentially snowball, explained Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and incoming co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).""These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominos. Once one is pushed over, it pushes Earth toward another. It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over,"" he said.The Earth would then warm at an accelerating tempo — even if humans stopped producing greenhouse gases entirely.""Places on Earth will become uninhabitable if 'hothouse Earth' becomes the reality,"" Rockström added.Read more: Current heat waves are linked to climate change, scientists confirmMinimizing 'self-amplifying' changeWhile the 2015 Paris Agreement, agreed to by 197 nations, settled on a 2-degree target, it is unclear whether this is enough to avert a climate catastrophe, warned Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of PIK and co-author of the study.""We still do not know if the climate system can be safely 'parked' at 2 degrees,"" he said.That is in no way to say that the Paris climate agreement is futile and should be abandoned — as United States President Donald Trump did in June 2017 when he pulled the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter out of the deal.""Fully implementing the Paris climate agreement by following a path of rapid decarbonization through socio-economic transformation minimizes the risk of triggering self-amplifying climate change,"" Jonathan Donges, a PIK researcher and co-author of the study, told DW.He said that meeting the Paris goals — or even better, aiming for a more ambitious target — remains ""the best-known strategy to minimize the risk of triggering self-reinforcing feedbacks in the Earth system that could lead to a hothouse climate state.""To avoid a potential chain reaction, much more needs to be done than just reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers point out.Humanity must protect the ecosystem as a whole; create more natural carbon sinks; stop deforestation; consume less; control population growth; invest in technologies that extract CO2 from the atmosphere; and much more. For Donges, such ""stewardship"" of the Earth will also require ""transformed social values.""Read more:  Earth Overshoot Day: Time for a radical rethink'Positive message'Despite the study's apocalyptic findings, co-author Katherine Richardson of the University of Copenhagen said they are not trying to present a hopeless doomsday scenario.""I think our study has an incredible positive message,"" she told DW, adding that real action on climate change requires increased awareness of its potential effects. ""What we are really doing is understanding ever better our role in the Earth's system, and acting accordingly,"" Richardson added. ""We would be screwed if we didn't recognize the fact that we are just not doing enough."""
222	4	"The decision to abolish the Department for Energy and Climate Change has been variously condemned as “plain stupid”, “deeply worrying” and “terrible” by politicians, campaigners and experts.One of Theresa May’s first acts as Prime Minister was to move responsibility for climate change to a new Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.Only on Monday, Government advisers had warned of the need to take urgent action to prepare the UK for floods, droughts, heatwaves and food shortages caused by climate change.The news came after the appointment of Andrea Leadsom – who revealed her first question to officials when she became Energy Minister last year was “Is climate change real? – was appointed as the new Environment Secretary.And, after former Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd announced in November that Britain was going to “close coal” by 2025, Ms Leadsom later asked the coal industry to help define what this actually meant. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted: “DECC abolition just plain stupid. Climate not even mentioned in new deptartment title. Matters because departments shape priorities, shape outcomes.”Greenpeace said it was concerned that the new Government did not view climate change as a serious threat..Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereJohn Sauven, the campaign group's executive director, said: “The voting record and affiliation with climate sceptics of key cabinet appointees are deeply worrying.""They show a lack of understanding posed by climate change to the UK and the world. If we are to continue to have a key global role in environmental action, we need urgent reassurance from the new government that the hard won progress on climate and renewables targets, air pollution and the protection of wildlife will not be sidelined or abandoned in the Brexit negotiations.”Green Party MP Caroline Lucas described the decision as “deeply worrying”.“Climate change is the biggest challenge we face, and it must not be an afterthought for the Government,” she said.“Dealing with climate change requires a dedicated Minister at the Cabinet table. To throw it into the basement of another Whitehall department, looks like a serious backwards step.”She said she would work with any Minister “willing to take climate change seriously”, but added she would seek to hold Government to account for “any backpeddling on our climate change commitments”.Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, pointed out that a major report into the effects of climate change on Britain had made clear that it was already happening.“This is shocking news. Less than a day into the job and it appears that the new Prime Minister has already downgraded action to tackle climate change, one of the biggest threats we face,” he said.“This week the Government’s own advisors warned of ever growing risks to our businesses, homes and food if we don’t do more to cut fossil fuel pollution. “If Theresa May supports strong action on climate change, as she’s previously said, it’s essential that this is made a top priority for the new business and energy department and across government.”And Stephen Devlin, an environmental economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), said the department’s abolition was “a terrible move by our new Prime Minister”.He said it appeared to signal “a troubling de-prioritisation of climate change by this government”.“Tackling climate change is an era-defining challenge that must direct and determine what industries we develop, what transport infrastructure we construct, how we manage our land and what our diets look like. It requires a central co-ordinated strategy; if we leave it to the afterthoughts of other departments we will fail,” he said.“This reshuffle risks dropping climate change from the policy agenda altogether – a staggering act of negligence for which we will all pay the price.”He called on Ms May to reaffirm the Government’s commitment to the 2008 Climate Change Act, which he described as a “world-leading piece of legislation”.This commits the UK to an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is “one of few remaining silver linings in UK environmental policy”, Mr Devlin said. A letter by DECC’s permanent secretary, Alex Chisholm, to staff in his department, which was leaked to Civil Service World, confirmed that its responsibilities were being transferred to the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, under its new Secretary, Greg Clark.""We can make sure we have the 21st century infrastructure we need. Business will have a strong champion in government,"" he wrote.

604	4	Climate change and humans are driving polar bears to cannibalism .A Russian scientist reveals the animals are feeding on each other in the Arctic as melting ice and fossil fuel extraction destroys their habit.Ice levels are falling due to rising temperatures and industrial companies are moving into the area -forcing polar bears out of their traditional hunting grounds or on to the shore areas where food is scares.The rise in cannibalism incidents, according to the researcher, could also be due in part to an increase in human activity in the Arctic who are there to witness the horrific events.Scroll down for videos A Russian scientist reveals the animals are feeding on each other in the Arctic as melting ice and fossil fuel extraction destroys their habit. Ice levels are falling due to rising temperatures and industrial companies are moving into the area (pictured is an incident from 2009)'Cases of cannibalism among polar bears are a long-established fact, but we're worried that such cases used to be found rarely while now they are recorded quite often,' Mordvintsev told Interfax news agency, AFP reported.'We state that cannibalism in polar bears is increasing.'He believes these animals are turning on each other because their food supply is scarce – large males are attacking females and cubs because they are easy targets and mothers are eating their babies.Their dwindling food sources is being blamed on the climate crisis, as ice levels in the Arctic have decreased at least by 40 percent over  the last 25 years.Polar bears use sea ice to hunt seals swimming in the waters, but with a lack of ice the are being forced onto shore where they cannot hunt as usual and it is harder to find the nutrients needed to survive.The scientist says these animals are turning on each other because their food supply is scarce – large males are attacking females and cubs because they are easy targets and mothers are eating their babiesAlso to blame are humans who are setting up shop in the bears' homes for fossil fuel extraction.This winter the area from the Gulf of Ob to the Barents Sea, where polar bears used to hunt, is now a busy route for ships carrying LNG (liquefied natural gas), Mordvintsev said.'The Gulf of Ob was always a hunting ground for the polar bear. Now it has broken ice all year round,' he continued, linking this change to active gas extraction on the huge Yamal peninsula bordering the Gulf of Ob, and the launch of an Arctic LNG plant.'Another Russian scientist, Vladimir Sokolov, who has led numerous expeditions with the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, based in St Petersburg, said that this year polar bears had been mainly affected by abnormally warm weather on Spitsbergen Island to the north, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, where there had been no ice floes and little snow.A separate study, released this week, found that polar bears also hoard the bodies of their kills by burying them in the dirt and snow so they can retrieve them at a later date.The behavior, called caching, is relatively common in other bear species, especially brown bears, from which polar bears evolved around 500,000 years ago.It is exceptionally rare among polar bears, but Ian Stirling of the University of Alberta and the Scientific Advisory Council for Polar Bears decided to investigate after receiving an intriguing photo from a friend.Loss of ice due to climate change has a direct impact on the ability of polar bears to feed and survive.The bears need platforms of ice to reach their prey of ringed and bearded seals. Some sea ice lies over more productive hunting areas than others.Like other predators at the top of the food chain, polar bears have a low reproductive rate. One or two cubs are born in midwinter and stay with their mother for two years. Consequently, females breed only every three years. The bears don’t reproduce until they are five or six years old.From late fall until spring, mothers with new cubs den in snowdrifts on land or on pack ice. They emerge from their dens, with the new cubs, in the spring to hunt seals from floating sea ice.Simply put, if there isn’t enough sea ice, seals can’t haul out on the ice, and polar bears can’t continue to hunt. End of summer measurements of sea ice in the Arctic in September revealed that the region has hit the eighth lowest extent in modern record keeping.Satellite data showed the Arctic reached its yearly lowest extent on September 13, at 1.79 million square miles (4.64 million square kilometres).

832	4	Greta Thunberg has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved “our society is not sustainable”.The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists.She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis.“Whether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.“If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.”The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.”The lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy.The key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings.“We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,” Rockström said. “Around the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.”He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities.Neither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.“During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.“We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”
8	4	"Science Reporter, NZ HeraldIn the last general election, policy to tackle our greenhouse gas emissions was put front-and-centre with a Climate Voter movement and a televised debate devoted to the issue.That demand for action hasn't waned - and this year Waikato University student Sarah Thompson felt compelled to sue the Government over what she argued was a lack of commitment to the global effort.Weeks later, celebrities, scientists, doctors, businesspeople and thousands of other Kiwis came together to launch a fresh push, calling on the Government to phase out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2050, and adopt tougher policy.And now, environmental groups have been furious to learn the Government has been sitting on an official report estimating that $19 billion of property is at risk from the effects of climate change.Yet the Goliath issue has been oddly absent from the first two televised leader's debates.For New Zealand, the impacts of climate change would be serious and wide-ranging: sea levels could rise by up to 1m and temperatures could increase by several degrees before the end of the century.Climate change would bring us more floods - about two-thirds of Kiwis live in areas prone to flooding - make our freshwater problems worse and put more pressure on rivers and lakes.Our primary industries would be transformed, even more species would be put at risk, and New Zealand would experience flow-on effects from climate change's potential global impacts, spanning from disease and famine to regional conflict and the mass displacement of millions.Many Maori, who have a unique relationship with the natural environment and advocate its preservation through the principles of kaitiakitanga, are particularly interested in what climate change will mean for their land and people.While New Zealand contributes just 0.15 per cent of the world's emissions - a fact often pushed by those who argue against taking a more ambitious stance - a recent international ranking found the 24 per cent increase our country registered between 1990 and 2014 placed the rise as the seventh worst out of 41 industrialised nations.And although about a third of our emissions come from transport and electricity generation, the greatest proportion - around half of the inventory - comes from agriculture, and much of that from methane belched from ruminant livestock like sheep and cows.It's a headache the National-led Government has been trying to solve by spending around $20 million each year on agricultural greenhouse gas research.But to meet its agreed pledge to cut emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels and 11 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030, the Government will largely rely on carbon trading and our main climate mechanism, the Emissions Trading Scheme.That includes buying around $14b worth of international carbon credits over the next decade to offset what emissions we produce here.Under the ETS, companies are required to match each unit of emissions they report with an allowance, or credits, they must pay to the Government.People who plant forests, meanwhile, can report the carbon dioxide they take out of the air and claim credits, which they can sell, thus creating a trading market and an incentive to lower emissions.Introduced in 2008 to meet Kyoto obligations, the ETS has gone through multiple reforms.Just a year after it was established, the scheme was overhauled by National, ushering in a raft of amendments many argued gave polluters an easier ride.At the time, the Government called its new ETS ""workable and affordable"" - but the Herald dismissed it as a ""miserable offering to the international effort"".The latest moves have scrapped low-credibility ""hot air"" credits that could long be bought cheaply from other countries and phased out a two-for-one measure, and proposed units to be auctioned and for participants' use of international units to be limited when the ETS eventually reopens to international carbon markets.Elsewhere in the climate space, National plans to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons by 80 per cent, spend $2b on public transport, increase renewable electricity to 90 per cent by 2025, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, plant millions more trees, and work toward doubling the number of electric vehicles registered every year to reach 64,000 by 2021.It's set up three new expert groups to look at adaptation, agriculture and forestry to address climate change, spent $31m on research into understanding climate change and its impacts, pledged up to $200m in international aid for climate-related support and signed the Climate Change Action Plan with China.But critics say New Zealand has been nowhere near bold enough.Labour, whose leader Jacinda Ardern has called climate change her generation's ""nuclear-free moment"", would establish an independent Climate Change Commission to track progress on the transition to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, and offer expert advice.Further, it would set emissions targets in law, forcing governments to meet them, and extend the ETS to cover all forms of gases and sectors, including agriculture, which green groups have argued to be folded into the scheme.Labour also wants the public sector to lead the way on reducing emissions, and it would require state-owned enterprises and other government departments to pursue low-carbon options and technologies.Under the policy, the public sector could only buy electric cars for their fleet unless there were ""exceptional reasons"" not to do so.Some parties would scrap the ETS altogether.The Greens advocate replacing it with a polluter-pays carbon tax - initially set at $25 per tonne for all sectors except agriculture, which would start at $12.50 - and NZ First argue it should be swapped for a UK-style Climate Change Act and a parliamentary commission which would set three-yearly carbon budgets starting in 2021.The Greens also back establishing a new commission, along with a goal to have electricity 100 per cent sourced from renewable energy by 2030, and a legally-binding target to make our economy carbon neutral by 2050.The party would set up a state-owned ""Green Investment Fund"" to help launch new clean energy and infrastructure projects, with its initial $100m line of credit raised by hiking royalties on oil extraction from 46 per cent to 70 per cent.It would also electrify rail between Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga to move freight off the road, and incentivise businesses to choose clean transport options for staff, while ensuring that at least 20 per cent of the vehicles the Government buys in the next seven years are electric.Act would replace petrol taxes with a user-pays road pricing system, alongside new lanes for high-occupancy vehicles like buses.NZ First would go further and require that all government vehicles be electric within a decade, and also bring in ""net metering"", where electricity retailers are required to buy power generated by customers at the price at which it's typically sold to them.The Maori Party wants emissions goals set into law, also through a new commission; to offer tax breaks for research on renewable energy; to close all coal-fired plants by 2025; and to plant 100,000ha of forest over the next decade.It's also promoting incentives to low-income families and remote communities, offering solar power and energy storage such as home batteries, while also helping displaced Pacific communities through a visa scheme.The Opportunities Party (Top) is campaigning to cover much more ground - reforesting 1.1 million hectares of erosion-prone land. Elsewhere in its comprehensive climate policy, Top, which also has set a 2050 carbon-neutral goal and a 2035 target to achieve 100 per cent renewable electricity, would ensure all large new investments take into account a low carbon future.While the party wouldn't scrap the ETS, it would dump ""junk"" credits held by the Government by cancelling surplus credits as at 2020 and ensuring the scheme stays closed to international trade.All revenue from a higher carbon price would go back toward helping households and businesses become more energy efficient, slashing their costs and emissions.Will McKay has more reason than most to care about climate change.Not only does the University of Auckland PhD candidate's research area, aquaculture, hinge on what's going to happen to our planet, but he's young enough to potentially see some of global warming's most significant near-future impacts.""Human-induced climate change to me is a result of a long-term misunderstanding of how our actions impact the planet and more recently, poor management of Earth's resources,"" McKay said.""Although an increasingly disastrous phenomenon, I find climate change an interesting challenge because if we are to avoid the worst we will need to research, experiment, innovate and challenge the norm.""But in the political realm, McKay, a Blake Ambassador with the Sir Peter Blake Trust, feels issues around the environment have sat somewhere behind personalities, personal accusations and economic policy at election time.""Environmental issues are often polarising, particularly as they raise discussion on rangatiratanga and kawanatanga and affect industry and large voting bases such as agriculture.""These issues require multifaceted approaches encompassing environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations.""Because no one currently has the answer to solve these issues and keep all affected parties happy it appears parties avoid bringing on more trouble amongst the chaos that election time brings.""He'd like to see policy that improves the Emissions Trading Scheme to ensure incentives or penalties are reflective of businesses' emissions, economic tools to promote businesses undertaking R&D to improve their operations, and policy making solar power more accessible in homes.""Policy on environmental issues has a large influence on who I will vote for because I care about it and its health immensely,"" he said.""But also as a country we rely heavily on our land and waters for the economic gains that agriculture, fisheries, tourism, bring as well as for social, cultural and spiritual well-being so I believe it is in New Zealand's best interest that environmental policy is at the forefront of decision-making.""NATIONAL: Continue NZ's Paris Agreement pledge to cut emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels; review and improve the Emissions Trading Scheme; fund agricultural greenhouse gas research; increase the amount of electricity that comes from renewable energy from 80 per cent currently to 90 per cent; spend $2b on public transport and encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.LABOUR: Back carbon emissions targets being cemented into legislation, requiring the government to set carbon budgets for itself; establish an independent Climate Commission to work toward net zero carbon by 2050; bring all gas forms and sectors into the Emissions Trading Scheme and use revenue to move to a low-carbon economy; require state-owned enterprises and other government departments to pursue low-carbon options and technologies.GREENS: Set a legally-binding target to make New Zealand carbon-neutral by 2050 and achieve 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030; boost investment in green tech with an investment fund; replace the Emissions Trading Scheme with an emissions tax and use revenue as tax credits for households; establish a Climate Commission to track progress and set carbon prices.NZ FIRST: Oppose the Emissions Trading Scheme; support programmes and goals to cut emissions as with the UK's Climate Change Act; Support ""net metering"" whereby electricity retailers buy power generated by customers at the price it's normally sold to the customer.MAORI PARTY: Set emissions goals into law with a climate commission; offer tax breaks for renewables research; close coal-fired plants by 2025; plant 100,000ha of new forests over the next 10 years; support displaced Pacific communities through a special visa scheme; offer solar power and energy storage, like home batteries, to low-income families and remote communities.ACT: Replace petrol taxes with a user-pays road pricing system to reduce congestion and emissions; encourage ride-sharing and car-sharing.OPPORTUNITIES PARTY: Aim to be carbon neutral by 2050 and for 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2035; reform the Emissions Trading Scheme by setting a carbon budget, removing the current upper limit on the carbon price, and keeping the scheme closed to international credits; cancel the surplus of emissions permits held as at 2020; reforest all erosion-prone land by 2030; scrap fossil fuel subsidies and electrify cars and trains."
133	3	Senator Matt Canavan says the Labor Party and the Greens do not mind if country and rural communities pay the price of rapid action on climate change, “because they don’t live in those areas”.Mr Canavan criticised the “hypocrisy” of other nations like New Zealand and Canada who have not yet met their Kyoto or Paris targets but condemn Australia for its apparent inaction on climate change.“This hypocrisy has got no end”.Mr Canavan told Sky News host Peta Credlin Australia should not “sign up to effectively unilaterally do more action” while other countries are not “meeting the commitments they have actually said they would do”.“I don’t think any of the evidence stacks up here to go down this path”.Image: News Corp Australia
258	5	"The research, published Wednesday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS), concluded that the 2016 global heat record would not have been possible in a preindustrial climate.The international team of scientists also found that last year's extreme temperatures in Asia and unusually warm waters off the coast of Alaska were a direct result of human-driven fossil fuel emissions.""This report marks a fundamental change,"" BAMS editor-in-chief Jeff Rosenfeld said.While scientists have long known that climate change may have increased the chances of certain floods, droughts, storms and other extreme events, it hadn't yet been pegged as the sole cause.""Finding multiple extreme events that weren't even possible without human influence makes clear that we're experiencing new weather, because we've made a new climate,"" Rosenfeld said.Extreme eventsThe study presented 27 peer-reviewed analyses of extreme weather across five continents and two oceans in 2016. More than 100 scientists from 18 countries took part in the research.The earth's mean surface temperature broke records last year, something that was ""only possible due to substantial centennial-scale anthropogenic warming,"" the report said.Researchers also said the heat wave that swept Asia last year, claiming more than 500 lives in India, was caused by climate change.Ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and off northern Australia were the highest in 35 years of satellite records. The warming waters resulted in ""massive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef and one of the largest harmful algal blooms ever off the Alaska shore,"" according to the report.The researchers concluded that it was ""extremely unlikely that natural variability alone led to the observed anomalies.""nm/se (AFP, dpa)"
578	4	Climate change scientists fly more often than any other researchers, a new study has revealed.Researchers at Cardiff University found that scientists specialising in climate take around one more flight a year for work than their contemporaries.The revelation has sparked calls for environmentalists to 'look in the mirror' before preaching about reducing emissions.A study has found that climate scientists fly on average for an extra flight per year when compared to others after researchers surveyed 1,400 scientists from 59 different countriesThe study, reported in The Times, found that climate scientists take around five flights a year on average for work while other researchers took just four.Climate change professors also take around nine flights each year while the average for professors in general is eight.The study's authors said the disparity was likely because climate scientists attend more global conferences.But climate scientists also took an average of three international flights a year for personal reasons - which was the same average as researchers in other fields.The study noted that climate scientists did have 'higher levels of awareness and concern about the impact of aviation on climate change.It added that they were more likely to take steps to reduce or offset the emissions from their flights.Director of CAST Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh, who led the study, said the findings were 'unexpected' but said it also suggested 'knowledge alone is not enough' to tackle global warming.'Our findings highlight that climate scientists, like many other professionals, can struggle to square their environmental commitments with competing professional and personal demands, and academia itself is not doing enough to change this culture,' she said.'Crucially, our research demonstrates the need for policies and ways of working to encourage and enable low-carbon travel and use of virtual alternatives – something which is already happening in light of Covid-19.'Travel restrictions have required businesses, including universities, to replace a lot of physical travel with virtual interaction, such as online conferencing.'These virtual options can be just as effective as face-to-face meetings, but at a fraction of the cost, as well as being more accessible for those with caring commitments.'Campaigners have said the findings should be a catalyst for change that should encourage climate scientists to look in the mirror as the study makes for 'uncomfortable reading'Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester and former director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said it made for 'uncomfortable' reading.'This paper must be a catalyst for rapid change. We need to take a long hard look in the mirror, reflect on our research, and rapidly transition to an academia fit for the 21st Century.'Perhaps then governments, businesses and wider civil society would take more note of our research and conclusions,' said Professor Anderson, who was not involved in this research.'The study, published in Global Environmental Change, involved an anonymous survey in 2017 of 1,400 university researchers from across 59 countries.Around a fifth of those surveyed specialised in climate change.The research highlighted the need for more virtual alternatives to academic conferences which reduce the need for flying.
934	4	"David Legates, who was a professor at the University of Delaware before being tapped by the administration, will serve as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's deputy assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction, according to the Post, which said the climate change skeptic will report directly to acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs. CNN has reached out to Legates on the reported appointment. The executive director/CEO of the nonprofit American Geophysical Union, whose website claims 60,000 members, urged in a blog post Monday evening that the appointment be rescinded.""With climate change producing raging wildfires in the western United States and devastating hurricanes in the Atlantic, our nation -- and the world -- cannot afford to have our federal government undermining the important work of climate scientists,"" Randy Fiser wrote. ""Legates' appointment not only threatens our ability to combat the climate crisis and protect our planet for future generations, it undermines scientific integrity at NOAA."" The Post said Legates formerly served as Delaware's climatologist but was ""forced out"" because of his ""controversial views"" on the issue. The newspaper said that Legates ""had come under pressure from then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner (D), because of his fossil fuel industry-funded research casting doubt on the science showing that burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the main factor behind heating the planet and would lead to dangerous effects such as sea level rise and extreme weather events."" Legates spoke about some of his views during a hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee in 2019, claiming that carbon dioxide isn't the only thing contributing to changes in the planet's temperature. ""Carbon dioxide is not this magic knob that decides the temperature of the planet. In particular, there's an awful lot of other things that happen with it, too. The plant does not warm like a greenhouse, that's simply pure radiation balance,"" Legates testified during the hearing. In response to questions from Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California, Legates said that although the planet is experiencing some of the highest recorded temperatures in the last 150 years, it ""has little to do with carbon dioxide,"" but instead has to do with the ""demise of the little ice age and warming conditions due to an increasing sun.""Climate scientists largely agree that carbon dioxide is warming the planet, and that human activity, like the burning of fossil fuels for energy, has increased the gas to dangerous levels. Other gasses, like methane, are also responsible for some of the human-causes warming we see today.  NOAA ""oversees weather forecasting, climate research and fisheries,"" according to the Post, and ""has until now continued its climate research and communications activities unfettered by political influence,"" unlike other parts of the administration, like the Environmental Protection Agency, that have ""dismissed and sidelined climate scientists or altered their work before publication.""This story has been updated with reaction from the American Geophysical Union."
162	4	"In February, 25 Republican lawmakers got together in Utah, to meet youth party members and environmental groups and brainstorm a conservative approach to tackling the climate crisis. But it was something of a clandestine meeting,with some politicians only attending after organizers promised they would stay anonymous. That's how sensitive this subject still is in the Republican Party post-Trump. The former president called human-caused climate change ""a hoax,"" withdrew from the Paris Agreement and railed against water-conserving showerheads that failed to keep his hair perfect. But as younger voters in particular demand a response to the crisis, things are changing, said Chris Barnard of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a group of young conservatives that helped organize the gathering in Salt Lake City. ""If they want to stay relevant, they need our vote,"" said the 23-year-old. When John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, formed a Conservative Climate Caucus in June, almost a third of his fellow party House members signed up. In the midst of a summer of extreme heat and wildfires, they declared that the ""climate is changing,"" acknowledging that the prosperity of industrialization has come at a price.Too often, Republicans simply have opposed climate solutions without putting forward any ideas of their own, Curtis told reporters. ""We, too, want to leave this Earth better than we found it."" Right before Earth Day in April, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, presented a plan to capture carbon, plant trees and expand nuclear energy. A few weeks later, he created a Republican task force to develop a climate and energy agenda. Among Republicans younger than 40, a majority is concerned about the changing climate, opinion polls show. By contrast, 65% of Republican baby boomers have said climate change was not an important concern to them. This age gap was illustrated in Miami in June, when the ACC held a rally dubbed ""the first conservative climate protest in the US."" Speakers had to shout over heckling by a group of older men who waved signs reading: ""There is no climate crisis.""Staunch climate denial is still seen in the rhetoric of Republican lawmakers, too. When large parts of Texas lost power in frigid weather last winter, Republican Governor Greg Abbott falsely blamed solar and wind energy. And when President Joe Biden announced his goal of cutting greenhouse emissions in half at a climate summit earlier this year, some Republicans and right-wing media stoked resistance by spreading misinformation suggesting the president planned to restrict meat consumption.But if the thought of giving up burgers is a turnoff for many Americans, the ACC believes there are ways to frame climate action more positively for the GOP's supporters. Barnard points to the promises of innovation and emphasizing conservation of wildlife and natural resources, a long-time interest of many farmers and hunters in rural America. ""A lot of Americans want to be positive. They don't want to feel guilty for the collapse of the planet,"" he said.Most climate-conscious conservatives emphasize investment in new technology to reduce emissions, regulatory reform to allow easier development of clean energy projects and so-called natural climate solutions — using soil, trees and grassland to capture and store carbon. ""We need to empower market action, scientists and entrepreneurs, rather than expect the government to throw money at the problem,"" Barnard said.Some Republicans have said they support carbon pricing and many favor nuclear energy. But most insist fossil fuels still have a role to play in the energy system. Curtis wants the United States to export gas to China to replace coal, which is heavier on carbon emissions. ""Reducing emissions is the goal, not reducing energy choices,"" he proclaimed in the founding statement of his caucus. On the other side the aisle, some Democrats suspect their Republican colleagues of ""greenwashing,"" of promoting solutions as good for the environment when they really aren't. Although both parties receive campaign contributions from the oil and gas sector, ""the vast majority"" of this funding goes to Republicans, according to researchers at Open Secrets, a research and government transparency group.Republicans in Congress are against Biden's climate plan to phase out fossil fuels. And many climate scientists are also skeptical about the solutions conservatives have proposed. Planting trees and carbon sequestration will not be enough, according to Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""There are limits to how much we can rely on these natural carbon sinks,"" she said. ""That's why we have to get to the core of the problem, which is fossil fuel dependence. We cannot get distracted."" Scientists also point out that purely market-based efforts to cut emissions have often failed to make an impact. ""The US is making some significant progress in the direction of cutting emissions. Almost all that progress is not coming from the market, but from mechanisms that are in place through regulation,"" said David Victor, director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California San Diego. And Cleetus isn't impressed by comparisons with China. ""I think this is not a moment where responsible nations can point at each other and try to evade responsibility,"" she said. Barnard said there is no ""perfect silver bullet"" to fight climate change. ""One of the frustrations we have is that a lot of the young people with the progressive climate movement make the perfect the enemy of the good."" Rather than disparaging policies that don't rapidly eliminate fossil fuels, he said we should welcome steps in the right direction.In Coral Gables, Florida, 43-year-old Republican Mayor Vince Lago is showing what such steps might look like. He passed legislation requiring new buildings to be energy efficient and expedited the approval process for solar panel permits. His city of 51,000 residents employs one of Florida's largest electric car fleets, and Lago himself lives in a home that runs on solar energy. He also drives an electric BMW i3 subcompact car — ""bought used,"" he stressed — charged by his own solar panels.The mayor said he often invites residents to his home to answer questions about solar energy. His close-to-zero electricity bill proves environmental policies can be financially savvy, too, he said. ""When we elected officials lead by example, when you're showing that you're walking the walk, not just talking, people have more faith in their government.""Another thing that might improve public perception of politicians' handling of the crisis would be an end to partisan bickering. ""As you talk about sea-level rise, global warming, deforestation and the destruction of our fish hatcheries and our water quality, I think eventually this is no longer going to be party politics as usual,"" Lago predicts. ""This is not really an issue about conservatives or liberals, Democrats or Republicans. This is an issue about our future."""
769	3	After generations of storing their food in handmade cellars dug deep into the permafrost, growing numbers in Alaska’s far-north now find their cellars filling up with water and blood.Dozens of the naturally refrigerated food shelters exist underneath the region’s mainly Inupiat whaling villages – where many rely on hunting and fishing to eat.But now climate change and other modern factors are forcing changes to an ancient way of life, rendering traditional storage methods dangerously unreliable.Ranging from small arctic root cellars to spacious, wood-lined underground chambers, ice cellars are typically stocked with vast amounts of whale, walrus, seal and caribou.These chambers, usually built 10 to 12 feet below the surface, have long been used to age subsistence food to perfection and ensure a steady supply during the sparser months, which is critical for survival. But increasingly, these cellars are beginning to collect mould and water, in some cases becoming completely submerged. Others collapse completely.In Alaska’s northernmost community, Utqiagvik – which saw its warmest summer on record this year – about 60 per cent of the 1,500 households rely on subsistence foods for at least half of their diet, National Geographic wrote in 2015.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms here“I’m worried,” said Gordon Brower, a Utqiagvik whaling captain whose family owns two ice cellars. One is more than a century old and used to store at least two tonnes whale meat set aside for community feasts. The other, built in 1955, is used to feed Mr Brower and his family.He recently asked his son to retrieve some whale meat from the one of the cellars, and discovered both were in a bad state.“He came back and said: ‘Dad, there’s a pool of blood and water at the bottom,’” said Mr Brower, who is now housing the community’s meat under a tarpaulin sheet above ground. “It seems like slight temporary variations in the permafrost – that active layer – is affecting the temperature of our cellar,” Mr Brower said.There were once at least 50 ice cellars in Point Hope, a native village built precariously on a thin spit of land caught between the Chukchi and Arctic oceans.Now, there are less than 20 cellars in the village of 750 people.Many in the community have little money and cannot afford to replace traditional methods with modern freezers.To compensate, Point Hope whaling captains have use of three walk-in freezers that were donated for use by the whaling community. But the much colder freezers do not impart the taste of aged whale meat so favoured throughout the region. “It’s definitely a challenge at this time to be able to feed our people that acquired taste,” said 52-year-old whaling captain Russell Lane, who has spent his whole life in Point Hope. The problem has been building for decades as a warming climate impacts multiple facets of life in the far-north – thawing permafrost, disruptions in hunting patterns and shorter periods of coastal ice that had long protected coastal communities from powerful storms. Other factors include development and soil conditions.The changes have increased vulnerability to foodborne illnesses and raised concerns about food security, according to studies by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. State health officials said so far they have not heard of anyone becoming ill.Despite the unprecedented rate of modern climate change, ice cellars have failed as far back as the early 1900s, according to a 2017 study in Utqiagvik in response to reports of flooded and collapsed cellars.Researchers mapped 71 ice cellar locations around town and monitored five functioning cellars from 2005 to 2015, finding little thermal change over that relatively short timeframe. One of those cellars has since failed, however, and another is starting to collapse.The study concluded that while a changing climate has great potential to affect ice cellars, there are other factors, including soil conditions and urban development.“Climate change, air temperatures, all these physical changes are affecting them,” said Kelsey Nyland from George Washington University, one of the study’s authors. “But also, a lot of it has to do with development and modern life in an arctic setting.”Scientists had previously agreed that an underground tunnel, known as the utilidor, built in Utqiagvik in 1984 to provide water, electricity, and other utilities had been responsible for the failure of some cellars, National Geographic reported in 2015.To adapt to the new environment, the village of Kaktovik, on the Beaufort Sea coast, took ambitious steps after it lost all but one family’s cellar to flooding.In 2013, the village launched a project to build a community ice cellar incorporating traditional designs with contemporary technology used in Alaska’s North Slope oil fields – thermosyphons, off-grid tubelike refrigeration devices that cool the ground by transferring heat outside.The hand-excavated cellar was ready for use in 2017, but it has yet to be filled. Whaling captains want to expand it first, according to whaling captain George Kaleak Sr, who represents Kaktovik on the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.Temperature sensors inside the cellar show it’s working as intended, Kaleak said. He expects the expansion to begin as early as next spring.But experts warn melting ice cellars are a problem for hunters across the Arctic. While some communities are able to avert crisis using modern technology, in Siberia the disappearance of millennia-old permafrost is now creating climate refugees.With researchers continually revising their predictions for how quickly permafrost could melt, and how this could contribute to the warming of the planet, it seems increasingly likely those forced to leave their homes will not be the last.“The permafrost is thawing so fast,” Anna Liljedahl, associate professor at the University of Alaska told The Washington Post in October “We scientists can’t keep up anymore.”Additional reporting by AP
317	4	Should the UK declare a “climate emergency” that would inform public policy and the national budget? The question was been debated in parliament on Wednesday, with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declaring the government should “embrace hope” through stronger actions on greenhouse gas emissions, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, calling the problem of climate change “an emergency”.Outside parliament, the activist group Extinction Rebellion has brought London motor traffic to a standstill on several occasions, and the youth activist Greta Thunberg has held meetings with leading politicians, including Gove and Corbyn but excluding the prime minister.These events have taken place while the courts have given the go-ahead for a new runway expansion at Heathrow, rejecting the UK’s participation in the Paris climate change agreement as the basis on which transport policy should be decided. Meanwhile the government’s statutory advisers on climate change are likely to warn on Thursday that reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 is achievable but will require sizeable changes in public consumption habits, industry and government policy.The UK’s emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen rapidly in recent decades, but the reasons have been complex. One has been the shift away from manufacturing and towards services, including financial services, which are lucrative but light on emissions, as the basis for economic growth and prosperity.This has come at a cost – the UK coal mining industry was nearly annihilated in the 1980s and 1990s, and other areas of heavy industry shed more than a million jobs in the late 1990s and 2000s. But other areas of industry, such as renewable energy and research and development into low-carbon forms of technology, have shown rapid growth. There are estimated to be about half a million jobs in the low-carbon economy in the UK, though estimates vary widely depending on what jobs are classed as “green”.Tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per person have tumbled in the UK, while for other countries the equivalent emissions have risen. In the UK, the shift away from coal to natural gas – from the North Sea – in the 1990s was a key factor.In many developing countries, by contrast, in recent decades the shift has been towards bringing electrical power to those who previously were denied it. Taking people out of “energy poverty” has been a key factor in economic growth in the developing world, benefiting all sectors of society.Yet it is possible for societies to move away from greenhouse gases while achieving growth in gross domestic product, as the UK’s recent history shows. This “decoupling” has been heralded by the UK government as an example to other countries, and the growth of renewable energy and much greater energy efficiency have been key to achieving this success.Renewable energy, in the form of onshore and offshore wind and solar panels, was subsidised by successive governments from the 1990s, helping its early growth and boosting developments in the technology that brought down costs and made it more easily adopted. In recent years those subsidies in the UK have been slashed, but worldwide the costs of renewables have come down rapidly, making them more accessible to all countries.Historic emissions have long been a bone of contention at international talks on climate change, which are carried on annually and in 2015 resulted in the landmark Paris agreement, which required countries to stay within at least 2C of global warming, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.For many years, developing countries argued that one reason for wealthy countries to take on the lion’s share of emissions cuts was their greater responsibility for emissions before the 1980s, when climate change began to be recognised as a problem. In recent years, however, the rapidly rising emissions from developing countries such as China have dwarfed the UK’s own historic emissions, and this trend is likely to continue.• This article was amended on 3 May 2019.

78	4	"A power plant fires coal from the nearby Garzweiler open-cast mine near Luetzerath, western Germany. File photo/AP. Dozens of large German companies have urged the country's next government to put in place ambitious policies to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord.The 69 companies said in an open letter Monday that the next government needs to put Germany ""on a clear and reliable path to climate neutrality"" with a plan for doing so within its first 100 days in office.The signatories included chemicals company Bayer, steelmaker ThyssenKrupp and sportswear firm Puma.The centre-left Social Democrats narrowly beat outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Union bloc in an election last month. The Social Democrats were meeting Monday with the environmentalist Greens party and the pro-business Free Democrats to discuss forming a coalition government.""Climate protection was the decisive topic in the federal election and the parties must place it at the top of their agenda in building the new federal government,"" said Michael Otto, board chairman of the mail order company Otto Group and president of the Foundation 2 Degrees, which organised the letter.Earlier this year, Merkel's government adopted a plan to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to ""net zero"" by 2045, five years earlier than previously planned.But official figures show that Germany is slipping behind on its ambitions for cutting greenhouse gases, with 2021 emissions forecast to rebound sharply after a pandemic-related economic slump.The signatories, which have an annual turnover of about 1 trillion euros ($1.16 trillion) and employ more than 5 million people worldwide, want the next government to support the rollout of renewable energy and enact a climate-friendly tax reform that includes a strengthened carbon pricing system to prevent investments in power-hungry industries going abroad.Pointing toward the upcoming U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, and Germany's presidency of the Group of Seven major economies next year, the companies said the German government must also work to set international standards for the global financial system and climate-neutral products.""As businesses, we are prepared to fulfill our central role in climate action. We call upon the new German government to make the transformation to climate neutrality the central economic project of the coming legislative period,"" they said.The UN climate summit begins October 31.Follow AP's coverage of climate change at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change"
833	5	"""It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,"" says sixth-former Joe Brindle. Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education. Ministers agree ""it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change"" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency.He is a founder member of Teach the Future which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.  ""It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,"" says Joe. ""And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse."" On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs. The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes ""is going to be really big"". Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is ""to get MPs on our side"". The idea is based on the 1958 US National Defense Education Act which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races. It paid off - by July 1969, the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28. ""I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,"" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer. But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes. ""The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences."" He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and ""try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can"". And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says. People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: ""It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.""Joe believes most people his age ""want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it"". But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.  ""It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,"" say the campaigners. They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector. The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are ""particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there"".Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030. The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception. In a statement, the government said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish.""This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.""A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies. The Department for Education also supports energy efficiency through its capital funding programmes, including interest-free loans, the spokesperson added."
313	5	"A lot of people are talking about climate change, and a lot of people are very worried about it. Children and grown-ups are protesting and you might hear some scary things about the future. People don’t know yet how things will turn out in 10 years, 20 years or a 100 years from now.But there are things we can do. One of the most important things, is to understand what the problem is, how we all play a role in causing it — and how we can all play a role in solving it.1. Why are so many children skipping school?Kids are worried. They're not happy that the adults in charge — those who should be making our lives better — seem to be ignoring the problem of climate change, or just not doing enough to stop the world from getting too hot.Students hope that by walking out of school with banners and megaphones, and getting together with other people who want things to change, that their voices will be heard. They want the politicians, those people who make the big decisions, to get together and come up with solutions to climate change and find a way to fix the damage we've done.World leaders met and agreed that they would do that. But so far, they haven't done enough to stop our planet from getting dangerously hot.2. And what exactly is climate change?That's a tricky one. Plenty of adults don't understand a lot of the details about climate change. It's a problem caused by ""greenhouse gases.""A greenhouse is made of glass that traps the sun's heat but doesn’t let it back out again, so that inside, it gets hotter. The same thing happens with the Earth's atmosphere, which holds in the heat from the sun to keep us all nice and warm (out in space, we'd quickly freeze!).But gases that come from factories, power plants and cars and get into the atmosphere are making the planet too hot.Most of the energy we use to make things, keep the lights on and our homes warm, turn on the air-con and power transport, comes from burning fuels like oil, gas and coal. These are called fossil fuels and when they are burned, they release carbon. Once carbon gets into the atmosphere, it traps a lot of heat.  Cutting down trees can also make the world hotter, because trees take carbon out of the atmosphere and store it safely away.Read more: Coping with climate anxiety on a warming planetWhen the planet gets hotter, how the weather changes is different from place to place — and hard to predict. You may have heard older people talk about how winters used to be snowy, or seen pictures of melting glaciers. In some places, deserts are getting bigger and in summer it can be too hot to go outside.But in other parts of the world it can actually get colder, rainier or more stormy: For example, when the glaciers melt, all that icy water goes into the sea, making it colder, changing the flows of water and air — and the weather. And when it gets hot, more water evaporates, making more rain.3. Is the world going to end?No — planet Earth is about 4.5 billion years old and it has been through lots of changes, getting hotter and colder at different times. But the animals and plants that live here now like the climate just the way it is. If it changes too much, many will die.Unusual weather — too much rain or not enough, huge storms, hotter summers, forest fires and floods— is also making it harder to grow the food we eat every day. In some places, there isn't enough food and water.Climate change could mean more people will become sick. And some people have to leave their homes and look for a safer place to live, sometimes far away in another country.To stop the world getting too hot, we have to change the way we live. People are comfortable living their lives a certain way, getting around in gas-powered cars and airplanes and finding everything they want in stores, and they may fear giving up that way of life.4. But what does that have to with me? Pollution can come from many things; nearly everything we do in our daily life has an effect on the climate. That's why we're trying to fly less, reuse our shopping bags and buy fewer things, or get our food from the farms closer to home.Read more: Net-zero by 2050: What does it mean?Think about plastic water bottles. Before they show up in the store, somebody has to make the bottle, fill it with water and move it to the store by truck. And then, once we're done with it, we usually just get rid of it right away — by recycling, when we can, or just tossing it in the trash. All that has an effect on the planet, by creating more pollution in the air, using up fresh water and making more garbage.5. So what can I do to help?We can make small contributions, like remembering to turn off the lights when we leave a room, eating less meat and composting our garbage. We can also walk places or go by bike, or go on vacations closer to home so we can take the train, which uses less energy and makes less pollution than a plane.Read more: Why healthy soils and forests are key to climate protection and prosperityEveryone can make changes in their daily lives that mean there will be less pollution. And while our choices alone aren't enough to fix the problem, they can help to convince companies and politicians to make bigger changes.Just by asking these questions — and learning from books or from interesting TV and movies — and talking about climate change and the environment with other people in your life, you're helping to spread the message. And the more that people know about the problem, the better chance we have of doing something about it.

48	3	"National Party Kaikoura MP and climate change spokesman Stuart Smith. Photo / LDR/Adam BurnsNational Party MP Stuart Smith has described a Government climate change plan as the ""science of bull****"" during a talk in Ashburton this week.The Kaikōura MP floated suggestions that warmer temperatures would not cause an increase in extreme rains - contrary to the Government's National Climate Change Risk Assessment (NCCRA) plan.Smith, who is National's climate change spokesman, confirmed during the meeting that he was making official parliamentary inquiries with Climate Change Minister James Shaw around the legitimacy of the report, sparking several heated reactions from patrons.Smith said, in light of recent floods in Mid Canterbury, that a Niwa study showed flooding risk would actually fall as the climate got warmer but had been ignored by the NCCRA document.A recent Tailrisks Economics report into the NCCRA claims the Ministry of Environment-commissioned report was based on a false premise that climate change would increase extreme weather and flooding.It then suggested that Niwa covered up flood risk results from a 2019 river and rainfall report.""Claims that buildings and people will be generally subject to large increases in flooding risk are misleading.""The Niwa data is not very informative because all it does is identify people and assets  on historical floodplains.""It does not take account of flood protection measures or make any assessment of the probability of flooding.""Smith said that the NCCRA report had been based on a pre-determined position.""That's appalling,"" he said.He added that many local councils would be misled because they only referred to the NCCRA when considering flood risk.Niwadeclined to comment on Smith's remarks but chief scientist for climate, atmosphere and hazards Dr Andrew Tait said an increase of extreme rainfall was expected.Potential changes to New Zealand's flood exposure were not covered in the 2019 Niwa report as a national climate change flood exposure study had not been done at the time, he said."
217	0	It’s often been said that we’re living through an unprecedented moment. But in city centres, the coronavirus crisis has merely accelerated trends that have been unfolding for some time. In Leeds, where I live, many major banks and building societies, cinemas, shops and department stores declined or disappeared as society shifted online. The pandemic has caused the job market to contract, and many more people are now working from home. But in cities across the country, traditional office spaces have long been shrinking, as technology reduces the need for face-to-face contact and a growing number of self-employed people opt for co-working spaces. Indeed, the idea of a dedicated office building is only 200 years old; before offices, many people lived above their workplaces.Despite the economic boom that some UK cities have experienced in the last 20 years, the centre of Leeds, like many other city centres, has not yet recovered from industrial decline. Vacated banking halls have supplied glamorous homes for bars and restaurants in regeneration areas, and housing has returned to the centre, albeit in the limited form of small apartments and poorly designed student accommodation. But the continuing trend of “meanwhile use” and sprawling ground-level car parks across the city are evidence that supply still exceeds demand.Coronavirus has accelerated these processes, but they aren’t new. Neither is Leeds a novice in dealing with pandemics; the Spanish flu of 1918, which infected one in three people in the city, overwhelmed its hospitals, closed its schools and created shortages of grave diggers. What’s new about Covid-19 is that it coincides with another existential crisis – the climate emergency – and that we’ve made extraordinary technological advances since 1918.City centres will struggle in the short term with the effects of the pandemic, and a great number of service workers will be unemployed. This is a tragedy, but it’s also an incentive to plan for medium- and long-term solutions. In the past, disasters have been the bedrock of social progress, not least in the creation of the National Health Service in 1948. And what’s good for dealing with the impacts of Covid-19 is also good for addressing the impacts of climate change.Work on climate mitigation and adaptation has already paved the way for how our city centres should change, and has supplied the technologies to make this possible. In Leeds, Covid-19 should be an opportunity to accelerate what has already been planned to address the climate emergency, such as installing a cycling network in the city centre that connects to surrounding neighbourhoods, and engaging the community in planting 1m trees.This green infrastructure is crucial for biodiversity, carbon capture, water management, temperature cooling and wellbeing. It’s the first step towards remodelling our urban environments as “15 minute cities”, a concept first promoted in Paris, which aims to provide all necessary services required for the health and wellbeing of its residents within 15 minutes’ walking distance. In the past, green infrastructure has also been a response to public health concerns: Central Park in New York was developed following a prolonged outbreak of cholera, and Victoria Park in east London, the city’s first purpose-built park, was opened as a response to insanitary conditions, overcrowding and pollution in the city’s East End.But we need to go further. We should be using public investment to build networks of new parks with playgrounds and sport and leisure facilities on underdeveloped sites in city centres. Providing this green infrastructure in our city centres would attract families to live there, and compel businesses to follow. Of course, there will be a time lag between the immediate effects of coronavirus and delivering on these ambitious plans. But I’m optimistic that in this period we’ll see a burst of creativity, of the sort that often emerges from the collapse of outmoded systems.Empty and cheap space may attract new users and institutions, as it did most notably in Detroit after the demise of its car industry. In UK cities, unused office spaces could be converted into modern family homes; in Leeds, Park Square, a handsome Georgian area that was repurposed into offices could be returned to its original residential use. Defunct shopping centres could become sites for new nurseries and community centres. Our coronavirus retrofit should be the work of many hands, a sensitive process of rebuilding cities so they’re durable, equitable and sociable places to live and work, capable of dealing with the twin emergencies of the pandemic and climate crisis.• Irena Bauman is a director at Bauman Lyons Architects, Leeds
128	4	The recent bushfires show the Coalition will not be able to take the same suite of climate change policies to the next election, according to The Australian’s Paul Kelly.Three people have died as dozens of fires burn out of control across the state, with conditions expected to deteriorate on Tuesday evening and into Wednesday.In Canberra, the bushfire crisis is exacerbating political tensions, with the Greens and the Nationals clashing over the cause of the fires.Mr Kelly told Sky News climate change is making fires ‘more frequent.’“Morrison can’t take to the next election in three years’ time the same climate change policies that he took to this year’s election in 2019.”“We will see a dramatic shift of the politics of climate change over the course of the next three years.”“That will certainly demand from Morrison a reappraisal and a policy rethink during this term”.
305	3	Europe’s Atlantic-facing countries will suffer heavier rainfalls, greater flood risk, more severe storm damage and an increase in “multiple climatic hazards”, according to the most comprehensive study of Europe’s vulnerability to climate change yet.Temperatures in mountain ranges such as the Alps and the Pyrenees are predicted to soar to glacier-melting levels, while the Mediterranean faces a “drastic” increase in heat extremes, droughts, crop failure and forest fires.Europe and the entire northern hemisphere are warming at a quicker pace than elsewhere, to the extent that tropical diseases such as West Nile fever are expected to spread across northern France by mid-century.Hans-Martin Füssel, one of the lead authors of the European Environment Agency report, said that scientific evidence was pointing increasingly to a speeding up in the pace of climate change.“We have more data confirming that sea-level rise is accelerating,” he said. “It is not a linear trend, largely due to increased disintegration of ice sheets. There is also new evidence that heavy precipitation has increased in Europe. That is what is causing the floods. The [climate] projections are coming true.”Earlier this month, Nasa, Noaa and the Met Office confirmed that 2016 had broken the record for the hottest year ever previously held by 2015, which had itself broken the record that had been held by 2014.The new EEA report finds that land temperatures in Europe in the last decade were 1.5C warmer than the pre-industrial age, although near-surface temperatures – measured at a metre above ground level – were only 0.83C-0.89C warmer.Hans Bruyninckx, the director of the EEA, which produced the report said that there was now “not a snowball’s chance in hell” of limiting global warming to 2C without the full involvement of the US, which has just elected a climate-sceptic president.“Empirical evidence is the basis of the climate debate,” Bruyninckx said. “There are still people around who say the earth is flat or was created in seven days but if you don’t accept the logic of empirical reasoning it becomes a very difficult discussion.”The peer-reviewed EEA study was compiled by 60 contributing authors and institutions, including the EU’s Joint Research Centre. The report, which contains new observations and projections, looked at a wide range of indicators including agriculture, health, transport and biodiversity.Over the course of this century, the study expects average global sea levels to rise between 1.5-2 metres, potentially threatening low-lying areas including south Florida, Bangladesh and Shanghai. The paper is intended to spur Europe’s sluggish moves towards adaptation strategies for dealing with the impacts of climate change, ahead of an EU review later this year. Frogs, birds, butterflies and insects are already advancing their life cycles as springs arrive earlier, but local extinctions of some species are being reported. “Species are adpating but not as fast as the climate is changing and this may cause disturbances in the equilibrium of ecosystems,” Bruyninckx said.Butterflies and birds were already migrating northwards to the poles, he added.This trend is only like to deepen as heat extremes in central Europe grow stronger, while the boreal forests of Scandinavia experience less snow, river ice, and an increasing risk of winter storms and pest infestations. On the positive side, the region’s hydropower and summer tourism potential are likely to increase, even as a reverse trend occurs in the Mediterranean.Europe’s thermal growing season is now 10 days longer than in 1992, with delays to the end of the season more dramatic than the advance of its start. In countries such as Spain, warmer conditions are expected to shift crop cultivation to the winter.In the Arctic, one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet, many habitats for flora and fauna such as sea ice, tundra and permafrost peat lands have already been lost.Oxygen-depleted ocean “dead zones” caused by agricultural fertilisers – particularly in the Baltic Sea – and ocean acidification fed by an influx of freshwater from melting continental ice will pose further threats to marine ecosystems, and the indigenous peoples who depend on them.While retreating sea ice will open up the potential for greater resource exploitation, the report’s authors warn that “utilising Arctic oil and natural gas resources would challenge the transition to a low-carbon society, as it is recommended that two-thirds of known global fossil resources remain in the ground if the 2C warming limit of the UNFCCC [UN framework convention on climate change] is to be met.”
60	3	A note on the false dichotomy between prevention and treatmentIn an interview with CNN on Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said that now is not the time to talk about climate change.“Here’s the issue,” he said. “To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm, versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced.”Fortunately this is not a choice that need be made. There is vulgarity in politicizing tragedies for the sake of gaining power, and crassness in pointing fingers and placing blame instead of mourning a tragedy. But of course these aren’t the only options. In the interest of minimizing harm to people, it’s always an important time to talk about climate change. We don’t have to choose between helping current victims and working to prevent the next tragedy.This is a false dichotomy of the sort that’s commonly used to silence talk of prevention and public health that implicates powerful industries. In the wake of mass shootings, for example, the supposed choice is between mourning loss of life and talking about the instruments of violence. In this case the choice is supposedly between rescuing people and talking about climate change.Pruitt doesn’t seem to favor talking about climate change much at all. Even before arriving at the EPA, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he led the fight against the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. And already, his EPA appears to be limiting study of the subject. The agency now reportedly has a Trump campaign aide monitoring research-grant applications for “the double-C word.”In exiting the Paris Climate Accord, the president, too, has removed the United States from a position of leading climate discourse to undermining it. While claiming to be focused firstly on American economic prosperity, Trump has denied the scientific premise that will shape the future of the global energy economy. His administration is undoing policies that would keep sustainable energy a priority for the economic future of the country, not to mention the well-being of its citizens.At the same time, this week Congress authorized $7.9 billion in disaster-relief funds for Harvey. Billions more could soon be needed, as hurricanes Irma and Jose now represent the first time two Atlantic systems have simultaneously exceeded 150 miles per hour.Even amid this unprecedented sequence of hurricanes and destruction, most Americans are not in the path of danger. Those who want to lend a hand—to save lives and minimize harm and do something—stand to do much good by using this moment of awareness to prepare for a severe-weather event that does eventually affect their community.Doing so does not require litigating the exact degree to which carbon emissions contributed or didn’t contribute to these exact hurricanes. It only means acknowledging that climate change is occurring, and it increases the likelihood of severe weather that will harm people.In addition to preparing homes and communities accordingly, we make daily and hourly decisions about how much we contribute to that risk, and how much we do to mitigate it. It’s more than possible to talk simultaneously about prevention and treatment; it’s irresponsible not to.

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - GettyYouTube users interested in climate issues are just as likely to be directed to conspiracy theories as they are scientific content, new research has found.And the Google-owned site's efforts to crack down on fake content appears to be struggling, with subscriber counts to channels promoting debunked nonsense still growing.Researchers in Germany took a look at what YouTube had to offer when it came to climate science, and were disturbed by what they found.""Searching YouTube for climate-science and climate-engineering-related terms finds fewer than half of the videos represent mainstream scientific views,"" said Joachim Allgaier, sociologist at RWTH Aachen University.""It's alarming to find that the majority of videos propagate conspiracy theories about climate science and technology.""About 54 percent of the clips YouTube served up at the top of the search rankings for terms like 'climate engineering', 'global warming' and climate modification' bucked the scientific consensus, which is that humans are the cause of an unprecedented spike in greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures.The worst offender was the search term 'chemtrails'. Only 5 percent of clips presented the scientific consensus, and they weren't popular, only garnering 1.5 percent of views. Conspiracy videos accounted for 95 of videos and 98.5 percent of views.Dr Allgaier said what was most worrying is that conspiracy theorists have learned to present their claims in scientific language so it's not immediately clear the claims have no basis in reality.""People searching for 'geoengineering' or 'climate modification' on YouTube won't find any information on these topics in the way they are discussed by scientists and engineers. Instead, searching for these terms results in videos that leave users exposed to entirely non-scientific video content.""YouTube earlier this year announced plans to cut down the number of conspiracy theory videos it recommended to its 2 billion users.""We'll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways,"" the site said in a blog post in January, ""such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the Earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.""But a new investigation by The Huffington Post has found the change has had little impact on major purveyors of such nonsense. Tech reporter Jesselyn Cook analysed several channels and found while it appears to be preventing new channels from breaking through to a wider audience, subscriber counts are still growing for YouTubers who already had a big following before the change.""If a creator has already started to grow an audience, that audience will seek out their content whether it’s going up in the algorithm or not,"" data researcher Becca Lewis told Cook.In many cases, this change is too little, too late.""Dr Allgaier said YouTube needs to ""take responsibility to ensure its users will find high-quality information if they search for scientific and biomedical terms, instead of being exposed to doubtful conspiracy videos"".""YouTube has an enormous reach as an information channel, and some of the popular science YouTubers are doing an excellent job at communicating complex subjects and reaching new audiences. ""Scientists could form alliances with science-communicators, politicians and those in popular culture in order to reach out to the widest possible audience. They should speak out publicly about their research and be transparent in order to keep established trustful relationships with citizens and society.""Dr Allgaier's findings were released the same day two new studies detailed how climate change sceptics have misused historic climate data to claim the recent upswing in temperatures has nothing to do with humans.His research was conducted between 2015 and December 2018, before YouTube announced its changes, which affected recommended videos but not search results. Newshub."
646	3	Remarks from the head of the World Health Organisation gives the public the first hint that the political class want to turn the tools of the pandemic, that is, border closures, lockdowns, state of emergency powers, restrictions, curfews, closing down businesses as part of their plan to combat climate change, according to Sky News host Rowan Dean. In a recent speech, World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros said the COVID-19 pandemic has given “new impetus to the need to accelerate efforts to respond to climate change.” “Over the past eight months, every Australian has learned just what a nightmare government-mandated zero emissions would be, thanks to the arrogant, deceitful and scandalously incompetent government responses to COVID-19,” Mr Dean said. “You don't have to be some crazy right wing nut job climate denier, guilty m'lud, to recognise that the reactions from our federal and state governments to Covid 19 are, if not a blueprint, then certainly a timely warning to the rest of us, of just how dangerous excessive government powers and control by unelected bureaucrats quickly become when power is absolute.”
845	4	The impact may not yet be obvious in grocery stores and greenmarkets, but behind the organic apples and bags of rice and cans of cherry pie filling are hundreds of thousands of farmers, plant breeders and others in agriculture who are scrambling to keep up with climate change.Drop a pin anywhere on a map of the United States and you’ll find disruption in the fields. Warmer temperatures are extending growing seasons in some areas and sending a host of new pests into others. Some fields are parched with drought, others so flooded that they swallow tractors. Decades-long patterns of frost, heat and rain — never entirely predictable but once reliable enough — have broken down. In regions where the term climate change still meets with skepticism, some simply call the weather extreme or erratic. But most agree that something unusual is happening. [Tell us how climate change is affecting your area.]“Farming is no different than gambling,” said Sarah Frey, whose collection of farms throughout the South and the Midwest grows much of the nation’s crop of watermelons and pumpkins. “You’re putting thousands if not millions of dollars into the earth and hoping nothing catastrophic happens, but it’s so much more of a gamble now. You have all of these consequences that farmers weren’t expecting.”Because the system required to feed the country is complex and intertwined, a two- or three-week shift in a growing season can upset supply chains, labor schedules and even the hidden mechanics of agriculture, like the routes that honeybees travel to pollinate fields. Higher temperatures and altered growing seasons are making new crops possible in places where they weren’t before, but that same heat is also hurting traditional crops. Early rains, unexpected droughts and late freezes leave farmers uncertain over what comes next.Here are 11 everyday foods, from all over the country, that are facing big changes:Weather has always been a challenge in northern Michigan, but never — at least as far back as tart-cherry growers can remember — has it been this frustrating. Tart cherries are a small, delicate crop that bakers prefer to use fresh for pies, although most are frozen, dried or processed into juice or canned filling. Growers rely on a long, cold winter and a slow, cool spring so trees won’t bud and bloom before the threat of a final freeze is over. But lately, Grand Traverse Bay hasn’t been freezing over reliably, so warmer temperatures arrive too soon. There have been two total crop failures in a decade; the last one before that was in 1945. Spring weather has become more violent, too, pummeling trees with hail and winds.The spotted wing Drosophila, an invasive fruit fly, showed up in 2010, and many farmers believe it is spreading quickly as a result of shifting climate patterns. It lays eggs in the fruit, and its larvae feed inside, ruining the cherry; so far it seems impossible to control. A team of researchers is trying to develop a cherry tree that blooms 20 days later, but with fruit that ripens at the same time as it does now. Still, a solution is years away. That may be too late for some of the 425 families who grow tart cherries. Already, there is talk among some families of abandoning the cherry business altogether, said Nikki Rothwell, coordinator of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Research Center. “The stress is becoming too much for many of the growers,” she said.The fruit fly that is vexing cherry growers in Michigan is also attacking the raspberry crop in New York State. Winters haven’t been as long or as cold, so the flies are appearing earlier; organic fruit are especially at risk because farmers are limited in using pesticides. Unlike other flies that feed on rotting fruit, the spotted wing Drosophila, which by 2011 had arrived in significant numbers in upstate New York, has a tiny saw near its abdomen that allows it to cut into fruit that is just ready to be picked. The raspberries, already delicate, can end up infested with larvae, and turn to goo by the time a customer gets them home. Couple that with mild winters that don’t kill off pests, and unusual weather patterns that don’t bring rain when they should — or bring so much that farmers can’t get into the fields to work or have to battle fungus — and organic berries aren’t such a good bet anymore. “People have really given up on raspberries on a lot of farms,” said Alissa White, a researcher at the University of Vermont who tracks the impact of climate change on Northeastern farms. “Farmers are the kings of risk management. Once every 10 or 20 years we could lose a crop. But if once every three or four, that’s a lot.”Warmer weather and an increasingly earlier growing season have, in many ways, been good for farmers like Sarah Frey. She used to start harvesting her South Florida watermelons in mid-April. This year, crews were picking in March. She’ll be picking earlier in South Georgia, and expects to pull watermelons from fields in Missouri by the Fourth of July, which she said was rare when she was growing up in the 1990s.But earlier and longer growing seasons have consequences. For Ms. Frey, harvesting watermelons earlier than usual puts her into competition with the late-winter crop from Mexico. And new, more restrictive immigration policies could mean she won’t have enough workers from Mexico to work the fields when she needs them — especially because many American produce growers are starting or expanding operations in Mexico. “Having it earlier is good for customers and good for business, but if it’s overlapping with the import business and I can’t get enough workers to harvest, that’s a problem,” she said.The chickpea is enjoying an unexpected assist from extreme weather. Farmers in Montana, who grow about 60 percent of the chickpeas produced in the United States, are being encouraged to plant more as a hedge against heat and drought. The average annual temperature in Montana has increased by 2.4 degrees over the last century, but the amount of rain hasn’t changed much. Chickpeas, which need less water to grow than wheat and other cereal grains that are the mainstay of Montana agriculture, provide an antidote. They improve soil and help reduce the need for fertilizer; rotating in a spring crop of chickpeas before a wheat crop can help break disease and pest cycles, said Kevin McPhee, a professor at Montana State University. It also doesn’t hurt that hummus is so popular, opening up new markets. Still, all the new chickpea growers face tough competition globally. India, which imports huge amounts of American chickpeas, protected its own producers with stiff tariffs in 2018, and China and the European Union have responded to recent United States trade tariffs with their own.The wild blueberry has long been an essential player in Maine agriculture, but unpredictable weather is challenging the 44,000 acres where the commercial low-bush berries grow. The season has stretched out four weeks longer, and summers are becoming warmer. Temperatures last year reached an unprecedented 95 degrees, said Lily Calderwood, an extension wild blueberry specialist at the University of Maine.Frosts are becoming erratic, too. A frost in the spring can kill blossoms that would have become fruit. “We didn’t used to have these unpredictable events,” Dr. Calderwood said. “We could rely on gradual and reliable growing seasons. Now it’s all starting to skip around, and these frost events come out of the blue.” Drought isn’t helping. Many smaller growers, some tending fields that are 100 years old, don’t irrigate, but that expensive step may become necessary. And the same fruit fly troubling cherry and raspberry growers in Northern states is also a concern in Maine.Gene Mealhow comes from a family that lost its farmland in the 1980s. Now he grows pearly flint popcorn, whose genetics he can trace back to the 1840s, on about 300 acres in Illinois and Iowa. When he was growing up, predictable spring rains led to even summer heat and a reliable crop of corn. “Now when it rains, it comes down four of five inches at a pop, or we’ve got tornado warnings,” he said. “Believe me, the weather is so extreme.”This season, some of Iowa’s big corn producers face land so soaked with rain that they have to leave crops in the field; recent floods turned the Missouri River into a monster. But not all of Iowa is in trouble, Mr. Mealhow said. Some parts of the state produced bumper crops last year. His little pocket of land near Shellsburg in eastern Iowa hasn’t been hit as hard, either. Still, he’s doing what many small farmers are: diversifying. He’ll work through his existing inventory of popcorn, which he sells under the Tiny But Mighty brand to stores like Whole Foods Market, and just grow some for seed. The rest of his energy will go into growing onions, sweet corn and tomatoes for restaurants in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Next year, perhaps, there will be more popcorn. “Everybody is still optimistic,” he said.The symbol of Georgia and the mainstay of a Southern kitchen, peaches could be devastated by climate change. They need a certain amount of consistent cold weather — what growers call chill hours — followed by dependably warm weather. Without enough chill hours, peach buds are weak, and weak buds make poor fruit. In addition, trees are blooming too early and then being hit by unusual frosts, which result in less sellable fruit. In 2017, a warm winter destroyed almost 85 percent of the state’s $30 million peach crop. It’s part of a pattern noted last year in the federally mandated National Climate Assessment, which predicted that it would continue. In response, researchers at places like Clemson University are trying to find new peach strains that can handle the shift, but new cultivars are still years away.Most organic apples in the American grocery store come from Washington State, which grows about 230,000 tons a year. Apples don’t have the same worries about chill hours that softer fruits like peaches do, but they are being threatened by climate change in their own way. One problem that comes with hotter spring weather is an increase in diseases like fire blight, which can be especially hard to prevent in organic orchards where antibiotics can’t be used, said Kate Prengaman, associate editor of Good Fruit Grower, a Washington-based magazine for tree fruit and grape farmers.Hotter temperatures can subject both organic and conventionally grown apples to sunburn, which causes defects on the fruit’s skin. Some growers have taken to installing large nets over orchards to reduce the intensity of the sunlight, but the process is expensive. Unlike many row crops, which can be replanted from year to year, orchards can take a decade or two to regrow, and farmers expect them to produce for at least a generation.As warmer weather endangers traditional Texas crops like peaches and pears, some growers have been enticed by exotic fruit like the golden kiwi fruit, a less fuzzy, sweeter and more nutritious cousin of the more common green species. The first golden kiwi crop was harvested in East Texas in 2014 using cultivars from Auburn University in Alabama, and enthusiastic researchers like David Creech have been growing increasingly larger crops every year. The humidity and acidic soil of East Texas seem like a perfect match for this potentially lucrative crop. But Tim Hartmann, an extension horticulturalist at Texas A&M University, said kiwi fruit are sensitive to cold weather. Finding the right amount of chill hours — the cold weather that kiwis need to produce — and dodging freezes make the task difficult. “You would think that with temperatures warming up, a subtropical place like Texas would predispose it as a suitable area for subtropical crops,” he said. “But we’ve noticed that as the climate changes and the weather is getting erratic, the freezes we get are more unpredictable.”When the chef Mary Sue Milliken started noticing artichokes in her favorite Los Angeles farmers’ market in December, all she could think about was climate change. The weather in Castroville, long the epicenter of California artichoke country, has shifted in a state where agriculture is feeling the impact of climate change more than any other.The classic California artichoke, with its spring growing season, likes cool, overcast weather that comes when heat from the Central Valley pulls in cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean. But the ocean has been warming, and the marine layer has been less reliable, said Pat Hopper, manager of the California Artichoke Advisory Board. And warmer weather has improved conditions for pests like the artichoke plume moth. As a result, artichoke growers have developed new seed that grows well in the desert heat of Coachella, 450 miles south, which puts California artichokes in the market almost year-round. “We’re in a time of change,” Ms. Hopper said. “The biggest thing consumers are going to see are higher prices. It’s just a result of higher costs all the way around to make things grow.”About 1.2 million acres of farmland are planted with rice in Arkansas, which grows about half of the country’s supply. And that rice needs a lot of water. But changing weather patterns produce less rain during the growing season, and the underground aquifers that feed the state’s crop are drying out. “The rice industry as we’ve known it is not sustainable,” said Anna Myers McClung of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Ark. Higher temperatures are another culprit. Too much heat alters the starch that the plants produce. Long-grain rice that should look translucent becomes chalky and cooks up stickier. It breaks apart more easily at the mill, causing waste. In response, some farmers are building reservoirs or experimenting with new, less water-intensive growing methods. Researchers like Dr. McClung are working with genetics to find strains of rice that are better adapted to the changing climate and more drought-tolerant. But developing a new variety, she said, could take five to 10 years.Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

328	4	"Watch: Kids explain why climate change matters. Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - GettyThe Government has announced new resourcing for teaching climate change in schools.Education Minister Chris Hipkins said on Sunday kids will be taught ""the role science plays in understanding climate change, aids understanding of both the response to it and its impacts - globally, nationally and locally - and explores opportunities to contribute to reducing and adapting to its impact on everyday life"".The resource, called Climate Change - prepare today, live well tomorrow, includes video, text and guidance, and was trialled at New Brighton School in Christchurch in 2018.Scientists say the world has warmed about 1.2C since the Industrial Revolution thanks to fossil fuel emissions, and warn the pace could accelerate this century, with possibly dire consequences. ""Children today are understandably growing up worried about how climate change will affect their lives,"" said Climate Change Minister James Shaw.""They see the simple fact that every year they have been alive has been one of the hottest on record and they expect us to act. ""Our zero carbon legislation is an important framework for lasting change, but its success depends on all of us working every single day to take the ambitious action we need. Making this resource available means children will be able learn about what we have done to the planet, its potential impacts and what they can to help us solve the problem.""The course has been designed for years seven to 10 - ages 11 to 14. Last year saw thousands of students around New Zealand - and the world - protest world leaders' lack of action on combating climate change, many inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019.Last year was New Zealand's fourth-hottest on record, according to NIWA. "
589	2	Temperatures rising just a few degrees could lead to thousands of early deaths in the US, a new study suggests.Researchers found that if global temperatures rose by 3.5 Fahrenheit (F), or 2 Celsius (C), it could result in 2,100 fatal injuries such as from transportation accidents, drownings and assaults.What's more, most of the deaths would occur among young men from ages 15 to 34, and most likely in either California, Florida or Texas. The team - from Imperial College London, Columbia University and Harvard University - says that warmer temperatures lead to more swimming, driving and drinking alcohol, which lead to an increased risk of fatal accidents.  A new study led by Columbia University in New York has found that rising global temperatures from climate change could lead to an additional 2,100 deaths per year, mostly among young men (file image) For the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, the team analyzed data from the National Center for Health Statistics to calculate the number of deaths from injuries from 1980 to 2017. It showed that 5.9 million American died from injuries over the 38-year study period, mostly from transport accidents, drownings, falls, assault and suicide.The team then looked at unusual temperature changes in every month in every county in the mainland US. Researchers then used a statistical model to see how many additional deaths would occur if global temperatures rose by 2.7F (1.5C) or 3.5F (2C). These numbers were chosen because countries in the Paris Agreement are committed limiting the increase in temperatures to 2.7F (1.5C).Since the mid-19th century, Earth's surface temperature has risen by approximately 2F (1C), according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The US will be withdrawing from the agreement in November 2020, shortly before the end of President Donald Trump's term.Results showed that if temperatures rose by 2.7F (1.5C), there would 1,600 excess deaths per year- more than 1,200 would be in young men dying from transport accidents and drowning.This is because warmer temperatures meaning more people swimming and more people driving on the roads. Past research has also found that when more energy is burned, there is higher volume on the road, which leads to more road deaths.Risks were also seen in deaths from suicide and assault due to warmer temperatures, but the changes in these risks were less significant. If global temperatures rose by 3.5F (2C), researchers calculated there would be as many as 2,100 additional deaths annually from the same causes.'These predictions suggest we should expect to see more deaths from transport accidents, suicides, drownings and violence as temperatures rise,' said senior author Dr Majid Ezzati of the School of Public Health at Imperial College London.  'These new results show how much climate change can affect young people. We need to respond to this threat with better preparedness in terms of emergency services, social support and health warnings.'  The team says it's not clear why there are increases in deaths from rising global temperatures triggered by climate change.One reason could be that, in warmer weather, more people spend time outdoors, which could lead to confrontations - and thus, deaths from violence.Another could be that agitation from hot weather could lead to drinking more alcohol, and that combination could cause a rise in assault.As for the rise in suicides, previous studies have found that warmer temperatures are linked to higher levels of mental distress, particularly among young adults.
691	3	Ahead of climate change negotiations in Paris, the Chinese government has released its latest scientific assessment of how global warming has affected and is likely to affect China. The 900-page “Third National Climate Change Assessment Report” is the work of some 550 scientists and experts, summing up the advancing knowledge of the environmental consequences of rising greenhouse gas levels.Here are the report’s main findings on how China’s environment will feel the effects of global warming:RISING TEMPERATURESAverage temperatures across China have been rising faster than the global average, and that trend is likely to continue, the report says. From 1909 to 2011, average temperatures across China rose between 0.9 and 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.6 and 2.7 Fahrenheit). Governments have set a goal of trying to limit future temperature rises in this century to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. But even if that global goal is met, temperature rises across China will be substantially higher: 2.7 to 2.9 degrees Celsius (4.9 to 5.2 Fahrenheit), the report says.transcriptSHOWS: LE BOURGET, FRANCE (NOVEMBER 30, 2015) (HOST BROADCASTER - ACCESS ALL)//8. (SOUNDBITE) (French) FRENCH PRESIDENT, FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, SAYING:“Never, and I mean never, have the stakes been so high at an international meeting because we’re talking about the future of the planet, the future of the life.”//6. (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SAYING:“I’ve come here personally as leader of the world’s largest economy and the second largest emitter to say that the United States of America not only recognises our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.”//10. (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SAYING:“Here in Paris we can show the world what is possible when we come together, united in common effort and by a common purpose. And let there be no doubt - the next generation is watching what we do.”//4. (SOUNDBITE)(Mandarin) CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING, SAYING:“Countries need to increase dialogue, exchange best practices and achieve common development through mutual learning. At the same time, countries should be allowed to pursue their own solutions that best suit their respective national conditions.”PRECIPITATION AND WATERAlthough global warming sometimes conjures images of parched deserts, the consequences for rain and snowfall across China are more complicated, as they are for many other parts of the world. Warmer air absorbs more moisture that, sooner or later, is released as precipitation. The effects on precipitation across China are likely to vary widely, and scientists are still working on finer-grained models of likely change. In parts of northern, northwestern and southern China, rain and snowfall have decreased in recent decades, while in other regions, especially out west, precipitation has increased.Over this century, the report says, China’s total precipitation could increase 2 percent to 5 percent. But increased evaporation due to higher temperatures can mean that soil and waterways retain less of that water. “Over all, climate change may further intensify the occurrence of floods and droughts,” the report says. “This will pose even more severe challenges for management of water resources.”AGRICULTUREThe Chinese government has made national food self-sufficiency a priority, fearing that reliance on foreign markets could make the country economically and politically vulnerable. So there is a great deal of research in China on the effects of global warming on agriculture, but also considerable uncertainty. Warmer weather could extend the growing season for some crops, especially in northeast China. But farmers will also have to cope with increased pests, less reliable rain and irrigation, and hotter summers.Over all, climate change will cause earlier and shorter growing seasons, a proliferation of diseases and pests, and intensifying hazards. That does not mean that China will inevitably face famine, the report stresses, but adaptation in crop varieties and in farming and irrigation technology will be needed to cope with these stresses.HIGHER SEA LEVELSAcross the planet, sea levels have been rising because of melting polar caps and the accumulated heat that is expanding oceans. But the effects are not uniform. Some parts of the planet experience higher rises than others, reflecting the effects of ocean currents, winds and the gravitational influence of polar ice masses. And China, the report says, is in a part of the world where sea level rises have been relatively high and are likely to remain that way. From 1980 to 2012, China’s coastal seas rose an average of 2.9 millimeters, or 0.11 inch, a year, higher than the global average. Forecasting how fast future rises will be is difficult, partly because much rests on the future of the polar ice sheets.In the next 30 years, the East China Sea off Shanghai could rise between 7.5 and 14.5 centimeters, or 3 and 5.7 inches. The rises will force back the coastline and expose low-lying areas to worse damage from storms and typhoons, which whip up surges of water, as well as inundations of saltwater into waterways and farmland. Each rise of one centimeter in sea level could push the coastline back more than 10 meters, or 32.8 feet, the report says. It calls for much greater investment in sea walls and other protections.
404	5	"The nation’s automakers would manufacture only electric cars. Utilities would have to stop producing pollution linked to climate change. And the federal government would double its investment in mass transit.All this and more was proposed by House Democrats on Tuesday under a plan aimed at bringing the U.S. economy’s greenhouse gas emissions — including carbon dioxide and methane — to zero by 2050.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) released an ambitious package of climate proposals that calls for a combination of government mandates, tax incentives and new infrastructure.The proposals would mandate electric utilities be net-zero emitters of greenhouse gases by 2040 and automakers produce only electric cars by 2035. The 538-page plan also backs placing a price on carbon emissions, imposing tougher methane limits and boosting energy efficiency in buildings. Solar and wind tax credits would be extended through 2025, and the tax credit for electric vehicles would be expanded.The package has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and President Trump occupies the White House, but Pelosi and Castor have put down a marker in the hopes that electoral victories by Democrats this year will change the political balance in Congress in 2021.“We’re going to press ahead with everything we can do in the near term,” said Castor, the chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. “But yes, it will provide a plan that can be taken off the shelf and adopted into law as soon as we are able to reconvene.”Speaking on the steps of the Capitol Tuesday, Pelosi called the report a “bold step for climate action now.”“I wish it weren’t a fight,” she said of the resistance from Republicans to the ideas from the Democratic majority on the committee. “I wish it were just a coming together.”She added: “We will turn this report into law.”The climate package comes as nearly two-thirds of Americans say the federal government should act more aggressively to combat climate change, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center last week. In that survey, significant majorities backed policies that would plant huge numbers of trees, greater restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.Still, the Democrats’ proposal comes with political risks. The far-reaching plan may not be ambitious enough for the Democratic Party’s left wing. For example, the Green New Deal, put forward last year by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and favored by progressives, calls for getting all of the nation’s power from renewable and zero-emission sources 10 years sooner than the plan from House Democrats. It includes other measures, such as a federal jobs guarantee, that are not in the committee’s proposal.Going into an election year, it is likely to be fodder for Republicans. The Republicans on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis issued a statement Tuesday that said the country should continue to produce oil and gas, along with renewable energy.The GOP also suggested that setting a goal of net zero emissions didn’t make sense as long as other countries continue to generate greenhouse gases.“Over 90 percent of all emissions will soon originate outside U.S. borders,” it said. “More than 105 percent of emissions growth will come from China and developing economies.”Republicans said it was “disappointing” that there would not be a formal markup, “preventing the opportunity for the select committee to endorse bipartisan recommendations.”“Public input has been pushed aside in favor of expedited Democratic partisanship,” the statement said. It also noted that the Democratic plan comes in the midst of a pandemic that has crippled the economy. “As a result of COVID-19, the nation is in a far different place than when the committee was formed last year,"" it said.Castor, citing U.N. scientists who say the world has precious little time to get emissions under control and head off devastating consequences, emphasized climate change is just as much of a crisis as the coronavirus, a struggling economy and racial injustice.“People would say, ‘Well, why are you releasing this in the middle of covid and … protests?’” Castor said. “We can’t wait. We can’t wait any longer.”Pelosi reconvened the special climate change panel, which Republicans disbanded about a decade ago, after Democrats retook the House in 2018. The previous version of the committee laid the groundwork for a major climate bill during President Barack Obama’s first year in office that passed the House but died in the Senate.Pelosi tasked Castor, an ally, with laying out a blueprint for Congress to tackle climate change. The Democratic majority on the committee consulted with a range of groups — environmentalists, labor unions, automakers and Native American tribes — to form the plan.“They’ve been casting a wide net,” said Sam Ricketts, who led climate policy for the presidential campaign of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) before co-founding a green group called Evergreen. Ricketts met with the committee last August to offer input.Pelosi has been briefed on the report and is set to promote the plan at an event Tuesday morning.“Democrats are doubling down with a huge jobs-focused clean-energy infrastructure and tax package, trying to draw a sharp contrast with a Republican Senate reluctant to pass true economic stimulus despite high unemployment numbers,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Senate Finance Committee staff member, now with the Progressive Policy Institute. “Assuming no bipartisan deal is reached this summer, it sets up a showdown over contrasting economic visions for November.”To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, House Democrats want to require utilities to deliver all of their electricity from sources that do not contribute to climate change by 2040.House Democrats are taking a cue from what states have already done. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 30 states and the District of Columbia have already mandated utilities to get more of their electricity from renewable or other clean-energy sources.To cut carbon pollution from the transportation sector, Castor’s committee said Congress should set an aggressive target that would compel carmakers to ensure all new passenger vehicles sold by 2035 produced no emissions — and that all new heavy-duty trucks would achieve that goal by 2040.The climate plan still leaves room for nuclear energy — a contentious issue among Democrats. The committee’s plan allows for nuclear power to count toward a utility’s clean-energy requirements.Long unpopular on the left due to the problem of spent fuel, as well as the risk of meltdowns and other accidents, nuclear power still produces half of the carbon-free electricity in the country. The growing threat of climate change had led to soul-searching among environmentalists more recently over the issue. Among the many backers of nuclear power are former energy secretary Ernest Moniz, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).“Where we landed is: If we're going to get to our net-zero goal as soon as possible, then nuclear needs to remain part of the equation,” Castor said.Oil, gas and coal would still play roles in the economy but would be limited to industries such as steelmaking and aviation, where there are no economically viable alternatives.The plan calls for putting a price on releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but it does not make a detailed recommendation about how to do that or how high that price might be. Any new tax risks triggering opposition.“Congress has a little more homework to do on that,” Castor said.Congressional Democrats and Obama tried but failed to pass one carbon-pricing system — a cap-and-trade plan — in 2009. Today, however, California and 10 Northeastern states have their own cap-and-trade programs in place.More recently, some Republicans and corporate executives have come to embrace the idea of a tax on carbon emissions.The report calls on Congress to direct the EPA to consider the cumulative pollution effects of the permits it grants to projects in poor and minority urban communities. In more rural areas, it called for Congress to protect at least 30 percent of all U.S. land and ocean by 2030.The package would also create a national climate bank, which would help finance projects that cut emissions, and expand the Energy Department’s loan-guarantee program to leverage private investment in decarbonization and resilience projects.It also calls for updating the “outdated” organization of the department — the main federal agency funding research into new energy technologies — so work done in one office (such as capturing carbon dioxide at power plants) can be put to other uses (say, containing emissions at factories).Susan Tierney, formerly an assistant secretary for policy at the Energy Department, called such a reorganization “long overdue.”“DOE’s current organization structure on the applied-energy side of the shop definitely deserves serious attention in order to address climate change,” said Tierney, who was not involved in the report."
962	4	"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says that the physical and financial impacts of global warming are accelerating.Record greenhouse gas levels are driving temperatures to ""increasingly dangerous levels"", it says.Their report comes in the same week as the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported a surge in CO2 in 2018.However, new data from the UK suggests Britain is bucking the trend with emissions down by 3%.This year's State of the Climate report from the WMO is the 25th annual record of the climate. When it first came out in 1993, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. These have now risen to 405.5ppm and are expected to increase further.This is having a significant impact on temperatures, with 2018 the fourth warmest year on record, almost 1C above what they were in the period between 1850-1900.The years between 2015 and 2018 were the four warmest on that record, the study says.""This report makes it very clear that the impacts of climate change are accelerating,"" said Prof Samantha Hepburn who is director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resource Law at Deakin University in Australia.""We know that if the current trajectory for greenhouse gas concentrations continues, temperatures may increase by 3 - 5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and we have already reached 1 degree.""While some of these figures were published in a preliminary release of the study from last November, the full version has data on many key climate indicators, that the WMO says break new ground. One example is ocean heat content. More than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the seas and according to the WMO, 2018 saw new records set for the amount of ocean heat content found in the upper 700 metres of the seas, and also for the upper 2,000 metres. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook MessengerSea levels also continued to increase with global mean sea level rising 3.7mm higher in 2018 than the previous year. ""This report highlights the increase in the rate of sea-level rise, and this is a real concern for those living in low-lying coastal areas, for both developed and developing countries,"" said Dr Sally Brown, a research fellow at the University of Southampton.""We know that sea-level rise is a global problem that will not go away, and efforts need to be made to help those who are really vulnerable to adapt to sea-level rise or move to safer areas.""The head of the WMO say that the signals of warming continue to be seen in events since the turn of the year. ""Extreme weather has continued in the early 2019, most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and tragic loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It may turn out to be one of the deadliest weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere,"" said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas. ""Idai made landfall over the city of Beira: a rapidly growing, low-lying city on a coastline vulnerable to storm surges and already facing the consequences of sea level rise. Idai's victims personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,"" said Mr Taalas. The report has been launched at a news conference in New York attended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. ""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he wrote in a foreword to the new study.However earlier this week the International Energy Agency published worrying data, indicating that in 2018 carbon emissions were up 1.7%, as a result of the fastest growth in energy use in the last six years. The UK government has also released emissions data about greenhouse gas emissions over the past year. The figures show that emissions across the UK have fallen by 3% over the last year, the equivalent the government says, of taking 5 million cars off the road.Factors driving UK emissions down include the fact that coal was the source of just 5% of electricity in 2018.The government now says that carbon emissions are at their lowest level since before the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne."
664	4	Apple Inc. has gone carbon neutral. But in order to say the same for its flagship iPhone, it’s going to need help from Taiwan.More than three-quarters of the emissions that come from making Apple’s ubiquitous products come from outside suppliers, according to the company’s Environmental Progress Report. That includes Taiwanese electronics giants like TSMC and Foxconn, which still get about 90% of their power from non-renewable sources, according to company reports.That’s changing though. The firms are installing solar panels and buying power from offshore wind farms in line with Apple’s target of having all of its products be carbon-neutral by 2030. It underscores how climate pressure is increasingly coming not only from activists, but from within company’s own supply chains.“What Apple and other companies are trying to do is contribute to meeting Paris climate targets by decarbonizing their own footprints and making it a precondition for their partners and suppliers to use renewable energy,” said Prakash Sharma, director for the energy transition practice at consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “It’s gaining momentum because more and more companies are moving in that direction.”So far 71 of Apple’s hundreds of suppliers have committed to using only renewable energy, about 8 gigawatts worth, or more than the peak power demand for the entire nation of Singapore. Once completed, these commitments will avoid over 14.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually— the equivalent of taking more than 3 million cars off the road each year.Taiwanese companies make up an outsize proportion of Apple’s suppliers worldwide because of their dominance of sectors such as contract manufacturing and made-to-order semiconductors. Linchpins of Apple’s manufacturing machine include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which exclusively makes cutting-edge chips for Apple’s iPhones and iPads in Taiwan, and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn, which assembles more than 100 million iPhones annually. Both firms recently agreed to join the renewable energy drive.Wind and solar power can be as cheap as fossil fuels, but they don’t produce at all hours of the day, so it isn’t feasible for major factories to run directly on renewables alone. Improvements in battery technology might soon change that, but at the moment Apple isn’t pushing its suppliers in that direction.Instead, Apple wants them to invest in enough renewable energy in their home region to cover their power use. That way even if a factory requires coal-fired electricity in the middle of the night, it will have invested in enough wind or solar to keep an equivalent amount of coal from being burned at other times.For Foxconn, that means installing solar panels on the roofs and of its campuses in places like Henan province in China, where coal is still the dominant source for power. The company had installed 224 megawatts of clean energy by the end of 2019, up from 33 in 2017. But it still has a long way to go, as solar power and renewable energy credits amounted to only about 10% of its power use last year, the company said in its sustainability report.TSMC, which used renewable energy and credits for 6.7% of its power in 2019, has committed to producing renewable energy for its entire operations by 2050. It signed a deal last month with Orsted A/S to buy all of the power from a 920-megawatt wind farm the Danish company is developing off the coast of Taiwan, in what is the world’s largest private renewable power deal. The deal means TSMC now actually has agreements to buy more clean energy than Apple, according to BloombergNEF.The company’s efforts have been aided by a massive Taiwanese government plan to transform the country’s energy mix away from coal and nuclear and toward renewables and natural gas. The Orsted deal, for example, came after the wind-maker had established a major presence in the company thanks to several government-backed deals for offshore wind farms.“Growing sustainability initiatives by major companies are definitely making a dent in their supply chains,” said Jonathan Luan, a Beijing-based analyst with BloombergNEF. “Some companies have been able to change market rules to achieve their goals, like in Taiwan.”
536	5	President Obama followed up his Inaugural Address with more strong words for climate protection in his State of the Union, delivering the lengthiest soliloquy on climate change in presidential history.
228	5	The latest report from the world’s climate scientists has made clear the size of the challenge if the world is to stay below the global warming limit hoped for in the Paris climate agreement. Unfortunately, with current trends we are likely to cross this threshold within the next two decades because we are already two-thirds of the way there.But how do we know what is driving these climate trends? It comes down to the same kind of detective work that typifies a crime scene investigation, only here we are dealing with a case that encompasses the whole world. Let me give you my view, which does not necessarily represent the position of NASA or the federal government.For the past 100 years we have documented good, independently confirmed observations of change at the surface of the planet, and for the past 40 years satellites and comprehensive measuring efforts have provided a much fuller view of changes throughout the earth system. These observations show clearly that among other things, the surface of the planet has warmed, the upper atmosphere has cooled, the oceans are gaining an enormous amount of heat, sea level is rising, Arctic ice has greatly receded and glaciers around the world are in retreat. [The Opinion section is now on Instagram. Follow us at @nytopinion.]Scientists have no shortage of suspects for the causes of climate change. Over the 4.5-billion-year history of the planet, almost anything that might have happened has happened, sometimes many times over. The sun has brightened and sometimes dimmed, massive volcanic eruptions have occurred, the planet’s orbit has wobbled, the continents have moved, the land surface has been remade, the composition of the atmosphere and its ability to trap and reflect solar and terrestrial radiation has altered, ocean circulations have sputtered and stopped, and we have been struck, at least once, by a mass-extinction-inducing asteroid.Each of these events left a unique fingerprint of change on the climate system, with impacts reaching from the upper atmosphere 30 miles high to the deep ocean four miles down, from the tropics to the poles, and in the sediments laid down in the geological record. To track down the culprit of any one specific climate change involves piecing together the contemporaneous fingerprints and tracking them back to the plausible causes.For changes since the beginning of the 20th century we don’t need to worry about asteroids or moving continents, but we know there have been natural changes in earth’s orbit, variations in the sun’s brightness and volcanic activity. There are some new suspects too. Human activity has deforested, replanted and irrigated large areas of land, added pollution to the skies, depleted the ozone layer and, yes, changed the concentrations of key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels are up 40 percent, methane has more than doubled, and we’ve introduced some purely synthetic compounds that are many times more potent than either of those but are fortunately present in lower, but growing, concentrations.Like forensic detectives, climate scientists have developed a new array of tools in recent decades designed to skillfully calculate what the fingerprints of these changes look like, and more important, how they differ from one another. It turns out that increases in solar activity produce warming throughout the atmosphere, while carbon dioxide increases cooling in the upper atmosphere and warms the surface. Variations in ocean circulation distribute heat, while changes in the sun or in greenhouse gases change the total heat amount in the system. Air pollution, volcanoes and irrigation all cool the climate, while rising greenhouse gases warm it. Ozone depletion has increased the speed of the winds around Antarctica, affecting ocean circulation and sea ice. But even taking into account uncertainties in the amount of air pollution in the 19th century or in estimating global temperatures through time, scientists have concluded that the current warmth is impossible to explain without human contributions. It is on a par with the likelihood that a DNA match at a crime scene is purely coincidental. Moreover, when we include the multiplicity of human effects, we match them with the observed trends at the surface, in the Arctic, in the ocean and aloft. The dominant factor that emerges is the rise in greenhouse gases, which we know comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Even more convincingly, these trends aren’t just being attributed in hindsight. The rate of surface warming was predicted in the 1980s, the cooling in the upper atmosphere was forecast in a 1967 scientific paper, and specific measurements from space indicate that the total greenhouse effect has been enhanced exactly as theory would predict.When this is all put together, the conclusions are inescapable: Without human activities the planet would not have warmed over the past century. When scientists include all of the effects that humans have had on the climate system, they can match them with these many independent and varied observations. Our best assessment is therefore that humans, at least the ones responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions, have been responsible for all of the recent trends in global temperatures.The forensics have spoken, and we are to blame.Gavin Schmidt is a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.
461	3	Anxiety over climate change is prompting more and more people to reconsider having children, a new study has revealed.Researchers from the University of Arizona interviewed 24 people between 18 and 35 who said climate change played an important role in deciding whether to have kids. They also analysed reader comments on articles about this topic.The researchers' findings indicated three key themes were evident in both online comments and interviews: overconsumption, overpopulation, and future uncertainty.Many participants believed if they had more than two children, it would be problematic and selfish because they felt they would be 'over-replacing' themselves or their partner. Interviewees frequently expressed they would feel guilty or were morally wrong if they had a child in a world with such an uncertain future if climate change remained uncontrolled. But while many participants were uncomfortable with the climate future, it was balanced with some expressions of hope, the study found. According to the study, some people felt their children and future generations could help manage and make a positive impact when it comes to climate change. Some saw adoption as a more responsible choice, as it was viewed as a more low-carbon alternative. Lead author of the study, Sabrina Helm, said the study also uncovered a bigger picture of how climate change impacts overall mental health.She said many participants were angered and frustrated because some family members and friends would not take their climate change concerns seriously. Helm said several people close to them might dismissively tell them they will change their minds about having children.
528	1	"Science Reporter, NZ HeraldClimate change has already made summer longer in some parts of the country, where heat extremes have been playing out in ways more typical of the Mediterranean. That's according to a just published analysis that's used a new measure to document previously unobserved changes - and warns that we need to urgently rethink how we define ""extreme heat"" in our fast-warming world.Along with finding that summer seasons have effectively been growing in certain places, Kiwi climate scientist Dr Luke Harrington's new paper has also turned up some heatwaves that earlier went unrecognised.With its relatively cool, temperate climate, New Zealand has been one of many higher latitude countries thought to be less threatened by extreme heat driven by global warming, which is predicted to lift our temperature by several degrees this century.Harrington argued this had meant metrics to gauge impacts of extreme heat here haven't kept pace with wider improvements in how heatwaves are defined.Harrington, a research fellow in climate extremes at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, saw a particular flaw in using 25C as a catch-all threshold for extreme heat.""Yet that is precisely what the vast majority of reports commissioned for the government and local councils in recent years have focused on.""In New Zealand, 25C is formally defined as a ""hot day"" and purportedly stems from the claim that beef and dairy cattle start experiencing heat stress at temperatures above it, rather than any wider impacts on human health.Part of the reason we haven't looked closer at this metric much, Harrington argued, was that most of us thought we'd never really experience temperatures hot enough to produce negative impacts - particularly compared with Australia next door.Yet ""extreme"" was a relative concept - and there was ample evidence from overseas that people were adapted to the temperatures they were familiar with.""For example, people have been hospitalised or even died from extreme heat in cool places like Finland, Stockholm or even Sheffield,"" he said.""This is exposure to temperatures which, while relatively hot, might be considered normal summer weather to someone living in Sydney.""In his paper, Harrington began looking at past hot years using 25C metric and found three years in the last 40 - 1998/99, 2007/08 and 2012/13 - where that threshold was crossed in many regions, over more than three months of the year.""Of course, when some major farming regions like Waikato experience a full summer of 'extreme heat' three times within 15 years, questions are raised as to how well the threshold even represents heat stress in livestock,"" he said.""Also, because of the nature of the threshold, it was hard to figure out which of these three years were more extreme.""But when he applied a different metric, gauging relative heat, he found that 1998/99 was by far the most anomalous year on record, followed by 2012/13 and then 2007/08.""My new metric works by digging into what temperatures we might expect in a specific part of New Zealand and for a specific time of year,"" he said.""But rather than asking a binary yes-no question of whether some chosen threshold is exceeded during a spell of hot weather, this new approach instead quantifies how severe these temperatures were, relative to what we are familiar with in this part of the country at this time of year.""By removing the binary nature of the index, he said, we can better compare the relative differences, such as those between three different heatwaves which might all exceed some absolute temperature threshold.That was crucial, given our notion of ""extreme"" heat under climate change remained heavily context-specific.""If temperatures stayed above 10C all winter in Te Puke, for example, that would fit the bill as an extreme event for a kiwifruit grower there,"" he said.""We also shouldn't be surprised, then, if the temperatures needed for a dairy cow to suffer heat stress will differ from that of a human, or if someone living in Hawke's Bay has a higher tolerance for experiencing a week of temperatures above 35C than someone from Westport.""It might also be the case that there are no bad effects for anyone in New Zealand experiencing a few summer days in the mid-30s.""But the fact is we don't really know, because we haven't properly examined the chain from unusual temperatures to impacts before,"" he said.""My concern is, what happens in the summer of 2030, when we have a week-long spell of temperatures approaching 40C in Auckland or Hamilton?""Sure, this will fit the hot day criteria of 'above 25C'. But that doesn't help us understand what the impacts would be, which is the entire point of these metrics being developed.""On the basis of overseas work, we could speculate that people will be hospitalised and some will even die because of the heat. But we can't yet provide any more detail than that, which is troubling.""Fascinatingly, Harrington's analysis threw up some heatwaves from the past that had never been defined as such.""I wanted to find events from our recent past which ticked the box using multiple heatwave criteria, and hence will be the best candidates to try and understand what the impacts of past heatwaves looked like.""The two most promising events were found in March 1999 and January 2018 - a month that went down as New Zealand's hottest on record, amid our warmest ever summer.Harrington also compared how the number of extreme hot days in each month had changed between the 1980s and 2010s, a period that saw about 0.5C of global warming.He found that February showed the most striking changes, with a more than five-fold increase in relative measures of extreme heat across the country.More worryingly, November and March also show pronounced increases over Waikato and Otago, which meant an effective lengthening of the summer.""Heat extremes are worsening faster than mean temperatures in these regions - this is the first time such changes have been seen in New Zealand observations,"" he said.""This behaviour is actually more typical of the changes being seen in the Mediterranean, and suggests drying soils might be making hot days even hotter.""But I stress though that these results are preliminary, and a lot more research is needed to get understand the details of what is going on.""His paper ultimately put forward several new ways to analyse extreme heat in cool climates like New Zealand, in addition to the one approach used already.""But the key point is that no single metric will do a good job of capturing the full range of temperature-related impacts as our climate becomes increasingly unfamiliar over the next few decades.""Depending on the scenario, the number of Kiwis over the age of 75 would quadruple by the end of the century, while global temperatures will also continue to rise.Both these trends increased the risks of extreme heat facing Kiwis.""If we walk into this future without having a range of approaches - each of them tailored to understand how extreme heat will impact our people, our livestock and our horticultural industries separately - then we are walking down the road blindfolded."""
711	3	The deadly landslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone on Monday morning was undoubtedly partly the result of deforestation. During the rainy season, Sierra Leone is one of the wettest places on earth, statistically. And from that point of view, it is a surprise that such disasters don’t happen more often.It looks as though the changing climate may make the future risk even greater as more frequent and more violent rainy season events such as this are a measurable consequence.In tropical Africa, much of the seasonal rain comes from thunderstorms and often these cluster together, creating mesoscale convective systems (MCS). In simple terms, these are arcs of giant thunderstorms that can cover half a country.Since the start of satellite observations, these have been observed and recorded with rather more reliability than is possible over the sparsely populated area of the Sahel. The systems grow and and move to the west, usually leaving West Africa trough Guinea or Sierra Leone. (Tellingly they are the start of most Atlantic hurricanes.)You may be surprised to hear that African thunderstorms are among the most intense on earth. That finding came from a scientific paper published in 2006, a study using a worldwide database. A more recent investigation has found that the number of these storms has increased in sub-Saharan Africa, by a factor of three, since 1982.That latter conclusion came from another scientific paper, published this year, discovering evidence that looks like a clear link to a warming climate. It is a well-established expectation that temperatures will rise, as a global average, and that local variations will be vastly different.That leads to an increase in the energy available for hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and simple rain showers. We see and measure this change. However, in sub-Saharan Africa and particularly in the Sahel, the change has been more dramatic.The Sahara Desert has heated up as predicted with a warming globe but the edge of the desert, the Sahel, during the wet season, has not. As a result, the temperature gradient from desert to tropics is now steeper. It is differences in temperature that cause weather – they create a reason for air to move.And as you cannot change the laws of physics, the resulting thunderstorms, grouped as mesoscale convective systems, now have more vigorous construction. They also have the necessary shear in wind direction and strength within the thunderheads to create an efficient up- and downdraught circulation.This increase in the intensity of these major storm systems looks like a result of climate change. The climate forecast sees the Sahara warming more which leads directly to a future of more intense rainfall events, especially in the Sahel. Resultant devastating flooding and landslides will become more common.

225	4	"A new tool for schools will help children understand how to live with climate change, and also how they can make a difference.  Climate Change Minister James Shaw and Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced Sunday that texts, videos and guidance for teachers will be available to all schools, following a pilot programme at Christchurch's South New Brighton School in 2018. Climate Change - prepare today, live well tomorrow, would help students understand the effects of climate change on a local, national and global scale, Hipkins said. ""Young people have shown us how important this topic is for them, and there's been a lot of interest in the development of this resource.  READ MORE: * Lessons in catastrophe: How schools can help take the fear out of climate change * Please Miss, can you teach us about climate change? * We asked about climate change coverage and got 15,000 responses * No time to delay on adapting to climate change It explains the role science plays in understanding climate change, aids understanding of both the response to it and its impacts – globally, nationally and locally – and explores opportunities to contribute to reducing and adapting to its impact on everyday life."" South New Brighton School teacher Melanie Field said there was a lot of discussion in the coastal community about sea level rise and climate change when the pilot was introduced. At the start, many children were uncertain and fearful about the impacts of climate change, she said. As well as providing information, the pilot also addressed the emotional side of things. ""Doing the programme, they could see there were things they could do to help slow climate change and things that other countries had done to adapt to climate change. So they saw it wasn't all over – there are things that we can do."" The year 7 and 8 pupils who took part in the pilot set individual goals. Some chose to mostly walk or bike to school, while others became vegetarian, Field said. At a teachers' course she attended, Field said some of her colleagues had been ""crying out"" for a climate change teaching resource. Having one rolled out nationwide would be beneficial, she said. ""The more children know about it, the more they can be positive about their future - they can make the changes that are needed."" ""Children today are understandably growing up worried about how climate change will affect their lives. They see the simple fact that every year they have been alive has been one of the hottest record and they expect us to act,"" Shaw said. ""Our zero carbon legislation is an important framework for lasting change, but its success depends on all of us working every single day to take the ambitious action we need. Making this resource available means children will be able learn about what we have done to the planet, its potential impacts and what they can to help us solve the problem. ""Following a positive evaluation, the ministry funded further development to make it applicable to all New Zealand Schools. The wellbeing element of the programme was also strengthened to recognise the strong emotions and reactions people experience when learning about climate change."" The resource is designed for level 4 (years 7-10) of the New Zealand Curriculum. It adds to existing curriculum resources that focus on national identity, Sustainability Development Goals, sustainable economies and personal and environmental wellbeing.  "
557	4	Here are seven ways of understanding the IPCC’s newest climate warning.1. There is no shortage of scary facts in the major new report on climate change and land, a summary of which was released today by a United Nations–led scientific panel. Chief among them: For everyone who lives on land, the planet’s dangerously warmed future is already here. Earth’s land has already warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the industrial revolution, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That’s the same amount of warming that climate activists are hoping to prevent on a global scale.This spike makes sense, scientifically: Land warms twice as fast as the planet overall. Earth as a whole has warmed by only 0.87 degrees Celsius (1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) during the same period. But this increase makes the stakes of climate change clear: When scientists discuss preventing “1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming,” they are really talking about forestalling 3 degrees Celsius—or 5.1 degrees Fahrenheit—of higher land temperatures.And land temperatures are what humanity usually cares about. Land, really, is what humanity cares about. That’s the point.2. If the report has an overarching theme, it’s that land is extremely scarce, we need it for everything, and we are already using most of it. More than 70 percent of the planet’s ice-free land is already shaped by human activity, the report says. As trees are felled and farms take their place, this human-managed land emits about a quarter of global greenhouse-gas pollution every year, including 13 percent of carbon dioxide and 44 percent of the super-warming but short-lived pollutant methane.But unlike other sources of pollution—such as the burning of fossil fuels, which must be quickly reduced globally—land can’t just be shut down. It must be made into a tool in the climate fight. The report’s more than 100 authors, hailing from 51 countries, say that this will require immediate action from farmers, bankers, conservationists, and policy makers worldwide. And to really succeed, it will require hundreds of millions of affluent people in the Northern Hemisphere to change their diet, eating many more plants and much less meat—and especially much less red meat—than they do now.These changes must happen fast, because land problems have a pesky way of metastasizing. Louis Verchot, a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and an author of the new report, described the cascading consequences of warmer air temperatures at a press conference this week.“As the biosphere gets warmer, we increase evaporation,” he said. “And as we increase evaporation, ecosystems dry out and burn when they normally wouldn’t do that. And when soils get dry due to increased evaporation, we get longer heat waves.” And longer heat waves, of course, make the biosphere warmer still, starting the cycle again.Around much of the world, this cascade has already begun. Heat waves worldwide have gotten longer, hotter, and more common, according to the IPCC. Deserts are expanding toward the poles, while zones of colder weather are shrinking. Dust storms are kicking up more often. And evidence suggests that every year from 1961 to 2013, an additional 1 percent of the world’s drylands slipped into drought.As I said, there are a lot of scary facts here.3. Yet one fact—maybe the most important idea in the report—didn’t frighten me so much as leave me awestruck. It comes early in the document: “People currently use one quarter to one third of land’s potential net primary production for food, feed, fiber, timber and energy.”It’s a lot of jargon. But here’s what it means. Recall from high-school biology that primary production is the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Besides the tiny creatures that live in deep-sea heat vents and other extreme environments, all life on Earth derives its energy from the sun. You and I don’t get our energy directly from photosynthesis, but we eat plants—or things that ate plants—that do. Every major food chain on Earth begins with a plant, somewhere, humbly transfiguring photons into sugar.This is the net primary production that the IPCC alludes to. It’s saying that the human demand for food, meat, clothes, and warmth now consumes at least 25 percent of the net product of photosynthesis on land. The free-wheeling, far-reaching maw of our material metabolism—that thing we normally call the global economy—devours as many as one out of every three sugar molecules made by dirt-bound plants, on net. Plants are one of the few things in the universe that can work this magic, as far as we know. And we have roughly hooked one out of every four of them into our planetary system of consumption and speculative exchange.Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what’s happening nowThis isn’t scary, necessarily, but it is strange. Whatever that kind of arrangement is, it doesn’t seem constrained by economics or agriculture or ecology. And this is the most daunting aspect of the new report. For the scientific community, this document is a milestone because it assumes that land is scarce and precious. Climate researchers, for decades, have sometimes talked about land as if it is a limitless global sponge capable of cleaning the worst mess in human history. A recent high-profile study, for instance, cheerfully suggested soaking up most of the planet’s carbon pollution by planting 1.2 trillion trees across 2.2 billion acres worldwide. It was impressive research, but it was immediately sold to the public as The Solution to Climate Change. And there’s a problem with that. Those 2.2 billion acres—an area roughly the size of the continental United States—are already in use. They comprise, in large part, the planet’s most productive farmland! And in the decades to come, that farmland is going to be very useful if we hope to feed the 9.8 billion people who will soon reside on the planet.4. In some ways, this is the most unavoidably political document that the IPCC has ever published. Its report last year, on the dangers of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, called for an unprecedented transformation in the globe’s energy system. It demanded a rapid switch to carbon-free energy systems. But talking about the energy system is, in this context, relatively easy. No one’s ever gone to war over electric cars or renewable portfolio standards. But land is different. It is home, and the possibility of home. The relationship between people and land is the most treasured and unresolved idea in global politics. As the IPCC says, land “provides the principal basis for human livelihoods and well-being, including the supply of food, freshwater and multiple other ecosystem services, as well as biodiversity.” Another authority put it like this: “Cursed is the ground for thy sake … By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.” Chemically speaking, of course, we are mostly water. But everything we love about ourselves is solid, and therefore made of land.Accordingly, everyone has opinions about it. Somewhat notoriously in climate circles, the final summary of every IPCC report is written by the world’s worst committee process. Over a marathon five days, the lead scientific authors sit at the front of a room and painstakingly read every line of the document to every national delegation that cares to attend. At any time, any delegation can more or less raise any issue with any word, and before the report can be published, every country’s delegation must acquiesce to it in full. Historically, oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia use this process to raise one concern after another, bogging down the proceedings and effectively excising the strongest language from the final document.But the process this time, which took place in Geneva, unfolded differently. The world’s developing countries might normally raise a few issues with the IPCC’s initial proposed language. For this report, they asked for changes to line after line, according to Doreen Stabinsky, an environmental-politics professor at the College of the Atlantic who observed the talks.“A lot of countries want to make sure that they see themselves, and their specific interests and issues, in every single paragraph,” she told me this week. “Land is something that’s so local. People come with the land and food-security issues in their country. You can tell people in the room care really deeply about these questions, but it has made things incredibly slow. There’s also some really complex political issues at the center.”The biggest of these issues: Land can’t really multitask.5. Nearly every American knows what our peculiar national grid of farm and field looks like. During a drive across the Midwest, it rolls past, flipbook-like: field-field-road, field-field-road. During a coast-to-coast flight, it unfurls outside the plane window like a vast Cartesian quilt, lines meeting lines at right angles, circles of irrigation locked within squares. This grid system, formally known as the Public Land Survey System, covers much of the land outside the 13 original colonies.What every American may not realize is that this grid gives us a great advantage when thinking about area. Each of those grid squares is about one square mile. The Earth’s total land surface is about 52 million square miles. So we only get 52 million grid squares to work with as a species. While 52 million squares may seem like quite a lot, consider that each of them is worth incommensurately more than $1. At some point in the past, $52 million might have seemed like quite a lot of money. But now it cannot buy a 10-foot sculpture of an orange balloon dog.These 52 million grid squares cannot only service our needs. They are all the land, period. They must also hold the vast, lovely, unknowable thing that we call nature—every shady spot, every mountain stream, every sand dune. (The IPCC authors call this, somewhat dryly, “biodiversity and ecosystem services.”) Every grain of rice and cobalt mine, every sidewalk square and platypus, has to be somewhere on that 52 million.Read: California’s wildfires are 500 percent larger due to climate changeThese were the “really complex political issues” at the center of the IPCC talks. “Land can’t, at the same time, feed people, and grow trees to be burned for bioenergy, and store carbon,” Stabinsky said. “That conflict of what’s going to take priority as we face greater and greater climate challenges” defined the talks, she said. “There’s going to be more and more desire to try to use land to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, and that’s going to interfere with food production.”In a way, this process previewed the more consequential negotiations—and, God forbid, conflict—to come. And the report tries to anticipate some of these. The authors conclude that some land must be used to remove carbon from the atmosphere through a process called BECCS, or bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration. BECCS involves growing vegetation, burning it for energy, capturing the exhaust before it reaches the atmosphere, and burying both the exhaust and the charcoal underground. But very little land should be used for this, the report says. Otherwise it will start to induce food shortages in poor countries.6. Even if the authors mumble about the future, they can clearly denounce the present crisis: That system of 52 million is already badly damaged.The planet’s land absorbs carbon pollution today only because of a great “natural subsidy,” said Louis Verchot, the report co-author. The 70 percent of ice-free land surface managed by people actually produces five gigatons of greenhouse gases a year. The remaining land surface—the 30 percent in nature’s control—sucks up 11 gigatons. So while the land surface absorbs about six gigatons of carbon on net, this has nothing to do with people.“The land is out of balance in areas that we are managing,” Verchot said. “The biosphere is offsetting the carbon emissions, but that’s not a reason to call the land in balance.” He called this absorption an “additional gift of nature,” but it may be more apt to call it the final gift of nature. And at some point in the coming century—as more forests are felled and as demand for beef grows—this gift could become a curse, and the land will spew greenhouse gases into the air as ferociously as humanity does today.Even before that reversal, this report confirms that the ill effects of climate change will arrive faster than scientists once thought. Under 1.5 degrees Celsius of planetary warming, Earth will face a high risk of food shortages, mass thirst, and rampant wildfires. Remember that land warms faster than the planet: A 1.5-degree-Celsius-warmer world would in fact be 3 degrees Celsius, or 5.1 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter on land.Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at NASA and an author of the report, warned this week of “multiple bread-basket failure,” in which crops die across several major agricultural regions at the same time. She noted that crops in Europe had already suffered this summer under successive heat waves. Farmers in the midwestern United States, meanwhile, have been hammered by spring and early-summer floods.Avoiding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming is a very aspirational if. While it’s not too late to stop our current course, humanity must put in extraordinary effort to hold warming to such a manageable level. If every car, pipeline, and power plant around today were allowed to keep operating until it broke down, and no other new fossil-fuel infrastructure was built, they would still lock in enough carbon emissions to shoot Earth well past 1.5 degrees of warming, according to a recent study.At the same time, climate policy may do more than we realize. Timothy Searchinger, a land scientist at Princeton who was not involved in the new report, told me that the IPCC may undercount the benefits of land policy specifically. The panel does not always assume that farmers, for instance, will get better at capturing carbon if paid to do so, even though technology almost always improves in such circumstances, he said.Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisisBut on our current trajectory—and on any trajectory, frankly, where the United States does not adopt a serious climate policy—it’s far more likely that the planet will warm at least 3 degrees Celsius (5.1 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. That means that average land temperatures will be 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than they are today.The IPCC warns that people who live on such a planet will face a “very high risk” of famine, water scarcity, and mass vegetation die-offs. Some of the people who will see that planet have already been born.7. Let’s return to that one astonishing fact: that humans have integrated as much as one-third of photosynthesis on land into the global economy. This statistic captures not only the rice or broccoli or carrots on your plate, but the coffee in your mug, the cotton fiber in your socks, the oak heartwood in your kitchen table, and the linseed oil in your linoleum floor.What’s incredible about this fact is not only the scale of economic production that it entails. It’s that photosynthesis isn’t even the energetic part of the economy. What we call “the energy sector” still mostly consists of fossil fuels: oil, coal, and natural gas. Those three fuels generated 80 percent of the energy used in the United States in 2017, at least by a traditional accounting. Of course, fossil fuels are themselves just concentrated sunlight: The Permian oil basin in Texas is so named because it holds the gloopy product of photosynthesis made during the Permian period, more than 251 million years ago. And there’s a view of climate change as a massive spending spree, the end result of humanity spending down its 600-million-year inheritance.But that’s not my point. To address climate change, we will need to reduce our use of fossil fuels, and replace energy generated in the past (by long-dead plants) with energy generated today (by wind turbines, solar panels, and uranium atoms). But, this report adds: We must do all that in a house of only 52 million rooms, the majority of which already serve as someone’s bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen. And those 52 million rooms must stage not only the unending drama of the human family, but also—as far as we know—every other living thing in the universe.How are you even supposed to talk about that? More than 30 years after climate change first became a political issue, it feels like we are still figuring it out. This report gets us closer. It makes clear that climate change isn’t only about coal-fired power plants, or gas-guzzling cars; and it’s definitely not about littering or—God help us—recycling. It’s about the profound chemical and physical specificity of human life. You and I are not free-floating minds that move around the world through text messages, apologetic emails, and bank deposits. We are carbon-based creatures so pathetic that we need a lot of silent plants to make carbon for us. Climate change requires us to alter the biogeochemical organism that we call the global economy on the fly, in our lifetimes. Such a task should command most of the time and attention of every economist, agriculturalist, investor, executive, and politician—anyone who fancies themselves a leader in the physical workings of the economy, or whatever we call it. It is our shame, and theirs, that they don’t.
830	5	A court in The Hague has upheld a historic legal order on the Dutch government to accelerate carbon emissions cuts, a day after the world’s climate scientists warned that time was running out to avoid dangerous warming.Appeal court judges ruled that the severity and scope of the climate crisis demanded greenhouse gas reductions of at least 25% by 2020 – measured against 1990 levels – higher than the 17% drop planned by Mark Rutte’s liberal administration.The ruling – which was greeted with whoops and cheers in the courtroom – will put wind in the sails of a raft of similar cases being planned around the world, from Norway to New Zealand and from the UK to Uganda.Marjan Minnesma, the director of the Urgenda campaign which brought the case, called on political leaders to start fighting climate change rather than court actions.What is it?Climate litigation is a ​new weapon for environmentalists who are turning to the courts in an attempt to hold governments and corporations to account for the environmental damage they cause. Advocates aim to use the law to force stronger government action to cut carbon emissions, and win damages from the companies responsible to cover the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming.Who is involved?There are hundreds of cases in the pipeline around the globe from India to Uganda; Ireland to Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. The UK government is facing its first major brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. But it is in the US, the world’s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought, with Arnold Schwarzenegger the latest to confirm he was preparing a lawsuit.Could it save the planet?To date victories are rare​, but campaigners say wins are more likely in future, as public opinion – and the attitudes of judges – shift with the times. A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has already pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But big oil is fighting back hard, with allegations of a politically motivated conspiracy against them. She said: “The special report of the IPCC emphasises that we need to reduce emissions with much greater urgency. The Dutch government knows that as a low-lying country, we are on the frontline of climate change. Our own government agencies recently concluded that in the worst case scenario sea levels might rise by 2.5 to 3 metres by the end of the century. The court of appeal’s decision puts all governments on notice. They must act now, or they will be held to account.”Jesse Klaver, the leader of the Dutch Greens welcomed the decision as “historic news”. He told the Guardian: “Governments can no longer make promises they don’t fulfil. Countries have an obligation to protect their citizens against climate change. That makes this trial relevant for all other countries.”The Dutch government must now decide whether to appeal to the Netherlands’ supreme court, or explain how it will nearly double the entire amount of greenhouse gas emission cuts it has made since 1990 within one year.One of two newly opened coal plants would have to be shut down to comply with the original court ruling, according to a report by CE Delft in 2016.Government sources did not immediately respond to requests for comment but an appeal is thought likely. However, legal sources cautioned that its success was far from assured, given the conservative nature of two courts in The Hague which had now ruled for the Urgenda campaign, and its 886 citizen co-litigants.State lawyers had argued that the judges were “sidelining democracy” by trying to force a policy change but the court found government proposals “unacceptable” in a stinging and wide-ranging judgement that leaned heavily on the European Convention of Human Rights.“Climate change is a grave danger,” ruled Judge Tan de Sonnaville. “Any postponement of emissions reductions exacerbates the risks of climate change. The Dutch government cannot hide behind other countries’ emissions. It has an independent duty to reduce emissions from its own territory.”Rutte’s administration has pledged to reduce emissions by 49% by 2030, but in nearly three decades, the country has so far only cut its emissions by 13%. Since 2012, that figure has barely changed, despite a court ruling for the 25% cut three years ago.Paul van der Zanden, a spokesman for the Netherlands’ economic affairs and climate ministry said: “A possible appeal by the Dutch government will not interfere with the execution of the the Hague court of appeal’s verdict made today. The Dutch government is fully committed to execute this verdict.”Van der Zanden added that a 25% emissions cut by 2020 was “feasible” and said that the Dutch environmental assessment agency would deliver an update on the outlook for doing so next spring.Dennis van Berkel, the legal counsel for Urgenda, which brought the case, told the Guardian that the ruling “has consequences for all governments. They should look at this closely and realise that they are not acting in the interests of their own people. By delaying [climate] actions and not increasing them to the highest possible level – they are violating the rights of their people.”
694	4	"China has a chance to assert leadership of a global plan to combat global warming this week at the first UN climate talks since US President Donald Trump decided to quit the 195-nation Paris Agreement.Government experts are to work on a 'rule book' for the 2015 climate pact at the November 6-17 annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. The accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to wind, solar and other clean energies.Mr Trump once dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax to harm the US economy and said in June that he would pull out of the agreement and instead promote US coal and oil. A formal US withdrawal will take until 2020.No other nation has followed his lead. US influence is likely to wane compared to other big greenhouse emitters led by China, the European Union and India, even though Washington will still have a place at the table in Bonn.""The rest of the world, including all major emerging economies, has made it clear that it is committed to the Paris Agreement,"" Maldives Environment Minister Thor Abraham, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS), told Reuters.China, on track to beat its goal of a peak in carbon emissions in 2030, seems best placed to step up leadership of an agreement largely designed by Washington under former President Barack Obama, many delegates say.The meeting ""will be a great free advertisement for China"", one European environment minister said. And Beijing plans to launch a nationwide carbon market this year, albeit delayed from the first half.""The results [in Bonn] will prove that this process has certainly not stopped,"" China's top climate official, Xi Zhenhua, told a news conference last week. He expressed hopes that Washington will end up staying in the Paris pact.Adding urgency, 2017 is set to be the second warmest on record, behind 2016, according to NASA. And 2017 has had weather extremes of hurricanes, floods and drought-fuelled wildfires.Fiji will preside at the Bonn talks, the first small island nation to do so in more than two decades of UN climate negotiations. That may give OASIS, at risk from rising seas, unprecedented influence."
518	4	"The Reserve Bank of Australia has been urged to 'mobilise all forces' to save the economy from a disaster induced by climate change. Photo / APThe Reserve Bank of Australia has been urged to ""mobilise all forces"" to save the economy from a disaster induced by climate change.The world's most powerful banks have issued a warning that climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis.In an expansive new report, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) told its members they had to start including climate change in their thinking about the stability of the economy.The BIS, the Switzerland-based international body comprised of more than 50 of the world's most influential central banks, including Australia's Reserve Bank (RBA), warned the RBA could be forced into rescuing the economy and the environment.The RBA may have to buy up coal mines and fossil fuel power stations to reduce the economic impact.During the global financial crisis some central banks intervened to save private banks and insurance firms as part of a program to protect the economy.The BIS said this could be the template used in the case of climate change.""In the worst-case scenario, central banks may have to confront a situation where they are called upon by their local constituencies to intervene as climate rescuers of last resort,"" it said.The BIS warned that economic models mapping out possible climate change scenarios were ""inherently incapable"" of dealing with the many overlapping forces that would lead to a lower-emissions economy.""Fundamentally, climate-related risks will remain largely uninsurable or unable to be hedged as long as system-wide action is not taken,"" the BIS said.It urged central bankers to ""be more proactive"" in pushing governments on the transition to a greener economy, while also urging governments to steer financial institutions and businesses towards accounting for climate-related risks in their investment decisions.It comes as four of Australia's leading international aid organisations have urged the Morrison Government to take major climate change action amid the country's bushfire crisis.World Vision Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia and Save the Children Australia have joined forces to issue a plea for stronger climate measures.The group wants more ambitious emission reduction targets to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, warning many countries will face unmanageable suffering and devastation if more isn't done.""The time for debate about climate change is over, it is now time for action. We cannot afford to waste any more time,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday.The organisations have called on Australia to demonstrate strong leadership on climate action and transition to a low-emissions global economy, support reforestation programs and build the capacity of vulnerable communities in Australia and overseas to deal with the ravages of climate change.The four charities have called for the Coalition government to sign the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action.""Our organisations acknowledge that this issue is so pressing, we must advocate in alliance to amplify the voices of the world's most vulnerable people,"" the joint statement says.The Australian arms of World Vision, Oxfam, Plan and Save the Children describe climate change as a human rights issue impacting on health and an adequate standard of living.""Every day, our aid workers see the very real and devastating impact of climate change on the world's most vulnerable people,"" the aid alliance says.The group pointed to a food crisis in southern African, severe floods in Indonesia and a 2018 deadly cyclone in Mozambique.""Now the climate emergency has well and truly arrived at home, too,"" the alliance continued.""Australians are suffering through the devastating ongoing fallout from our worst fire season on record, with dozens of lives, thousands of homes and more than a billion creatures lost.""Fires continue to rage and millions are breathing in hazardous air across three states."" Climate action has been brought into sharp focus by Australia's deadly bushfires with the issue sparking tensions within the coalition."
721	4	"If climate change continues at its current pace, deadly heatwaves could make large parts of South Asia too hot for human survival by the end of the century, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) warned on Wednesday.""The most intense hazard from extreme future heat waves is concentrated around the densely populated agricultural regions of the Ganges and Indus river basins,"" wrote the authors of the study.

However, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances, that figure could rise to as much as 70 percent unless major efforts are taken to curb climate-warming carbon emissions.""Climate change is not an abstract concept, it is impacting huge numbers of vulnerable people,"" said MIT professor Elfatih Eltahir. ""Business as usual runs the risk of having extremely lethal heat waves.""'Wet-bulb temperatures'Unlike previous climate change and temperature projections, the MIT study also looked at humidity and the body's ability to cool down, as well as heat levels. The three factors make up what's called a ""wet-bulb temperature,"" which is measured by recording the temperature of the air when a wet cloth is wrapped around the thermometer. Climate scientists use this measurement to estimate how easily water can evaporate.According to climate scientists, humans can survive a wet-bulb temperature of about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), while anything beyond could cause the body to have difficulty sweating to cool down. Such a phenomenon could lead to heat stroke or even death within just a few hours.Putting the research findings into perspective, wet bulb temperatures have so far rarely exceeded the already hazardous level 31 degrees Celsius.It is hard to imagine conditions that are too hot for people to survive for a more than a few minutes, but that is exactly what is being discussed in this paper,"" Chris Field, a Stanford University climate scientist who was not involved in the study, told the Associated Press news agency. ""And of course, the danger threshold for punishing heat and humidity is lower for people who are ill or elderly.""Read more: Global warming is reshaping the world's forestsSouth Asia's densely populated farming are likely to fare the worst; deforestation has left workers particularly exposed to the sun, while the rural surroundings leave little chance of people having access to electricity and air conditioning units.As recently as 2015, a heat wave across India and Pakistan killed some 3,500 people.World's hottest regionThe study also predicts that the Gulf could become the world's hottest region by 2100, due to climate change. However, citizens in the region are significantly better off financially than those in the Ganges and Indus river basins, meaning they will be able to better respond to the risks posed by relentlessly blistering temperatures.The affected South Asia reasons also rely on crops and livestock, while the oil-rich Gulf region imports almost all of its food. Less developed medical infrastructure in the rural regions of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would also see diseases and infections flourish in the in the scorching temperatures, compounding the just how dangerous merely venturing outside could become in the coming decades. Cause for hopeIn the study, scientists also estimated wet-bulb temperatures under the scenario in which concerted action was taken was to limit global warming. Although temperatures would still reach dangerous levels of around 31 degrees Celsius - a level considered dangerous but significantly less fatal - the percentage of South Asia exposed to potentially fatal temperatures would increase from zero to just 2 percent.dm/jr (AP, Reuters, AFP)"
971	5	"This year, 2021, a number of things are coming together to help achieve a low-carbon future. In 25 years of reporting the environment patch I've never been so convinced that the world has the potential to change. It's about politics: recent bolder climate commitments from the UK, the EU, incoming American President Joe Biden and even China. It's about business: for the first time ever renewable energy investment will exceed that in fossil fuels. And it's about timing: a post-Covid recovery year running up to the global COP26 climate summit in November. But mostly it's about ideas - an eruption of climate change solutions. Applied human intelligence is the vaccine against climate change.I've been exploring 39 inspiring ideas - some already happening, some in development - and meeting the people behind the projects, who each put a big grin on my face. Here are five of the most intriguing: BladeBUG is a rectangular robot which crawls over turbine blades. Imagine a suitcase that sprouted six legs with suction cup feet. Having humans on site to look after marine turbines is risky and expensive, making up 40% of their overall lifetime cost. But drones will be able to carry BladeBUG to the offshore wind farm before it crawls over the tower and blades using sensors to detect damage or anything reducing its efficiency or lifespan. It can even fill and polish small defects itself. The International Energy Agency says offshore wind could deliver 18 times today's global electricity demand - and innovations like this will make it even more affordable and achievable. The BladeBUG will undergo commercial trials this year and plans to reach the market in 2022.Growing rice has a similar climate impact to flying - about 2-3% of global warming. Paddy fields are like giant marshlands emitting huge quantities of methane. Rothamsted Research, in Hertfordshire, has developed 'Direct Seeded Rice' (DSR) which doesn't need to be grown in a puddle so uses less water. The plant has also been bred to grow its first roots and shoots more rapidly which is vital for success in a conventional field system. It's crossed with existing high-yield varieties and initial results are promising. The water in paddy fields does help to suppress weeds and so this system could need more herbicide but the developers believe farm-ready seeds will be ready in a couple of years with most of the world's rice grown this way in a decade.  Every seven seconds the sustainable forests of Europe yield enough wood to build a four-person family home. Carbon is absorbed by the growing trunk, locked up in the house and then trees are replanted.Wooden construction also lessens the enormous carbon impacts of using concrete and steel.  Cross Laminated Timber - like a super-thick plywood - enables the use of wood for large areas of floors and walls. The French government has ruled that all new public buildings must be made from at least 50% timber and a 'plyscraper' race is under way with the 18-storey Mjosa Tower in Brumunddal, Norway the current winner. Around the world taller buildings are on the drawing board but in the UK, building regulation changes in response to the Grenfell Tower fire might limit the use of wood in tall buildings.  In deepest Siberia, Nikita Zimov runs Pleistocene Park. Populated by musk-ox, wild horses and bison, it's like Jurassic Park but with a friendlier crowd. He wants to protect the frozen ground from thawing and releasing carbon in rising temperatures, but to achieve that he says something that sounds like heresy: ""Here trees worsen climate change"". Arctic forest cover only arrived when humans killed most of the grazing animals including the now-extinct mammoth. As forests are a darker colour than snow-covered grassland, less of the sun's energy is reflected resulting in more ground heating. Grazing animals also trample the snow to a thin layer which allows the chill of the air to penetrate into the ground, rather than allowing a thick fluffy snow layer to insulate it. Nikita, and many supporters in Western universities, would like to see trees suppressed across a vast area of the tundra by mass introductions of grazing animals and some deliberate felling.For them, this would mean a re-wilding and potential re-cooling of the Arctic. The experimental park is 50 sq-miles (129.5 sq-km) but to have fuller impact he'd like it to be thousands of times bigger. The International Energy Agency says solar electricity is now being made more cheaply than any other method of production. But solar panels currently only convert around a fifth of the sun's energy that falls on them into electricity.Sunlight is made up of the spectrum you see in a rainbow and silicon, found in nearly all solar panels, is best at converting the red part into electricity. But UK-based company Oxford PV is combining silicon with a material called perovskite - a semi conductor mineral with a crystal structure of titanium calcium oxide - which turns the blue wavelengths into electrical energy. This chemical sandwich can increase the panels efficiency to 30-40%. They are going into production this year and expect early applications to be on rooftops where customers want to maximise the wattage from a confined area."
164	4	OPINION: The juggling act between taking genuine action towards Auckland’s climate change goals and nursing the council’s coronavirus-hit Emergency Budget should become clearer in the coming months. The annual process of setting the region’s public transport fares will be a real test for councillors on a crucial piece – which they control (almost) alone – of the climate change puzzle. Auckland’s freshly-agreed Climate Action Plan set a daunting interim target of halving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, with transport needing to deliver 68 per cent of the cuts. Part of making that happen, according to the plan, is trebling public transport’s share of trips made.

The price of hopping on a bus, train or ferry is not the only thing that drives up patronage, but it counts. Last year's relatively modest increase of 5-10 cents a trip on about half of the more commonly-taken shorter journeys was estimated by Auckland Transport to slow patronage growth by 555,000 trips. So with only 10 more annual fare decisions to be made before the 2030 emission reduction deadline is reached, each will be critical if such a dramatic increase in public transport use is to be achieved. Auckland Transport will pitch scenarios around fares to councillors in a couple of months at the start of the 2021 budget-setting process. It will do so in a scenario of a reduced budget for operating costs and softer patronage, running perhaps 10 per cent below a year ago, thought largely to be due to more people working from home. One trial carried out during the post-lockdown period was cutting off-peak fares by 30 per cent, taking the pressure off peak services while people were wary of close contact. Auckland Transport said it achieved a 10 per cent shift from peak to off-peak travel, a change which caught the attention of director Paula Rebstock at its June board meeting. If brought back permanently, it is a shift that would come at a cost – either through lost revenue or higher fares imposed on peak travellers to balance it out. Like most things, the cost might be easy to quantify, but the benefit – slowing the need to add additional buses to the city’s fleet – will be harder to promise. Additional buses will need to be the more costly electric ones if the city is to achieve its other goal of the bus fleet being entirely zero-emission by 2030. Patronage-boosting incentives have been rolling out thanks to decisions made before Covid-19 blew a forecast half billion dollar hole in council revenue. The most recent, from July 26, makes one-zone bus or train trips that connect with a ferry journey fare-free. The next, slightly increasing the discount for child fares, fell victim to the budget squeeze. These are just a few of the fiscal dilemmas both the governors of Auckland Transport and their political masters will have to grapple with before the wraps come off the fare decision in the new year. The other dilemma is an obvious one. Any patronage-boosting decision put off for another year will require a bigger commitment later. On major climate change curbing policy, such as tax rebates for buyers of electric vehicles, the council can point the finger at the government to make the big calls. While the government does co-fund the cost of public transport, taking full responsibility if needed for making fares cheaper is within the council’s power and ability – fiscally painful though that might be. A commitment to the bold goal of halving GHG emissions in a decade is one thing. Committing the money to do it is the next and real test.

The causes of climate change are everywhere, from the clothes you wear to the burger you eat -- but do you actually understand the basics? At CNN, we recently analyzed the most searched climate change questions on Google Trends; the results revealed that many people are still looking for fundamental answers. We've put together this list to help you learn more about our changing climate. What is climate change? The term, climate change is used to describe a long-term change in global temperatures and weather patterns. The earth's temperature has changed drastically in its 4.5 billion year history, from the Huronian Ice Age that covered vast portions of the planet in ice for nearly 300 million years, to a period about 50 million years ago, when scientists believe that palm trees and crocodiles were native above the Arctic Circle. Today, climate change is commonly used as a term to describe the effects of global warming that have occurred as a result of human activity following the industrial revolution in the 18th century. Why is climate change happening now, what are the causes? This is where it gets a little complicated. Earth's atmosphere is full of gases. Some gases, including nitrogen and oxygen -- that together accounts for 99% of the gas in the atmosphere do not absorb heat from the sun, allowing it to reflect back into space from the Earth's surface. Other gases, known as greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- absorb heat and make up roughly 0.1% of the atmosphere. When these gases absorb solar energy, they radiate it back towards the planet's surface and to other gas molecules, creating the greenhouse effect.  The greenhouse effect plays an important role in naturally regulating the temperature of our climate. Without it the Earth's average temperature would -18C. That's roughly the temperature of a domestic freezer.Since the industrial revolution the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been increasing as a result of human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation and modern farming practices. Which means more greenhouse effect, and more heating. A 2013 report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body of climate scientists, found that the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration had risen by 40% since the industrial revolution, resulting in earth's temperature increasing by 1C.What is the impact of climate change? The impact of climate change depends on how much the earth warms. In 2018, the IPCC released a stark report on the effects of a 1.5C temperature increase. These include more extreme weather conditions, sea-level rising, the destruction of coastal ecosystems, loss of vital species and crops, population displacement and a huge cost to the global economy.In 2018, the United Nations warned that without urgent action global temperatures are set to rise above 3C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. At that temperature the outlook begins to look even worse -- Entire cities could be swallowed by the rising oceans, species of plants and animals face extinction as their ecological systems fail to adapt to the heat, and hundreds of millions of people could be forced to migrate due to coastal flooding, longer-lasting draughts and depleting crop yields.   Is climate change real, or a hoax? Almost everyone now accepts that the global climate is changing. The biggest public debate -- fueled by high-profile climate skeptics like US President Donald Trump -- is around whether climate change is being caused by human activity. But various studies have shown that a vast majority of scientists agree climate change is real and caused by humans, with one finding that 97% of the world's scientists agree that human-caused global warming is happening. In 2014, 1,300 scientists from around the world contributed to a UN (IPCC) report on the scientific knowledge of climate change. Their report said there was a 95% chance that human activity in the past 50 years had directly resulted in increasing the temperature of the earth. Physical proof of global warming has been found across the globe, from glacial retreat high in the Himalayas, to coral bleaching in our oceans, to the regularity of extreme weather patterns. Can climate change be stopped? But there is hope. Climate change can be limited and halted but only if we take what the IPCC describes as ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.""To do this, two things need to happen. Firstly, we need to reverse 250 years of bad environmental habits. In December 2015, 195 countries agreed to a legally binding framework -- The Paris Agreement -- to achieve zero net carbon pollution by the end of the century. The immediate challenge is to slow down and limit global warming to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. A key aspect of this is to limit the human practices that create greenhouse gas emissions. That will mean changes to many aspects of our daily lives -- from our diets, to the way we travel and how we produce the products we all buy. The second, big challenge is reversing the effect of those practices by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is already in the atmosphere. There have been advances on this front, ranging from hi-tech carbon capture technologies, to simply planting more trees. But as of yet the IPCC has categorized the technology as ""unproven"" at a large enough scale to move the needle. "

While acknowledging the reality of global warming, the White House has opposed specific targets to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide – spewed by coal-fired power plants and petroleum-fuelled vehicles – arguing that this would hurt the US economy. Robert Cluck, the Republican mayor of Arlington, Texas, George Bush’s home state, said the US president’s failure to sign the Kyoto Protocol did not mean American cities could not take the lead on cutting emissions in their own backyards. Across the US, more than 700 mayors, representing 75 million Americans, have pledged to meet the standards proscribed by the Kyoto Protocol. Although his call for cutting emissions has not played well with “big oil” Republicans in Texas, Cluck, also a doctor, maintains that the state’s greenhouse gas emissions – the deadliest levels of carbon dioxide pollution in the US – are shameful, inexcusable and embarrassing.
149	5	The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming. By David Wallace-Wells. Tim Duggan Books; 320 pages; $27. Allen Lane; £20.CLIMATE CHANGE is a devilish problem for humanity: at once urgent and slow-moving, immediate and distant, real and abstract. It is a conundrum for writers, too. Relegating it to a human-interest story—a Bangladeshi displaced by rising sea levels, say—downplays its civilisation-wide significance; sticking to scary forecasts—200m climate refugees by 2050, the UN warns—diminishes its visceral relevance. That may be why, for all its existential gravity, the subject has yet to produce a great work of literature. It lends itself instead to dystopian science-fiction, or to compendiums of scary science facts, sometimes derided as “climate porn”. The latest in that genre, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, is unabashedly pornographic. It is also riveting.Mr Wallace-Wells, an editor at New York magazine, freely admits that he is not an environmentalist. He has never willingly gone camping, and rarely recycles. Nor is he an environmental reporter. He is a voyeur, seduced at first by stories that appeared allegorical—Arctic scientists trapped by melting ice on an island inhabited by polar bears, or a Russian boy killed by anthrax from a reindeer carcass uncovered by thawing permafrost.Yet, as the author makes starkly clear, global warming is no parable. Far from being a problem only for future generations, it is wreaking havoc now. Five of the 20 worst fires in California’s history blazed in 2017; the deadliest incinerated the town of Paradise last year. Floods are becoming wetter, droughts drier and hurricanes fiercer. Such calamities, Mr Wallace-Wells notes, are not the “new normal”; they mark “the end of normal”, as climate change tips Earth beyond the conditions that allowed humans to evolve in the first place. And that is with barely 1°C of man-made warming since the industrial revolution.Things will get much worse. The world is on course to become at least 3°C hotter than in pre-industrial times. Within a few decades, this could mean that temperatures in Mecca render the haj physically impossible for many of the 2m Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year. With a rise of 7°C— plausible if humanity remains wedded to fossil fuels—swathes of Earth’s equatorial band would become uninhabitable. Even if warming did not exceed 2°C, as stipulated in the Paris climate agreement of 2015, rising seas may engulf $1trn-worth of American property.“Numbers can numb,” Mr Wallace-Wells writes. Yet like fellow climate-porn addicts, he cannot resist piling statistic on dismal statistic. In the hands of a lesser writer, this litany of woe might have degenerated into one of the dry treatises on which he draws. But whereas his chapters—on the impacts of extreme weather, sea levels, human health, economic consequences and so on—echo reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, his elegant, accessible prose does not.He has a point when he says that exercising caution over warning signs is tantamount to complacency. Occasionally, however, he could exercise a bit more of it himself. For example, he acknowledges that humans are an adaptive species, then cites projections of lives lost to heatwaves, air pollution and the like, which typically do not factor in adaptation measures.He nevertheless gets the big things right. His insistence that electing leaders with climate-friendly policies matters immeasurably more than forgoing a plastic straw in your cocktail is surely correct. Yet he is perversely optimistic: because humans are responsible for the problem, they must be capable of undoing at least some of it, he thinks. If Americans’ carbon footprints matched those of average Europeans, the United States would emit less than half as much carbon as it does.The book does not dwell on the policies that might achieve such outcomes; it is more expository than prescriptive. Some readers will find Mr Wallace-Wells’s outline of possible futures alarmist. He is indeed alarmed. You should be, too.

18	4	"Whanganui students gather at the Virginia Lake punchbowl to protest climate inaction. Photo / Stuart MunroThe students' strike for climate change was an inspiration for those of us who have been struggling for years trying to get governments to understand how serious climate change is and to have the courage to do something.Governments need the guts to do something that may be unpopular, but they will be thanked for in the long term. It will be this Government's ""nuclear-free moment"".It is hard politically for a government to do something unpopular because it affects people now for something indefinite in the future. Getting everyone with different agendas to understand long term is not easy.This students' strike started with Greta Thunberg who sat on the Swedish Parliament's steps every day during school hours for nearly three weeks holding a sign ""school strike for climate"", which became noticed worldwide.I'm not sure why it has taken so long for students to realise they could have political influence. Hopefully it will convince those adults close to them that their inaction is ruining the future for the next generations.Most of us oldies won't be around when climate change gets a whole lot worse than the fires, droughts, sea inundations and storms currently occurring. Then again, looking at the past year's climate excesses, maybe we will be.Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest, which tended to mean the strongest, was once the most important criteria, but being adaptable and smart also comes into it.Being the smartest on the planet has also meant the survival rate of our species is higher through better food supplies, housing, transport and health, but these advantages are also leading to pressure on resources and causing climate change.Last year,  Earth overshoot day was sooner than ever, August 1, when we had used a year's ration of resources in seven months.We are treating Earth like some sort of Ponzi scheme, kidding ourselves we can pay the Earth back in the future. But all Ponzi schemes are prone to collapse, having provided short-term gains.The Antarctic ice sheet is perhaps the Earth's metaphorical warning of this collapse. But what is at the root of this resource wastage is human desire for more and more, which our current economic system encourages, as it only considers more growth as acceptable. The health of the planet doesn't seem to feature in the economic equation.Chief Seattle is said to have stated: ""When the last tree is felled, the last fish is eaten, the last river polluted, then eat your money"".As David Wallace-Wells wrote in the Listener a few weeks ago, we need to treat climate change as a critical issue needing immediate action.It could be seen as similar to how the Allies reacted in World War 2; they changed from ""business as usual"" to creating armaments to fight an obviously dangerous enemy.This is what we must do now, put all resources towards fighting climate change, as the result of not doing so is as calamitous, if not more so, than losing WW2.Our children must keep the pressure on, through more student strikes if necessary, the Government and their elders to make some sacrifices, really very little in the scheme of things, but potentially securing a future for our children.How many times have I heard ""I'd do anything for my kids""?Okay, the time is now. Tell our Government that we will support them to secure a future for our kids.It won't cost the Earth. Doing nothing will.• John Milnes is a Green Party candidate for three elections, founder member of Sustainable Whanganui, a parent and grandparent."
230	4	Boosted by a historic heatwave in Europe and unusually warm conditions across the Arctic and Eurasia, the average temperature of the planet soared to its highest level ever recorded in June.According to data released on Monday by NASA, the global average temperature was 0.93C above the June norm (based on a 1951-to-1980 baseline), easily breaking the previous June record of 0.82C above the average, set in 2016.The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets.Notably, 13 locations in France surpassed their highest temperature ever recorded.The heat wave’s highest temperature of 45.9C, posted in Gallargues-le-Montueux, was 1.8C above the old record, set during an infamous heat wave in July and August 2003.NASA is the second institution to confirm that it was Earth’s hottest June, as the Copernicus Climate Change Service had already determined that June 2019 was the warmest such month on record for Europe and globally.June featured unusually mild conditions in the Arctic, particularly in Greenland, where the melt season got off to an early start.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereJuly is picking up right where June left off.Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist based in Berkeley, California, tweeted that the month so far ranks as the hottest on record narrowly ahead of 2017, the previous record holder.“If this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth!” tweeted Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University.Like June, July has featured some notable high-temperature extremes, including in Nunavut, Canada, the northernmost permanently inhabited location on Earth.It hit a record high of 21C on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 20C.In addition, Alaska last week posted its hottest two days on record, highlighted by a temperature of 32.2C in Anchorage for the first time.The June monthly record and July’s toasty first half raises the odds that 2019 could make a run for a top-three finish for warmest year, rather than top five.According to data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, a trend that scientists have tied mainly to human emissions of greenhouse gases.Washington Post
21	3	"Auckland Council environment and community committee chair Penny Hulse said it was joining a number of cities globally who recognised urgent action was needed to address climate change. Photo / FileAuckland Council is taking urgent action to tackle climate change in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions and limit rising temperatures.The council's environment and community committee unanimously voted today to declare a climate emergency and make climate change a priority in all its decision-making.Committee chair councillor Penny Hulse said the move signalled the importance of an immediate national and global response to addressing climate change.Hulse said it was also a direct response to a range of residents and group who asked the council to improve the health of the environment and water and to do more to target climate change.Recent research revealed Auckland's mean temperature was rising, rainfall patterns were changing and the coastlines were being affected by the rising sea level.The effects of climate change were expected to get more serious over time, according to the research.The council was also committed to making sure the temperature did not rise more than 1.5C.Auckland mayor Phil Goff said action needed to be taken urgently to ensure future generations would not inherit a world devastated by global heating.""Scientists tell us that if we don't take action, the effects of heating will be environmentally and economically catastrophic.""In declaring an emergency, we are signalling the urgency of action needed to mitigate and adapt to the impact of rising world temperatures and extreme weather events.""As part of its commitment to reducing climate change, the council would continue to make climate change a key part of its programmes and decisions. This included putting climate change impact statements on all council committee reports.It would also continue to advocate for greater central government leadership and lead examples in monitoring and reducing the council's greenhouse gas emissions."
442	3	"Road planners in England have been accused of rigging accounting rules to disguise the climate impact of new roads.Environmentalists say the Department for Transport has under-counted CO2 from its road improvement programme. That's because the DfT measures emissions against national CO2 targets, whilst measuring benefits of a new road against the local economy.A Treasury spokesperson said this was a reasonable approach. But critics say the resulting calculation exaggerates the benefits of new roads, whilst downgrading the negatives in terms of carbon emissions. Chris Todd, director of pressure group Transport Action Network, told the BBC it proved the government has one rule for its Â£27bn road-building programme, and another rule for everything else.He said: âThis is like someone who's morbidly obese insisting they can gorge on another cream cake, because no single cake will have a 'material impact' on their well-being.âThe Treasury strongly rejects the allegation. A spokesperson said it made sense to measure the carbon emissions from new roads against the UKâs entire carbon budget, because climate change is a global problem, whereas smaller road schemes offer local benefits. But the objectors are motivated by a recent analysis from transport academic Phil Goodwin, an emeritus professor at University College London. He says the DfT should employ the same standard for measuring the negatives of the roads programme as it uses to measure the positives. âConsider,â he says, âif one calculated the total number of jobs generated by a specific scheme as a proportion of the total jobs in the economy.""âAny such calculation will always be open to words like âimmaterialâ or âinsignificant' - but this does not in the slightest prove that the aggregate effect really is unimportant.âProf Goodwin said the appraisal system made CO2 âuniquely unimportantâ. A recent consultantsâ report projected that the governmentâs roads programme will increase carbon emissions from the strategic road network by about 20 MtCO2, when they need to go down by about 167 MtCO2 to meet carbon targets.A Treasury spokesperson said: âWe reject this. The report is based on old project appraisals, and takes no account of our ambitious plans to decarbonise transport. âWe have assessed carbon impacts throughout the design of the roads programme using much more accurate methods, and expect the impact of new improvements to be around 0.27 million tonnes through to the end of 2032.âBut Prof Goodwin said the roads programme was still predicated on increased traffic, even though Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says we should be driving less.The government argues that the advent of electric cars will solve the CO2 problem on the roads. But its critics predict that the switch to 100% electric cars will come too late to meet CO2 targets. They also warn that battery cars take a huge toll on resources."

984	4	Climate change is a gradual process. If you simply measure air temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide or sea-ice thickness in any given year, you won’t be able to see the full picture of how the planet’s weather patterns are changing. That’s why graphs showing change over time can be such a powerful teaching resource to help students better understand climate trends.In this teaching resource, we have gathered 24 graphs previously published elsewhere in The New York Times that relate to climate change. In the first section, we discuss teaching strategies for using these graphs in the classroom. In the second section, we present a collection of graphs organized by topic: melting ice, rising seas, changing ocean temperature, changing air temperature, rising carbon emissions, impacts on humans, intensifying storms and contradicting attitudes._________Each week in “What’s Going On in This Graph?,” we spotlight an engaging graph previously published elsewhere in The Times and pair it with a simple set of questions: What do you notice? What do you wonder? What do you think is going on in this graph? On Wednesdays, teachers from the American Statistical Association provide live facilitation in our comments section to respond to students as they post analyses and consider what story the graph is telling. Then, at the end of the week, we add an end-of-activity “reveal” that shares the original article containing the graph, highlights from the moderation, related statistical concepts and helpful vocabulary.The philosophy behind our approach is to let students begin analyzing graphs with the skills they will most naturally and successfully use — simple noticing and wondering. From there, students can simultaneously build confidence and acquire new conceptual understanding. Over time, as their critical thinking skills develop and their vocabulary grows, students’ analyses become more sophisticated.Below, we detail step-by-step instructions for how to adapt this approach to teaching with graphs to your classroom, and we provide examples from students who have participated in our weekly conversations about climate change-related graphs.In this Stats and Stories podcast, Sharon Hessney, the curator of “What’s Going On in This Graph?,” describes the benefits of the Notice & Wonder approach: “Noticing and wondering has a ‘low floor and a high ceiling.’ Every student can notice something in a graph. There are dots on it; it’s about different countries. As they hear each other’s noticings, they dig deeper. They’ll discover more by comparing and contrasting aspects of the graph and by relating these noticings to the world they know.”So, what can simply noticing look like in action? Here are examples of what students noticed about the above graph about summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere.I noticed that the graph is only focusing on the summer temperatures, and not the overall temperatures. The base year has a 29-year difference while the other years have a 10-year difference. The graph does not cover the years 1981-1982. — Deija Robins from CaliforniaI noticed that as the years go by, the mean or the center of the graph shifts farther to the right. This upward trend seems to be in a stage of rapid acceleration and I wonder if it will continue to increase at the same rate in the coming years. — Brooke Shalam from New York CityI noticed that as the years went on the temperatures became hot and extremely hot more frequently. I also noticed that the distribution of the temperatures starts as an approximately symmetric distribution and becomes skewed right over the years. — Chandler B from GeorgiaDiscussing what students notice and wonder, either online or in the classroom, is an important part of the learning process. Ms. Hessney recommends: “We think the best practice for doing ‘What’s Going on in This Graph?’ is first, for students to converse about what they notice and wonder either individually or in small groups, and then to discuss as a whole class. By hearing other people’s ideas, students form more and deeper stories from the graph.”Here are examples of student wonderings about the same graph.I wonder if the progressing extreme heat will affect our animals and even, human beings. Will this affect us in dangerous ways? For example, will we die from heat stroke, Will the water sources dry up and the animals die of thirst? These are my wonders for this graph. — Ruby Casey from New HampshireWe wonder what “extremely cold,” “normal” etc. means in terms of temperatures. We also wondered if there were outliers at all. It seems like there were outliers on the hot side and then outliers on the cold side. We wonder if something similar is happening in the southern hemisphere and if this type of trend happens in the winter, too. We also wonder if these are actual temperatures and where was the data gathered — cities, country, novice weather people as opposed to trained weather people We think that global warming is being illustrated by this graph. — @mathteacher24 from Bethlehem, Pa.An essential part of our approach to teaching with graphs is that students don’t do their thinking in a vacuum. On The Learning Network, moderators from the American Statistical Association provide students with feedback on their comments. Plus, students get to read what others have to say, and have a chance to reply as well — whether they are in the same classroom or on the other side of the globe.In the screen shot below, you can see a student, Madison from New Jersey, responding to Christian in Pittsburgh. One of the questions Madison asks is, “Are these the effects of naturally increasing temperatures, or the doing of man made emissions?”Just like photographs, graphs tell stories. After students have “noticed and wondered,” we ask them: What’s going on in this graph? What story can it tell?Here are some examples of the comments students made about the above graph about winter temperatures.This graph shows that although the average winter temperature in the US is not increasing at a steady rate, overall the temperatures are getting warmer with time. This is in favour of the discussion about climate change causing global warming. — Tatyana from New ZealandThis graph depicts how the winter temperatures from the 1900s differ from the 2000s. And how the temperatures are gradually getting warmer. This could be happening due to global warming or maybe how they say the sun is gradually getting closer and closer to our planet. — Matthew Laing from PhiladelphiaFrom brief observations, I can conclude that this is a graph depicting the differences between the average winter temperature in 1900 and the present average winter temperature at the time. Because of this, I’m curious if an increase in air pollution, carbon dioxide, and deforestation is responsible for the overall increase of winter temperatures on Earth. This graph could capture how pollution and an increase of carbon dioxide within the atmosphere because the gas prevents small bits of heat from the sun from escaping the Earth’s atmosphere, forcing it to bounce back to the Earth’s surface as more thermal energy from the sun reaches our planet. A similar phenomenon has been present on Venus, which, due to the gases within Venus’ atmosphere capturing the majority of thermal energy from the sun, has made Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System. — Ben S. from Allen Tex.This past summer Robert Lochel, a math teacher in the Hatboro-Horsham School District, mentioned to us that he always asked students to write a catchy headline after they were done noticing and wondering. We liked the idea so much, we added it to our weekly protocol.Here are a few examples of students’ headlines about the graph above.• “You Thought This Winter Was Cold? Check This Graph,” by Nathan of Virginia• “Is Earth on the Hot Seat?,” by Kero K. and Jon I. from Hampton High School• “Dreaming of a Green Christmas,” by Isaac from Hampton High School• “Doomsday Deviation,” by Michael, Harper, Joseph and Owen from Hampton High School_________The graph above illustrates how rising temperatures could affect ice cover across 1.4 million lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. It is one of scores of graphs related to climate change that The Times has published in the last few years. We hope that by collecting a selection of these graphs in one place, organized by topic and accompanied by links to the original Times articles, we are providing teachers with a valuable resource for teaching about climate trends.With any one of these graphs, you can have students notice, wonder and do the sequence of strategies recommended above.And here is one more teaching idea: Choose a handful of these graphs and ask students to select the one they think is most valuable for teaching the general public about Earth’s changing climate. Then they can explain why they selected that graph.We Charted Arctic Sea Ice for Nearly Every Day Since 1979.

522	4	"Climate change is already bringing massive changes to the waters around Aotearoa. Photo / FileAuckland, environment and Māori affairs reporter, NZ HeraldSnapper caught in Otago, tropical species making New Zealand home and mussels shrinking due to more acidic waters - these are all climate change impacts, and all happening now.But according to a new report, Climate-related risk scenarios for the 2050s, they are only a tiny snippet of climate-induced changes expected in the marine space over the next few decades.Prepared for the Aotearoa Circle - made up of industry, iwi and government bodies focused on sustainable development - the report says there will be both physical risks - including warming seas and acidification threatening fish stocks; and transition risks - such as changes to energy use and supply, artificial intelligence and ""green"" fishing vessels, and increasing societal demands.And industry leaders say now is the time for collaboration to both cut emissions and to ensure the impacts are minimised, even proposing a Ministry for Oceans be established.Since the late 1800s the planet's average surface temperature has risen by about1.1C, with most of this warming in the past 35 years, and the past five years being the hottest years in history.Oceans are taking the brunt of this warming, since 1970 absorbing over 90 per cent of excess heat trapped in the climate system.The KPMG report looks at two scenarios for the year 2050: mako, where the world fails to curb greenhouse gas emissions; and kahawai, one where it achieves the aims of the 2050 Paris Agreement, keeping warming under 2C by 2100.Under mako - named after the fast, aggressive and unpredictable shark - global warming is on course to exceed 4C by 2100, resulting in major oceanic changes due to increasing acidity and changes in temperature and currents.By 2050, this would see commercially valuable species like hoki migrating south and becoming uncommercial to fish.Meanwhile warm-water species from the tropics could begin intermittently migrating south with marine heat-wave events, altering the composition of marine food webs.Traditionally-prized New Zealand species such as snapper and kingfish could migrate in greater numbers to the coastal waters of the South Island.Some North Island QMA fishers could suffer financial losses due to a collapse in quota value of these species, but could be awarded quota for warm water species as compensation.However, the volatility in abundance and distribution of wild fish due to changing currents, amid increasing global socioeconomic pressures, could see fisheries governance overwhelmed, and collapse of global fish stocks.These pressures could also put strains on Crown and iwi relations, the authors said.A higher emissions scenario could also spell disaster for farmed shellfish - such as mussels, with potential for a 150 per cent increase in acidity, severely affecting growth rates and productivity.More variable sea temperatures would also make aquaculture unviable closer to shore, and need to be shifted further offshore into deeper waters, raising costs.Under kahawai - a species known to collaborate to avoid danger, and punch above their weight - while the world avoids the worst physical impacts it still faces a range of transition-related challenges including energy use and societal and cultural expectations.While globally species abundance could drop by around 10 per cent, New Zealand was placed to fare much better than most.Advances in technology and science would further enhance the understanding of species and habitats, leading to more sustainable fishing.By 2050 report authors envision potential for ""green"" fishing vessels, not only reducing energy use but using enhanced technology and even AI-driven robotics to target species and eliminate bycatch.Sanford CEO Volker Kuntzsch said from a marine perspective, climate change was the country's biggest natural capital challenge.""Water temperatures are rising and the weather is more unpredictable.""Algal blooms result from changes in nutrients in the water column driven by changing rainfall patterns on land, and warmer waters affect our aquaculture operations.""Rising water temperatures are already creating shifts in the distribution of fish species and marine mammals around our coastlines.""To address what was ahead, collaboration was key.Kuntzsch called for an oceans strategy/policy for New Zealand, ideally to be administered by a Ministry for Oceans.""There's no common approach to treating our big blue backyard in a way that respects kaitiakitanga or our collective future.""An oceans policy should consider our ecosystem across all impacts, from the mountain to the sea.""We need a holistic approach that adds up to an outcome that every New Zealander should be able to buy into.""This would enable sustainable relationships around the farming the most ""environmentally-friendly protein"", while restoring the environment.Examples included immediately promoting aquaculture, to a national focus on seaweed identifying appropriate farming regions and methods to innovating farming technology and products like high value algae oil extracts or pharmaceuticals.""Add seaweed's potential to sequester carbon to the mix and we have a species that provides a convincing basis for a large scale multi-stakeholder project that would have benefits for the environment, the economy and the people."""
747	4	Climate change gets blamed for a lot of things these days: inundating small islands, fuelling catastrophic fires, amping-up hurricanes and smashing Arctic sea ice. But a global review of insect research has found another casualty: 40 per cent of insect species are declining and a third are endangered. It confirms what many have been suspecting: in Australia and around the world, arthropods – which include insects, spiders, centipedes and the like - appear to be in trouble. The global review comes hard on the heels of research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that suggests a potent link between intensifying heat waves and stunning declines in the abundance of arthropods. If that study’s findings are broadly valid – something still far from certain – it has chilling implications for global biodiversity. READ MORE: * 2018 was the Earth's fourth hottest year on record * 'Many parts of Earth could become uninhabitable': Study's grim warning * Scientists just linked another record-breaking weather event to climate change * 2016 the hottest year ever recorded, World Meteorological Organisation says ARTHROPOD ARMAGEDDON In the mid-1970s, researchers on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico conducted a large-scale study to measure the total biomass (living mass) of insects and other arthropods in the island’s intact rainforests, using sweep nets and sticky-traps. Four decades later, another research team returned to the island and repeated the study using identical methods and the same locations. To their surprise, they found that arthropod biomass was just one-eighth to one-sixtieth of that in the 1970s – a shocking collapse overall. And the carnage didn’t end there. The team found that a bevy of arthropod-eating lizards, birds and frogs had fallen sharply in abundance as well. In the minds of many ecologists, a widespread collapse of arthropods could be downright apocalyptic. Arthropods pollinate some of our most important food crops and thousands of wild plant species, disperse seeds, recycle nutrients and form key links in food chains that sustain entire webs of life. This ecological ubiquity arises because arthropods are so abundant and diverse, comprising at least two-thirds of all known species on Earth. In the 1940s, evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane quipped that “God has an inordinate fondness for beetles.” Humans might think we rule the world, but the planet really belongs to arthropods. KILLER HEAT WAVES The researchers who documented the arthropod collapse in Puerto Rico considered a variety of possible causes, including pesticides and habitat disruption. But the evidence kept pointing to another driver: rising temperatures. Weather stations in Puerto Rico indicate that temperatures there have risen progressively in the past several decades – by 2℃ on average. But the researchers are far less worried about a gradual increase in temperature than the intensification of heat waves—which have risen markedly in Puerto Rico. This is because nearly all living species have thresholds of temperature tolerance. For example, research in Australia has shown that at 41℃, flying foxes become badly heat-stressed, struggling to find shade and flapping their wings desperately to stay cool. But nudge the thermometer up just one more degree, to 42℃, and the bats suddenly die. In November, heat waves that peaked above 42℃ in north Queensland killed off almost a third of the region’s Spectacled Flying Foxes. The ground beneath bat colonies was littered with tens of thousands of dead animals. Dedicated animal carers could only save a small fraction of the dying bats. THE EL NIÑO CONNECTION El Niño events – fluctuations in Pacific sea-surface temperatures that drive multi-year variations in weather across large swaths of the planet – are also part of this story. New research appears to be resolving longstanding uncertainties about El Niños and global warming. Recent studies published in Nature and Geophysical Research Letters suggest global warming will in fact intensify El Niños – causing affected areas to suffer even more intensively from droughts and heat waves. And this ties back to Puerto Rico, because the researchers there believe a series of unusually intense El Niño heatwaves were the cause the arthropod Armageddon. If they’re right then global warming was the gun, but El Niño pulled the trigger. BEYOND HEAT WAVES Puerto Rico is certainly not the only place on Earth that has suffered severe declines in arthropods. Robust studies in Europe, North America, Australia and other locales have revealed big arthropod declines as well. And while climatic factors have contributed to some of these declines, it’s clear that many other environmental changes, such as habitat disruption, pesticides, introduced pathogens and light pollution, are also taking heavy tolls. So, at a planetary scale, arthropods are suffering from a wide variety of environmental insults. There’s no single reason why their populations are collapsing. The bottom line is: we’re changing our world in many different ways at once. And the myriad little creatures that play so many critical roles in the fabric of life are struggling to survive the onslaught.

259	4	Once, a night in with David Attenborough promised the TV equivalent of a warm blanket. It was a chance to watch spectacular creatures revelling in the beauty of their natural habitats, as the man with a voice as soothing as ice-cream described what we could see, from the violent to the serene. Those days are gone. Attenborough’s recent move to Netflix, for Our Planet, was deceptive: a seemingly gorgeous nature documentary that doubled up as animal kingdom snuff movies in which the beauty of those natural habitats was revealed as a crumbling paradise, ruined by people and particularly by greed. One of the main points of praise for Our Planet, which was well received, suggested that Attenborough was no longer tiptoeing around the issue of climate change, the implication being that he had done so before.You sense that Our Planet was unfortunately timed for the BBC. In Climate Change: The Facts, the gloves are now not so much off as thrown to the floor in a certain rage. It’s right there in the title, bold and stark. This hour-long documentary, part of the Our Planet Matters season, is wide-ranging yet concise, easy to understand, not blighted by the ego of, say, An Inconvenient Truth, and it is designed to do for climate change denial what 2017’s Blue Planet did for single-use plastic.That’s not to say it should be Attenborough’s responsibility to get the wider public to pay attention, nor that it is down to the BBC. It isn’t. But Climate Change: The Facts is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. The first 40 minutes are given over to what Attenborough calls, without hyperbole, “our greatest threat in thousands of years”. Expert after expert explains the consequences of rising CO2 levels, on the ice caps, on coastal regions, on weather and wildlife and society itself. The most powerful moments are in footage shot not by expert crews who have spent years on location, but on shaky cameras, capturing the very moment at which the reality of our warming planet struck the person holding the phone. In Cairns, Australia, flying foxes are unable to survive the extreme temperatures; rescuers survey the terrible massacre, and we learn that while 350 were saved, 11,000 died. A man and his son talk through their escape from raging wildfires, over the film they took while attempting to drive through a cavern of blazing red trees. These are horror movies playing out in miniature. It is difficult to watch even five minutes of this and remain somehow neutral, or unconvinced.Yet as I kept on, scribbling down an increasingly grim list of statistics, most of which I knew, vaguely, though compiled like this they finally sound as dreadful as they truly are – 20 of the warmest years on record happened in the last 22 years; Greenland’s ice sheet is melting five times faster than it was 25 years ago – I started to wonder about responsibility, and if and where it would be placed. This would be a toothless film, in the end, if it were hamstrung by political neutrality, and if its inevitable “it’s not too late” message rested solely on individuals and what relatively little tweaks we might make as consumers. What about corporations? What about governments?Then, at that exact moment, having played the despair through to its crescendo, the experts served up unvarnished honesty. They lined up to lay out the facts, plain and simple. Fossil fuel companies are the most profitable businesses man has ever known, and they engage in PR offensives, using the same consultants as tobacco companies, and the resulting uncertainty and denial, designed to safeguard profits, has narrowed our window for action. It is unforgivable. I find it hard to believe that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, can watch footage of Trump calling climate change “a hoax ... a money-making industry” and not be left winded by such staggering ignorance or astonishing deceit, though it is, more likely, more bleakly, a catastrophic combination of the two. At least Nigel Lawson only appears here in archive footage, and his argument sounds limp, to put it kindly.Climate Change: The Facts should not have to change minds, but perhaps it will change them anyway, or at least make this seem as pressing as it needs to be. With the Extinction Rebellion protests across London this week, disrupting day-to-day business, and this, on primetime BBC One, maybe the message will filter through. At the very least, it should incite indignation that more was not done, sooner, and then urgency and a decision to both change and push for change at a much higher level. Because there is, for a brief moment, just possibly, still time.
111	4	"A man watches the flames as a wildfire approaches Kochyli beach near Limni village on the Greek island of Evia. Photo / APEarth is getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade will probably blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent, according to a report the United Nations called a ""code red for humanity"".""It's just guaranteed that it's going to get worse,"" said report co-author Linda Mearns, a senior climate scientist at the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research. ""Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.""But scientists also eased back a bit on the likelihood of the absolute worst climate catastrophes.The authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which calls climate change clearly human caused and ""unequivocal"" and ""an established fact"", makes more-precise and warmer forecasts for the 21st century than it did last time it was issued in 2013.Each of five scenarios for the future, based on how much carbon emissions are cut, passes the more stringent of two thresholds set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. World leaders agreed then to try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above levels in the late 19th century because problems mount quickly after that. The world has already warmed nearly 1.1 degrees since then.Under each scenario, the report said, the world will cross the 1.5-degree warming mark in the 2030s, earlier than some predictions. Warming has ramped up in recent years, data shows.""Our report shows that we need to be prepared for going into that level of warming in the coming decades. But we can avoid further levels of warming by acting on greenhouse gas emissions,"" said report co-chair Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at France's Laboratory of Climate and Environment Sciences at the University of Paris-Saclay.In three scenarios, the world is also likely to exceed 2 degrees over pre-industrial times — the less-stringent Paris goal — with far worse heatwaves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours unless there are deep emissions cuts, the report says.""This report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid and intensifying, unprecedented in thousands of years,"" said IPCC vice-chair Ko Barrett, senior climate adviser for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.With crucial international climate negotiations coming up in Scotland in November, world leaders said the report was causing them to try harder to cut carbon pollution. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called it ""a stark reminder"".The 3000-plus-page report from 234 scientists says warming is already accelerating sea- level rise and worsening extremes such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms. Tropical cyclones are getting stronger and wetter, while Arctic sea ice is dwindling in the summer and permafrost is thawing. All of these trends will get worse, the report says.For example, the kind of heatwave that used to happen only once every 50 years now happens once a decade, and if the world warms another degree Celsius, it will happen twice every seven years, the report says.As the planet warms, places will get hit more not just by extreme weather but by several climate disasters at once, the report says. That's like what's now happening in the western US, where heatwaves, drought and wildfires compound the damage, Mearns said. Extreme heat is also driving massive fires in Greece and Turkey.Some harm from climate change — dwindling ice sheets, rising sea levels and changes in the oceans as they lose oxygen and become more acidic — is ""irreversible for centuries to millennia"", the report says.The world was ""locked in"" to 15-30cm of sea-level rise by mid-century, said report co-author Bob Kopp, of Rutgers University.Scientists have issued this message for more than three decades, but the world hasn't listened, said United Nations Environment Program executive director Inger Andersen.For the first time, the report offers an interactive atlas for people to see what has happened and may happen to where they live.Nearly all the warming that has happened on Earth can be blamed on emissions of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. At most, natural forces or simple randomness can explain one or two-tenths of a degree of warming, the report says.The report described five future scenarios based on how much the world reduces carbon emissions. They are: a future with incredibly large and quick pollution cuts; another with intense pollution cuts but not quite as massive; a scenario with moderate emission cuts; a fourth scenario where current plans to make small pollution reductions continue; and a fifth possible future involving continued increases in carbon pollution.In five previous reports, the world was on that final hottest path, often nicknamed ""business as usual"". But this time, the world is somewhere between the moderate path and the small pollution reductions scenario because of progress to curb climate change, said report co-author Claudia Tebaldi, a scientist at the US Pacific Northwest National Lab.While calling the report ""a code red for humanity"", UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres kept a sliver of hope that world leaders could still somehow prevent 1.5 degrees of warming, which he said is ""perilously close"".Alok Sharma, president of the upcoming climate negotiations in Scotland, urged leaders to do more so they can ""credibly say that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive"".""Anything we can do to limit, to slow down, is going to pay off,"" Tebaldi said. ""And if we cannot get to 1.5, it's probably going to be painful, but it's better not to give up.""In the report's worst-case scenario, the world could be about 3.3 degrees hotter than now by the end of the century. But that scenario looks increasingly unlikely, said report co-author and climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, climate change director of the Breakthrough Institute.""We are a lot less likely to get lucky and end up with less warming than we thought,"" Hausfather said. ""At the same time, the odds of ending up in a much worse place than we expected if we do reduce our emissions are notably lower.""The report also says ultra-catastrophic disasters — commonly called ""tipping points"", like ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents — are ""low likelihood"" but cannot be ruled out. The much-talked-about shutdown of Atlantic ocean currents that would trigger massive weather shifts, is something that's unlikely to happen this century, Kopp said.A ""major advance"" in the understanding of how fast the world warms with each ton of carbon dioxide emitted allowed scientists to be far more precise in the scenarios in this report, Mason-Delmotte said.In a new move, scientists emphasised how cutting airborne levels of methane — a powerful but short-lived gas that has soared to record levels — could help curb short-term warming. Lots of methane the atmosphere comes from leaks of natural gas, a major power source. Livestock also produce large amounts of the gas, a good chunk of it in cattle burps.More than 100 countries have made informal pledges to achieve ""net zero"" human-caused carbon dioxide emissions some time near mid-century, and will be a key part of the negotiations in Scotland. The report says those commitments are essential.""It is still possible to forestall many of the most dire impacts,"" Barrett said."
264	4	Flanked by a team of ministers, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Thursday to discuss his country's plan to combat climate change.Both countries are lagging behind on their emissions targets, but Germany in particular is struggling to meet its goals. So far, Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas output by around 32% since 1990, but is likely to fall well short of the 40% target it set for 2020.At home, Merkel has struggled to find a compromise between appeasing industry leaders and and taking on more drastic measures — like a carbon tax — that her environment minister and climate activists say are necessary to prevent a global climate catastrophe.In June, the Netherlands revealed its national climate accord after months of hammering out details in talks with industry and society stakeholders. The plan includes a goal to cut emissions by 49% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050.As Merkel's government draws closer to revealing its own package of climate measures in September, DW has taken a look at the Dutch accord to see what tips Germany could borrow:ElectricityBy the 2050 deadline, the Netherlands wants to make its electricity production entirely carbon neutral — phasing out coal over the next few years and closing the first coal-fired plant by 2020.By 2030, the country hopes to generate 70% of its electricity from renewable sources, boosting offshore windfarms as well as expanding wind turbines and solar farms on land.Carbon tax on industryOne of the most controversial measures — and the one that has proved difficult to agree with industrial giants in Germany — is establishing a carbon tax.Starting in 2021, companies will be taxed €30 ($33) per ton of CO2 produced. That figure will rise to €125 to €150 per ton after 2030.There will also be subsidies to encourage companies to switch to renewable energy as well as funding to boost research into the use of hydrogen and other sustainable fuels.Overhauling homesBy 2050, 7 million homes and 1 million office and industrial buildings need to be rid of natural gas. At least 1.5 million of those homes need to be gas-free by 2030.In order to accomplish this, homeowners and businesses will need to install better insulation and switch to renewable energy sources to heat and power their homes. The changes will be rolled out district by district, with neighborhood-wide consultations.The Dutch government has acknowledged that the initial costs of making the switch will be high — particularly with a new energy tax system — but say that subsidies and lower energy bills will eventually offset the costs.AgricultureInnovative farming methods have helped the Netherlands become the second-largest exporter of agricultural products in the world. In order to make the sector carbon neutral, the government plans to implement better manure processing techniques to reduce emissions from livestock.Specific plans have been set out for the country's sprawling greenhouses, including plans to modernize 300 hectares (741 acres) of greenhouse space per year and utilize geothermal heat.TransportationAll newly produced passenger cars must be emission-free by 2030, with the government offering incentives for electric vehicles. Some 1.8 million charging points are supposed to be built by 2030.Already known for being a country of avid cyclists, the Netherlands plans to implement more measures to encourage bike use, including setting up more bicycle parking at train stations.Every evening, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

192	3	"Scientists have been warning for years that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent — and the latest catastrophes are seen as a timely reminder the threat could hit much closer to home than some might think.But this week, with much of China's central Henan province devastated by record rains, there was little reference to  the broader climate crisis among Chinese officials, scientists or state media.The silence is all the more conspicuous given how much Chinese authorities have emphasized the extremeness and rarity of the weather. At one point, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou was pelted by nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in an hour. In just three days, it had 24 inches (61 centimeters) — or nearly a year's worth — of rainfall, according to the Zhengzhou meteorological station.Zhengzhou's weather station called it a ""once in a thousand years"" downpour. Henan's water resources department went a step further, claiming rain levels recorded at some stations could only be seen ""once every 5,000 years.""But on Thursday, state-run newspaper the Global Times said Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at China's National Climate Center, ""dismissed the connection between heavy rain in Zhengzhou and global climate change."" Instead, he attributed the flooding to ""abnormal planetary scale atmospheric circulation,"" the report said.Liu Junyan, climate and energy project leader for Greenpeace East Asia, said without the impact of climate change, ""it is very difficult to imagine such extreme rainfall would occur in an inland city like Zhengzhou."" But she said it is rare for Chinese weather and climate authorities to acknowledge a potential climate change connection in the aftermath of extreme occurrences, because such analysis requires more research and data. ""Out of caution, they basically avoid talking about it,"" she said. Such associations are also seldom reported by state media, she added.That stands in stark contrast to how climate scientists and the media have responded in the West. While full analysis is needed to confirm to what degree changes to the earth's climate have affected specific extreme weather events, many experts agree the trend is clear. Scientists at the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, conducted a rapid attribution analysis, which found the western North America heat waves would have been ""virtually impossible"" without climate change. WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas later said they were ""clearly linked"" to global warming.It is not that Chinese leaders do not admit climate change is real. On the contrary, President Xi Jinping wants China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to become a global leader on the climate crisis. Last year, he pledged to hit domestic peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, earning international praise.In the official narrative, climate change is often presented as a global crisis that China, a ""responsible major power,"" has stepped up to solve, especially as the former Trump administration rolled back US involvement. Less mentioned, however, are the direct threats it poses to China, and its effect on the daily lives of its 1.4 billion people.Chinese authorities are also wary that climate activism popular among young people in the West could spread to China. Last September, 17-year-old Ou Hongyi, known as the Greta Thunberg of China, was detained and questioned for hours by police when she joined the Global Climate Strike in Shanghai, an international event that attracted thousands of protesters at more than 3,500 locations worldwide.That has made it difficult for the Chinese public to realize how they are personally related to the climate crisis, Liu said. Like some in the West, Chinese people tend to perceive the dangers of climate change as something remote — threatening only the melting ice caps in the Arctic or low-lying islands in the tropics. And although emission cuts and green reforms are often mentioned in state media and classrooms, many treat them as just another state policy for local governments to follow. ""For many, climate change is more of an issue about politics, about economic gains and costs, and international collaboration,"" Liu said. But as the devastation in Henan shows, many Chinese cities are not prepared to deal with the climate risks from increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather.In the 18 hours before the evening rush on Tuesday, Zhengzhou's weather station issued five consecutive red alerts for torrential rain. According to guidance from the China Meteorological Administration, the alert should have prompted authorities to halt gatherings, suspend classes and businesses — advice Zhengzhou authorities apparently failed to heed. As the deaths of 12 passengers trapped on a flooded subway gripped the nation, some have questioned why authorities didn't shut down it down earlier to avoid casualties.The situation could be worse in smaller towns and villages around Zhengzhou with far less contingency planning, rescue resources and media exposure, Liu said.The last time Henan saw similarly intense downpours was nearly half a century ago. In 1975, a super typhoon dumped huge amounts of rain onto the province — one village at the center of the storm saw 63 inches (160 centimeters) of rain in three days. Overflowing rivers burst 62 dams, killing more than 26,000 people by the official count, though other estimates were several times higher.While the connection between climate change and extreme weather in China might not have received much official mention, it doesn't mean Chinese scientists haven't been studying the issue. A senior meteorologist with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, for example, has published a paper on the impact of climate change on extreme torrential rains in Chinese mega cities.On Chinese social media, too, some have started to reflect on the lack of discussions on the issue.

The Chinese delegation includes more than 770 people, including athletes, coaches and support staff, according to state-run news outlet CCTV — and more than 99% of the delegation is fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Arrested over a children's bookA children's book about sheep led to the arrest of five people in Hong Kong on Thursday, under the city's sweeping national security law.The book series depicts a sheep village — but police say the books referenced parts of the 2019 pro-democracy anti-government protests, including the 12 Hong Kongers who were caught and detained by Chinese authorities after trying to flee by boat.The protests, which often turned violent and threw the semi-autonomous Chinese city into political turmoil, prompted the Chinese government to promulgate the security law last summer. It granted far reaching new powers to authorities, who wasted little time in detaining activists, raiding newspapers, and banning public protest.Police said in a statement that the five people — all core members of the General Union of Hong Kong Speech Therapists — were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to publish seditious material that incited hate toward the Hong Kong government, one of the crimes laid out in the security law.In a separate news conference, however, police said they had been arrested under articles 9 and 10 of the law — which allow the government to regulate the internet, the media, and other communications to prevent ""terrorist activities"" and to ""promote national security education in schools.""CNN has reached out to police, but was not offered an explanation as to the discrepancies in the statements.In the news conference, police said the storylines depicted in the children's books ""beautify illegal acts of political violence,"" and urged parents to get rid of books that would ""harm the mind of the next generation.""Police denied accusations the law was being used as a ""legal trap"" for publishers or media outlets — but the arrests are deepening fears of censorship nevertheless. In the past year, authorities have ordered schools to ban certain textbooks that may violate the law, blocked websites on national security grounds, and revised film censorship guidelines to abide by the law.Around AsiaMyanmar doctors in hiding have set up underground networks of clinics to help battle the country's Covid outbreak, with the military junta accused of using the pandemic as a weapon against the people.An Indonesian man is facing arrest after disguising himself as his wife to board a flight, despite reportedly testing positive for Covid.More than two thirds of Indians surveyed above the age of 6 showed antibodies against Covid-19, providing yet more evidence the virus may have spread far more widely than official figures suggest.The Australian government and a United Nations body are facing off on Friday over whether the Great Barrier Reef is ""in danger"" of losing its ""outstanding universal value"" — meaning it could lose its World Heritage status.Chinese tech IPOs on Wall Street could come to a grinding halt A wave of Chinese firms have reportedly backed off of plans to go public in the United States.Tough US laws requiring audits for foreign companies and a growing crackdown by Beijing has made it increasingly tough for Chinese tech companies to approach Wall Street.Since February, shares of overseas-listed Chinese tech firms have lost a staggering $1 trillion in value, marking one of the biggest sell-offs of all time, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. And, after a disastrous IPO by ride-hailing giant Didi, TikTok owner Bytedance, social e-commerce platform Xiaohongshu, fitness app Keep and medical data company LinkDoc Technology have all either shelved or scrapped plans to list in New York, according to media reports.It ""may very well be"" the end — at least temporarily — to US listings for Chinese companies, according to Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management. He added that a ""serious pause"" on such listings could be in effect until US-China relations improve.There are still ways for Chinese companies to tap overseas investment even if the US is no longer an option. They can go to Hong Kong, for example, which also has a diverse pool of international investors and a regulatory regime that meets international standards. But the US market still has an irreplaceable role, as it's bigger than any other financial market in the world, has a greater turnover in stocks and places a higher value on company earnings. That means a company listing in America may find it easier to achieve a higher valuation and sell more shares.--By Laura He and Michelle Toh"
431	4	"It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. Their dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C says the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C.Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".  It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open. After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C.The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC.""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation.""""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have.""The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever.The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems:But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to:Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved."" ""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport.""It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century.""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.""The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world.You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editorThe countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed:It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong.The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity.""Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face.""Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate.""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened."""
351	2	"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.In the first release of a three-part report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned this week of the consequences of a rapidly warming world spurred largely by human-influenced climate change.""The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse‑gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,"" United Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres said. ""Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible.""But, not everyone agrees with Guterres and the panel’s nearly 4,000-page Sixth Assessment Report. ""The IPCC is an excellent source for climate science, but we tend to focus very selectively on the worst news, often overstating the effects of climate change on extreme weather events. Often adaptation is ignored, although it can alleviate much or sometimes almost all of climate damages,"" Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus and visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover institution, said in an emailed statement to Fox News on Wednesday. ""Although climate change in total has negative impacts, we rarely hear about the positive impacts, such as a profound global greening of the planet, equivalent to two more continents of green, each the size of Australia.""Lomborg wrote in a New York Post article on Monday urging readings not to buy alarmism and ""scare stories on climate impacts,"" and that the U.N. has ""a long history of claiming catastrophe is right around the corner,"" writing about problems related to ""one-sided"" and negative thinking on climate change. Lomborg said that while climate change is a ""real problem that we should fix smartly,"" it won’t be as catastrophic as some present it to be and that humans’ adaptive capacities are not properly being taken into account.The IPCC report is compiled by more than 200 of the world’s leading climate scientists from 66 countries, including research from thousands of papers. The last one was released in 2013.It says global temperatures have reached their highest level in more than 100,000 years, rising by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, with almost all warming since pre-industrial times caused by the release of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and methane.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released on Monday, Aug. 9, 2021, says warming already is smacking Earth hard and quickly with accelerating sea level rise, shrinking ice and worsening extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and storms.       (Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP, FIle)As temperatures rise, the scientists note that ice melt and sea level rise have been accelerating, with extreme weather events like rainfall and drought also expected to worsen and become more frequent as further warming is ""locked in.""The 2015 Paris climate accord target of limiting global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 – ideally, an increase of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius – is practically unattainable according to five scenarios in which scientists all concluded that the world would see an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 2030s. Three of the scenarios saw temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius.""The whole notion is just built on this assumption that warming is bad to start with,"" former Trump/Pence EPA Transition Team member and JunkScience.com founder Steve Milloy told Fox News on Wednesday, calling the report’s extreme weather claims ""very unlikely."" ""This new report, number one, there’s nothing new in it. There’s no new science, the alarm is just, you know, it’s more ‘code red’ than it was five, six years ago – the last time they came out with one of these things,"" the IPCC was ""backing off their most extreme projections because none of that – obviously – is going to happen.""Speaking with Fox News the same day, Competitive Enterprise Institute Center for Energy and Environment senior fellow and ICPP reviewer Patrick J. Michaels said he believes the report and its conclusions were ""mired in the atmosphere of unreality.""""The U.N. has been pushing the climate story since 1988 – that’s a long time ago – when it established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And, that panel was established specifically to provide what they call the basis for a possible treaty on climate. Any committee that is assigned such a specific assignment will do exactly as it was told. And, therefore, the composition of the [IPCC] – the authors – are selectively chosen because they know the results they are going to get,"" he said.""The real reason this report is so extreme is that the previous reports have not elicited the actions that its proponents wanted,"" Michaels noted. ""And, in fact, people are becoming increasingly tired of stories about the end of the world.""Michaels, a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society, took issue with the report’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) modeling.Michaels, who says he is not a climate change skeptic, said if the report had used best practice models instead the issue would have ""fallen apart.""

A new massive United Nations science report is scheduled for release Monday Aug. 9, 2021, reporting on the impact of global warming due to humans.       (AP Photo/Valentin Bianchi, FILE)That said, the report states that CMIP6 modeling includes ""new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, compared to climate models considered in previous IPCC assessment reports.""David Legates, a professor of climatology at the University of Delaware and a policy expert at the Heartland Institute, took issue with what he says is the political nature of the report.""So, it’s a panel of government officials who have been selected by the various governments. And, of course, they all have axes to grind,"" the former Trump-era National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) senior official said.""So, [there are] certain things they want to say. [There are] certain things they want to guarantee. Many of these nations want to make sure that carbon dioxide is an evil gas because ‘if we can tax it we can make sure that we can get our cut of the money that they’re taking away from other people.' And so, they have a vested interest in not the science – whatever that may be – but in stating that carbon dioxide is sort of an evil gas and therefore has to be regulated and has to be controlled.""For those looking to find a glimmer of hope in the new IPCC report, researchers found that majorly catastrophic disasters or ""tipping points"" were of ""low likelihood,"" including ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents.The report suggested that warming could be reversed through ""negative emissions"" – extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is added – though the term ""fossil fuels"" is not included in the summary or a Monday press release.Man-made CO2 removal ""leading to net negative emissions"" would lower CO2 in the atmosphere, a 42-page summary of the report for policymakers said. And even if this were achieved and sustained, increases in temperature would be reversed but other climate changes would continue in the ""current direction for decades to millennia.""However, the panel doesn’t explain how this could be achieved and many scientists remain skeptical of its plausibility.Michael Shellenberger, the author of ""Apocalypse Never"" and founder and president of Environmental Progress, told Fox News that most of the important trends regarding climate change are currently headed in the right direction.""""Climate change is real. It’s caused by human emissions – at least a significant amount of it is. And, we should try to do something about it because – all else being equal – it’s better for temperatures to not change. But, of course, not all else is equal,"" he said.""Climate change is being caused by human emissions, which are caused by humans trying to improve lives for themselves and their children. Not just through fossil fuel use but also through land-use change,"" he continued. ""And so, you’re always looking to balance the benefits of energy consumption with the downsides. But, the trends are mostly going in the right direction.""Shellenberger said the IPCC report’s ""scary"" scenarios were inaccurate because there is ""no possibility"" that they could occur due to the usage of natural gas over coal across the world.The environmental journalist said that while the IPCC science is ""mostly fine,"" he highlighted that there are ""some games that get played"" in the panel’s reports, including ""a bunch of scenarios that basically everybody acknowledges [are] not going to happen because we’re not going to increase coal use sixfold.""The report’s claim that the world is seeing more extreme weather is misleading, Shellenberger says, because it leads people to think that disasters are getting worse.Droughts can be worsened by warmer temperatures but are explained by natural variability and high-intensity fires can be avoided by better forest management, he argued – though allowing that climate scientists can point to longer fire seasons over larger geographic areas.Nevertheless, he said human beings are more resilient to extreme weather events and carbon emissions would go down globally over the coming decade.""The takeaway is that climate change is not what people think it is. It is significantly outweighed by things like droughts, which are still determined by natural variables and by economic development and preparedness, and we’re just so much better prepared,"" he told Fox News.""We’re more resilient to changing temperatures than we’ve ever been and it’s just not the end of the world.""The Associated Press contributed to this report."
395	5	INVESTORS CONCERNED about climate change have never been better organised, thanks to Climate Action 100+, a coalition with more than $33trn in assets under management. Nor have they ever had more success. Last year shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell persuaded it to pledge emissions reductions from both its operations and its products. In May BP’s shareholders voted to require the European oil-and-gas giant to disclose how its strategy matches the goals of the Paris climate agreement.Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the Church of England, sees “a gulf opening between the European supermajors and the American ones”. On May 29th the shareholders of ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest listed energy company, and Chevron, another American major, voted against climate resolutions. Yet even in Europe green investors’ impact is more a ripple than a wave.In America oilmen have been shielded in part by regulators. Even before ExxonMobil’s annual meeting, America’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sided with the company by agreeing that an emissions resolution brought by the Church of England and New York state’s retirement fund amounted to micromanagement. This allowed the motion to be omitted from its proxy materials.At the same time, some big asset managers have become more restrained. In 2017 BlackRock helped pass a resolution requiring ExxonMobil to disclose how climate change, or efforts to combat it with measures like carbon taxes, might affect its business. It has seemed warier of the new campaigns at Exxon. After the SEC’s decision, the Church of England and New York sought to split the roles of chairman and chief executive at ExxonMobil, hoping that a more independent board would set a greener strategy. Preliminary results show only 41% of votes in favour. ExxonMobil insists it shares green investors’ concerns about climate change, pointing to investments in biofuels and carbon capture and storage. “Exxon seems stuck in time,” counters Thomas DiNapoli, New York’s state comptroller.European firms seem forward-looking by comparison. Look closer, though, and they too appear grounded in the past. Shell aspires to halve its “net carbon footprint” by 2050. Shorter-term targets support the ambition—but leave room for emissions to rise so long as solar and wind power account for a growing share of Shell’s energy production. BP opposed targets for total emissions, supporting instead the resolution focused on strategy disclosure.Bruce Duguid of Hermes Investment Management, who worked with BP on behalf of Climate Action 100+, says that disclosure will help investors understand if the billions which BP continues to spend on oil and gas creates too much risk. BP will describe how big new capital projects stack up against the Paris goal of keeping warming “well below” 2°C relative to preindustrial times. Equinor, Norway’s state behemoth, agreed to something similar in April. As with Shell, BP’s resolution does not require it to cut oil and gas output. Greenpeace, a combative NGO, blocked entrances to BP’s headquarters in London ahead of its annual meeting on May 21st.Energy companies have made the right noises in other areas. ExxonMobil, Shell and BP have each devoted $1m to support an American proposal for a carbon tax. In April Shell said it would drop its membership of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, describing the lobby group’s climate policies as being in “material misalignment” with its own. BP plans to review its membership of trade groups.For the time being, though, Shell, BP and ExxonMobil remain members of the American Petroleum Institute, which has sought to ease rules on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They also maintain links with the Western States Petroleum Association, which last year fought a carbon tax in Washington state. BP spent over $13m directly to help defeat a ballot initiative in favour of the levy.Some investors in America will continue to seek changes, including on company boards. “The story of the next year is, how do we increase the pressure for companies to act fast?” says Andrew Logan of Ceres, a consortium of investors that helps co-ordinate Climate Action 100+. Others are beginning to question the value of shareholder engagement. The Church of England has said it will divest by 2023 if no advances are made. “Investors’ patience is not limitless,” says Mr Logan. “It’s going to be measured in years, not decades.”

Once Sunday's inspection was completed, the queen and the Bidens headed into the castle for tea.Following the visit, Biden said ""I don't think she'll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother.""US President Joe Biden said his fellow leaders agreed that ""America is back at the table and fully engaged,"" following a period of ""America First"" protectionist policy under former president Donald Trump.Here's a roundup G7 leaders' comments on Biden at the summit.A ""big breath of fresh air"" is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit in southwest England, described Biden, He told reporters Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its ""democratic values.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel, attending her last G7 in the post, meanwhile said Biden had brought ""new momentum"" to resolving the world's problems at the three-day summit.French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that it was a relief that he was now working with an American president who he termed was ""willing to cooperate.""""What you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,"" Macron said of Biden.Macron and Biden appeared to have built up quick chemistry during the in-person summit. The two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo on Friday.US President Joe Biden said democracies were ""in a contest with autocratic governments around the world"" in his final address at the G7 conference.""We're in a contest, not with China per se, ... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,"" said Biden.He indicated Russia had its own problems to ""chew on,"" saying its president, Vladimir Putin, had not changed.""Let me make it clear I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which in many cases he has not,"" Biden told reporters.The US president also stressed that his country was making a comeback in international diplomacy, following Trump.""America's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,'' Biden said, before leaving Cornwall to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. ""I think we've made progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends.""Biden said he does not view NATO as a ""protection racket."" Trump had often criticized European member states for what he viewed as too low financial contributions to the organization.Biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that he accepted the science of climate change: ""One of the things some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, 'Well, the United States' leadership recognizes there is global warming,''' Biden said.The final communique from the G7 meeting has been released to some media outlets. The document covers several topicsOn the coronavirus, the document:On climate change and environment it:On Russia, the document:On other human rights issues, it:On China, it:On global economic issues, it:G7 leaders said in their draft communique that China must respect human rights in Xinjiang as well as allow Hong Kong freedoms. The group also expressed concern over what it called Beijing's growing influence in the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait.""We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" the G7 said in the communique that was almost finalized.Leaders also expressed concern over forced labor in China. ""The United States and our G7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors — the main supply chains of concern in Xinjiang,"" the document said.DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says G7 leaders have agreed to increase their financial support ""to make sure that they will be able to mobilize €100 billion for poorer nations to cope with the coincidences of climate change and to help them switch to clean energy."" ""However, this promise was already made a decade ago and so far the leaders have not managed to live up to their promises,"" von Nahmen told DW. Therefore, they are ""now saying they are definitely going to increase financial spending,"" she added.G7 leaders called for a transparent, science-based study into the origins of COVID-19 convened by the World Health Organization, according to the draft communique. ""We call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts’ report, in China,"" it said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes that a new G7 task force can present details of the first infrastructure projects in developing countries in 2022.She also said that 2.3 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses should be distributed to low-income countries by the end of next year.""Germany is responsible for 350 million doses,"" Merkel said. That includes 30 million doses that Germany had ordered and would distribute, she said. ""That will probably be more over time."" The G7 group has ""agreed that the pandemic can only be defeated globally,"" she said. ""The way out of the pandemic is vaccines,"" she stressed. Speaking about coal, for which the G7 leaders are facing pressure to phase out state subsidies, Merkel said the delegates had not agreed on a date for ending the use of the fossil fuel.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has joined the summit for its last day, urged the G7 to help finance the World Health Organization's program to increase COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines.""We need to address the substantial financing gap for tests, treatments, critical supplies like oxygen and the health systems that enable testing, treatment and vaccination,"" Ramaphosa said in the presidency statement, referring to the Access to the COVID-19 Tools Accelerator. ""If all G7 countries met their fair share target, this initiative would be two-thirds funded – and it would be 90% funded if all G20 countries made their fair share contributions,"" Ramaphosa said.G7 countries will provide one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector and other countries to increase the contribution over the next months, according to a communique draft.""The commitments since we last met in February 2021 including here in Carbis Bay provide for one billion doses over the next year,"" the communique said.""We will work together with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase this contribution over the months to come,"" it added.World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the vaccine pledge but said it's not enough.He said at least 11 billion doses are needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population by the middle of next year.""We need more and we need them faster,'' Tedros said.DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says climate policy is a ""top priority"" for G7 countries.Speaking from Cornwall, England, where the G7 summit is taking place, von Nahmen says leaders are expected to discuss the phasing out of diesel and patrol cars as well as ending the use of coal ""as soon as possible."" She added that the leaders are unlikely to specify a deadline.  Concerning relations between the West and China, von Nahmen said: ""The US is pushing and hoping for a united front to counter China's rise,"" with European countries being ""very cautious not to push it too far to the extent that it would prevent any cooperation with China.""""What we expect from the (final) communique is to strike a balance, to stress that it is important to work on global issues with Beijing such as climate change,"" she said, adding that the G7 would also be expected to ""call out China for human rights abuses"" and that the Chinese government should ""use fair methods to compete with western economies.""The heads of state plan to commit to steps to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources.The US, Germany, Britain and Canada say they intend to provide developing countries with up to $2 billion (€1.65 billion) to accelerate their phase-out of coal.A White House statement also said that the G7 would coordinate climate targets so that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels — as outlined in the Paris climate agreement — remains ""within reach.""British naturalist Sir David Attenborough is to address the G7 delegates by video link, warning that countries must take urgent action to avoid human-made environmental disasters.In remarks released ahead of his speech, Attenborough said global warming and loss of biodiversity are ""beyond doubt,"" as is the fact that ""our societies and nations are unequal.""""The question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether, as a result of these intertwined facts, we are on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet.""""If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade, in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations, are the most important in human history,"" Attenborough added.The third and final day of the G7 summit takes place in Cornwall, England, on Sunday.The UK wants to use the summit to coordinate global climate targets and persuade world leaders to agree on tougher climate measures, such as the phasing out of coal.The heads of state and government will discuss steps on how to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources as well as how to accelerate the phase-out of coal.mvb/mm (AP, Reuters, dpa)"

Photo / Paul TaylorJason Walls is a political reporter for the New Zealand HeraldThe National Party will vote in favour of two sizable pieces of climate-change fighting legislation but will continue to fight for substantial changes to both bills.All 55 National MPs will vote for the second reading of the Zero Carbon Act this afternoon.They will also this afternoon vote with the Government in the first reading of the bill which could see farmers hauled into the ETS by 2022 if they don't abide by a new set of emissions rules.READ MORE:• One billion at risk: How climate change is transforming our oceans and mountains• Covering climate now: How much do you know about climate change? Take our test• Premium - Herald podcast: Why we can't risk normalising climate change• Climate change: How hard will extreme weather hit NZ?National has spoken out strongly about aspects of both pieces of legislation in the past.The party voted for the first reading of the Zero Carbon bill so when it got to the select committee process – where it is scrutinised and tinkered with by MPs – they could make some changes.The bill came back from select committee last month but the controversial biological methane targets – which had to be reduced by 24-47 per cent below 2017 levels by 2050 – remained in place.National's Climate Change spokesman Scott Simpson voted National would keep fighting this target as it wanted it to be at the lower end of that scale.This morning, National Leader Simon Bridges confirmed National would be voting with the Government on the bill's second reading.""We take climate change seriously but … we're not prepared to see a pilling on of tax and costs on everyday New Zealanders.""After the second reading, National want to implement more changes to the legislation, including that the independent Climate Change Committee to be able to set to biological methane target, not the Government.The bill was meant to be law in April this year, but has been delayed. It is being pushed through the House this week and will have its final reading on Thursday.Also on the Government's agenda today is the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Bill. Last month, the Government announced that it would be partnering with the agriculture sector and working with them to reduce on-farm emissions, instead of hauling them into the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).If the Government is happy with the sector's progress, they would not be pulled into the ETS in 2025.But, it officials were not happy with progress, farmers could be hauled into the scheme by as early as 2022.A spokeswoman for Bridges this afternoon confirmed to the Herald that National would be supporting this bill through its first reading.National's promised support of the bills comes as US President Donald Trump moves to formally exit the Paris climate agreement, making the United States the only country in the world that will not participate in the pact.It had previously indicated it would not be supporting the agreement, but today made it official."
116	4	"What will climate change mean for future air pollution? Photo / FileScience Reporter, NZ HeraldWe think of climate change as a gargantuan global crisis that will transform our environment in ways we can barely begin to imagine.Yet few of us appreciate how it could hurt us individually.An expert report released today by New Zealand's leading body for science, Royal Society Te Aparangi, warns of a warmer world bringing heatwaves, diseases, water contamination and air pollution.Several degrees of warming this century could also have alarming implications for our mental health and social inequality - hitting Maori particularly hard.It followed a global report in 2015 that bleakly warned how the past 50 years of health gains could be undone by the ""medical emergency"" that was the threat of climate change.""If we think of the basic building blocks of health, such as our shelter, the air we breathe, water we drink and the food we eat, all will be affected by climate change,"" said the society's president, Professor Richard Bedford.But if we knew what the risks were, he added, we could prepare for them and lower their impact.Here are five big factors in the report.If greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb close to current levels, many parts of our country will see more than 80 days a year above 25C by 2100.By contrast, most places today typically see only between 20 and 40 days above that.Cities, with their large, impermeable surfaces, would act as heat islands, pushing up the temperature of hot days and retaining the heat at night.Already in Auckland and Christchurch temperatures above 20C each year resulted in around 14 heat-related deaths among those over 65.Yet if global temperatures rise just one, two or three degrees above current levels, that death rate could rise to 28, 51 and 88 respectively.Elderly populations are especially vulnerable to heatwaves.With about one in four Kiwis projected to be 65 and over by 2043 - that's including many people in their 40s today - the problem would be amplified.Heat poses big risks to occupational health and labour productivity in areas where people work outdoors for many hours in susceptible regions.Otago University public health expert Professor Michael Baker said that, in his own area of infectious diseases research, rises in temperature had been shown to contribute directly to an increased risk of foodborne diseases such as salmonellosis.Hotter days could also lead to higher rates of aggression - and potentially heart attacks and strokes.Data showed that when temperatures climbed above 18-20C, hospital and emergency room admissions increased for those with mental health or psychiatric conditions.The problem could be eased or worsened by the magnitude and duration of the high temperatures - and the speed of temperature rise.The report did not ignore the danger of one-off extreme events.""Extreme events, such as the June 2015 flooding in South Dunedin and the 2017 Edgecumbe floods and Christchurch fires, pose immediate risks associated with being burned by fire, or being swept away when driving or walking through floodwaters or landslides.""These extreme events may also have negative effects on wellbeing through disease outbreaks, toxic chemical contamination, effects of damp buildings, mental health issues, disruption to healthcare access and damage to homes, which can last from weeks to months after the initial event.""Implications for our marine and freshwater environments were as concerning as they were broad.Climate change would increase our exposure to waterborne diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and micro-organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium.Changing weather patterns, bringing extreme rainfall and flooding, would combine with agricultural run-off to heighten the risk of contamination to the water we drink or swim in.""Many of the short- to medium-term health effects will come via climate change's impacts on freshwater,"" said Otago University environmental health senior lecturer Dr Alex Macmillan, who served on the advisory group for the report.""We already have declining freshwater quality in New Zealand as a result of increasing agricultural and urban pressures on rivers, lakes and drinking-water sources.""When these existing pressures are put together with warmer waters and heavier but more infrequent rainfall, then we are setting ourselves up for more outbreaks of waterborne illness like the one experienced by Havelock North in 2016.""Protecting health from climate change will therefore require greater action on freshwater quality.""With between 18,000 and 34,000 cases of gastroenteritis per year, New Zealand already had relatively high rates of waterborne illness compared with other high-income countries.By 2050, the World Health Organisation had suggested New Zealand could see about one to three more deaths of children due to all causes of diarrhoeal disease as a result of climate change.Today's report further highlighted a ""significant impact"" of higher temperatures on increasing diarrhoeal disease transmission, and increasing risk of illness which could range from days off work to hospitalisation.Here and overseas, extreme rainfall events had been linked to increased levels of harmful micro-organisms like norovirus, and those causing cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis diarrhoea in treated drinking-water supplies.In our streams, concentrations of salmonella and E. coli could rise significantly over summer months, and after heavy rain.The bacteria Leptospira, introduced into water from the urine of infected animals, could further bring illness, ranging from nausea to renal failure.Small community or private groundwater wells, and other drinking water supplies where water was untreated or minimally treated, were especially susceptible to contamination after heavy deluges.In ocean waters, the marine bacteria vibrio - whose growth rates were highly responsive to rising sea surface temperatures, particularly in coastal waters - could cause infected wounds, or diarrhoea or septicaemia if it contaminated sea food.Algae, also fuelled by a warming climate, could cause problems in our waterways and shores.In rivers and lakes, blue-algae produced toxins could cause liver damage, skin disorders, and gastrointestinal, respiratory and neurological symptoms.In our marine environment, climate change could mean toxic algae spreading and becoming more abundant and toxic.Rising air pollution is a well-known risk of climate change - but in New Zealand, it isn't just smog we would have to worry about.Higher concentrations of CO2, together with higher temperatures and changes in precipitation, might extend the start or duration of the growing season - increasing the quantity and allergic potential of pollen.Historical trends had shown climate change has forced shifts in the length of the growing season for certain plant species that were sources of allergenic pollens.Studies had also found that increases in CO2 levels resulted in greater pollen production, and increased allergic potential of grass and pine trees.While grasses formed the main source of atmospheric pollen in spring and summer here, annual birch pollen production in 2020 and 2100 was projected to be 1.3 and eight times higher respectively - with pollen season also arriving several weeks earlier.Meanwhile, exposure to PM2.5 and PM10, two major man-made air pollutants, could rise with heightened seasonal fire severity.Patients with underlying diseases, the elderly, and children were particularly sensitive.Even in 2012, exposure to PM10 was estimated to have caused 1000 premature deaths and more than 500 hospital admissions in New Zealand.PM2.5 was linked with serious chronic and acute health effects, among them lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and asthma.The amount of soil-derived PM10 dust in the air could also increase in areas more frequently affected by drought.In Masterton, for example, soil had been found to contribute up to 14 per cent of the PM10 particulate matter in the air.We know there are many organisms - notably mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas - capable of spreading infectious diseases between us, or from animals.The seasonality, range, and occurrence of diseases spread by these carriers are largely influenced by climatic factors - especially high and low temperature extremes, and precipitation patterns.These factors can affect disease outbreaks by changing the population size, population density, and survival rates of the disease carriers.Further, climate change could affect the relative abundance of other animals that are part of the disease cycle - and higher temperatures can increase the infectious agent's own reproduction rates.Collectively, these changes could contribute to an increase in the risk of the infectious diseases being spread to humans in some areas.We would face an assortment of nasty bug-borne diseases we don't have here already. Worst among them are West Nile virus, dengue fever, Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus.Similarly, there were emerging pathogens that had recently spread across the globe - such as mosquito-borne Zika - which were present in the Pacific Islands today.These could become more of a risk in New Zealand if climate change allowed important disease-spreading mosquitos to become established here.Added to that were a host of parasitic diseases, also characteristic of warmer climates, that might arrive here, via flies whose larvae infested skin, or lung fluke-carrying snails.Harmful species such as sea snakes or toxic jellyfish might similarly extend their range, while the invasive Australian redback spider, presently found only in Central Otago and Taranaki, could cross into other regions as they warmed.Higher temperatures, extreme weather events and displacement of people from homes and communities would all have a major toll on our mental health and wellbeing.Effects could range from minimal stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and suicidal thoughts, the report authors said.Research in Australia during the decade-long drought which officially ended in 2012 revealed an increase in anxiety, depression, and possibly suicide in rural populations.In these communities, concerns about financial and work-related issues were compounded by loss of hope for the future and by a sense of powerlessness or lack of control.For Kiwis, our natural environment is at the heart of our nation's identity - profoundly so for Maori - and shapes our economy, lifestyles and culture.""There's going to be a reduction in rain, particularly on the eastern side of the country - and more rain on the west - but the increase in drought frequency is going to put a lot of pressure on our rural economy,"" University of Auckland epidemiologist and biostatistician Professor Alistair Woodward said.""We know that there is a relationship between the rural economy, the welfare of the people working in the rural economy, and the frequency of mental health problems.""Disruption of cherished bonds between individuals and their environment, such as during the managed retreat of threatened coastal communities, could cause grief, loss, and anxiety.Even routine exposure to news articles like this one can add stress to an individual's everyday environment.Between 2005 and 2016 an average of 422 articles were published each month mentioning climate change or global warming in print and online media in the New Zealand region, according to the global media database.In the United States, psychological responses to such stress have been shown to include heightened risk perceptions, general anxiety, pessimism, helplessness, eroded sense of self and collective control, stress, distress, sadness, loss, and guilt.For Maori, climate change threatened to further entrench patterns of social disadvantage and unacceptable health inequities, said Dr Rhys Jones, an Auckland University senior lecturer and co-convenor of OraTaiao: NZ Climate and Health Council.""On the flip side, the report highlights the significant health benefits that could be realised through well-planned climate action.""Mitigation measures could actually lower air pollution and its associated health problems - and dozens of lives could saved each year if we moved from driving cars to cycling.One assessment of the effect of retrofitting houses in New Zealand with insulation suggested there could be savings of 217kg of CO2 per household per year through improved energy efficiency.At the same time there would be fewer inpatient hospital respiratory admissions for the elderly, days off school for school-age children, and days off work for adults.""A clear implication is that New Zealand must act urgently as part of global efforts to address climate change, and must do so in ways that centralise and prioritise the most vulnerable groups in society,"" Jones said.""A business-as-usual approach would predictably see the opportunities and benefits accrue disproportionately to those who are already privileged, leading to widening social and health disparities.""This makes it critical that health and equity are at the core of decision making as we transition to a zero-carbon society.""Macmillan echoed Jones' call for urgent action.""By bringing together such a comprehensive body of evidence, the report should be a wake-up call for us to shift from thinking about climate change as an environmental problem which will be expensive to address, to it being fundamentally an issue of health and quality of life for all New Zealanders,"" she said.Indeed, many of the health effects described in the report were already beginning to occur.""The report adds further weight to arguments that New Zealand can no longer afford to delay urgent action as part of the global effort under the Paris Agreement.""The overwhelmingly negative impacts of climate change on health require a co-ordinated health sector response - to adapt health services to expected changes, to reduce the health sector's own climate pollution, and to ensure health is at the heart of climate decision-making.""• Under present projections, the sea level around New Zealand is expected to rise between 30cm and 100cm this century. Temperatures could also increase by several degrees by 2100.• Climate change would bring more floods; worsen freshwater problems and put more pressure on rivers and lakes; acidify our oceans; put even more species at risk and bring problems from the rest of the world.• Climate change is also expected to result in more large storms compounding the effects of sea-level rise.• New Zealand, which reported a 23 per cent increase in greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2014, has pledged to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels and 11 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030.• The new coalition Government has promised greater action, with a proposed new Climate Commisson and Zero Carbon Act and goals for a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2035."
485	0	"World leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, after Theresa May urged them to do more on climate change.The prime minister called on the G20 countries to set targets for net zero greenhouse gas emissions.Instead, 19 pledged to meet their targets set in the 2015 Paris agreement. The US did not sign up.The UK is the first country to legally commit to become a net zero emitter of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.At the summit, Mrs May was also one of several world leaders to put pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.Leading the session on climate change, Mrs May called on other world leaders to match the UK's net zero target, aiming for the summit's joint statement to have ""the strongest wording we can deliver"" on the issue.But only 19 of the 20 leaders signed up to the statement, which committed them to the ""irreversibility"" of the 2015 Paris agreement and pledged the full implementation of its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. US President Donald Trump declined to sign.Mrs May said: ""In recent months we have heard hundreds of thousands of young people urge us - their leaders - to act on climate change before it's too late.""The UK's net zero goal was ""world-leading"", she said as she called on other countries to ""raise their ambition and embrace this target"".The UK's target means it will have to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions completely or - in the most difficult cases - offset them by planting trees or absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere.Under the Paris agreement, reaffirmed by the 19 world leaders, every nation is committed to keeping global temperature rises to less than 2C (3.6F) higher than pre-industrial times.Scientists say that a 1.5C rise is the threshold for dangerous climate change, and if other countries adopted the UK's net zero target, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below this by 2100.Separately, in a 20-minute meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, she raised the case of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a British official said.US intelligence concluded the crown prince directed the killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last year, but Saudi authorities have denied they were acting on his orders.With 11 unidentified people put on trial behind closed doors, Mrs May told Prince Mohammed that the legal process must be ""open and transparent"", the official said.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it was Saudi Arabia's responsibility to ""uncover"" the perpetrators, but added: ""Nothing is done so far."" He said they should be prosecuted in Turkey.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said he highlighted ""continuing concerns"" about the investigation, and about human rights in Saudi Arabia.But the US president praised Prince Mohammed as a ""terrific ally"" and said ""nobody so far has directly pointed a finger at the future king of Saudi Arabia"".Mrs May also called for other countries to follow the UK's pledge of Â£1.4bn to the Global Fund, an international organisation which fights three of the world's deadliest diseases.The UK will contribute Â£467m a year for three years, providing tuberculosis treatment for more than two million people, 90 million mosquito nets to protect people from malaria, and treatment for more than three million people living with HIV - the virus that causes Aids.Mrs May said the world needed ""urgent international action and a truly collective response"" to halt the spread of these illnesses.The pledge follows an appeal by Sir Elton John and French President Emmanuel Macron for an Â£11bn cash injection for the Global Fund, which is expected to help save 16 million lives.Sir Elton, whose Aids foundation works with the fund, said the UK's response set an ""extraordinary example for others to follow"".Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who is one of the Global Fund's backers, said the UK pledge was ""really fantastic"" and urged the country to continue supporting overseas aid.The Microsoft founder told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I wish all the UK citizens could go and see how miraculous it is that HIV - that was going to kill so many people and really undermine these societies and destabilise them - because of the generosity, that's been avoided.""Earlier in the day, Russian president Vladimir Putin was asked about Mrs May's comments the day before on the Salisbury poisonings and her assertion that Russia must end its ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"".The UK believes two officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in March 2018. Russia denies any involvement.The Russian president said: ""She set out her position in a fairly tough way. That's true, it's how it was. I informed her of the position of the Russian Federation on a series of irritants in our relationship.""He added: ""However people behave to us, we will behave to them. Tit for tat. I want them to remember that."""
508	4	"Derek Cheng is a political reporter for the New Zealand HeraldClimate Change Minister James Shaw has evoked the nuclear-free and women's suffrage movements in telling to a UN conference that New Zealand has turned a corner and will now be a world leader on climate change.""A little over 30 years ago a New Zealand Prime Minister, David Lange, declared that nuclear weapons were morally indefensible and that we would no longer play any part in the arms race that threatened to extinguish all life on earth,"" Shaw told the COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany, in delivering New Zealand's national statement overnight.""We were the first country where women won the right to vote. We were around the table at the formation of the United Nations. And we became a nuclear-free nation in the face of the Cold War's deadly logic.""Our new Government has committed to the goal of becoming a net zero emission economy by the year 2050, and to join with the high ambition countries leading the worldwide fight against climate change.""Shaw said there was no room for half-commitments.""Ask the citizens of Houston if Hurricane Harvey would meet them half-way. Ask the people of Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, or Kiribati, or Tokelau - how compromising is the rising sea?""The conference is discussing how to implement the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming to 1.5C.Shaw told the conference that New Zealand would do its part through a range of policies, including planting 1 billion trees, turning the Government's fleet electric, and building sustainable industries.At COP23, New Zealand has also signed up to the Powering Past Coal alliance, which is committed to phasing out the use of coal for electricity generation by 2030.Shaw told the Herald New Zealand's only coal-burning generators at Huntly are to be decommissioned by 2025.""But symbolically it is really important, and the more countries that get in on it, the better.""Shaw said the alliance was more popular than anticipated.""As it was launching, security wasn't letting people through because there were so many people trying to get in, they were afraid the floor would collapse.""He said the reaction at COP23 to New Zealand's new direction had caused a stir.""When I got here, everyone was talking about how Jacinda had said this was the nuclear-free moment of our generation. I wasn't really anticipating the level of reaction that we're getting from the international community about the shift. It's been quite extraordinary, really warmly received.""He said New Zealand's small size was no excuse for inaction. ""If you add up all the countries who contribute less than 1 per cent, we collectively contribute almost a quarter of global climate pollution.""There are a number of countries that have committed to net zero, and there are a number trying to squirrel out of the Paris Agreement in one way, shape or form, so it really helps that there are countries like New Zealand that are making that commitment."""
329	5	Climate change has riven New Zealand politics for two decades or more, but the morning after the Climate Change Commission debuted the most significant set of emissions reductions policies to grace mainstream politics, there was little sign of serious political discord.  Prominent breakfast TV host Duncan Garner even asked Climate Change Minister James Shaw to get on with giving Kiwis cheaper electric cars. “How big will the incentives be for us to go and buy an electric car? You give us a big incentive [and] we’ll go and do it,” Garner said.  “You’ve been telling us that for a while, Duncan – it’s on the way,” Shaw replied.  READ MORE: * Government introducing car import rules aimed at lowering emissions and fuel costs, considering incentive scheme for EVs * The change that'll make Rogernomics 'look like a trial period' * Climate chief wants a road safety-style campaign to get us out of cars   Shaw took to the  airwaves on Monday morning, saying the biggest challenge facing the country when it comes to reducing emissions would be getting the balance right between changes asked of each industry.  Debate focused on a policy the Government had tried to implement in its first term: a scheme to make electric and clean petrol cars cheaper by subsidising their upfront costs with a levy on the most polluting cars. The policy is called a feebate, the “fee” being the levy on polluting cars, and the “bate” being a rebate consumers get if they purchase cleaner alternatives. In 2019 the Government consulted on a plan that would have made clean cars up to $8000 cheaper, while polluting cars would have been $3000 more expensive. National decried the plan as a “car tax”, and in 2020, the Government dropped the policy after failing to get NZ First support. While the Greens took the policy to the election, Labour quietly ditched it from its manifesto.  But Labour’s position changed after the election with Transport Minister Michael Wood just last week saying the Government will “consider options for an incentive scheme to help Kiwis make the switch to clean cars”.  Just what that means is an open question. The Climate Change Commission’s first emissions budget suggested either a feebate or a subsidy, leaving the Government to pick one or neither option. Shaw said the Government hadn’t yet come down on what sort of incentive scheme it would use. “I couldn’t tell you right now – Cabinet hasn’t yet considered what those alternatives are,” Shaw told RNZ on Monday.  Ministry of Transport officials mulled both a feebate option and a direct subsidy back in 2019.  The subsidy option would have given EV owners a more modest $1000-$2000 subsidy, which would have cost the Crown an equally modest $104 million over three years. By contrast, the Government has set aside $421m for the screen production grant, a film industry subsidy, over the same period.  Ministers eventually opted for the feebate method: the subsidy on cleaner cars was higher, and because it was funded entirely by levies collected on polluting cars, it didn’t come at a cost to the Crown. However it did come at huge political cost with the Government apparently blindsided by the vociferousness of the opposition to the fee on polluting cars.  The Government now faces a choice of whether the cost of any incentive scheme will be borne by people who continue to purchase polluting cars or taxpayers at large.  Shaw gave little away, but further suggested that the scheme would look at incentives to bring the upfront cost of purchasing EVs down – rather than existing EV incentives which focus on lowering running costs.  “The upfront cost is prohibitively expensive for most people but the running cost is very, very low, “New Zealanders typically spend more on the running costs of our cars than we need to over the lifetime of those cars because we like to spend less upfront,” Shaw said. Shaw said that more broadly the challenge with reducing emissions would be ensuring that each sector’s transition was managed in a fair and balanced way.  “The biggest challenge really is going to be getting the balance between all of the industry sectors that are going to see change over the coming years because every sector is going to be saying ‘it’s too tough you’re going to have to go harder on another sector’,” Shaw said. Rod Carr, who chairs the Climate Change Commission, also took to Monday morning media to manage the expectations of the Commission’s proposals.  He told RNZ that despite calling for a ban on the import of fossil fuel vehicles by 2032, 60 per cent of light vehicles in New Zealand would still use internal combustion engines by 2035, meaning consumers would still be able to get their hands on one if they wanted to. He also discussed the enormous demand this would place on our renewable electricity generation. Carr said that the power would come from existing and new sources. “[The emissions budget] assumes the near 13 per cent of electricity currently used by the aluminium smelter will become available for the use of all New Zealanders and between now and 2035 we increase by about 170 per cent the renewable generation capacity in New Zealand largely but not entirely from wind and some solar,” Carr said.  As things currently stand, New Zealand will be able to use the additional renewable electricity generated for the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter once it closes towards the middle of this decade. This will free up about 13 per cent of the current electricity supply. But this could be a challenge if Tiwai stays open (which is unlikely – although it has threatened to close before and stayed open), or if Transpower isn’t able to make investment in the grid to get that power from the bottom of the South Island to other parts of the country where it will be consumed. Carr said that Transpower was already looking to bring that extra power north. “Transpower are already investing in the first stage of bringing that power north and they’re developing plans to bring that power even further into the North Island,” Carr said.  Carr said it was time to accept Tiwai Point would close. “The smelter has indicated that it is on an exit path so the time has come to accept that is going to happen, if indeed that power doesn’t become available it means New Zealand will have to bring forward substantial investment sooner in the generation of additional electricity,” Carr said.  Politicians from the Opposition have been fairly muted in their response to the Commission’s draft budget. They’ve still got some time to formulate a response. The Commission will only present its final advice to the Government in March and the Government has until the end of the year to act on it.
891	4	"Two Stanford University researchers modeled the country-by-country effects of global warming over a 50-year period, and published their findings in a paper out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Countries with the hottest climates suffered the most economic damage, the study showed.India's gross domestic product per capita, for example, was 31% lower in 2010 than it would have been if not for global warming caused by human activity over the prior half century, the study found. Chad's economic activity per person was 39% lower, Venezuela's was 32% lower, and Nigeria's was 29% lower. In absolute terms, many of those countries have actually boosted their economic output significantly over the past half century, and as a result, inequality between countries has declined in recent years. However, that progress could have moved faster if temperatures weren't rising, the study found.""It represents a number of years of economic development that have effectively been delayed,"" said Noah Diffenbaugh, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment who co-authored the report with Stanford's Marshall Burke. ""There would've been a greater convergence, and less inequality on the country level than what we have seen, if global warming hadn't occurred."" The report doesn't describe exactly how rising temperatures have depressed economic growth. But other research has demonstrated how warming above a certain ""optimum"" average temperature — estimated in a previous study by Burke at about 13 degrees Celsius, or 55 degrees Fahrenheit — can dry out farmland, lower cognitive function, decrease worker productivity and increase interpersonal conflict, among other effects. ""To me this confirms and quantifies trends that we have been seeing in a lot of poor countries,"" Rebecca Carter, deputy director of the climate resilience practice at the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said of the findings. Carter pointed to Costa Rica, which the study estimated has 21% lower GDP-per-capita than it would have without human-caused global warming. There, coffee farmers have seen lower yields and more frequent disease outbreaks due to higher temperatures. ""In some parts of the country their harvests have been undermined gradually, year after year after year,"" Carter said.Could richer countries benefit?Wealthier countries have historically generated the most greenhouse gas emissions, which tend to rise with industrialization and personal consumption unless effective pollution controls are imposed.  Rich countries also tend to be further north and have cooler temperatures, on average. And they may, in fact, actually have benefited from the warming trend as they approach the ""optimum temperature"" for economic growth, further widening inequality across countries. For example, the study found that Iceland's economic output is nearly double what it would've been without man-made temperature change — the largest outlier in the results. Countries like Canada, Norway, and Finland also benefited, adding between a quarter to a half of their per capita GDPs on account of warming between 1961 and 2010, according to the study. That could happen if agriculture benefits from longer growing seasons, for example, or if fewer snowstorms interrupt transportation. The idea that rich countries have benefited from climate change is controversial, and that part of the study has encountered skepticism from others in the climate science field. Two outside experts who reviewed the study at CNN Business' request, Wolfram Schlenker of Columbia University and Solomon Hsiang of the University of California-Berkeley, each said that its conclusions are weaker when taking into account the response of countries to warming over time. ""For example, a hot year might temporarily reduce GDP in a year, but it might rebound in future years,"" Schlenker wrote in an email. The study also looked at the response to temperature changes with five-year lags, and under those parameters, the previously apparent benefits for richer, cooler countries faded away. Even under that scenario, however, the authors found there was a 66% likelihood that climate change widened the gap between rich and poor countries. ""The authors consider this case in the last table of the appendix and find that inequality would have almost not changed using this approach, I believe because everyone (rich and poor) suffers so economic gaps do not widen as much,"" wrote Hsiang, who co-authored a 2015 paper with Burke upon which much of the new analysis is based. ""I think this finding is important and probably should have been the main approach, since it's likely closer to the truth."" Poor countries don't suffer aloneDiffenbaugh acknowledged that the results showing climate change has enriched wealthy countries have the most uncertainty around them. However, he stood by the finding that climate change has very likely widened inequality across countries, because the evidence of deep negative impacts for poorer nations is so strong. That's something that other large climate studies, such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also affirmed — especially when it comes to more qualitative impacts on human health and vulnerable ecosystems. Previous work has also looked at the unequal impact of climate change within countries and across income groups, making clear that wealthier individuals of all nationalities are better-equipped to adapt to or shield themselves from a warming world. Wealthier people can often work inside with the benefit of air conditioning and are more likely to be able to afford to relocate or rebuild if storms reach their homes. A study released last year by Hsiang and co-authors, for example, projected that the poorest counties in the United States would see the largest negative effects from climate-change events like droughts and hurricanes because they're already concentrated in the steamy deep South. But the new study is among the first to boil the impact of climate change down to an estimate of national economic output, which is a simple way of understanding how people are faring on average within each country. Even though people are impacted differently within the US, for example, the Stanford researchers found that climate change had little to no effect on overall GDP-per-capita between 1961 and 2010. For countries that are negatively impacted, the broader economy is less able to absorb and respond to the people who are hardest hit. ""When we say 'standard of living,' we mean real income, which means GDP-per-capita,"" said Branko Milanovic, a professor at the City University of New York who studies global income inequality and who also reviewed the new report at CNN Business' request. ""If climate change is particularly bad for poor countries, that means climate change would make elimination of poverty extremely difficult."" Furthermore, negative impacts even in cooler countries can ramp up quickly. The melting of ice in Alaska has prevented indigenous residents from hunting whales, for example, and algae blooms have turned lakes from tourist destinations into dead zones. And of course, poor countries don't suffer in isolation. Poverty can spark or worsen political conflict, and residents displaced by wars and drought often end up seeking refuge in richer countries. ""We can't assume that what's happening somewhere across the globe isn't going to have impacts in richer countries,"" said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute. ""To me this is an indication of the way in which those who are on the front lines of the problem are being affected in ways that we should anticipate will spread."" "
465	3	THE SOUTH-WEST of the United States, together with adjacent parts of Mexico across the Rio Grande, is one of the driest parts of the North American continent. But, over the past two decades, even that expected dryness has been taken to the limit. According to Park Williams, who works at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the current lack of rainfall in the area constitutes a megadrought of a magnitude seen on only four other occasions in the past 1,200 years.Dr Williams and his collaborators studied the annual growth rings of 1,586 ancient trees from Oregon and Montana all the way down to the northern reaches of Mexico, in order to reconstruct soil-moisture patterns going back to 800AD. During warm, wet years trees grow fast, producing wide rings. During cold, dry ones they grow more slowly, producing narrow rings. During a drought, a tree might not grow much at all.As they describe in this week’s Science, the team identified dozens of droughts over the centuries in question. But four stood out: those of the late 800s, mid 1100s, 1200s and late 1500s. They then took the mean soil-moisture value for the current drought (which has lasted 19 years so far) and compared it with sequential 19-year averages from the previous four, one of which lasted nearly a century. This showed that the region is already drier than it was during the first three of the previous megadroughts, and is on a par with the event of 1575-1603.In a world where human actions are driving temperatures up, Dr Williams and his colleagues wondered how much people are to blame for this state of affairs. To estimate that, they turned to climate modelling.Climate models are able to re-run the past with and without the warming effects of human activity, offering a way to compare what actually happened with what might have done. In their simulated world in which anthropogenic emissions had not ramped up the greenhouse-gas effect, the team found that a drought did indeed still engulf the western reaches of North America during the first two decades of the 21st century. But this fictitious dry spell was considerably less severe than the real one—ranking 11th rather than 2nd in the period under study (see chart).Worse still for those who live in the area, Dr Williams's research also confirmed suspicions that the area’s water-management policies, which govern abstraction rates from its rivers and aquifers, and which are mostly set on the assumption that 20th-century rainfall levels represent historical normality, are actually out of kilter. He found that, compared with most of the previous millennium, the 20th century was a period of abundant moisture. With nature providing less water than usual, and people taking more than seems wise, the future of the region looks parched indeed.Correction (April 23rd 2020): A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to Park Williams of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York state as “Dr Parker”.

For example, coral reefs would decline by 70 - 90 percent with global warming of 1.5degC, whereas virtually all (>99 percent) would be lost with 2degC.""Species loss and extinction are projected to be significantly lower at 1.5degC of global warming compared to 2degC.""If global warming continues to increase at the current rate, it's predicted to reach 1.5degC between 2030 and 2052. At that temperature, many species are at risk of extinction - but if the global average temperature rises by another half a degree, about 400,000 species could die out.The report says global temperatures have already risen by 1degC higher than average warming increases prior to industrialisation. Earth is now warming at about 0.2degC per decade, which lead report author Associate Professor Bronwyn Hayward from the University of Canterbury says could have a massive impact.""This doesn't sound like much but if we carry on like this, effectively the world will be warmed 50 percent more that it has already experienced, between 2040 and 2050, and some regions will feel the effects of these changes even more severely and quickly.She says the findings ""mark the end of 'magical thinking' about climate change"".""The report is unequivocal, our climate is changing now,"" she says.""Without unprecedented cuts to emissions now, we will have fewer opportunities to develop sustainably and will be required to rely increasingly on unproven, risky and possibly socially undesirable technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the future.""Professor Hayward says the report is groundbreaking because it places climate change within a social context and asks how humanity can make urgent changes to limit its devastation.""But to avoid climate warming above 1.5C, we have to scale up action in unprecedented ways across all sectors of our economy and everyday life, over the next 10 years.""David Tong from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says the report's release is a landmark moment that shows humans have the power to prevent the disastrous effects of climate change.The report says human activity is estimated to have caused about 1degC of global warming above pre-industrial levels.Mr Tong says the findings have particular significance for islands like Kiribati.""The difference between 1.5degC and 2degC is huge. For our Pacific neighbours, it's an existential difference.""Professor Hayward says a future warmer than 1.5degC will put New Zealand's own coastal communities in jeopardy, providing us with another reason to avoid it.""If the world's temperatures remain at or below 1.5C the report suggests we could avoid an additional 10 cm of sea level rise on average, over and above the trajectories we are already committed to by 2100.""The report also has enormous repercussions for icy land masses like Antarctica and Greenland, as warming of 1.5degC to 2degC could trigger rapid melting and sea level rises.Mr Tong says he's confident New Zealand can work to keep warming below the temperature danger zone.""This is a challenge but New Zealanders have a history of doing incredible things in the face of big global challenges. By acting now, our businesses, communities and every single one of us can reap the benefits of being a first mover in the switch to a new clean energy economy.""Professor James Renwick from Victoria University of Wellington says the report makes for ""sobering reading"".""We are currently living with 1degC of global warming and we're seeing effects already in extreme events and impacts on ecosystems and societies worldwide.""More warming, even half a degree, means more and bigger impacts, but it is clear that a 1.5degC world would be a lot more manageable and recognisable than a 2degC world.""He says while it's physically possible to prevent warming from increasing above 1.5degC, it would require ""huge political and social commitment"" from every country on Earth.""The world would need to reach zero carbon by 2050, with a 50 percent reduction between now and 2030. Given the past trajectory of global emissions of greenhouse gases (nearly a doubling in the past 30 years), this represents a truly heroic and unprecedented effort to turn the global economy around. Are the governments, the businesses, and the people of the world up to it?""Lobby group Coal Action Network says the findings ""should be ringing in the ears"" of Climate Change Minister James Shaw as he negotiates the Zero Carbon Act with the Opposition.""He cannot cave to special interests over science,"" says spokesperson Cindy Baxter. ""This report should bolster his case for strong and early action.""Greenpeace hopes the report will ""shock the world"" into immediate action.""We have 10 years to save the world as we know it,"" says climate and energy campaigner, Amanda Larsson.""This really is our last chance to avoid catastrophic climate change, the effects of which will be felt in our lifetime. We need to pull out all the stops to fast-track clean energy, especially solar, and to clean up our dairy industry through a transition to regenerative farming. We have to act now, and very quickly.""She says New Zealand's new ban on oil and gas permits mean we're emerging as a global climate leader and we must keep up the good work.""As a small nation, our biggest impact is in showing the world that immediate and dramatic action is not only possible, but it's achievable."""

663	3	Antarctica has experienced its hottest temperature on record with a provisional recording of 18.3C – nearly 1C higher than the previous record – according to researchers.The Argentine research station Esperanza, which collected the data, said the figure beat the previous record of 17.5C in March 2015 by 0.8C.It comes after the world saw the warmest January on record last month, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with temperatures in Europe 0.2C higher than during the previous warmest January in 2007.A committee for the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) will now work to verify whether the new record for the continent is correct.“Everything we have seen thus far indicates a likely legitimate record but we will of course begin a formal evaluation of the record once we have full data from SMN and on the meteorological conditions surrounding the event,” Randy Cerveny, WMO’s Weather and Climate Extremes rapporteur, said.“The record appears to be likely associated (in the short term) with what we call a regional ‘foehn’ event over the area: a rapid warming of air coming down a slope/mountain,” Mr Cerveny added.The Antarctic peninsula, the northwest tip near South America, is among the fastest warming regions on Earth, with temperatures rising almost 3C over the past 50 years, according to the WMO.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereThe organisation added that about 87 per cent of the glaciers along the peninsula’s west coast have “retreated” over the last 50 years, with most showing an “accelerated retreat” in the last 12 years.On Thursday, a major hole was discovered in the Thwaites Glacier, which could send sea levels surging by up to two feet if it dissolved completely.Scientists have found a cavity beneath the glacier that is far larger than previously thought.“The size of the cavity is surprising, and, as it melts, it’s causing the glacier to retreat,” Pietro Milillo, a Nasa radar scientist who led the research into the glacier, said.The Esperanza research base, located near the northern tip of the peninsula, has been collecting data since 1961.The reading breaks the 2015 record for the Antarctic continent, which is defined as the main continental landmass and adjoining islands by the WMO.The record for the Antarctic region, which is defined as all land and ice south of 60 degrees latitude, is a temperature of 19.8C recorded on Signy Island in January 1982, the WMO said.Additional reporting by PA

Stelter opened his segment by bemoaning how journalists are running out of ways to stress the effects from climate change.""Meteorologists and reporters are running out of words,"" Stelter explained. ""They are running out of words to describe the impacts of climate change. ‘Unprecedented’ just doesn't cut it anymore.""He asked his guests how the news should ""cover a permanent emergency?""Wallace-Wells acknowledged that media must remain in ""a state of alarmism"" in reporting the impact of climate disasters. ""We can't shy away from scary projections about the future or the scary facts as we're living them today,"" Wallace-Wells said. ""I think we also need to start thinking a little harder, be a little clearer in our story-telling, that learning to live in this new future, which will continue to get worse—probably considerably worse from here—is not just going to require decarbonizing, although that's very hard.""He went so far as to compare the current climate issues with the Holocaust in terms of deaths.Wallace-Wells explained that estimates ""suggest the burning of fossil fuels kills about 10 million people every year, which is dying on the scale of the Holocaust—in fact, larger than the Holocaust—every single year. And yet we don't see many public health stories, we don't see many moral crises stories addressed to that issue.""This number came from a Science Direct study that suggested pollution from fossil fuels caused ten million global excess deaths in 2012. A further Harvard study eventually decreased that number to approximately eight million people per year in 2018.Energy expert Alex Epstein, however, had previously debunked this study, stating that the findings wildly overstated fossil fuel side-effects while underplaying benefits. ""Since 1980, India's fossil fuel use has increased by 700% and China's has increased by 600%. Did this lead to many more premature deaths given ‘fossil fuels cause 1 in 5 deaths’? No, India's life expectancy increased by almost 16 years and China's increased by almost 10,"" Epstein wrote.""Any study about fossil fuels' side-effects must prominently mention their life-extending benefits. But modern studies, funded by governments with anti-fossil fuel agendas, systematically ignore fossil fuels' benefits and wildly overstate side-effects,"" Epstein continued. Nevertheless, Atkin was also insistent on wildly overstating the threat of climate change as well as blaming fossil fuels for the damage.""Yeah, it's not an excuse that you need to talk to a climate scientist anymore to include something in your story that says this extreme heat event was made more likely by climate change, and it's a part of our climate change future,"" Atkin stated. ""And what I would also argue is that you should probably have a sentence in there saying climate change is caused by fossil fuels because climate change is not something that's happening to us—it's something that's being done to us.""In the past, experts, reporters, and politicians predicted environmental doomsday for humans with all the predictions turning out wrong. A New York Times article from 1995 falsely warned ""[a]t the most likely rate of rise, some experts say, most of the beaches on the East Coast of the United States would be gone in 25 years."" "
672	2	"A shark had attacked a surfer, who was missing. Authorities sent drones into the sky for aerial surveillance, emergency workers jumped onto boats to scour the area, and medics waited on shore.Days of searching uncovered the man's surfboard, but his body was never found. He was counted as Australia's seventh shark attack victim this year -- an alarming spike that hasn't been seen in the country for 86 years.This year's attacks have taken place in a number of different states, including Queensland and New South Wales. Among them is a diver who also went missing in January after a suspected great white attack. His body was never found.To put this year's spike into perspective, there were no shark attack deaths in Australia in 2019. The years before that only saw one or two deaths annually. The last time the country had seven shark attack deaths a year was 1934, according to a spokesperson from the Taronga Conservation Society Australia. The highest annual figure on record dates back to 1929, with nine deaths.""In Australia, (this year is) a bit of a blip,"" said Culum Brown, a professor at Macquarie University's Department of Biological Sciences in Sydney. ""And in fact the long-term average is one -- one fatality per year. So seven is a long way above that, there's no doubt.""That average of one death per year has stayed stable for the past 50 years, the Taronga spokesperson said.It's not that there has been a sharp increase in shark attacks in Australia overall -- there have been 21 shark incidents this year, which is normal and consistent with previous years. The difference is in the fatality rate.There are a number of possible explanations -- several experts have pointed out that year-by-year figures always fluctuate, and this could be simple bad luck. But there's another possible culprit: the climate crisis. As oceans heat up, entire ecosystems are being destroyed and forced to adapt. Fish are migrating where they've never gone before. Species' behaviors are changing. And, as the marine world transforms, sharks are following their prey and moving closer to shores popular with humans.Australia is a hotspot for global warmingOn land, Australia's climate crisis has led to raging bush fires, extreme heatwaves, and one of the worst droughts on record.But it has also slammed the oceans with acidification and rising temperatures, which can wreak havoc on entire ecosystems. In particular, Australia's southeast region is on the front lines of the climate crisis -- near-surface waters there are warming at about four times the global average.The Great Barrier Reef, a vital marine ecosystem along the east coast, has experienced such widespread repeated bleaching that more than half the coral on the reef are dead. Massive stretches of mangrove forests have also died in the past decade.""Those two ecosystems alone are responsible for a massive diversity in marine ecosystems -- so you're seeing huge ecosystems disappearing and/or moving,"" Brown said.This all means that animals are migrating further south than normal in search of a suitable environment. Species like yellowtail kingfish, which are typically seen in northern tropical waters, are appearing in droves near the southern island state of Tasmania. The common Sydney octopus has shifted from the northeastern state of Queensland down to Tasmania. Even plankton and plant life like kelp are moving south.These types of ""marine tropical vagrants"" often travel up and down the coastline, Brown said, riding the Eastern Australian Current famously depicted in the movie ""Finding Nemo."" But now, climate change means winters are warm enough for these fish to survive the season -- so some species are choosing to permanently stay in the southern waters.""I spend a lot of time in boats off the coast and this year I don't remember a year where I've seen so many bait fish aggregations so close to the coast,"" Brown said. Researchers still aren't exactly sure what drives the movement of many of these species -- but Brown added, ""there's no doubt the sharks are just responding to where the bait fish are.""Sharks follow water temperatureThe ocean is by no means a stagnant mass; the surging currents mean there are areas of warm and cold water. The Eastern Australian Current is a major player in this dynamic -- it has also grown much stronger in recent decades, meaning it's pumping more warm tropical water down the coast.But because the current is more intense, it's also pushing cold nutrient-rich water toward some eastern shores.These dynamic, shifting water temperatures are perhaps also why sharks are beginning to move into human spaces. Some species, like bull sharks, like warm water -- so they're spending more time in the warm southern waters,  said Robert Harcourt, a researcher of shark ecology and director of Macquarie's marine predator research group.Meanwhile, species like great whites that prefer lower temperatures are drawn closer to shores where pockets of cold water also hold abundant prey. Tiger sharks, too, are typically found further north -- but have ventured down as far as Sydney, likely also affected by the current.These three species -- bull, great white, and tiger sharks -- are responsible for most of Australia's shark attack deaths.""I would foresee that there's going to be greater movement, an increase in geographic range, in a lot of these species,"" Harcourt said. ""That's because the dynamics of climate change mean their suitable habitat in terms of water temperature and prey distribution is changing as well.  And these animals are large, far-ranging apex predators.""""They will potentially come more in contact with people, and at the same time, human use of the ocean is increasing all the time,"" he added.There are other possible factorsModern technology, improved medical care, and faster emergency response times mean the fatality rate of shark attacks has dropped significantly in the past decade -- which is why this year's spike is ""a real anomaly,"" Harcourt said.But climate change aside, there might also be other factors at play. Luck is a major one: there have been several close calls in recent years where the victim was saved because there happened to be a medical worker close by at that time, said Brown.""We managed to save several people over the last couple of years, just by the fortune of having somebody qualified on site to deal with the trauma immediately, and that makes a massive difference,"" he added.It also depends where the victim is bitten. ""One centimeter to the left, if you get bitten on the leg, and you can die in seconds or minutes at least,"" said Harcourt. ""You know, one centimeter to the right, you get a terrible scar and a lot of pain but if you don't go into shock you've got a good chance of survival.""There's also a chance people are just spending more time in the water this year due to work-from-home conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, or because it's been particularly hot in Australia lately, Harcourt said -- thus raising the chances they could run into a shark.We're in a new era of unpredictabilityBrown and Harcourt cautioned that the 2020 fatality rate of shark attacks is only based on a single year's data; given shark figures can fluctuate year by year, it's difficult to say whether climate change is directly causing this year's spike. It could be a simple matter of bad luck; we just can't know until a few years down the line, when there is enough data to determine if it is a trend or an outlier.But both experts agreed on one thing: the ocean is changing, and sharks are changing with it. Climate change has devastated the world's natural environments and thrown everything off balance, disrupting how marine ecosystems live, move, and potentially interact with humans.""You can't draw any conclusions about anything based on (just one year), but there's no doubt that we're moving into a period of the unknown, effectively,"" Brown said. ""All the old distributions of species and how we interact with them -- you can pretty much throw that out the window. Whatever coming in the future is going to be new."""
861	5	Climate change “deniers” who claim the rapid temperature rise experienced by the world is part of a natural cycle have been proven wrong by a new study, experts said after it revealed that global warming is happening at an “unprecedented” scale that far exceeds temperature fluctuations during the last two millennia.Warming in the 20th century, seen over 98 per cent of the world, is in “stark contrast” to previous warm and cool periods such as the “Little Ice Age” when frost fairs were famously held on a frozen Thames, according to the findings in published in the journal Nature.These occurred on a regional basis and others were seen in different parts of the world. Researchers examined climate changes over the past 2,000 years which were thought to have been global in nature, such as the medieval warm period from 800 to 1200 AD and the Little Ice Age between 1300 and 1850.It found that warmer and cooler periods before the Industrial Revolution, when human activity started to put out large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, were not “globally coherent”.During the Little Ice Age for example, the coldest temperatures were seen during the 15th century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the 17th century in north-western Europe and south-eastern North America, and during the mid-19th century over other regions.The researchers also said the previous periods are in line with natural variability of the climate.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereHowever, the rapid warming over the past 150 years is very different, with the warmest period of the past two millennia occurring during the 20th century for more than 98 per cent of the globe.“There’s this globally coherent warm period that’s very different than what we see in the past and that coherence cannot be explained by the natural variability of the climate,” said one of the study’s authors, Dr Nathan Steiger, of New York’s Columbia University. “In the past the large patterns we do see we find those are consistent with natural variability but that’s not the case with the current period.”He added: “When you go back in the past these are really regional phenomena, there’s cold periods in Europe or the central Pacific, but they are not global, whereas the contemporary warm period really stands out. We find 98 per cent of the globe has this coherent warming during the contemporary warming period after the Industrial Revolution. That very much stands out and contrasts with the climate variability that has happened before in the past 2,000 years.”Earlier this year a YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Poll found that 13 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement that human activity is “not responsible at all” for climate change. Professor Mark Maslin, from University College London, (UCL) who was not involved in the research, said: “Over the last 2,000 years the only time the global climate has change synchronically has been in the last 150 years when over 98 per cent of the surface of the planet has warmed.“This paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle. This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.”His colleague, Professor Simon Lewis from UCL, said the study reinforced “the abundant evidence that human actions are driving rapid changes to the climate of our home planet”.He added: “With new robust analyses and new and painstakingly collated data, the last few decades are again shown to stand out: it is warming everywhere. As I sit in a sweltering heatwave in London, the big question remains: are people going to force governments and businesses to take swift action to drive down greenhouse gas emissions to zero to stabilise the climate?”Additional reporting by Press Association
949	5	Temperatures in the UK have risen by about one degree since the 1970s and, given the levels of greenhouse gas already in the atmosphere, further warming is inevitable over the next three decades or so. The amount of warming will depend on future emissions but even if emissions are cut quickly and sharply to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, there will be some unavoidable impacts that the UK will have to adapt to. The government's latest climate change risk assessment identifies flood risk, and particularly flooding from heavy downpours, as one of the key climate threats for the UK, alongside stresses on water resources, threats to biodiversity and natural habitats, and the repercussions for the UK from climate change impacts abroad. Computer models that simulate the climate suggest that, as a result of warming, extremely wet winters could become up to five times more likely over the next 100 years, with more intense downpours in the winter months driving a greater risk of flash floods and river flooding, alongside risks from sea-level rise. Extreme flood events such as those in the summer of 2007 could become more frequent and severe, putting homes, businesses and infrastructure at greater risk. The government estimates that annual damages from flooding alone could increase to between £2bn and £12bn by the 2080s, an increase of about two to 10 times compared with current-day estimates. Critical infrastructure, including water-pumping stations, water treatment works, transport and electricity systems, and schools and hospitals sited in flood-risk areas could also be threatened, while heavy rainfall events could increase the risk of water contamination should sewers overflow. Current government estimates suggest about 330,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding, and climate change could increase this to between 630,000 and 1.2m by the 2080s. Conversely, the models suggest that the UK could experience warmer, drier summers in the future. While that may bring some benefits, it could mean increased risk of drought, and extreme events such as the 2003 heatwave could be the norm by the end of this century. Heatwaves could also heighten pressure on healthcare services, because older populations are more vulnerable to extreme heat, and impact on transport, as higher summer temperatures bring the threat of rail buckling and associated travel delays.The UK could also face threats to its water security and supply. Declining summer river flows, reduced groundwater replenishment and increased evaporation could all contribute to water loss, which could result in water shortages and restrictions on usage. The government estimates that 27-59 million people could be living in areas affected by water supply deficits by the 2050s, even before considering increasing populations and rising water demand.Ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to climate change, which can aggravate existing stress factors such as pollution, land conversion and invasive non-native species. While some species could benefit from climate change, far more are set to lose out, according to the latest government estimates.The UK may see changing patterns of wildlife and plants as species try to adapt by moving northwards, or have to compete with new non-native species. Habitats may come under increasing pressure – from salt marsh threatened by sea-level rise to beech woodland susceptible to summer droughts. Species could also experience reduced food supply if earlier breeding periods are at odds with the food available at the time.None of the model predictions are certain. There is a lot that science does not yet know, and wider social and economic trends will also affect the UK's vulnerability to the effects of climate change. These range from an ageing population – with greater vulnerability to extreme heat – to population growth and increasing household and industry demand for water, which is expected to be 5% higher by 2020 compared with today. With 13% of new homes built since 2000 constructed on floodplains (that's about 10,000–16,000 new homes a year), planning decisions are another factor that can worsen the UK's existing vulnerabilities.Recent reports by the UK Government Foresight programme and PWC suggest that the impacts of climate change outside the UK could have a larger effect on the British economy than the impacts felt within the country. If, for example, climate impacts led to international instability or reductions in the supply raw materials or commodities, the UK could experience effects ranging from increased food price volatility (if crop patterns change globally) to changing migration patterns as environmental refugees move from areas affected by extreme weather events. Nevertheless, the UK could see some gains from climate change. While summer deaths could increase given the predicted increase in hot days and heatwaves, the country could see a fall in the number of cold-related deaths – estimated to be in the region of 3,900 to 24,000 premature cold deaths avoided each year by 2050. Providing water is available in sufficient supply, the UK could also see new crop types, or increased yields of crops such as wheat or sugar beet. For some areas of the UK, climate change could also offer wider opportunities for tourism. And for wildlife warmer temperatures could increase survival rates for offspring born in winter. As with climate predictions, there are still many uncertainties over the extent and distribution of climate impacts. Model predictions are based on a number of assumptions about factors ranging from future rates of warming and economic growth to the technological and social achievability of different levels of emissions cuts. Regional impacts are particularly difficult to predict, though some work has been done to map the risks in different areas of the UK. For example, see this map (p329).Climate policy to cut global greenhouse gas emissions could have a tangible effect on future climate impacts, not only offering governments a way to avoid the most extreme impacts, but also providing them with more time to prepare and adapt to those that are unavoidable.• This article was written by Naomi Hicks and Dr Nicola Ranger at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian• This answer last updated: 10.10.2012• Read about the project and suggest a question• Report an error in this answerRelated questions• How do trees and forests relate to climate change?• What is the carbon cycle?• How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air?This post by The Guardian is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.Based on a work at theguardian.com

If you have a question you'd like an expert to answer, please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz Q: Will the delay of the COP26 UN climate negotiations impact international action to decarbonise? Would catch-up talks help? Could the talks collapse because countries stopped paying their dues? The 26th Conference of the Parties — better known as COP26 — is the United Nations climate change conference that was scheduled to be held in Glasgow, UK, during the first two weeks of November 2020. READ MORE: * Climate protesters block Huntly coalmine and push national mining conference online * Coronavirus: what does the UN summit delay mean for climate change? * Coronavirus: UN climate summit postponed until 2021 * COP25: Disappointment over marathon UN climate talks But in April this year the Covid-19 pandemic led to the event being postponed, then later rescheduled to November 2021. That’s a 12-month delay on a meeting of representatives from nearly 200 countries, including New Zealand, charged with monitoring and implementing the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It will be crucial to make progress towards the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit average global warming to 1.5-2℃ this century, relative to the 1890s (the so-called “preindustrial period”). The temperature target agreed in Paris was carefully chosen. Numerous scientific studies show an increase beyond 2℃ would activate self-reinforcing feedbacks in the climate system (such as a weakening of ocean and land carbon sinks). This would tip our planet into an extreme “Hothouse Earth” that could persist for millennia, regardless of what happens with future emissions. To avoid this scenario, the legally binding UN agreement encourages all participating nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases as soon as possible. As part of the Paris Agreement, developed countries agreed to provide, from 2020, US$100 billion to support developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Unfortunately, the current trajectory of global emissions is on track to increase global average temperatures by more than 2℃ and possibly as much as 4℃, far exceeding the target set in Paris. One recent study put the economic costs of failing to meet the Paris goals up to an eye-watering US$600 trillion by 2100, effectively keeping the planet in permanent recession. National representatives are expected to arrive in Glasgow next year with substantially strengthened plans to reduce emissions and meet their commitments to support developing countries. There is no doubt the gathering of 30,000 delegates in Glasgow will come at a time of ongoing uncertainty about Covid-19 and the largest shock to the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The pandemic is a game changer but it’s not yet clear whether this is good or bad for reducing emissions. Many of us have made substantial cuts to our travel and embraced remote work and online video chat, particularly at the height of the pandemic. Google and Apple data suggest more than half of the world’s population reduced their travel by more than half in April. Unfortunately, greenhouse gas emissions have remained stubbornly high. Daily global carbon dioxide emissions fell by as much as 17 per cent in early April. But as the world’s economy started to recover, emissions bounced back, according to the UN, with 2020 likely experiencing only a 4-7 per cent decline in carbon dioxide relative to 2019. To meet the Paris target and limit warming to 1.5℃, the world needs to achieve cuts of 7.6 per cent year-on-year for the next decade, and effectively reach zero emissions by 2050. The sobering reality is nations have a lot more work to do to decarbonise their economies. But for many national governments, the thorny question is how to achieve more ambitious emission targets while at the same time rebuilding economies battered by Covid-19. Although the UN has a large financial shortfall of US$711 million (at the end of 2019) due to some nations failing to pay their annual dues — with the US, Brazil and Saudi Arabia the worst offenders — there is no suggestion of cancelling the COP26 meeting next year. Catch-up talks have indeed been mooted but so far nothing has been publicly announced. That’s not to say there aren’t intensive negotiations and commitments being made in advance of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow. And there are some positive signs. As the world moves towards an economic recovery after the pandemic, some major economies are tilting towards a green stimulus and public commitments to reduce fossil fuel investments. For example, China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide and took the opportunity at the UN General Assembly 75th anniversary last month to announce it will reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Arguably more ambitious is the proposed European Green Deal announced in late 2019. It aims to slash greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade and make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent. To help achieve this, a carbon tax is proposed for imports into the European Union. This threatens to have far-reaching implications for European trading partners such as New Zealand and Australia. In parallel to these government announcements, industry is also making commitments to decarbonise. The multi-trillion-dollar financial sector is adding pressure by focusing on companies at risk from climate change and identifying so-called “stranded assets”. These pronouncements will help boost the negotiations for more stringent cuts to emissions as delegates prepare for the COP26 meeting in Glasgow next year. This can only put more pressure on all nations to be more ambitious. Attention will inevitably focus on the world’s largest historic emitter, the US, which is formally leaving the Paris Agreement on November 4 this year, the day after the 2020 presidential election. So the COP26 won’t collapse, but the year’s delay to the meeting may give the world the breathing space it so desperately needs to realise the ambition of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst of climate change.

163	4	Aucklanders face an additional council rate to accelerate action to curb the effects of climate change, under a budget proposed by mayor Phil Goff. The rate, of about $1.10 a week for an average-value home, would raise about $57 million a year to accelerate the introduction of electric ferries and buses, boost bus services, and fund tree-planting in the south and where the forest canopy is meagre. The Climate Action Targeted Rate (CATR) is the main feature of the so-called “mayoral proposal” which launches debate to set the annual budget. It will be voted in during June 2022. Goff is proposing to keep average general rates rises at the forecast 3.5 per cent level. READ MORE: * Money talks – what will Auckland's proposed Budget say next month? * Auckland hotel tax mayor Phil Goff's $28 million newcomer lesson * Auckland Council budget: Ratepayers face 5 per cent one-off rates boost  The mayor is hoping the rate revenue can be supplemented by government funding and money from other sources to create $1 billion for climate action in the city over the next decade. The biggest single line is the purchase of up to seven electric commuter ferries and chargers. Diesel ferries currently account for 21 per cent of public transport emissions. Sixty-six low-emission buses would be funded, along with a raft of new routes which will put a further 10 per cent of the population within 500 metres of a frequent bus service. “Councillors were unanimous in declaring a climate emergency, we must now walk the talk and take tangible action,” Goff said. The climate rate ring-fences the money raised for the specific programme, and is in addition to $15 million a year already provided for out of general rates in the 10-year budget, which began mid-2021. This is Goff’s second attempt at bringing in a climate targeted rate, which failed to gain councillor support in the 2021 budget. It comes as a strongly-worded council report said achieving promised emissions reductions would demand urgent action beyond what is funded in the council’s 10-year plan. “The scale of the challenge is enormous, but so too is the significance of the moment,” the report said, looking ahead to the pledge to halve Auckland’s emissions by 2030. Other parts of the CATR programme include $23 million a year for walking and cycling projects, and $1.3 million for urban tree-planting, food gardens and “tiny forests”.  The budget may also have to accommodate a $28 million refund of Goff’s Accommodation Provider’s Targeted Rate if the council doesn’t appeal a Court of Appeal ruling that the extra rate on hotels was “invalid”. Goff proposes continuing capital spending at the levels proposed in the 10-year budget. It is also not yet clear how sharing the overall rates burden will be skewed by property revaluations that take effect in July 2022. Analysis for Stuff in May 2021 suggested above average property value rises which occurred in the cheaper suburbs could deliver higher than average rates rises to those in southern Auckland. Goff is opposed to asset sales such as reducing the council’s cornerstone shareholding in Auckland International Airport, a topic also expected to surface in the wider budget debate. The two-term mayor will announce his political future in the new year, but is expected to not seek a third term, making this the last of six budgets he has led. Councillors will decide in a meeting on December 8 which budget ideas should go out for public consultation early next year, ahead of the main debate in May and June.

71	0	Saying nothing often is saying something.Supreme Court justices typically write opinions that say more than what is strictly necessary to decide the case before them. In those opinions, the justices also communicate with their colleagues, other courts, and the country about the issues, values, and people they deem especially important. When it comes to the possibility and history of racism, however, most of the current justices—with the important exception of Justice Sonia Sotomayor—tend to respond the way so many white people do: More often than not, they would rather just not talk about it.That tendency was evident this past term in most of the cases potentially implicating the subject of race.In Kansas v. Glover, the Court held that a police officer could lawfully stop a vehicle about which the officer knew only that its owner had a revoked driver’s license. In 2016, an officer in Lawrence, Kansas, ran a license-plate check on a moving pickup truck and found that the license of the registered owner—Charles Glover—had been revoked. The officer stopped the truck, which Glover was driving, and Kansas charged him with driving as a habitual violator. In his defense, Glover argued that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people against “unreasonable searches and seizures,” and the Kansas Supreme Court ruled in his favor, arguing that the officer had not adequately justified the stop and instead had “only a hunch” that Glover was driving.One wouldn’t know it from the several opinions written by the justices, but the defendant appears Black. Does racial profiling explain the officer’s decision to run the vehicle’s license plate? One cannot know.Seth W. Stoughton, Jeffrey J. Noble, and Geoffrey P. Albert: How to actually fix America’s policeThe Fourth Amendment protects people’s reasonable expectations of privacy when they are subject to searches and seizures by the police, but it is difficult to argue that people have such an expectation for their license plates, which are readily viewable by others when an individual is driving. So the Court understandably declined to read the Fourth Amendment as requiring police officers to explain their decision to run a license plate. But the risk of racial profiling is significant, and the justices might have drawn attention to the problem. That the officer spends most of his time running license plates seems unlikely, and at no point in this case did he give an explanation for his action. The justices might have also mentioned that police departments could insist that officers explain their reasons for running a vehicle’s license plate, to help limit racial profiling. Only Sotomayor expressed concern about the police stopping vehicles “based on nothing more than a demographic profile.”There was no claim of racial discrimination in this specific case, so the amicus briefs filed in Glover’s favor did not focus primarily on the issue of racial profiling. But some of them did mention racial and socioeconomic disparities in police stops across the country; one of them emphasized that Black drivers are more likely than white drivers to be pulled over by the police and pointed to “evidence that racial bias motivates many traffic stops.” The lack of more extensive discussion in the briefs may in part be a function of the Court’s long-standing resistance to discussing the subject in Fourth Amendment cases.Glover is not a one-off. It is extraordinarily rare for the justices—again, except for Sotomayor—to reference race or racism in cases involving police stops. For example, in Utah v. Strieff, in 2016, the Court held that when a police officer discovers a preexisting warrant for a person’s arrest, incriminating evidence seized pursuant to that arrest is admissible in court even if the officer’s stop of the individual was unconstitutional to begin with. The Court had nothing to say about whether it was enabling police to engage in racial profiling. Sotomayor wrote for herself alone that “it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny.”Read: Pleading for the fourthThere are many other examples one could cite and very few counterexamples. Racism was mentioned briefly in a majority opinion in 1968, in Terry v. Ohio, which provided the constitutional basis for the stop that occurred in Glover. There was also a brief discussion of race-based selective enforcement of the law in 1996, in Whren v. United States, but there the Court actually said that issues such as racial profiling and pretextual reasons for traffic stops may not be evaluated under the Fourth Amendment. Occasionally a justice will mention concerns about racism in a dissent, but that’s pretty much it.The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case (Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California) is another example from this term in which the majority might have at least acknowledged the freighted racial or ethnic context and potential implications of a case, regardless of whether doing so would have altered the outcome. Instead, the majority opinion, which held that the Trump administration had acted arbitrarily (and thus unlawfully) in rescinding the DACA program, limited itself to deciding whether the administration had violated procedural requirements set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act. Four of the five justices in the majority (and all four dissenters) rejected the argument of the respondents that the decision to end DACA was unconstitutional because it had been motivated by animus against the beneficiaries of the program, concluding that there was “no plausible equal protection claim.” Only Sotomayor talked about the possibility of racism given Donald Trump’s past public statements that Mexican immigrants are “people that have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, drug dealers, [and] rapists,” and his statement likening undocumented immigrants to “animals” who are responsible for “the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, [and] MS13.”Garrett Epps: The Trump administration’s incompetence was the saving grace of 700,000 DreamersIt should not be considered out of bounds for the justices to worry publicly about the possibility of racism just because the racist statements are made by the president of the United States. Such statements invariably affect federal officers further down the chain of command, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence of such influence in a given case to change the result.There were times this past term when most of the justices did better. In Ramos v. Louisiana, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial requires a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious crime in both federal and state courts. As briefs on behalf of the defendant emphasized, the history of non-unanimous jury verdicts has everything to do with race and racism. Louisiana and Oregon originally permitted non-unanimous jury verdicts to negate the impact of Black and other minority jurors and thereby increase the likelihood of convicting Black people and other minorities.The history in Louisiana is especially ugly. Reconstruction ended in 1876 as part of a compromise among white people that gave Republicans the White House and Democrats the end of military rule in the South. As Republicans tired of pursuing racial equality and joined the Democrats in courting business interests, former Confederate states were emboldened, and established an authoritarian, apartheid social order. Louisiana first embraced non-unanimous verdicts at its constitutional convention in 1898, when it declared white supremacy to be the official policy of the state and adopted numerous measures to disenfranchise Black people on a massive scale. Mississippi did much the same at its constitutional convention in 1890, and put the Confederate battle flag on its state flag in 1894.  Stephanie McCurry: The Confederacy was an antidemocratic, centralized StateTo its credit, the majority in Ramos did emphasize the racist history of laws permitting non-unanimous jury verdicts. But it did so over the fierce objections of the three dissenters. Writing for them, Justice Samuel Alito accused the majority of using “ad hominem rhetoric” that “contribut[es] to the worst current trends” in public discourse. Alito also declined to concede the existence of this racist history, instead deeming the issue irrelevant to the outcome of the case. “If Louisiana and Oregon originally adopted their laws allowing non-unanimous verdicts for these reasons, that is deplorable,” he wrote, as if the point were fairly debatable, “but what does that have to do with the broad constitutional question before us? The answer is: nothing.”(Yet in another case this term, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, Alito wrote a concurring opinion in which he elected to emphasize the anti-Catholic history of certain laws prohibiting government aid to religious schools. It was not necessary for him to have done so to decide the case; he had already joined the majority opinion, which itself noted this history even though the case almost certainly would have come out the same way had the history of anti-Catholic bigotry been different. So it is not as if he disfavors talk of history in general.)In another case, also this term, the Court again acknowledged some of the relevant history of racism in the United States, but it did not get the history quite right, making it sound better than it was. In Comcast Corporation v. National Association of African American–Owned Media, the Court held that a plaintiff who sues for racial discrimination in contracting under a federal law, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, has to show that race was not just a motivating factor, but a but-for cause of the plaintiff’s injury. It is much harder to prove but-for causation, which is why a major corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Trump administration wanted this requirement, while civil-rights groups opposed it. This case obviously had to do with potential racism: It was expressly about proving certain claims of racial discrimination.What is less obvious is that Congress originally passed Section 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, after the Civil War, to protect certain rights of formerly enslaved people. Concerns about whether the Thirteenth Amendment (which ended slavery) permitted Congress to pass this law led to the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment (which, among other things, includes a guarantee of constitutional equality).What is also less obvious is how narrow was the understanding of racial equality embraced by the Congress that passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Court in Comcast said that the law had been passed “to vindicate the rights of former slaves.” Sadly, the history is more complicated and depressing. The law was passed to protect the civil rights of formerly enslaved people, such as contracting, suing, and owning property. Civil rights for Black Americans at that time did not include political rights such as voting (hence the need for the Fifteenth Amendment) or social rights such as attending public schools with white children and marrying white people (rights—to America’s national shame—not protected by the Court until 1954 and 1967, respectively). These distinctions among civil, political, and social equality, which are not required by the text of the Constitution and no longer exist in U.S. constitutional law, were intended both to grant some measure of equality to the citizens who had been slaves and to strictly limit how much and what kind. By describing Section 1981 in sweeping terms, the Court failed to acknowledge the more sobering portions of the relevant history.It would have been interesting to see the Court respond to a constitutional challenge to affirmative action or to the Voting Rights Act in the current political climate. But this term does illustrate why, in light of American history, racism and race relations remain the nation’s most enduring domestic crisis.Leah Litman: Progressives’ Supreme Court victories will be fleetingThe impulse of most of the justices, most of the time, not to talk about race and racism is not excusable, let alone justifiable, but it is understandable. Why risk making oneself, one’s colleagues, and other audiences uncomfortable or even upset when it is not absolutely necessary to “go there”? When it comes to the subject of racism in this country, however, saying nothing often is saying something.The general silence of the justices can have spillover effects that produce bad law in cases in which correct interpretation of the Constitution and statutes requires serious engagement with the long, tragic history of racism in this nation—and with its continued existence. For example, a Court more attuned to history and current social reality would not have been as likely to declare that “things have changed dramatically” and a key part of the Voting Rights Act is no longer constitutionally justified, which is what the Court said and held in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. The Court’s equal-protection jurisprudence in the areas of affirmative action and disparate-impact liability might also look different. But if more often than not the justices can’t—or won’t—grapple with the nation’s racist history and present, then more often than not the law articulated by the Court will continue to be unworthy of the aspiration engraved over the front entrance to the building in which it sits: equal justice under law.
297	2	"Donald Trump's administration have removed all mentions of climate change from the White House website.They have been replaced by a new energy plan that makes no mention of global warming and commits only to helping reduce the prices paid by Americans for their energy.Before Barack Obama's team handed over the website, a number of pages made explicit reference to his work responding to climate change. Chief among those was a page celebrating the Climate Action Plan, a landmark deal announced by Obama in 2013 that looked to respond to the challenge of climate change.But President Trump has committed to remove that plan and the regulation attached to it, as part of a commitment to save money for Americans and to get rid of policies that he believes to be unnecessary.That pledge is made as one of six ""Issues"" on the site, which also include President Trump's policies on jobs, military, law enforcement and trade deals.The only mention of the environment is a reference to cleaning the air and sea.""Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment,"" the page reads.

850	4	The Paris agreement has been ratified. Only one year after negotiating this historic treaty, it has come into force. This signals that the vast majority of governments around the world remain committed to fighting climate change. Yet that was the easy part. Actually realising these commitments made at COP21 in Paris will require concerted, concrete action for many years to come. Though the vast majority of countries in the world have clear goals in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), these are not action plans, nor are the NDCs strong enough to actually keep global average temperature from rising more than 2C.The Paris agreement is a truly global commitment, spanning developed and developing countries around the world. Yet for many developing and least-developed countries, in particular, contributing to the fight against climate change requires taking targeted actions while also prioritising economic development and poverty reduction. Here are five areas in the energy sector that offer such a win-win.While energy is the foremost contributor to carbon emissions, access to it is also a critical enabler of human and economic development. At the same time, the billions who lack access have not contributed to climate change. Any concerns that achieving energy access for all would magnify the challenges of energy security or climate change are unfounded: it would only increase global energy demand by 1% in 2030 and CO2 emissions by 0.6%.The latest figures, recently published in the World Energy Outlook 2016, show that an estimated 1.2 billion people, 16% of the global population, still do not have access to electricity. Access to clean cooking receives far less attention than electrification and in many ways is more difficult to achieve. An estimated 2.7 billion people, or almost 40% of the global population who are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, still rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking.Despite the urgency of the problem, investment is falling far short of what the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed to achieve universal access by 2030 – around $50bn (£40bn) per year. Dedicated policies to promote access are essential to break the vicious cycle of energy poverty, in which growth in incomes and living standards are severely hindered by a lack of energy services. Technology can also be a major enabler of effective policymaking and improvement on the ground: decentralised renewable energy is providing an increasingly viable way to close the access gap in rural areas, particularly for remote settlements far from the existing grid.Around 6.5 million premature deaths worldwide are attributed each year to poor air quality, making this the world’s fourth-largest threat to human health after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking. This is an energy sector problem, as energy production and use, mostly from unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion, are the most important sources of air pollution from human activity. The harmful effects of energy poverty are felt most heavily in developing countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Confronting the twin challenges of CO2 emissions and air pollution means dispensing with short-term thinking and stop-gap solutions. IEA analysis shows that proven energy policies and technologies can chart a development path that delivers major cuts in air pollution around the world and bring health benefits, universal access to energy and improve sustainability.Though the Paris agreement is a global accord between countries, much of the hard work will be taken in the cities of the world. Cities dominate energy demand, and by extension are responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions. As IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 highlighted, the world’s urban areas accounted for about 64% of global primary energy use and produced 70% of the planet’s CO2 emissions in 2013.These shares will rise as cities grow and urban economic activity expands. As the world seeks to make more efficient use of its energy resources, increase energy security and meet global climate targets, cities must take a leading role in the energy transition.Leadership must of course start from the top; policy at the national level must encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies, and include greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, carbon pricing mechanisms, and investment in energy research, development and demonstration. But these targets must then be complemented by action at the local level through efforts including sustainable transportation planning, building codes and improved data collection.Unfortunately today, many of the megacities of the world, particularly those in Asia, are still powered by antiquated subcritical coal-fired power plants. These can have emissions intensities of around 1,000kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour (that is, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released for each unit of power produced). More modern, highly efficient coal-fired power plants may have an intensity of around 800, yet a natural gas turbine can reach about 350. A coal plant equipped with carbon capture and storage can release less than 150kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour. At the very end of the spectrum, renewable sources like wind and solar have zero emissions. Globally, the average intensity of power generation today is just over 500kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour.But, to align with the 450 Scenario in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2016 – a scenario consistent with limiting the global increase in temperature to no more than 2C – the emissions intensity of power generation needs to fall much further and faster, to around 80kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour by 2040. A path to achieving this is likely to include a combination of a more rapid shift to low-carbon technologies worldwide (especially wind, solar and hydropower), fuel switching (such as from coal to gas), efficiency improvements and in some markets, adoption of carbon capture and storage.This low-carbon transition must take place on a level playing field. Fossil-fuel subsidies distort energy markets, promoting inefficient use of energy and increasing energy-related CO2 emissions. They are a roadblock on the way to a cleaner and more efficient energy future.They have also consistently dwarfed the amounts allocated by governments to subsidise renewable energy. In 2014, for example, fossil fuel consumption subsidies of almost $500bn (£400bn) were more than three-times higher than renewables subsidies of some $140bn (£112bn). But there has been progress. World Energy Outlook 2016 reports that the value of global fossil-fuel consumption subsidies in 2015 was estimated at $325bn (£260bn), reflecting lower fossil-fuel prices but also a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in some countries.In the case of renewables, rapidly falling costs in recent years have been welcome, but in many cases subsidies are still needed to level the playing field with fossil-fuel alternatives that emit CO2 and other pollutants. But as technology costs continue to come down, and hopefully the environmental impacts of fossil fuel use is better reflected in pricing, more and more new renewable energy projects will be competitive without support.Achieving universal access to clean, modern energy services while meeting global climate targets is no easy task. But with the right policies, aimed at the right sectors, with the right technologies, the world can soon be on track for a sustainable energy future.

189	3	UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the political will to fight climate change has faded at the same time as it is getting worse for those feeling its effects.Guterres made the comments after arriving in New Zealand on Sunday where addressed the media alongside Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Auckland. Guterres plans to spend three days there as part of a trip to the South Pacific to highlight climate change’s global threat.“Climate change is running faster than what we are … The last four years have been the hottest registered,” Guterres said.Countries are not living up to their commitments under the 2016 Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, he said.“We are not on track to achieve the objectives defined in the Paris Agreement, and the paradox is that as things are getting worse on the ground, political will seems to be fading,” he added.A string of apocalyptic reports on the state of the planet is bringing home the need for concrete steps to tackle climate change and environmental catastrophe.One million species are on the brink of extinction. Carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, pushing targets from the Paris accord further out of reach.Guterres commended Ardern for introducing an ambitious bill last week aiming to make New Zealand mostly carbon neutral by 2050 while giving some leeway to farmers.He noted that Pacific Island nations are on the front line of climate change.“We cannot allow for runaway climate change,” he said. “We need to protect the lives of our people and we need to protect our planet.”Guterres’ trip comes ahead of the Climate Action Summit he plans to convene in September in New York City.In Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, Guterres will meet with families whose lives have been upended by cyclones, flooding and other extreme weather events.Pacific island countries face an especially dire risk from climate change because of sea level rise. In some cases, low-lying countries could disappear completely.Fiji is working to build a coalition of more than 90 countries from the Caribbean, Africa and Asia facing the climate crisis.“We hope that the secretary-general will draw far more inspiration from his first visit to go further, faster and deeper with the climate summit,” said Fiji’s UN Ambassador Satyendra Prasad. “We are very hopeful that the climate summit will mark a turning point.”Ardern, speaking at the joint press conference in Auckland, called climate change “the biggest challenge” facing the global community and said it would be “gross negligence” to avoid the issue.But the United Nations‘ push on climate change is shaping up amid geopolitical shifts: the United States under President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, giving China more space to assert its views.Trump announced in 2017 the US would exit the landmark Paris deal, but under its terms the withdrawal will only become effective in 2020.The US administration is not taking part in summit preparations but has not said it will skip the event, according to UN officials.Guterres’ mission may also be further complicated by Trump’s nomination of Kelly Knight Craft as UN ambassador.Craft, who is married to a major coal magnate, raised eyebrows for declaring that she believed “both sides” of climate science, indicating she may well be out of sync with the UN on the issue.The summit is seen as critical because of US resistance to discussing climate change at other forums, including the G7 and G20, and again last week at a meeting of the Arctic Council in Finland.“What people are looking for is countries to commit to major ambition increases in 2025 and 2030 at the summit or in 2020,” said Nick Mabey, head of the E3G climate think-tank.This should include legally binding targets for countries to phase out coal, become climate neutral, and invest in climate resilience, especially for the poorest countries, he added.

112	4	"As COP 26 takes place in Glasgow, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern talks to us about New Zealand's commitment to emissions reduction in an extended joint interview with the Herald, US broadcaster NBC and news agency AFP as part of Covering Climate Now, a coalition of international media reporting climate change. Video / NZ HeraldSenior Political Reporter, NZ HeraldLong-awaited details of how the Government expects to finance its climate change work look set to be announced next week, when the Government sets out its budget priorities for 2022.The Government will not confirm what sort of announcement will be made, but when questions relating to funding and financing climate change were put to the Government on Friday, the Minister of Finance's office said more detail would be released on Wednesday, when Treasury releases its HYEFU forecast, and the Government publishes its Budget Policy Statement.At the last budget, Finance Minister Grant Robertson said he was working on ways of updating New Zealand's public finance regime to tackle long-term challenges like climate change.A paper on that work, released to the Herald under the Official Information Act, shows a range of options.One option considered by Treasury is to establish climate change as its own ""vote"" in future Budgets, in line with a recommendation from the Climate Change Commission.Government Budgets are organised into different areas, called ""votes"" - like vote health, vote education, and vote defence.Climate does not, as yet, have its own vote.Treasury said vote climate change would be a ""multi-agency"" appropriation, meaning it could bid for money that would be disbursed to multiple parts of government to tackle climate change.The Commission said this would ""support the scale of response required and make sure action [on climate change] is coordinated.""Treasury thinks the aims of such a vote would ""increase transparency and monitoring"" of climate funding, support ""coordination"" and support the ""adequacy, scale and durability of funding for climate change"".Whether Treasury is full-throated in its support of the idea is unknown - the rest of the commentary on vote climate was heavily redacted.Treasury was concerned that it's not yet clear just what qualifies as climate expenditure, saying direct mitigation subsidies, adaptation subsidies, research and development, and policy could all arguably qualify.""It is often difficult to definitively label something as ""climate aligned,"" officials said.One option for funding the transition - which Robertson committed to in the last budget - is to recycle revenue from the Emissions Trading Scheme towards climate change initiatives.Treasury raised some concerns with the use of the ETS to fund climate change, noting the price of ETS units was ""volatile"" and the number of units auctioned off could reduce, meaning less money for the Government.This could create difficulties if the Government ""reduces the number of available units in order to accelerate domestic emissions reduction"".Revenue from the ETS would likely decrease, while the need for subsidies to aid transition increased.This could be further complicated if the Government allowed companies to purchase ETS units offshore - something currently banned.If this happened, the Government ""would need to decrease the number of units auctioned by the same volume, decreasing the available proceeds from the ETS"".The paper said Treasury hoped to find some agreement on funding in October, but Climate Change Minister James Shaw wasn't reached then.Shaw said Covid and the Government's Emissions Reduction Plan had delayed work.The Emissions Reduction Plan is the Government's climate change bible and is currently out for consultation. A final plan will be published next year and will include policies the Government will implement to cut emissions in line with the country's targets.""The decision you're talking about feeds into when we said we were going to link the Emissions Reduction Plan to the Budget - the decisions will feed into that,"" Shaw said.He could not say whether a climate change vote had been established, citing budget confidentiality."
846	3	Climate change is risky business — including for officials at the Federal Reserve. An increase in severe weather events could lead to bank failures as property prices rapidly adjust, stoke uncertainty and harm economic growth. That makes global warming and its fallout relevant to the Fed, which is responsible for both financial regulation and for guiding the nation’s economy toward full employment and stable prices. But those threats force the central bank, which prizes its political independence, to walk a tightrope. The Fed could be criticized for weighing in on a highly politicized issue: Survey data suggest that Democrats tend to be much more concerned with climate than Republicans. Against that backdrop, United States monetary policymakers have been slow to create a concerted climate change research program, even as peers like the Bank of England began to talk frequently about the economics of global warming. This week brought a significant shift in that approach. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of 12 regional branches, held the system’s first-ever climate research conference. It is partly a sign that the central bank is ready to talk about a global economic agenda item — and partly a recognition that the risks are too important for the authorities to ignore. “Why now?” Mary C. Daly, president of the branch, asked in her speech to open the event. “The answer is simple: It’s essential to achieving our mission.” The Fed’s job is to promote economic stability, and that requires understanding emerging challenges related to climate, Ms. Daly said. Power outages could shut down the electronic payment system, she pointed out, and increase the demand for cash — which the Fed manages. Damage from droughts and floods could come at a heavy cost to insurers or banks whose customers struggle to make payments. “By participating more actively in climate-related research and practice, the Federal Reserve can be more effective in supporting a strong economy and a stable financial system,” Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed’s board in Washington, said in prepared remarks at the same event.The event, and the speeches that came with it, made it clear that the Fed is on the cusp of diving into climate-related research more intently. Ms. Brainard said the central bank was discussing how it might participate in a network of about 40 global central banks that was created in 2017 to promote discussions about climate-related financial and macroeconomic issues. The goal of becoming more active with the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, she said, would be to “learn from our international colleagues’ approaches to measuring and managing climate risks in the financial system.” The Fed may stop short of the climate-related action embraced by some of its global peers. The Bank of England’s head, Mark Carney, talks openly and regularly about the need for changes. The institution is stress-testing its financial system against potential climate developments, essentially running scenarios to see how banks would fare amid different government policies and weather outcomes. Christine Lagarde, the new president of the European Central Bank, left the door open to using environmental sustainability as a criterion when the central bank carries out bond-buying programs to bolster the economy.She noted in recent written responses to the European Parliament that once the European Commission set a standard for bonds to qualify as “green,” the central bank would “need to assess whether and how it can apply” to asset purchase programs. In America, that kind of activity is not yet on the table. Climate change “is an absolute first-order issue,” the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell, said in a question-and-answer session in Denver last month. “Less obvious is that it’s a first-order business for central banks.” “We’re not in a place where, I think, we would conduct monetary policy to deal with climate-change-type issues,” he added, explaining that the Fed already regulates banks with an eye on severe weather. The Fed can legally buy only government- or agency-backed securities, so some sort of green buying campaign would most likely be beyond its authority. Other central banks have more flexibility. The mere fact that America’s central bank is increasingly talking about — and researching — climate developments could expose it to congressional criticism, said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “In a sense, the Federal Reserve is picking a dog” by placing importance on a concern more squarely embraced by Democrats, he said. But that does not suggest to him that it should shy away. “Commenting on climate risks for purely partisan reasons would be a mistake,” he said, but talking about it because of potential macroeconomic and financial risks “is what the Fed was created to do.” It is appropriate for the Fed to avoid becoming too activist, said George Selgin, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. “There’s really not much the Fed — or any central bank — can do to address climate,” Mr. Selgin said. “There is a temptation for people to look upon the Fed as some Wizard of Oz that can solve everything.” This is not the first time that the Fed, which is overseen by Congress but granted independence in its day-to-day decision-making, has proceeded with caution in talking about an issue with potential economic effects but deep partisan identification. Income inequality provides a close comparison. Democrats have longed focused on the topic. When a former Fed chair, Janet L. Yellen, gave a speech on inequality and its potential economic implications in 2014, she drew rebuke from some congressional Republicans. As social norms have shifted, the Fed has talked about inequality more openly and regularly without a backlash. A similar evolution seems to be underway when it comes to the climate. “It is vital for monetary policymakers to understand the nature of climate disturbances to the economy, as well as their likely persistence and breadth, in order to respond effectively,” Ms. Brainard said Friday. “Work to understand the implications of climate-related risks for our economy and financial system is at an early stage.”
255	4	In June 1988 a NASA scientist, Dr. James Hansen, appeared on a very hot day in Washington and told a group of powerful senators that a grim future lay ahead. Carbon emissions, he said, had raised average global temperatures to the highest levels in recorded human history, bringing heat waves, droughts and other disruptions to people’s lives. “The greenhouse effect has been detected,” he said, “and it is changing our climate now.”That same year a collection of scientists assembled by the United Nations — known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — delivered much the same message, warning pointedly of rising seas and threats to biodiversity. Four years later, world leaders meeting in Rio de Janeiro signed a landmark agreement to stabilize “greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”We knew, three decades ago, about global warming and its consequences. We suspected, even then, that the potentially catastrophic future forecast in the I.P.C.C.’s latest report, released on Monday — a report the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, called a “code red for humanity” — could well come to pass.What have we done with that knowledge? Very little, for lots of reasons. Timid leaders, feckless legislatures. Interminable arguments between rich and poor nations over who bears responsibility. Well-financed disinformation campaigns from big polluters like Exxon Mobil. On a purely human level, there’s the reluctance of people living worry-free in the here and now to make the investments and sacrifices necessary to protect future generations.All in all, the past 30 years have been a colossal series of missed opportunities. Good ideas squandered. Time lost. The performance of the United States, historically the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (China is now the biggest annual emitter) and therefore presumed leader of any effort to confront the problem, has been particularly disheartening.President George H.W. Bush, having boldly promised to counter the “greenhouse effect” with what he called “the White House effect,” had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the Rio conference, where he made sure that the treaty signed there had no real teeth. Similarly blinded by fossil fuel interests, and worried that the United States was being asked to carry a disproportionate share of the burden, Congress in 1997 refused to even consider, much less ratify, the agreement worked out by Vice President Al Gore in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce emissions from industrialized nations.President George W. Bush — who, like his father, talked a good game in his campaign — was no better. Hypnotized by the fossil fuel enthusiasts around him, notably Karl Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney, he repudiated Kyoto altogether, greatly embarrassing his E.P.A. administrator, Christie Whitman, who eventually quit. Even Barack Obama, who understood the issue and appreciated its gravity, but was fatally detached when it came to legislative infighting, fell short. He failed to persuade a Congress controlled by his own party to cap emissions of carbon dioxide.Mr. Obama partly compensated for this with an admirable suite of regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing emissions from vehicles, oil and gas wells and power plants, which gave John Kerry, then the secretary of state, the credibility he needed to help forge a new global treaty in Paris in 2015. But these initiatives were always vulnerable to repeal, and were unsurprisingly and expeditiously repudiated by President Donald Trump, who seemed to have no idea what climate change was all about and had no interest in learning.Such is the weight of history that President Biden bears as he faces an opportunity to assert American leadership in advance of a global summit on climate change in Glasgow in November. There, it is hoped that the 190 or so countries in attendance will greatly improve on the commitments they made in Paris to reduce emissions. The Washington Post has called this meeting a “moment of truth’’ for climate change. To anyone who has read the I.P.C.C. report, that is not journalistic hyperbole.The report’s main points are these: First, nations have waited so long to curb emissions that a hotter future is essentially locked in, as are more droughts, more forest fires, more crippling heat waves, more sea level rise, more floods. The greenhouse gases that have already been pumped into the atmosphere are going to stay there a long time, inflicting misery for years to come.This summer has already produced huge floods in Central Europe, Nigeria, Uganda and India, blazes in Greece and Siberia, wildfires erasing entire towns in California and Canada, murderous heat waves in the Pacific Northwest, the drying up of Colorado River reservoirs. “What more can numbers show us that we cannot already see?” asked one U.N. climate official. Fair question. But what the numbers show is that these meteorological calamities will become routine unless the world takes dramatic steps to get a grip on emissions.In their analysis of the new report, the Times reporters Henry Fountain and Brad Plumer offer this illustration. Humans have already heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century. If global warming rises to around 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years, heat waves that would have occurred once every 50 years can be expected to show up once every 10 years. At 4 degrees of warming, they’ll show up every year.Point two: Humanity can still take a stand. It must. If countries make a coordinated effort to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by, say, midcentury, and undertake through reforestation and other means to remove carbon from the air, global warming might level off at around 1.5 degrees. This in turn means mustering the will to stave off a darker future than the one the world has already locked itself into. It also means, in policy terms, a rapid shift away from fossil fuels; big investments in wind, solar and nuclear power; a rebuilt electric grid; more efficient homes and buildings — in short, a wholly different energy delivery system.Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced a strategy to shift Americans from gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles, thus resurrecting an Obama initiative Mr. Trump had canceled. This is an important step. But Mr. Biden is not going to get the energy transformation he wants via regulation any more than Mr. Obama could. For this, he will need Congress.Can Congress deliver? No small question. The Senate, split evenly between the parties, took forever to approve an infrastructure bill, which has only modest climate-related measures in it and should not have been all that controversial. Ahead lies something a lot more difficult — winning approval of a giant $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill that can be approved with only 51 votes (all the Democrats and the vice president), thus avoiding a Republican filibuster and opening a legislative pathway for a range of big-ticket social programs and Mr. Biden’s climate policies.Of these, two are of paramount importance and are essential to honoring Mr. Biden’s campaign promise to cut America’s emissions in half by 2030, eliminate fossil fuel emissions from power plants by 2035 and zero out all greenhouse gases by midcentury — pretty much what the I.P.C.C. wants. One is billions in incentives for electric vehicles and for clean energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear power. The other is a clean electricity standard that, as currently envisioned, would reward power producers that reduce emissions and penalize those that don’t. There are likely to be add-ons from individual senators, like Chris Van Hollen’s proposal, unveiled this month, to tax Exxon, Chevron and a handful of other major oil and gas companies to get them to pay for floods, fires and other disasters linked to the fossil fuels they have produced over the years.How great would it be if the Senate and then the House approved such a package before the climate summit in Glasgow? One person who would shout to the rafters is John Kerry, once again the White House’s point man on international negotiations. He’ll be the face of America’s resolve in Scotland, and he’ll need tangible evidence to prove that Washington cares. Congress can give it to him.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

287	4	Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series of climate briefs. To read the others, and more of our climate coverage, visit our hub at economist.com/climatechangeON NOVEMBER 21ST 2016, a line of thunderstorms passed through the Australian state of Victoria. By the end of the following day, it had sent 3,000 people to hospital. Storms typically hurt people by blowing down buildings, flooding streets or setting fires. In this case, though, the casualties were caused by asthma. Late that afternoon a peculiarly powerful downdraft generated by the storm front pushed a layer of cold air thick with pollen, dust and other particles through Melbourne. The city’s ambulance service was swamped within hours. At least ten people died.The risks that weather and climate pose to human life are not always as specific to the peculiar circumstances of time and place as that sudden-onset asthma epidemic. But they are complex functions of what, where and who, and their mechanisms are not always easily discerned. What is more, they can interact with each other. For example, if the southern spring of 2016 had not brought weather particularly well suited to the growth of allergenic grasses, would that stormy afternoon have been so catastrophic? Such complexities mean that a gradual change to the climate can lead to sudden changes in the impacts on human beings when things pass a certain threshold. And that threshold will not necessarily be discernible in advance.Not all the ways in which today’s weather harms people will be exacerbated by climate change. But research suggests that many of them will. Most of the problems people have with weather and climate come from extremes. When means shift a little, extremes can shift a lot (see chart). Today’s rare extremes become tomorrow’s regular disturbances; tomorrow’s extremes are completely new.How damaging these impacts will be to the economic and physical welfare of humankind depends on how much warming takes place and how well people adapt—both of which are currently unknowable. But it is possible to get a qualitative sense of what they could mean by looking at the range of timescales over which they operate. At one end, a thunderstorm’s pollen surge, sweeping by in minutes; at the other, sea-level rise which could last longer than any civilisation in human history.In terms of short-lived events, the worst sort of bad day that the world’s weather can offer is generally taken to be the one on which you get hit by a tropical cyclone, which is why hurricanes (as they are known in the Atlantic) and typhoons (as they are known in some other places) have become so heated a part of the arguments about climate change. A single hurricane can do more than $100bn in damage, as Harvey did when it hit Houston in August 2017, or kill thousands, as Maria did the following month in Puerto Rico.Tropical cyclones can only form over a sea or ocean with a surface temperature of 27°C or more. The area where such temperatures are possible will definitely increase with warming. But that does not mean hurricanes will become more common. Their formation also requires that the wind be blowing at a similar speed close to the surface and at greater altitudes—and this condition, models say, will become less common in future over many of the places where hurricanes spawn. Thus models do not predict a great increase in the number of tropical cyclones; Atlantic hurricanes may well become more rare.But more heat in the oceans means that those tropical cyclones which do get going are more likely to become intense. There is thus broad agreement among experts that the proportion of hurricanes which reach category four or five looks set to increase. So, too, does the rainfall associated with them, because warmer air holds more moisture. Studies of the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey suggest that warming due to climate change increased its rainfall by about 15%. Extreme rainfall events of many sorts increase in warmer worlds.The heat which powers hurricanes at sea can, on land, kill directly. Humans cool themselves by sweating, a process that becomes less effective the more humid the atmosphere. Combining the heat and the humidity into something called the wet-bulb temperature (WBT) allows scientists to measure temperatures in a way that reflects that difficulty (similar measures in America are called the heat index). WBTs of 35°C and above are lethal.Until recently it was thought that WBTs that high would not be seen until warming had continued for decades. A review of weather-station data from 1979 on, however, shows that for very brief periods local WBTs almost that high are already being experienced occasionally in South-East Asia, the Persian Gulf and the coastal south-west of America, and that their frequency had doubled since 1979. With 2.5°C (4.5°F) of global warming above pre-industrial levels, which is quite possible in the second half of this century if action on emissions is not significantly increased, these unliveable conditions will become a regular occurence in parts of the humid subtropics.Another recent study defines climates which people find liveable according to where, historically, they have lived, and then sees which such areas move beyond those climatic bounds as the world warms. Temperature rises quite plausible by 2070 would see many areas where people live today develop climates unlike any that people have lived in before (see map). Some econometric analyses based on interannual differences suggests that, in general, higher temperatures lead to lower labour productivity and more violence.In the nearer term, there is an increased likelihood of heatwaves. Between August 3rd and 16th 2003, Europe saw 39,000 more deaths than would have been expected on the basis of previous years. The excess mortality was due to a summer that was hotter, by some estimates, than any for the previous 500 years. Modelling suggests that, even in 2003, climate change had made such a heatwave at least twice as likely.Extreme heatwaves are becoming more frequent not only because temperatures are climbing. Warming-induced changes in the climate system can weaken the processes that normally move weather around the world, allowing conditions to get stuck. Such stalling can be the difference between a hot week and a lethal month, or in winter a cold snap and a deep freeze.Hot summers can also harm crops, both directly—many important crops are very sensitive to temperatures above a certain threshold—and through water stress. Milder winters can also do harm by allowing pests to survive, hurting yields.When unusually hot and dry conditions suck the moisture off the land, the subsequent droughts do not just exacerbate the problems for farmers. They also increase the risk and severity of fires—which an increase in the amount of lightning will, in some regions, spark off more frequently. This is an issue not just in warm, fire-prone places such as Australia. For several months in the summer of 2019, large swathes of northern Russian and Canadian forest—and even some of Greenland’s few woodlands—went up in flames.Unusual infernos have plagued California for many years now, again as a result of parched conditions, which are drying out rivers, lakes and underground aquifers across the entire south-west of the state. This is no regular drought. It is 19 years in the making, enough for it to be classed as a “megadrought”.Tree-ring records show only four such in the region over the past 1,200 years, and suggest that this could be as bad as the worst of them, which took place in the 17th century. Such droughts are linked to changing patterns of circulation in the ocean. Models suggest that such patterns are themselves altered by warming, which can thus change the frequency of other large-scale regional shifts in the climate.And then there is the longest term change: sea level. The sea’s rise comes from three different mechanisms—the expansion of the oceans as they absorb more heat, the addition of meltwater from shrinking glaciers on land, and the physical break down of ice sheets such as those on Antarctica and Greenland. The first two factors are currently driving an increase of about 1cm every three years, and are set to do so at a similar rate well into the 21st century even if global warming is held well below 2°C; the time it takes seawater to warm up gives the process a significant inertia. Such rises will erode coasts and increase flooding—especially when pushed inland by the surges intense storms produce.The big unknown, though, once you get to the century time scale, is the stability of the great ice sheets. It is widely believed that there are points of no return after which such sheets are doomed slowly to collapse, thus increasing sea levels by many metres. Where these points of no return are is not clear. It is possible that they might be passed even if warming is kept to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial.A high likelihood of drought and crop failures; changes to regional climate that upset whole economies; storms more destructive in both their winds and their rains; seawater submerging beaches and infiltrating aquifers: what is known about the impacts of climate change is already worrying enough. The known unknowns add to the anxiety. It is not just the question of the ice sheets, an uncertainty massive enough to weigh down a continent. There are other tipping points, too, which could see ocean currents shift, or deserts spread. And in the spaces between all these troubles are the unknown unknowns, as surprising, and deadly, as a thunderstorm that kills through pollen.■Sign up to our fortnightly climate-change newsletter hereDig deeper:Climate brief 1: Why tackling global warming is a challenge without precedentClimate brief 2: How modelling articulates the science of climate changeClimate Brief 3: Humanity’s immense impact on Earth’s climate and carbon cycleThe Economist’s climate-change hub
773	4	Wholesale derision greeted a spectacularly clueless statement from Republican Senator Ted Cruz last week, after President Joe Biden committed to signing the United States back up to the Paris Agreement. Cruz said Biden is “more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh”.Cruz’s comment was met with abject criticism on Twitter where users pointed out the obvious: the Paris Agreement is a multinational effort and not, obviously, focused solely on the people of Paris.The trouble is Cruz is not alone. Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebart was just one who echoed his words, saying she does not work for the people of Paris.Which, if you think of the raft of climate policy Biden needs to get through Congress, makes you realise the challenge still at hand convincing those lawmakers who either doubt reality, or act as such for the sake of the constituents who voted them in.One could say that even those who advocate positive change have been equally obstructive in enacting it. If we look at the billions promised by richer nations at the 2015 negotiations in Paris, earmarked to help poorer nations adapt to climate change, the contributions have been woefully short.A total $100bn per year was promised, yet the amount of financing stands at an estimated $20-30bn, according to World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) deputy climate lead Vanessa Perez-Cirera – no more than 30 percent of what was committed. And according to the UN Environment Programme’s Adaptation Gap Report, $500bn a year is the amount we should be targeting anyway.Still, with the headwind of a new US presidency, optimism by pledge was once again ramped up at the virtual Climate Adaptation Summit hosted in the Netherlands this week.Veteran negotiator John Kerry, appointed as Biden’s climate envoy, is back in the fray, pointing out that a drastic reduction in emissions must go hand in hand with adaptation to manage the effects of extreme weather.“There is no adapting to a 3C or 4C world, except for the very richest and most privileged,” he warned.“Some of the impacts are inevitable, but if we don’t act boldly and immediately by building resilience, we will see dramatic reversals in economic development for everybody, and the poorest and most vulnerable communities will pay the highest price.”When I spoke to WWF’s Perez-Cirera, she said adaptation is a moral imperative of climate justice and inaction will have disastrous consequences.“If we do not adapt there will be a huge impact in terms of social unrest,” she told me. “We are talking about massive migrations from south to north, with water and food disputes between nations. And conflicts. Conflicts between countries and within countries.”She said that with desperate economies struggling to clamber out of recession, everyone is competing for public finance. “But there is hope,” Perez-Cirera added. “We can bring synergistic approach to investments which will help the world to adapt to climate change while mitigating its effects at the same time.”That means funding nature-based solutions to build back better, and investing in the likes of forests, coral reefs and mangroves to help populations adapt to the worst effects of climate change while reducing emissions at the same time.It seems like sound policy, but convincing the likes of Ted Cruz and the Trumpian dinosaurs may be a forlorn hope.1.

772	3	"US President Joe Biden's administration sounded the alarm about the worsening climate and its impact on national security this week. Reports from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House on Thursday highlighted the ties between climate change, geopolitical conflict, and migration. In a summary of the intelligence assessments, the White House said future extreme weather events ""will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to US national security interests, from physical impacts that could cascade into security challenges, to how countries respond to the climate challenge."" The ODNI report said 11 countries, including Haiti and Afghanistan, are ""especially are likely to face warming temperatures, more extreme weather and disruption to ocean patterns that will threaten their energy, food, water, and health security.""The Department of Defense (DoD), in its climate risk analysis, said it will now ""consider the effects of climate change at every level of the DoD enterprise.""  The DHS report aimed to put together a strategy to ""safeguard the homeland from current and projected climate change-driven disasters."" This year alone, the US witnessed extreme heatwaves, multiple hurricanes and blazing wildfires, which experts say are a result of climate change.  The reports were also the first time the US government officially recognized that climate change is driving migration.The assessment from the White House suggested that the executive and legislative branches could work together to make climate-related reasons a consideration when granting refugee status. It also highlighted how existing US foreign aid programs could be best used to ""reduce the risk of forced migration.""Nina von Uexkull, an associate professor at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden, told DW  where she believes geopolitical tensions will escalate the most due to climate change.""When assessing the security implications of climate change we rely on observations of the past. How do states react to increasing scarcity or new resources becoming available? Generally, we do not see that armed conflicts between states are fought over resources that are directly affected by climate change such as freshwater,"" von Uexkull said.""It is, however, plausible and in line with existing evidence that increasing, not necessarily violent, tensions and disputes will arise from an increasingly ice-free Arctic and the resources and transport routes that become available in that region and changes in water availability in transboundary waters such as the Nile in coming decades,"" she added.The ODNI report also suggested that ""climate change is likely to increase the risk of instability in countries in Central Africa and small island states in the Pacific."" Von Uexkull agreed with the assessment that Central Africa is a region that will see ""increased humanitarian and development challenges"" due to climate change-related conflicts, citing countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.    ""The challenges to small island states in the Pacific are different,"" von Uexkull said. ""They are currently not affected by large-scale armed conflict but unmitigated climate change and resulting sea-level rise will threaten local populations' livelihood. This is no doubt very challenging and existentially threatening in the long term, but this does not necessarily mean that violence or instability will result from slow-moving changes like sea-level rise.""The reports were released ahead of the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, which will take place from October 31 to November 12. Biden will attend the talks, with the US delegation expected to urge other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biden's advocacy of climate change mitigation is a stark contrast from his predecessor, Donald Trump. During his tenure as president, Trump downplayed climate change and pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris Accords.The US later moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on January 20, hours after Biden was sworn in as president. Florian Krampe, the director of the Climate Change and Risk Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Sweden, believes the US should work closely with European allies such as Germany to tackle climate-related security risks.""Climate and security become inextricably linked — but the solutions aren't solely, or even primarily, military. Climate action, development and peacebuilding have to go hand in hand,"" Krampe told DW. ""Climate change is the defining security challenge of our time today – in the West and beyond,"" he said when asked whether climate change poses a greater security risk to the West than terrorism. He cited the recent catastrophic flooding in Germany as one example, and noted that in countries such as Somalia, Mali and Afghanistan, ""climate-related impacts on people's livelihoods are one of the many complex drivers that push people into joining extremist groups."" "
14	5	"Derek Cheng is a political reporter for the New Zealand HeraldWhen Jacinda Ardern spoke at a town hall meeting 10 years ago as a fresh, young MP and talked about climate change, she was roundly booed - even from members of her own family.Ardern shared the anecdote this morning (NZT) while on the Safeguarding Our Planet panel, alongside broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.""What greater threat to our wellbeing is there than the current threat of climate change,"" Ardern told the audience.The panel chairman, former US vice-president and climate change campaigner Al Gore, asked Ardern how she dealt with resistance to change, including people who still deny that climate change is happening.""Ten years ago, when I first came into Parliament, I remember standing at a town hall meeting and speaking passionately about the issue of climate change, and being roundly booed, including I think by members of my own family,"" Ardern said.""But even in that 10-year period, how dramatic the shift has been. No longer do you have the significant questioning of the science.""How do we move in the face of resistance? We don't do it alone. We build a movement with us.""When asked how she would talk to a world leader who didn't believe in climate change, she said she would take the person to the Pacific.""You don't have to know anything about the science ... to have someone from one of the Pacific island nations take you to a place where they used to play as a child on the coast and show you where they used to stand and now where the water rises.""Then it's a matter of saying, 'You don't have to cede power by acting on climate change. There's nothing to fear about your individual political status. This is about being on the right side of history'.""Ardern said one of the obstacles to enduring change was the three-year political cycle.She alluded to the Government's proposal for zero carbon legislation, which would require future governments to have targets for carbon emissions.""This needs to be something we embed in our national psyches ... and it needs to endure beyond us as individuals.""We have the chance here to transition and future-proof our economies ... it's the only option.""She mentioned the Government's goal to plant one billion trees over 10 years, the $100 million green investment fund, and the $3 billion Provincial Growth Fund as ways to help people working in fossil fuel industries to move into a new economy.She also mentioned the Government's upcoming wellbeing Budget, saying that a model based only on GDP and ""growth for growth's sake"" could show a country that is supposedly thriving, even if the environment is degrading and carbon emissions are soaring.Gore, who said he was a ""big fan"" of Ardern's when he introduced her to the panel, noted the global uptake of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy.""The world is in the early stages of a sustainability revolution which has the magnitude of the industrial revolution but at the speed of the digital revolution.""We can solve this. But we need leadership ... We know we can change, so the remaining question is: will we change?""Sir David Attenborough, who met with Ardern before the panel, said there was nothing more serious than climate change.""The maddening thing is we know how to deal with it. We just aren't doing so.""The panel also included Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, and Akira Sakano, chairwoman of the Zero Waste Academy in Japan."
463	5	AFTER DECADES of incremental steps forward, 2021 will be the most significant year yet for combating climate change. Two recent developments have made this possible.First, as science tells us that we have a decade to reduce emissions dramatically or face the worst impacts of climate change, many of those impacts have already arrived at our door. From the historic and deadly wildfires in Australia and California, to severe flooding around the world, there is no denying that climate change is already disrupting our daily lives. At the same time, support for climate action has never been stronger—from Generation Z’s solutions-oriented mindset, to political support that increasingly crosses party lines, to Europe’s large-scale ambition to become the first ­carbon-neutral continent, society is ever more unified against the threat of climate change.Second, we are seeing promising technologies and policies that will bring carbon-free energy within reach. Not long ago, it was hard to imagine a 24/7 carbon-free electricity supply. At its most basic level, the wind does not always blow and the sun does not shine at night. But new technologies—including better energy storage and the reduction of costs associated with wind and solar power by 70% and 89% respectively over the past ten years—are bringing 24/7 carbon-free energy closer to reality.Another of those technologies is artificial intelligence (AI). At Google, we are working on ways to apply AI to optimise electricity consumption within our data centres. In collaboration with our sister venture, DeepMind, we have developed solutions that have reduced the amount of energy used to cool our data centres by 30%. This approach could be used by commercial buildings, including airports and shopping malls, to do the same. AI can also be used to make wind power more predictable, which will increase the value, utilisation and adoption of renewable energy.Meanwhile, sensors on satellites can locate large-scale emitters of carbon dioxide at a very fine-grained level. This could dramatically improve the effectiveness of the Paris climate agreement. Technology is also helping cities reduce their carbon emissions. According to the Global Covenant of Mayors, an international alliance of over 10,000 cities and local governments committed to fighting climate change, less than 20% of cities outside western Europe have the time, resources and data to meet their climate commitments. With platforms like our own Environmental Insights Explorer, cities can use anonymised, aggregated mapping data to estimate the carbon footprint of their buildings and transport, and realise their solar-energy potential—a critical step, as cities continue to contribute over 70% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions.Technology is also helping communities adapt to the effects of climate change that are already apparent. As one example, we are able to use satellite data to map wildfires in real time and better predict how they might spread. In India, flood forecasting models use AI to predict when floods will hit and how deep the waters will get, helping save lives. Machine learning is also being applied to “nowcast” rainfall sooner and with more accuracy than con­ventional forecasting methods, helping people make safer, more informed decisions.Driven by these promising trends and tools, companies have made bigger sustainability commitments in shorter time frames. At Google, we have eliminated our carbon legacy using high-quality offsets, and set a goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy in all our data centres and campuses worldwide by 2030. Our aim is to demonstrate that a 100% carbon-free electrical grid is not just possible but also economically viable. We hope that companies of all sizes will join us in this effort.In addition to concrete and ambitious company commitments, the world also needs enabling policies and global frameworks to ensure we are working towards the same goals. We know it’s possible: we have seen this kind of collaboration during the pandemic, as the private sector worked with governments to deliver personal protective equipment, medical devices and contact-tracing apps needed to fight the virus. Stronger public-private partnerships will be just as critical in fighting climate change.Throughout history, every generation has confronted big challenges. Climate change will be our generation’s most profound challenge—and in 2021, the world will take its biggest steps yet to meet it.■This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “The power of green technology”
17	5	"Science Reporter, NZ HeraldIn an interview with the Herald last week, Climate Change Minister James Shaw said adults had failed our young ""comprehensively"" over the past three decades. He understood ""completely"" why teenagers concerned about inaction on climate change would want to leave their classrooms and take to the streets next Friday. What kind of planet might they have to inherit? Science reporter Jamie Morton looks at five reasons why they deserve to be angry.By the middle of the century, students taking part in this week's climate marches will be in their 40s, and with children of their own.Average temperatures will be, at best, 0.5C warmer than today - meaning roughly 50 per cent more heatwaves, more droughts and more river floods.At worst, temperatures will be about 1.5C higher than now.""That would mean roughly a tripling of heatwaves and droughts,"" Victoria University climate scientist Professor James Renwick said.By the end of the century, assuming greenhouse gas emissions continued to climb close to current levels, many parts of our country will record more than 80 days a year above 25C.Most places typically only have between 20 and 40 days above that now, yet, already, about 14 elderly people in Auckland and Christchurch die each year when the mercury climbs above 20C.If global temperatures climb just one, two or three degrees above current levels, that same death rate could rise to 28, 51 and 88 respectively.With about one in four New Zealanders projected to be 65 and over by 2043 - that's including many people in their 40s today - the problem will be amplified.The heat isn't the only danger the weather of a warmer world may bring.In the Auckland region particularly, extreme rainfall will likely increase because a warmer atmosphere carries more moisture.""Ex-tropical cyclones that approach Auckland in the future may be stronger due to retention of tropical cyclone characteristics farther south than at present,"" climate scientist Professor Jim Salinger said.Those impacts will only be compounded by a sea level expected to be 15cm to 30cm higher by 2050.""This will cause present-day high tide levels to be exceeded more frequently in Auckland.""Low-lying parts of the city – including the CBD, eastern bays, Onehunga, Mangere Bridge, Devonport and Helensville – are the most vulnerable to inundation.Beyond the obvious threat of extreme weather, rises in temperature have been shown to fuel myriad knock-on problems for human health.Hotter days may lead to higher rates of everything from aggression, to heart attacks and strokes.We already know that when temperatures climb above 18C-20C, hospital and emergency room admissions increase for those with mental health or psychiatric conditions.Other mental health effects of climate change could range from minimal stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and suicidal thoughts.Studies have shown the routine exposure to news articles like this one are enough to pile more stress on someone's everyday environment.Research has also pointed to the heightened risk of infectious diseases - including nasty ones we don't have already, like dengue fever and the West Nile virus.Scientists have highlighted the threat of new pests like the Asian tiger mosquito - but also warmer water, and heavier yet more infrequent rainfall events, that could set New Zealand up for more Havelock North-scale outbreaks of waterborne illness.With between 18,000 and 34,000 cases of gastroenteritis per year, the country already has relatively high rates compared with other high-income countries.But by 2050, the World Health Organisation has suggested New Zealand could expect about one to three more deaths of children because of all causes of diarrhoeal disease as a result of climate change.On top of that, exposure to air pollution could rise with heightened seasonal fire severity, and, pollen season could arrive weeks earlier.Predicting what will happen to our cherished natural environment is tough – but scientists say we can expect sweeping transformations.Some particularly native species - among them, tuatara, takahe, rockhopper penguins, little spotted kiwi and Archey's frog - face bleaker chances of adaptation than others.Alpine environments - refuges to many birds, lizards and invertebrates - will be among the first to suffer as our climate warms.""The largest change will be a rise of snowlines and continuing loss of glacier ice,"" Salinger said.As of 2018 there was 37.5 cubic kilometres of glacier ice - a 40 per cent reduction of that 50 years ago - so another 40 per cent would likely melt, leaving about 20-25 cubic km of glacier ice, he said.""Ruapehu would lose its ski areas and impacts in the South Island would be that alpine ecosystems would be pressured upwards – this would perhaps lead to extinctions of species in the mountain areas.""In our rivers, streams and lakes, freshwater plants and animals will experience everything from more intense floods and droughts to the knock-on impacts of more irrigation and new pests and weeds.On our coasts, estuaries and offshore islands, rising seas will squeeze already fragile habitats against developed land.Underwater, the toll of acidified oceans could be enormous.Globally, the oceans' average pH is 8.1, which is 0.1 lower than 250 years ago.While that might not sound much, a decrease of one pH unit represents a 10-fold increase in the acidity.The decline in pH is projected to continue in line with the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, leading to the most rapid decrease in ocean pH in the past 50 million years.The effect is associated with decreases in nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate in the surface ocean, where most marine organisms live.Even small shifts could have big consequences: mussels and paua might struggle to build their carbonate shells, while some fish species could experience changes in behaviour, physiology and habitat distribution.Niwa scientists estimate perhaps 25 per cent or less of the existing cold water coral locations around New Zealand will be able to sustain their growth by 2100 because of ocean acidification.For the world, Renwick says climate change means further price volatility on staple foods and occasional crop failures in major growing areas like the United States and Eurasia.There is also a risk of regional conflict and mass migration in other parts of the world, including South Asia and South America.Under a worst-case scenario, major crop failures could be happening several times per decade – and water and food scarcity could drive the movement of tens of millions of people.Renwick says this means much greater scope for regional warfare over resources, putting millions of lives at risk, or at least displacing populations.""High temperature extremes would also be making areas in the tropics and near-tropics uninhabitable - or close to it.""His colleague, Victoria University glaciologist Professor Tim Naish, said temperatures and sea levels in the western equatorial and south Pacific were rising faster than anywhere else on Earth.""There are huge vulnerable populations that will not be able to adapt and will need to migrate - 150 million people world wide live within one metre of current day sea-level.""A sprawling study published late last year highlighted the impacts climate change was already having on the world.Crop yields have declined in 30 countries because of global warming, raising concerns about malnutrition in some regions, while the risks of dengue fever and malaria have markedly increased around the planet.Increases in extreme weather events, which in 2017 numbered 712 events resulting in US$326 billion (NZ$480b) in economic losses, were bringing with them injuries and deaths, displacement, post-traumatic stress, and other short and long-term impacts to health.Another section of the report, authored by New Zealand-based environmental and occupational health expert Professor Tord Kjellstrom, found hotter temperatures cost workers 153 billion productive hours in 2017, in turn affecting family incomes and agricultural output to compound the risks to health.The worst-hit regions were India, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, and South America, but Kjellstrom added impacts on New Zealand's labour force would also become more pronounced as heat levels climbed.Renwick said the best-case scenario is that warming stopped somewhere between 2050 and 2070.The worst case is that global temperatures ended up about 4C above present by the close of the century – and sea levels rose 1.5m higher, with at least another 10m locked in across coming centuries.Major food-producing areas in existence today would be badly affected, much of the tropics would become uninhabitable, and extreme high temperatures would make many mid-latitude areas hard to bear in summer, he said.Added to that could be quadrupling or more of heavy rainfall and flooding events - with some events well beyond anything observed to date.Under current projections for 2100, Salinger said significant amounts of road, rail and water infrastructure would be affected in Auckland.""As well, 4500 residential buildings will be affected during a 1-in-100-year storm tide event with one metre of sea level rise, with a replacement cost of billions of dollars,"" he said.""In areas that become even hotter, like the Middle East and North Africa, with temperatures reaching into the 50s, we'd see increased conflict and heatwave fatalities.""In New Zealand, there would be marine environment losses of our coastal kelp forests, mortality in our aquaculture farms through heatwaves, and migration of subtropical fish into our fisheries.""Renwick said the bigger increase there was in climate change, the harder it was to judge what would unfold.""Really bad things could happen with unabated climate change, as we'd be living in a climate so far outside anything humanity has experienced before, and all bets would be off.""Naish said a world 5C warmer could come with mass food shortages, global conflict, economic collapse and population crashes.""On a positive note, if global warming is severely restricted to somewhere near the Paris Agreement target [restricting future temperature rise within 2C above pre-industrial times], there will be some committed climate change - but the impacts will be significantly less.""The most recent figures show that, if warming continues at the current rate, the Paris Agreement's aspirational threshold of 1.5C will be crossed at some point between 2030 and 2052.To keep within that mark, carbon dioxide emissions will need to be halved over the next decade, and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide will also need to be forced down.If the 1.5C threshold can be held, the world could escape an extra 10cm of sea level rise, over and above what's already been locked in for this century.If the world can't hold the line, then the 2C threshold - the ultimate limit the Paris Agreement was built around - could be over-shot only about a decade later.Given the past trajectory of global emissions of greenhouse gases - nearly a doubling in the past 30 years – climate scientists say turning this picture around requires ""far-reaching and unprecedented changes"" to every aspect of society.And, as students around the country will demand on Friday, this bold action has to begin right now."
85	3	Record warm temperatures are hitting the Great Lakes that will fuel lake effect snow, disrupt fish and threaten livelihoods of those who rely on them for freshwater, researchers warn.Lake effect snow is as weather phenomenon that forms when cold air and moisture move across open water and when the water is warm, the air turns into clouds.These clouds then form narrow bands of heavy snow downwind of the lake and can produce two to three inches of snow per hour.Researchers are unsure the exact impact that above average Great Lake temperatures will have on fish. However, they note trout only spawn when temperatures are in the low 50s, whereas water temperatures have in the upper 50s over the past few weeks.Lake Superior, for example, is known for being frigid this time of year, but it was nearly 60 degrees in October and 51 degrees last week when its normal average is about 45 degrees Fahrenheit.All five of the Great Lakes have been one to two degrees above normal since October, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, as reported by Detroit News.All of the five Great Lakes have been one to two degrees above normal since October, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dataThe increases may not sound threatening, but Andrea Vander Woude, manager of NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory's CoastWatch program, told Detroit News: 'It could have a negative impact on ecosystems, on fish, on zooplankton and phytoplankton and the whole dynamics of small animals within the lakes.'Lake trout breed around this time, but only if water temperatures are just right.Since they are higher than normal, spawning could be delayed and lead to a decline in the adult population for next year.Todd Wills, Lake Huron-Lake Erie area fisheries research manager for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, said in a statement: 'All fish have some sort of optimum temperature that they survive at.Lake effect snow is as weather phenomenon that forms when cold air and moisture move across open water and when the water is warm, the air turns into clouds. These clouds then form narrow bands of heavy snow downwind of the lake and can produce two to three inches of snow per hourLake Superior, for example, is known for being frigid this time of year, but was nearly 60 degrees in October and 51 degrees last week when its normal average is about 45 degrees Fahrenheit'When you get past that optimal temperature, even by a few degrees, things like their ability to grow, to spawn and to survive can change.'Even small changes in temperature for some species can really have a pretty substantial effect.'A study published in September analyzed 60 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere and discovered water temperatures have steadily increased over the past 100 to 200 years. However, water temperatures increased more than any other quarter in the past century in the past 25 years.The temperature increases are causing lakes to lose ice cover, which is resulting in lower water levels.The lakes in the Northern hemisphere are also freezing about 11 days later and thawing seven days earlier.
72	0	Over five decades, the GOP has transformed into something I no longer recognize.I have been immersed in national politics in Washington for five decades. Over my time here, as an academic, a congressional staffer, a think tanker, and a commentator and public figure, I have gotten to know and worked with a wide range of key actors in politics and policy. I have seen up close the changes in our politics and culture. Nothing has been more striking or significant than the transformation of the Republican Party, from a moderately conservative party to a very conservative party to something else entirely.One sign of this change? A five-term Republican congressman from Colorado, elected in the Tea Party wave in 2010 and now a Trump loyalist, was recently defeated in a primary by a candidate who runs Shooters Grill, where servers are encouraged to carry firearms, and who has indulged the QAnon conspiracy theories and who is now endorsed, not repudiated, by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Another? The current buzz surrounding Tucker Carlson as the party’s hope in 2024—even as he takes sudden leave from his show to go fishing, after one of his writers was tied to racist and misogynistic posts on an internet message board.Few of the dozens of Republicans in high office I have known and admired over five decades—in a party not my own and holding views that, in many cases, I did not share—would be represented in the Republican Party of today. While some of my friends and mentors were and are moderates, others were proud conservatives, who genuinely believed in fiscal discipline but also valued government, albeit in a limited form. But the radical and unconservative idea that all government should be disdained, that tax cuts that blow up the debt are just fine, would be anathema to them.Read: The November election is going to be a messAnd the idea that the Republican Party would be a force for ethnic and anti-immigrant animus and racial division would appall them—including my late friend Jack Kemp. The Republicans I knew best and worked most closely with were almost uniformly for civil rights—they represented the party of Everett Dirksen and William McCullough, who were instrumental in passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965.The individuals I knew, admired, and worked with were not the entirety of the Republican Party, even then. Plenty of lawmakers and others were quite content to exploit racism. They sought out the votes of segregationist former Southern Democrats, such as Strom Thurmond, to refill their party’s diminishing moderate ranks in the Northeast and the Midwest, and on the West Coast. Beginning with Barry Goldwater’s 1964 candidacy and Richard Nixon’s 1968 “law and order” campaign, some Republican politicians ran for office using rhetoric that, at best, cynically inflamed racial divisions.But even as I opposed many of the initiatives and campaign tactics of that Republican Party, I appreciated its efforts to solve problems and work within the governing institutions. The party of Nixon, with all its pathologies, created the Environmental Protection Agency, proposed a health-care-reform plan as sweeping as the later Affordable Care Act, and considered offering Americans a guaranteed annual income on a par with Andrew Yang’s universal basic income. The party of Reagan, which tried to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and which slashed taxes in 1981, precipitating ballooning deficits, also cut deals with Democratic Representative Henry Waxman to bolster Medicare and Medicaid; championed bipartisan Social Security reform in 1983; and supported tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 to offset the earlier cuts and reduce the deficits. The party responsible for Iran-Contra is also the party that championed democracy and moved in concert with Democrats to create the National Endowment for Democracy, the United States Institute of Peace, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute.In 1976, I worked on a project to reorganize the Senate’s committee system. The effort was led by Democratic Senator Adlai Stevenson III, but involved Republicans, including Bill Brock, Bob Packwood, and Pete Domenici. After a long day during which Domenici had worked nonstop on our committee, I asked the freshman senator why, with so many other assignments, he was giving so much to a panel whose rewards were limited. Any changes we made in committee numbers, assignments, and jurisdictions were sure to infuriate his colleagues. “Serving in the Senate is the greatest honor I can imagine,” he told me. “I am determined to leave it a better place than it was when I came in.”Domenici, like many other Republicans of his generation, had a great amount of what scholars call “institutional patriotism”: a concern for the operation and integrity of Congress as an institution, and its relationship to the other branches. They cared about integrity in governance and personal rectitude. They believed in the independence of Congress and its need to provide a check and balance against corruption and maladministration in the executive branch, whether the president was from their own or the opposite party. Unfortunately, they were unable to transfer those values to succeeding generations, or to overcome the regional shift in American party politics, the rise of manipulative leaders, and the growing influence of extremist tribal media.Read: Larry Hogan isn’t coming to save the Republican Party The Republican Party’s slide away from those values preceded Donald Trump, providing the conditions for his rise. In recent years, the GOP has thrown away its guiding values and embraced its darkest instincts. It has blown up long-standing norms in the Senate, creating divisions that outstrip anything I have seen before; done nothing about rank corruption in the White House and the Cabinet; accepted the politicization of the Justice Department and lies from the attorney general; avoided any meaningful oversight of misconduct; and failed to curb attacks on the independence of inspectors general.Read: Why Republicans still can’t quit TrumpThe GOP now distinguishes itself by inaction. It has stood and watched as this administration separated children from their parents at the border, mistreated asylum seekers, botched its response to a hurricane in Puerto Rico, attacked science, and opened new avenues for toxic materials in our air and water. It said and did nothing about Russian interference in the 2016 elections, and is actively blocking efforts to combat a recurrence in 2020. It has refused to pass a new Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated the legislation, which, reflecting the GOP of the past, had passed the House unanimously. It has refused to deal in any fashion with urgent problems such as climate change, immigration, global competition, hunger, and poverty. It confirmed nominees who lied to the Senate, who inflated résumés, and who failed to meet minimum qualifications for the job. It confirmed judges who were unanimously rated unqualified by the American Bar Association.The party jammed through a tax cut at a time of low unemployment and low economic growth, making a mockery of modern economics and leaving little flexibility to deal with the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It slashed the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, delivering an 80 percent cut to global-health programs designed to fight pandemics, and leaving the agency without the resources necessary to battle COVID-19. It has said almost nothing about the pitiful and reckless responses of the president to the pandemic, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths that should never have occurred. And now it is silent as we learn that Russia offered bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers, while the president said and did nothing.I grew up in a family of Democrats. My maternal grandfather, who had emigrated from Russia to escape czarist pogroms, moved to Minneapolis and became a labor leader, a member of the small “kitchen cabinet” that convinced Hubert Humphrey to enter politics and run for mayor of the city. My idols, growing up were giants of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, including Humphrey, Orville Freeman, Walter Mondale, Art Naftalin, and Donald Fraser.I was a young student at the University of Minnesota before I talked to a Republican at length. That’s where I met Doug Head, the state attorney general. He was a thoughtful intellectual and, like the core of the Minnesota Republican Party, a moderate conservative, far more center than right. His emphasis on public service made a lasting impression, helping me understand that I could share a common commitment with people who disagreed with me on policy.I came to Washington in 1969 on a congressional fellowship. Although I was working for Don Fraser, William Steiger, a young Republican representative from Wisconsin, soon became another mentor. Steiger loved the House and the congressional-fellowship program, and opened his door to me regularly to come and talk about politics, governance, and careers. He seemed destined for a major leadership role, before he died of a heart ailment at 40.When I moved to the Senate for the second half of my fellowship in 1970, I was assigned to George McGovern. He had put together an informal committee to push for a vote to end the Vietnam War. I worked closely with Republicans, including Mark Hatfield, Charles Goodell, and Jacob Javits. The task was not easy for them—after all, they were directly challenging President Nixon. The work was sometimes intense. I saw, up close, a bitter confrontation over Vietnam between McGovern and Bob Dole. But later, I would watch them develop a working relationship to combat hunger, and then forge a close friendship that lasted four decades, until McGovern’s death.William J. Burns: Polarized politics has infected American diplomacyPlenty of the Republicans I dealt with in the past were fierce partisans, including Dole and John Rhodes. But when pushed, they put country first—that was the basis on which they could forge bonds across the aisle. I had strong relationships in years past with a number of Republicans currently in the Senate. But none of them have, in recent years, behaved in a fashion that would meet the values of the party of Domenici, Steiger, or Dole.The country obviously needs a major change in its politics, a purging of the status quo. It faces challenges both societal and structural that go beyond Trump and the two parties. The United States must recover from the pandemic and rebuild its economy, while confronting head-on the issue of racism. But we cannot long operate as a democracy without two problem-solving parties that aim to compete for genuine majorities in the country.The Democratic Party is far from a paragon of virtue here; in politics, there are no angels. It faces its own deep challenges ahead. But America’s crisis of governance has been driven by a party that my colleague Tom Mann and I, long before Trump, described as an insurgent outlier in American politics. “It is ideologically extreme,” we wrote in 2012; “scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.”I was reminded of that description recently by the comments of the Republican pollster Alex Castellanos. “Mask-wearing has become a totem, a secular religious symbol,” Castellanos told The Washington Post. “Christians wear crosses, Muslims wear a hijab, and members of the Church of Secular Science bow to the Gods of Data by wearing a mask as their symbol, demonstrating that they are the elite; smarter, more rational, and morally superior to everyone else.”A reshaped GOP would be very conservative, but not radical. It would believe in limited government, but a government run by professionals, respecting data and science, and operating efficiently and fairly. It would believe in genuine fiscal discipline. It would try to apply free-market approaches to solving difficult problems, such as climate change. It would believe in the integrity of institutions and insist that those in office adhere to high ethical standards. It would respect the sanctity of alliances and the fundamental values of decency and equal treatment. It would work to broaden its base across racial and ethnic lines, not use division and voter suppression to cling to power.Sadly, even if Donald Trump is defeated in November, there is no sign that such a party will return anytime soon. But restoring the Republican Party to its traditional values is absolutely essential to preserve the core of our system of governance.
689	4	" Catholic leaders representing the church from around the world said the international community has an ethical and moral obligation to reach a climate deal that is socially just and takes into account the poor.  ""We Cardinals, Patriarchs and Bishops have come together to express, on our own behalf and on behalf of the people for whom we care, the widely-held hope that a just and legally binding climate agreement will emerge,"" the appeal said. The appeal comes ahead of the November 30 to December 11 UN climate talks in Paris aiming to reach a global pact that would commit countries to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and limit a world temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.  The call puts the 1.2 billion-member Catholic Church squarely within the debate on global warming, after Pope Francis earlier this year issued an encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si, warning of the consequences of environmental destruction and climate change. In the unprecedented call Catholic Church leaders from Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Oceania said the global agreement ""should limit global temperature increases to avoid catastrophic climatic impacts, especially on the most vulnerable communities."" The 10-point policy proposal calls for ""complete decarbonization"" by 2050, prioritizing ""people-driven solutions rather than profits"" and for negotiators to take into consideration ""particularly the ethical and moral dimensions"" of climate change. The latter point is a nod to not only the burden climate change will place on the poor and vulnerable, but recognizes the industrialized countries have more responsibility for climate change as well as the technology and ability to adapt. ""Those responsible for climate change have responsibilities to assist the most vulnerable in adapting and managing loss and damage and to share the necessary technology and knowhow,"" the appeal said. One of the main divides in the upcoming talks is between developed and developing countries, which argue that advanced economies should provide financial and technological support to help developing countries adapt to climate change and implement greener technologies.

Photo / Alex Burton Auckland, environment and Māori affairs reporter, NZ HeraldCovid-19 lockdowns slashed emissions across the globe but researchers warn climate benefits will be negligible, unless governments seize opportunities for ""green"" recoveries.Policies designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 have had a significant impact on travel and work, resulting in dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.During lockdown, New Zealand's C02 emissions were down 41.1 per cent and air pollution  75 per cent, compared to last year.Researchers from the University of Leeds analysed mobility data - mostly from Google and Apple - from 123 countries, representing 99 per cent of C02 emissions, to estimate changes because of restrictions, from February to June.In a paper published today in the journal Nature, they revealed the reductions in isolation would have a negligible impact on long-term warming, with potential cooling of just 0.005–0.01C by 2030.They found reductions were likely to have peaked in April, and the most significant decrease was in nitrogen oxides, which were down 30 per cent.The world's daily output of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide fell by more than a quarter during this month, based on their research.However, the 20 per cent decline in sulphur dioxide (SO2) weakened the aerosol cooling effect and contributed to short-term warming.Researchers used the estimates to project future changes and compared them to a baseline scenario of current national policies.They found that the short-term effects would end by 2025, leaving a longer-term slight cooling of 0.01C.Researchers also modelled four recovery scenarios, including a fossil fuel-based recovery and green stimulus packages.If the economic recovery maintained current investment levels over the next two years, a recovery with fossil fuel stimulus was likely to result in warming of more than 1.5C by 2050.Conversely, choosing a strong green recovery that included low-carbon energy supply as well as energy efficiency and did not support bailouts for fossil firms could limit warming by 0.3C and keep warming within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.Catherine Leining, a Motu Research policy fellow and commissioner on the Climate Change Commission, said the research reinforced the message that Covid-19 recovery investments today would determine the future climate.In April the commission wrote to the Government, warning it not to ""lock"" New Zealand into a high-emissions future and ""compound"" the crisis with its Covid-19 economic recovery.""An economic stimulus package can either speed up or stall our progress on climate change,"" said the letter, signed by committee chairman Rod Carr.Leining said the Global Financial Crisis caused global emissions to fall by 1.4 per cent in 2009 before increasing 5.1 per cent in 2010 as the world locked in the next decade of emissions growth.Non-governmental organisations Forest & Bird, Greenpeace, WWF-New Zealand, Generation Zero, EDS and Ecologic also wrote to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urging a ""transformative"" economic recovery to tackle climate change, save native species, improve freshwater quality, and restore oceans.A recent New Zealand Climate Change Poll by IAG found 86 per cent of those surveyed believed climate change should play a part in the economic recovery plan.The Government wants New Zealand's carbon emissions to peak in 2020 and slowly come down towards 2030.But at the current rate, New Zealand is predicted to fall woefully short of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, designed to keep global warming under 1.5C."
993	5	The warning signs are flashing red. The California wildfires were surely made worse by the impacts of global heating. A study published in July warned that the Arctic is undergoing “an abrupt climate change event” that will probably lead to dramatic changes. As if to underline the point, on 14 September it was reported that a huge ice shelf in northeast Greenland had torn itself apart, worn away by warm waters lapping in from beneath.That same day, a study of satellite data revealed growing cracks and crevasses in the ice shelves protecting two of Antarctica’s largest glaciers – indicating that those shelves could also break apart, leaving the glaciers exposed and liable to melt, contributing to sea-level rise. The ice losses are already following our worst-case scenarios.These developments show that the harmful impacts of global heating are mounting, and should be a prompt to urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But the case for emissions cuts is actually even stronger. That is because scientists are increasingly concerned that the global climate might lurch from its current state into something wholly new – which humans have no experience dealing with. Many parts of the Earth system are unstable. Once one falls, it could trigger a cascade like falling dominoes.We have known for years that many parts of the climate have so-called tipping points. That means a gentle push, like a slow and steady warming, can cause them to change in a big way that is wholly disproportionate to the trigger. If we hit one of these tipping points, we may not have any practical way to stop the unfolding consequences.The Greenland ice sheet is one example of a tipping point. It contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by seven metres, if it were all to melt. And it is prone to runaway melting.This is because the top surface of the ice sheet is gradually getting lower as more of the ice melts, says Ricarda Winkelmann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. The result is familiar to anyone who has walked in mountains. “If we climb down the mountain, the temperature around us warms up,” she says. As the ice sheet gets lower, the temperatures at the surface get higher, leading to even more melting. “That’s one of these self-reinforcing or accelerating feedbacks.”We don’t know exactly how much warming would cause Greenland to pass its tipping point and begin melting unstoppably. One study estimated that it would take just 1.6C of warming – and we have already warmed the planet 1.1C since the late 19th century.The collapse would take centuries, which is some comfort, but such collapses are difficult to turn off. Perhaps we could swiftly cool the planet to below the 1.6C threshold, but that would not suffice, as Greenland would be melting uncontrollably. Instead, says Winkelmann, we would have to cool things down much more – it’s not clear by how much. Tipping points that behave like this are sometimes described as “irreversible”, which is confusing; in reality they can be reversed, but it takes a much bigger push than the one that set them off in the first place.In 2008, researchers led by Timothy Lenton, now at the University of Exeter, catalogued the climate’s main “tipping elements”. As well as the Greenland ice sheet, the Antarctic ice sheet is also prone to unstoppable collapse – as is the Amazon rainforest, which could die back and be replaced with grasslands.A particularly important tipping element is the vast ocean current known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which carries warm equatorial water north to the Arctic, and cool Arctic water south to the equator. The AMOC has collapsed in the past and many scientists fear it is close to collapsing again – an event that was depicted (in ridiculously exaggerated and accelerated form) in the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow. If the AMOC collapses, it will transform weather patterns around the globe – leading to cooler climates in Europe, or at least less warming, and changing where and when monsoon rains fall in the tropics. For the UK, this could mean the end of most arable farming, according to a paper Lenton and others published in January.In 2009, a second study took the idea further. What if the tipping elements are interconnected? That would mean that setting off one might set off another – or even unleash a cascade of dramatic changes, spreading around the globe and reshaping the world we live in.For instance, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is releasing huge volumes of cold, fresh water into the north Atlantic. This weakens the AMOC – so it is distinctly possible that if Greenland passes its tipping point, the resulting melt will push the AMOC past its own threshold.“It’s the same exact principles that we know happen at smaller scales,” says Katharine Suding of the University of Colorado, Boulder, who has studied similar shifts in ecosystems. The key point is that processes exist that can amplify a small initial change. This can be true on the scale of a single meadow or the whole planet.However, the tipping point cascade is very difficult to simulate. In many cases the feedbacks go both ways – and sometimes one tipping point can make it less likely that another will be triggered, not more. For example, the AMOC brings warm water from equator up into the north Atlantic, contributing to the melting of Greenland. So if the AMOC were to collapse, that northward flow of warm water would cease – and Greenland’s ice would be less likely to start collapsing. Depending whether Greenland or the AMOC hit its tipping point first, the resulting cascade would be very different.What’s more, dozens of such linkages are now known, and some of them span huge distances. “Melting the ice sheet on one pole raises sea level,” says Lenton, and the rise is greatest at the opposite pole. “Say you’re melting Greenland and you raise the sea level under the ice shelves of Antarctica,” he says. That would send ever more warm water lapping around Antarctica. “You’re going to weaken those ice shelves.”“Even if the distance is quite far, a larger domino might still be able to cause the next one to tip over,” says Winkelmann.In 2018, Juan Rocha of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden and his colleagues mapped out all the known links between tipping points. However, Rocha says the strengths of the interconnections are still largely unknown. This, combined with the sheer number of them, and the interactions between the climate and the biosphere, means predicting the Earth’s overall response to our greenhouse gas emissions is very tricky.The most worrying possibility is that setting off one tipping point could unleash several of the others, pushing Earth’s climate into a new state that it has not experienced for millions of years.Since before humans existed, Earth has had an “icehouse” climate, meaning there is permanent ice at both poles. But millions of years ago, the climate was in a “hothouse” state: there was no permanent polar ice, and the planet was many degrees warmer.If it has happened before, could it happen again? In 2018, researchers including Lenton and Winkelmann explored the question in a much-discussed study. “The Earth System may be approaching a planetary threshold that could lock in a continuing rapid pathway toward much hotter conditions – Hothouse Earth,” they wrote. The danger threshold might be only decades away at current rates of warming.Lenton says the jury is still out on whether this global threshold exists, let alone how close it is, but that it is not something that should be dismissed out of hand.“For me, the strongest evidence base at the moment is for the idea that we could be committing to a ‘wethouse’, rather than a hothouse,” says Lenton. “We could see a cascade of ice sheet collapses.” This would lead to “a world that has no substantive ice in the northern hemisphere and a lot less over Antarctica, and the sea level is 10 to 20 metres higher”. Such a rise would be enough to swamp many coastal megacities, unless they were protected. The destruction of both the polar ice sheets would be mediated by the weakening or collapse of the AMOC, which would also weaken the Indian monsoon and disrupt the west African one.Winkelmann’s team studied a similar scenario in a study published online in April, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. They simulated the interactions between the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, the AMOC, the Amazon rainforest and another major weather system called the El Niño southern oscillation. They found that the two ice sheets were the most likely to trigger cascades, and the AMOC then transmitted their effects around the globe.Everyone who studies tipping point cascades agrees on two key points. The first is that it is crucial not to become disheartened by the magnitude of the risks; it is still possible to avoid knocking over the dominoes. Second, we should not wait for precise knowledge of exactly where the tipping points lie – which has proved difficult to determine, and might not come until it’s too late.Rocha compares it to smoking. “Smoking causes cancer,” he says, “but it’s very difficult for a doctor to nail down how many cigarettes you need to smoke to get cancer.” Some people are more susceptible than others, based on a range of factors from genetics to the level of air pollution where they live. But this does not mean it is a good idea to play chicken with your lungs by continuing to smoke. “Don’t smoke long-term, because you might be committing to something you don’t want to,” says Rocha. The same logic applies to the climate dominoes. “If it happens, it’s going to be really costly and hard to recover, therefore we should not disturb those thresholds.”“I think a precautionary principle probably is the best step forward for us, especially when we’re dealing with a system that we know has a lot of feedbacks and interconnections,” agrees Suding.“These are huge risks we’re playing with, in their potential impacts,” says Lenton. “This is yet another compulsion to get ourselves weaned off fossil fuels as fast as possible and on to clean energy, and sort out some other sources of greenhouse gases like diets and land use,” says Lenton. He emphasises that the tipping points for the two great ice sheets may well lie between 1C and 2C of warming.“We actually do need the Paris climate accord,” says Winkelmann. The 2016 agreement committed most countries to limit warming to 1.5 to 2C, although the US president, Donald Trump, has since chosen to pull the US out of it. Winkelmann argues that 1.5C is the right target, because it takes into account the existence of the tipping points and gives the best chance of avoiding them. “For some of these tipping elements,” she says, “we’re already in that danger zone.”Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is not a surprising or original solution. But it is our best chance to stop the warning signs flashing red.
