564	4	The country shows the power of self-determination when it comes to development and climate policy.About the author: Joyashree Roy is the Bangabandhu Chair Professor in the Department of Energy, Environment, and Climate Change at the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand. She was a National Fellow of the Indian Council of Social Sciences Research, and among the network of scientists who shared in the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Fifty years ago, Bangladesh won independence from Pakistan amid devastating climate disaster. The year before, in 1970, the Bhola cyclone had killed up to half a million people. The human toll of the disaster—one of the deadliest cyclones in recorded history—was amplified by a woefully insufficient response by Pakistan’s government. Faced with renewed demands for independence in what was then East Pakistan, the military waged a brutal crackdown and genocide. In the War of Independence, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, an estimated 200,000 women were raped, and 6 million homes were destroyed.From these beginnings, Bangladesh has remained, in the imagination of much of the developed world, a poster child for poverty and looming climate catastrophe—a warning for what will befall the global poor if climate change is not addressed.The country’s low elevation and high population density do make it distinctly vulnerable to rising sea levels and natural hazards such as cyclones. But the narrative of Bangladesh as a climate victim in waiting is almost entirely misinformed. From the fight for independence to now, as I recently wrote for Breakthrough Journal, Bangladesh in fact represents a success story, showing the power of self-determination when it comes to development and climate policy.An accurate telling of Bangladesh’s recent development should start with natural gas. The country’s rich domestic endowment of the resource was the driving force of its modernization.In 1974, the government nationalized Bangladesh’s energy resources, but rather than selling its gas abroad, the country opted to keep much of it. And rather than use the gas for consumption in people’s homes, the authorities channeled it into activities such as power generation for industrial growth, the development of the fertilizer sector, water supply for irrigation, and cement production.That, in turn, fueled spectacular expansion in agricultural production, and by 2019, Bangladesh was self-sufficient in food, and had also become a significant exporter of textiles, apparel, and leather products. Its economy is now the fastest growing in South Asia, but because natural gas constitutes more than 60 percent of its primary energy use, the country is greener than many of its neighbors, such as India, which depends more on coal. Alongside this economic progress, Bangladesh cut both extreme poverty and infant mortality by some 70 percent from 1990 to 2016. Life expectancy is only seven years shy of the United States’. In 2015, Bangladesh’s progress was recognized by the World Bank, which upgraded it to a “lower-middle income” country.Bangladesh has also adapted to climate change with improved forecasting, public community-wide training and education campaigns, and infrastructure investments. As a result, death tolls from cyclones since Bhola have ticked down to the double or triple digits in recent years. These casualty numbers are still tragic, but a long way off from the shocking human cost of a half century ago. Certainly, these adaptive efforts have their limits, particularly as the effects of climate change worsen, but Bangladesh has bought itself time to make an energy transition while not compromising on the needs of its people.Much of Bangladesh’s growth model has flown in the face of recommendations from international-development institutions, well-meaning NGOs, and global environmental groups.The International Monetary Fund, for example, has long criticized subsidies such as the ones Bangladesh uses in the energy sector, downplaying the benefits that the combination of those and domestic use of gas has brought to Bangladesh’s economy. Others have urged the diversification of countries’ economies and energy sectors to reduce carbon emissions, typically touting investments in “greener” energy sectors and the phasing out of fossil fuels, including natural gas. Still more argue that, for low-lying countries to survive global warming, large cuts to energy consumption are needed now.But generic recommendations haven’t made much sense for Bangladesh in the past. And in the future, they may be even more off base.For one, although the nation has opportunities for hydroelectric power, harnessing it will not be possible without the large-scale displacement of communities. Potential for wind and solar energy is also limited: Most of Bangladesh’s land is fertile and required for food production, whereas unused nonagricultural land is scarce.In addition, to lift millions more people out of poverty and raise living standards across the country, Bangladesh needs to produce and consume much more energy, which means that some imagined cut to energy consumption is off the table.In short, Bangladesh illustrates why priorities at the international level aren’t always appropriate at the local one. For countries such as Bangladesh, the question should not be how to phase out fossil fuels the fastest, but how to make the best and cleanest use of them—and the infrastructure around them.Doing so will mean continuing to prioritize productive domestic use of the country’s remaining natural-gas reserves and finding ways to use that sector’s infrastructure, resources, and knowledge to tap cleaner energy sources that make sense for local circumstances, such as geothermal and hydrogen.Geothermal energy has been used in many countries for heat and power generation, but it does not make up a very large share of total global energy generation, mainly because of the high cost of infrastructure required. However, using oil and gas exploration wells and depleted wells for geothermal heat and power generation is becoming possible, as a recent study from me and my colleagues showed. Hydrogen, meanwhile, first became an important part of the energy industry in the mid-20th century, but has recently received renewed focus as a potential replacement for oil and gas. As with geothermal, Bangladesh’s existing infrastructure might be repurposed in a number of ways to support a hydrogen economy: Already, half of the world’s hydrogen is produced with natural gas.To be sure, all of this would require huge levels of investment, but Bangladesh, with its well-developed gas sector, has opportunities to move to geothermal and hydrogen over time—and in ways that are consistent with both its climate and development goals. But to get there, both imperatives need to be taken equally seriously, and the actors best placed to balance them are local.The vision of Bangladesh as a place on the brink of being overwhelmed by rising seas is outdated, just as the notion that it might rapidly transition to renewable energy is unrealistic. In the 50 years since the Bhola cyclone, the nation has carved out a path to development thanks to natural gas. Turning away from that path precipitously would strand the nation’s fossil-fuel assets and undermine its hard-won sovereignty and development gains.For countries such as Bangladesh, fossil fuels cannot be abandoned overnight, at least not within any global framework for mitigating climate change that could be characterized as sustainable or just. The transition to a low-carbon economy in less developed nations should go as fast as it can and no faster—meaning that affordable, abundant energy services, and all the associated human development and economic benefits those bring, cannot be given up in pursuit of climate-change-mitigation objectives.There will be multiple transition models, all deeply entangled with development imperatives, local histories, governance, and resource endowments. Choices must be made democratically. They must respect sovereignty. And they must allow developing nations to build the technology, infrastructure, and institutions they need to chart their own path.

Pictured is parasite under a microscope ‘Climate change has a strong link with the emergence of zoonotic disease,’ Víctor Sánchez-Cordero, an ecology professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told UnDark.org.‘There is the possibility that there will soon be cases of human leishmaniasis in the U.S. where before [they] did not exist.’Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics and southern Europe.It spreads in through bites of a sand fly, which are only about one fourth the size of mosquitoes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The parasites use sand flies as a host, which bites humans to spread the infection that causes skin soars or even organ damageResearchers note that these parasite moving into the US is not expected to happen overnight, but over several decades.However, several studies have found these creatures in the US in just the past decade, including one case as far north as North Dakota.In 2014, a healthy 27-month-old developed lesions on the right upper eye and lower eyelids, according to a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.After months of testing, the boy was found to have been infected by a Leishmania.Researchers warn that by 2080, nearly 27 million North Americans could be exposed to the flesh-eating parasite. The parasite causes skin soars However, the parasite has been on researchers’ radars since at least 2010, with one paper sounding the alarm about the parasite traveling into the US.‘Climate change is increasingly being implicated in species' range shifts throughout the world, including those of important vector and reservoir species for infectious diseases, reads the study published in the journal National Library of Medicine.‘In North America (México, United States, and Canada), leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease that is autochthonous in México and Texas and has begun to expand its range northward.’ Vector-born diseases are infections by the bite of infected arthropod species, such as mosquitoes, ticks, triatomine bugs, sandflies and blackflies - and in this case, a sand fly.The 2010 study, conducted by the University of Texas at Austin and the National Autonomous University of Mexico, analyzed data from captured sand flies and rodents in Texas and northern Mexico.The researchers predicted that by 2020, the rodents and flies carrying the parasite would move into Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri by 2020, according to the study publuished And the report also suggests that by 2080, the disease will be exposed to 27 million Americans and Canadians.Sahotra Sarkar, author on the study and professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin, told UnDark that the team still needs more data to prove the accuracy of their model, but he believes the 2020 predictions  are correct.Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection found in tropical and subtropical regions, as well as southern Europe. The disease is caused by being infected with one of more than 20 Leishmania parasites, which is spread by over 30 species of sand flies.The most common forms of the condition are cutaneous leishmaniasis - which causes skin sores - and visceral leishmaniasis - which affects the spleen, liver and bone marrow.Cutaneous symptoms usually start out as bumps that then ulcerate. These are typically painless.Visceral symptoms include fever, weight loss, abnormally low blood cells, and an enlarged spleen and liver.Some people have a 'silent infection' and never develop symptoms.Leishmaniasis' prevalence is difficult to estimate.The cutaneous form of the disease is thought to affect between 700,000 and 1.2million people globally every year.And the visceral form affects around 100,000-to-400,000 annually. The infections are found in parts of Asia, Middle East, Africa, southern Europe, Mexico, Central America and South America.Cases that arise in the US or UK are almost always from people who have become infected while travelling or living in other countries. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually heals on its own without treatment, but this can take years and leave scars.There is also the risk the ulcers may spread from the skin to the nose, mouth or throat.Visceral leishmaniasis is often deadly if untreated, however, medication is available.There is no vaccine or preventative medication for humans, with people being advised to avoid sand flies via nets and insecticide sprays.However, a vaccine does exist for dogs. Collars impregnated with insecticides and spot-on treatments that prevent sand-fly bites are also effective. Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention
185	5	"         (Shutterstock)There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there has been for 800,000 years — since before our species evolved.On Saturday (May 11), the levels of the greenhouse gas reached 415 parts per million (ppm), as measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Scientists at the observatory have been measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since 1958. But because of other kinds of analysis, such as those done on ancient air bubbles trapped in ice cores, they have data on levels reaching back 800,000 years. [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World]During the ice ages, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were around 200 ppm. And during the interglacial periods — the planet is currently in an interglacial period — levels were around 280 ppm, according to NASA.But every story has its villains: Humans are burning fossil fuels, causing the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are adding an extra blanket on an already feverish planet. So far, global temperatures have risen by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the 19th century or pre-industrial times, according to a special report released last year by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Every year, the Earth sees about 3 ppm more carbon dioxide in the air, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State University. ""If you do the math, well, it's pretty sobering,"" he said. ""We'll cross 450 ppm in just over a decade.""The subsequent warming is already causing changes to the planet — shrinking glaciers, bleaching coral reefs and intensifying heat waves and storms, among other impacts. And carbon dioxide levels higher than 450 ppm ""are likely to lock in dangerous and irreversible changes in our climate,"" Mann told Live Science.""CO2 levels will continue to increase for at least the next decade and likely much longer, because not enough is being done worldwide,"" said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""The long-term increase is due to human-related emissions, especially the emissions of our burning of fossil fuels.""However, he noted that the annual peak in carbon dioxide, which fluctuates throughout the year as plants change their breathing rhythms, occurs right now. The annual average value will be more like 410 to 412 ppm, he said. Which … is still very high.""We keep breaking records, but what makes the current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere most troubling is that we are now well into the 'danger zone' where large tipping points in the Earth’s climate could be crossed,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, the dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. ""This is particularly true when you factor in the additional warming potential of the other greenhouse gases, including methane, that are now in the atmosphere.""The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were this high, way before Homo sapiens walked the planet, the Antarctic Ice Sheet was much smaller and sea levels were up to 65 feet (20 meters) higher than they are today, Overpeck told Live Science.""Thus, we could soon be at the point where comparable reductions in ice sheet size, and corresponding increases in sea level, are both inevitable and irreversible over the next few centuries,"" he said. Smaller ice sheets, in turn, might reduce the reflectivity of the planet and potentially accelerate the warming even more, he added.""It's like we're playing with a loaded gun and don't know how it works.""Originally published on  Live Science."
598	4	"If all of us moved to climate-friendly diets, what difference would it make to emissions? Video / NZ HeraldScience Reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions have shot up by more than a quarter in the past three decades – and the latest annual stocktake shows they're still not coming down.In response to the Ministry for the Environment's just-released inventory, Climate Change Minister James Shaw said every part of Government would need to take ""urgent action"" to turn the picture around.The report, covering all human-generated emissions between 1990 and 2019, showed gross emissions leapt by 26 per cent – or some 17.2 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2-e) - over that period.Most of that increase came from methane belched by dairy cattle and CO2 from road transport.But the inventory also showed that, despite increased efforts to decarbonise, both gross and net emissions rose by around 2 per cent in 2019.In that case, the bump was mainly down to emissions rises in manufacturing industries and construction, along with public electricity and heat production.Overall, New Zealand's emissions in 2019 amounted to 82.3 Mt CO2-e, of which about 46 per cent came from CO2, 42 per cent from methane, and 10 per cent from nitrous oxide.About 33 per cent of that was offset by land use and forestry - a sector whose net CO2 removals had climbed by about 14 per cent since 1990.Because of the delay in producing the inventory, which took about 15 months to prepare, it didn't capture the impact of some of the Government's more recently introduced measures.That included capping the Emissions Trading Scheme, introducing a ""clean car standard"", replacing coal-fired boilers in schools and investing more in public transport and cycleways.Still, the Climate Change Commission's recent draft report showed New Zealand wasn't on track to miss its locked-in commitments by millions of tonnes of CO2-e.Under policies in place when the report was prepared, the country would fall short of its 2050 target of net-zero long-lived gases by 6.3Mt of CO2-e.What's your carbon footprint? Try this five-minute FutureFit survey, supported by Auckland Council, to find out.Biogenic methane - largely stemming from livestock and responsible for a third of our greenhouse gas emissions - would also come down only 12 per cent below 2017 levels.That was well beneath the Zero Carbon Act's targeted reduction range of 24 to 47 per cent.The commission recommended an aggressive but achievable plan of action, that included slashing livestock numbers, winding down petrol car imports and planting more forestry - and amounted to cutting all emissions by a third within the next 16 years.Shaw said that, while the bump over 2018-19 had taken New Zealand further away from hitting its targets, the country's emissions had generally remained flat for the past 15 years.""What this makes absolutely clear is that every part of Government must now come together and help to deliver an Emissions Reduction Plan in line with what the Climate Change Commission recommends,"" he said.""If we can do that, then we can reverse the current trend and finally bring emissions down in line with what the science requires.""Shaw said the plan would need to cover every part of the economy – including finance, energy, transport and agriculture.""When the Climate Change Commission released its draft advice in January I said that, because of the legislative and institutional framework we have put in place and the roadmap the Commission had provided, I had never felt more confident that a climate-friendly, prosperous future for New Zealand was within reach,"" he said.Whether or not we get there is going to depend on the decisions that we make over the next few years.""Our best chance to take the actions that will bring emissions down is now; and we clearly have a lot to do.""He added that the recent rise showed the Government was ""right"" to ban new coal-fired boilers – although commentators have noted that large existing boilers wouldn't need to go until 2037.The new data comes after StatsNZ last week reported New Zealand's Covid-19 measures had put a slight dent in emissions over 2020 - although this was separate to the formally reported national inventory.It was also published as the Government prepares to introduce a law that requires the financial sector to disclose their climate impacts, and explain how they will manage related risks and opportunities.The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosure and Other Matters) Amendment Bill has been introduced to Parliament and will receive its first reading this week.""It is important that every part of New Zealand's economy is helping us cut emissions and transition to a low-carbon future,"" Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister David Clark said.""This legislation ensures that financial organisations disclose and ultimately take action against climate-related risks and opportunities.""The bill will make climate-related disclosures mandatory for around 200 organisations, including most listed issuers, large registered banks, licensed insurers and managers of investment schemes.Once passed, disclosures will be required for financial years commencing in 2022, meaning that the first disclosures will be made in 2023."
563	4	The latest UN report is clear: Climate change is here, it’s a crisis, and it’s caused by fossil fuels.A new United Nations–led report from hundreds of climate scientists around the world makes it clear: The human-driven climate crisis is now well under way. Earth is likely hotter now than it has been at any moment since the beginning of the last Ice Age, 125,000 years ago, and the world has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, or nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the Industrial Revolution began—an “unprecedented” and “rapid” change with no parallel in the Common Era. What’s more, the recent spate of horrific heat waves, fire-fueling droughts, and flood-inducing storms that have imperiled the inhabited world are not only typical of global warming, but directly caused by it.Climate change has arrived, in other words, and it will keep getting worse until humanity reduces its greenhouse-gas pollution to zero, which can be accomplished only by dethroning oil, coal, and gas as the central energy sources powering the global economy.But the speed of that transition matters—and preventing every last ton of carbon pollution, and averting every additional tenth of a degree of warming, will not only lessen the harm over the next few decades, but resound for centuries and even millennia to come.These are the conclusions of the newest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN-sponsored body that has periodically released a synthesis of current climate science since its founding in 1988. The group’s reports tend to punctuate the otherwise slow immiseration of climate change; its previous synthesis report, released in 2013, helped inform international climate policy, including the writing of the Paris Agreement.This is its sixth report and its most definitive. The group’s findings must be agreed to by 195 countries; this famously makes it more conservative than some scientists believe is prudent. But compared with previous reports, there is little restraint here. In its strongest statement of culpability ever, the IPCC declared that humanity is “unequivocally” responsible for climate change. “In past reports, we’ve had to make that statement more hesitantly. Now it’s a statement of fact,” Gregory Flato, a vice chair of the group that authored the report and a senior research scientist within the Canadian government, told me.Some of the worst impacts of climate change can still be avoided. “There are still emissions pathways that would lead us to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but they require deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions,” Flato said. “That leaves a glimmer of optimism that we could limit warming to levels like that.” But it would require much more expedient action from the United States than is contemplated in, say, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Congress is currently considering.The report is 3,949 pages long and synthesizes the past eight years of advances in climate science; altogether, it cites some 14,000 studies. It would be folly to try to summarize all that work here. But the bottom line is that climate science, and the cataclysm of climate change, has lurched into the present tense. Where scientists once warned of disasters in the distant future, now they strive to understand what has already happened—and what is too late to save. Here are four takeaways:Climate change has been happening now nearly since before it first became a public issue. When James Hansen, the head of climate science at NASA, first warned Congress about climate change in 1988, he framed it in what might be called the tentative present tense, saying that the agency could now say “with a high degree of confidence” that global warming was under way.And it was. As the new report notes: “Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850.” Yet in the past few years, global warming has moved from a statistical property to an ambient condition of modern life. A mega-drought seems to grip the American West without end. A series of wildfires have passed, like a baton, from one part of the world to another, going from California to the Amazon to Australia to Greece to California again. And then there was the morning, a few weeks ago, when Americans on the East Coast and in the Midwest woke up, thousands of miles away from any wildfire, and smelled smoke in the air.“We’re reaching a point where the impacts of climate change are becoming too hard to ignore for many people,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and a co-author of one of the report’s chapters, told me.For the first time, the report establishes that those extreme events are happening because of climate change. Scientists’ ability to attribute individual events to the warming atmosphere is the “biggest advance” the field has seen in the past decade, Ben Cook, a climate-science professor at Columbia University, told me.“Every inhabited region across the globe” has seen a well-documented increase in heat waves, heavy rain, or drought, the report says. Human activity is also behind the demise of glaciers since 1990, the hemorrhaging of the Greenland ice sheet, and the decline of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere since 1950, the report says. No part of the world has been left untouched by humanity’s prodigious carbon pollution.In the past decade, climate scientists have arrived at more pessimistic views about sea-level rise, and those views are reflected in this report. Most researchers now believe that the oceans will rise roughly half a foot more than once projected. In a relatively optimistic “intermediate” emissions scenario, for instance, the IPCC once projected that oceans would rise about one and a half feet by 2100. The new report finds that just under two feet is more likely, and two and a half feet is not out of the question.The authors could not eliminate from their models the small chance that some of the largest glaciers in West Antarctica could catastrophically collapse this century. In that scenario, humanity could see more than six and a half feet of sea-level rise by 2100 and perhaps as much as 16 feet of sea-level rise by 2150.If humanity successfully learns how to remove carbon from the atmosphere, some of the impacts of climate change, such as ocean acidification and the rise in land temperatures, may be reversible.But some will not. Sea-level rise is chief among them. “Once you have melting under way, it’s very hard to rein it in, even if you go full-scale into reversal of global warming,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech and a co-author of the report, told me. The slow increase in sea levels could continue for millennia.“When I say those words, it almost chokes me up. It scares the crap out of me, frankly,” Cobb said. “This is a horrific long-term consequence to the decisions we’ll be making this decade on our watch.”If climate change is happening now, then its time scales—which once seemed distant—are suddenly ticking by at the speed of the political or business calendars. An earlier draft of this report cautioned that the world could see more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the early 2030s. Although that language was removed because researchers could not guarantee that a fluke event, such as a once-in-a-century volcanic eruption, would not briefly cool the planet and delay the inevitable for a few years, the broad point remains. The IPCC now warns that the world is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040 even if humanity cuts carbon pollution as rapidly as is plausible. In fact, the agency estimates that enough greenhouse gas is already in the atmosphere today to raise the planet’s temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius—only the cooling effects of smog and other forms of conventional air pollution are keeping temperatures depressed.But humanity may still avoid warming the planet by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. On all pathways, the world’s temperature will increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century; the only question is whether it then begins to cool down or keeps going up. Current policies suggest that the planet is set for 3 degrees Celsius, or more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming by the end of the century.“We’re already seeing extreme rainfall, heat waves, and droughts that are all implicitly or explicitly tied to climate change—and this is just a 1-degree world,” Cook said. “I would not want to live in a 4-degree world. And a 3-degree world … would be quite challenging.”
181	4	The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28 percent in July from a year ago, official data shows, as environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.Brazil’s space research agency INPE recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019. Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August – a 12-year high for that month.Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike.More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Sixty percent of the Amazon basin region is in Brazil. Since the blaze last year, it has faced global pressure to do more to protect the massive forest, seen as vital to containing the impact of climate change.The fires are largely set to clear land illegally for farming, ranching and mining.Activists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right climate change sceptic, of encouraging the deforestation with calls to open up the rainforest to agriculture and industry.Under international pressure, Bolsonaro has deployed the army to fight the fires and declared a moratorium on burning. But activists say that does not go far enough to address the roots of the problem.Fires rose 77 percent on Indigenous lands and 50 percent on protected nature reserves from July 2019, environmental group Greenpeace said, showing how illegal activities are increasingly encroaching on those areas.Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement that “the government’s strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground”. “On paper, the fire moratorium prohibits burning, but it only works if there is also a response on the ground, with more patrols. Criminals aren’t known for obeying the law.”Instead, the Bolsonaro administration has slashed the budget, staff and programmes of Brazil’s environmental authority, IBAMA.“Everything that was working was thrown out the window,” Erika Berenguer, an Amazon ecologist at Oxford and Lancaster Universities, told AFP news agency.Fire season in the Amazon typically runs from around June to October. But fires are just part of the deforestation picture.Throughout the rest of the year, ranchers, farmers, miners and land speculators are clearing forest and preparing to burn it.The first six months of 2020 were the worst on record for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 3,069 square kilometres (1,185 square miles) cleared, according to INPE data – an area bigger than the nation of Luxembourg.If a significant portion of those felled trees burns in 2020, the result could be catastrophic, experts warn. “I think August will be the make-or-break month,” said Berenguer.Deforestation in the Amazon hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has soared a further 25 percent in the first half of 2020.Last month, scientists with US space agency NASA said higher surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean were drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon.“As a result, the southern Amazon landscape becomes dry and flammable, making human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading,” NASA said on its website.Fires are also worsening in the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetlands, adjacent to the southern Amazon.In July, the number of blazes there more than tripled to 1,684 compared with the same month a year ago, according to INPE data, the most for that month since records began in 1998.
650	3	On Time and Water. By Andri Snaer Magnason. Translated by Lytton Smith. Serpent’s Tail; 352 pages; £16.99. To be published in America by Open Letter in March 2021; $26.IN AUGUST 2019 an extraordinary plaque was unveiled at Borgarfjordur, in western Iceland. It commemorates Okjökull, the first of the country’s glaciers to be completely lost to climate change. Okjökull was declared “dead” in 2014, when it was no longer thick enough to flow across the landscape, as it had done for centuries. Framed as “A letter to the future”, the plaque reads (in Icelandic and English):Along with the date, the memorial carries the words “415ppm CO2”: last summer, atmospheric carbon dioxide was measured at 415 parts per million, higher than at any point since humans have lived on Earth.The text was written by Andri Snaer Magnason, an Icelandic author. As he notes in his haunting new book, “On Time and Water”, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere has soared at shocking speed. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ratio was about 280ppm; by 1958 it stood at 315ppm. It is now rising by about two to three parts per million every year.The author’s aim is to give readers a proper sense of geological time, so that they grasp, at a visceral level, how human activity is damaging the planet. He calls the current transformation “mythological”, affecting “the roots of everything we think, choose, produce and believe. It affects everyone we know, everyone we love.”These high-speed changes, including the rise of the world’s waters, will alter life irrevocably within a more familiar time frame: “All this will happen during the lifetime of a child who is born today and lives to be my grandmother’s age, 95.”There are plenty of books about the climate crisis. But Mr Andri Snaer Magnason’s perspective on his country’s environment is unique and compelling. His earlier book, “Dreamland: A Self-Help Manual for a Frightened Nation”, was a hymn to Iceland’s highlands and a critique of the government’s decision to build dams to provide power for aluminium smelting. Now he traces his family’s links to the landscape, notably those of his grandparents Hulda and Arni. They were early stalwarts of the Icelandic Glaciological Society, and spent their honeymoon in 1956 investigating the frozen world of Vatnajökull, an ice cap of 8,000 square kilometres—for now, at least—which was almost entirely unexplored in the mid-20th century. In old age Hulda recalls the indescribable smell of the glacier. “When you’re up on Vatnajökull,” she tells her grandson, “everything disappears; you forget everything. An infinite vastness. An absolute dream.”“On Time and Water” is part family memoir, part scientific analysis, part meditation on subjects as wide-ranging as the “Poetic Edda”—Iceland’s medieval literary treasury—and the role of the Dalai Lama in 21st-century climate politics. The author tries to understand, and tries to make the reader understand, why the climate crisis is not widely perceived as a distinct, transformative event in the manner of, say, the fall of the Berlin Wall or the attacks of September 11th 2001. The fundamental problem, as this book elucidates, is time. Climate change is a disaster in slow motion, and yet “slow” is a great deal faster than many people seem able to comprehend. ■
235	4	"In the study, researchers at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program found that states, counties and congressional districts that voted Republican in 2016 and 2018 will suffer greater economic and environmental damages from a changing climate over the coming decades than places that voted Democratic in the past two elections. As a share of income, rural areas that now break predominantly for the GOP will likewise suffer greater losses than the metropolitan centers that have become the backbone of the Democratic coalition. These findings show how continued disruption in the environment might scramble the geographic alignment of the climate debate. Today, Republicans elected from the states that emit the highest levels of greenhouse gases have coalesced into what I've called ""a seemingly impregnable brown barricade against federal legislation to reduce the carbon emissions linked to climate change."" Republicans hold 35 of the 40 Senate seats from the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, according to figures from the federal Energy Information Administration; in 2016, President Donald Trump won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states. But these new results raise the possibility that some states that now see action against climate change as an economic threat may increasingly view inaction as the greater danger. That could poke holes in the ""brown barricade.""  ""Drill down on the political geography of climate damage and it becomes clear that in much of the country Republicans are voting for people who are opposed to climate policy even as they are most exposed to climate impacts,"" write David G. Victor, Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, the authors of the report. On the other hand, some of the Mountain and Great Plains states that now emit the most carbon may benefit economically from a warming climate, the study found. That raises the ironic prospect that the states contributing the most to climate damages elsewhere may grow even more resistant to action because the shifting weather patterns may improve their own long-term economic prospects. The Brookings study tracked these dynamics by using a county-level model of the impact of climate change developed by the Climate Impact Lab, a consortium that includes scientists and economists from several institutions, including the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Chicago and Rutgers University. The model incorporates such factors as potential losses from rising sea levels, the impact on agricultural yields and changing mortality rates to project how much economic harm climate change will impose on each county through the end of the century, in the period from 2080 to 2099. Though projections that distant are inherently subject to uncertainty, Victor says there are two reasons for confidence in the forecasts. ""One is that these impacts are based on good physical understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms,"" he wrote in an email. ""We know a lot about how strong wind and high tides affects coastal areas, about how heat stress affects workers, etc. Second, this is not a single analysis, but a meta-analysis. It is a compilation of the best science in the area. Putting both together give one a lot more confidence in the projections."" The Brookings analysis of the Climate Impact Lab's results for American counties produced a clear pattern: The red places most opposed to green activism are the most exposed to economic and environmental risks from a changing climate. The study found that Trump carried nine of the top 10, and 16 of the top 20, states projected to suffer the most economic damage from a changing climate over the coming decades. Counties that voted for Trump in 2016 are projected to face significantly greater economic losses in the coming decades than those that voted for Clinton -- nearly 5% for the Trump counties, compared with just over 3% for the Clinton counties. And congressional districts that Republicans carried in 2018 likewise are projected to endure significantly greater long-term economic losses (4.4%) than those that voted for Democrats (2.7%). These contrasts are largely driven by the regional imbalance in the long-term impact of climate change. The study finds that states across the nation's southern half, especially in the Gulf region from Florida through Texas, face the greatest risk of overall losses, coastal damage and increased mortality rates from a changing climate. These are states now dominated by Republicans. The eight states that the study projects will face the largest economic damages from climate change run from east to west across the Sun Belt from South Carolina, Georgia and Florida through Alabama and Mississippi to Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas. Trump won all eight of those states and Republicans now control all 16 of their Senate seats.  So far, there's no evidence that concern about climate has become a decisive political factor in those states. Most pointedly, voters in Florida and Texas last fall elected climate skeptics Rick Scott and Ted Cruz, respectively, to the Senate over Democratic opponents who called for aggressive actions to reduce the risk. But Muro, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program, says continued climate-related damage could tilt that balance over time. ""Wave after wave of hurricanes coming into central Texas or the Gulf states may be destabilizing of the usual assumed ideological position of those places,"" he says. Three other states across the Sun Belt -- North Carolina, Oklahoma and Arizona -- also rank in the top 15 states at greatest risk for losses, Brookings found. Trump won each of those and Republicans hold all of their Senate seats except for one in Arizona, which Democrat Kyrsten Sinema captured last fall. (Sinema has called for action on climate change, but did not stress the issue.) The study also found that while the absolute economic losses will be greatest in metropolitan centers -- almost all of which now lean toward Democrats -- the damages will represent a greater share of total per capita income in rural places that Republicans now rely upon.""Rural areas suffer less in absolute terms but have much lower incomes, so the percentage hit is greater,"" Muro says. ""This is consistent with the intuition in most research on climate impacts -- that poor places are more vulnerable and, while they lose less in absolute terms, they have even less they can afford to lose."" For all these reasons, the authors conclude: ""The current gridlock might not be as permanent as it now seems because many of the jurisdictions that have selected political leaders opposed to climate policy are most exposed to the harms of climate change."" But in most of the high-risk states the prospect of future damages from climate change must contend politically with the reality of current economic benefits. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and South Carolina -- each projected for big climate-related losses in the study -- all rank among the 20 states that today emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, according to the Energy Information Administration data. Most high emission states either produce a substantial amount of fossil fuels or rely on cheap coal-generated electricity to power robust manufacturing sectors. Over time, support for action against climate change may grow faster in high-risk states that are not as reliant on the fossil fuel economy, a list headlined by Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Florida may prove especially pivotal over time, the Brookings authors believe. Heavily exposed to the danger of increased coastal damage, it exceeds all other states in the expected economic losses through the remainder of this century. It is home to fully seven of the 10 metropolitan areas across the country that the study expects to endure the greatest damages from climate change, led by Lakeland-Winter Haven, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Cape Coral-Fort Meyers; Miami-Fort Lauderdale ranks 10th on the list. ""You do have to think about Florida,"" says Muro. ""Is it less stable (in its resistance to climate action) than Texas?"" Victor, the study's co-author, believes that in the high-risk states with a big investment in the fossil fuel economy, growing awareness of climate danger may translate into calls for policies of adaptation, rather than acceptance of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Republicans from those states have uniformly backed Trump as he's moved to rescind the regulations from former President Barack Obama limiting carbon emissions from power plants and increasing automotive fuel economy, and to withdraw US from the Paris treaty limiting global emissions. It may be easier for conservatives from those states to advance policies, such as seawalls, to offset the danger of rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes. ""The politics of adaptation and emission control are very different,"" says Victor, a professor of international relations at the UC San Diego and a senior fellow at Brookings.  One of the study's most striking projections is that 19 states, all across the nation's northern half, will experience at least some net economic benefits from the changing climate. These states will benefit mostly because climate change will mean longer growing seasons, fewer intense cold snaps and also because higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increase yields for some crops. These 19 states include 11 that voted for Clinton over Trump, and all three of the ""blue wall"" states that Trump peeled away after they had voted Democratic in at least the previous six consecutive presidential elections: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. ""There is certainly an irony here that the blue coalition by and large appears more oriented to policy actions and responses that in fact will benefit other parts of the country, even as they benefit the world,"" says Muro. But the list of potential beneficiaries from a changing climate also includes Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Alaska and Idaho, all reliably Republican states. Each of those, except for Idaho, is a major energy producer that ranks among the seven states that emit the most carbon for every dollar of economic output. That juxtaposition creates a different irony: Several of the states contributing the most to carbon emissions -- and voting most reliably for politicians opposed to reducing them -- may also benefit from the changes those emissions trigger. Still, the larger pattern is that Sun Belt states across the nation's southern tier that now underpin Republican strength in the Electoral College, the House and the Senate are on the front line for economic and environmental losses from future changes in the climate. In the coming years, the American climate debate may turn on whether growing evidence of harm dislodges many, or any, of those states from the ""brown barricade"" now blocking any federal efforts to confront the challenge."

Photo / Alan GibsonAuckland, environment and Māori affairs reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand could be upping the ante in its global efforts to combat climate change with an independent review of its emissions reduction targets under way.Minister for Climate Change James Shaw has asked the Climate Change Commission to review New Zealand's nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.The current target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels over the next decade, however Parliament last year agreed to ensure the target was consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre‑industrial levels.In a letter to commission chair Rod Carr, Shaw asked the review to ""ensure consistency between the NDC and the more recent temperature and emissions reductions goals"".Science had also ""evolved considerably"" since the target was lodged back in 2016, and under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand had committed to update it this year.Shaw said New Zealand was ""showing leadership"" by committing to the review to ensure the target was ambitious enough.READ MORE:• Climate change costs NZ in droughts, floods - Victoria University, NIWA• Climate change: New Zealand emissions barely budge, transport emissions cuts urged• NZ's big dry and climate change: What's the link?• Climate change: Coronavirus could halt the world's emissions growthThe Paris Agreement required action from all countries, and targets were expected to strengthen over time.""The Paris Agreement was a turning point,"" Shaw said.""It was the moment that virtually every country in the world decided that, if we are to hand our children a safer future, we need to act.""As a government fully committed to solving climate change, it's only right that we get expert, trusted and independent advice on whether our international targets are consistent with that goal.""Government emissions projections last year showed the country falling woefully short of its Paris commitment, with just a 9 per cent reduction in gross emissions expected by 2030 on 2005 levels.The latest greenhouse gas inventory, released this month, showed New Zealand's emissions had barely budged in recent years, and the country continuing to rely on plantation forestry to soak them up to meet international obligations.""There is a long way to go, but we are starting to bend the curve towards a climate-friendly future in New Zealand,"" Shaw said.He pointed to the Zero Carbon Act passed last year, which enshrined the 1.5C goal in domestic legislation, and Climate Change Commission as examples of actions taken.""If they conclude there is more we need to do, the Commission will provide recommendations on how best to align our international targets with the Paris temperature goal. This will ensure we are playing our part globally,"" Shaw said.However, critics say while more has happened than in previous governments in terms of setting policy, there was still little action.""It would be much more effective if the Government actually enacted some policies - like a carbon tax in the transport sector, some vehicle emissions standards, and so on - that might move us along in terms of beginning even a tiny bit to walk towards the commitments they have already made,"" said Professor Dave Frame, director of Victoria University's New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute.He also questioned setting targets against a global target, which was reliant mostly on the performance of other countries.Instead, he suggested New Zealand set a target to limit its own warming by a given date - as the United Kingdom had done, fix a date by which New Zealand was at net zero CO2 and had lower than current levels of methane, or choose a warming level for New Zealand and aiming not to exceed it.""All those are things countries can do, where success or failure is up to them. Our 1.5C-compatible logic is not.""In its review the Commission was expected to consult with a wide range of people, including iwi and hapū, industry, technical experts, special interest groups and sector leaders.Shaw urged other countries to also review their commitments, and said he had informed an overnight meeting of the Alliance of Small Island States.The review was also to factor in changes in science since the commitment was lodged in 2016, particularly the IPCC's 2018 Special Report on Global Warming that painted a grim picture and urged more action.Along with the emissions target review, Shaw also requested advice from the Commission regarding New Zealand's biogenic methane emissions, the most controversial aspect of the zero carbon law.The current target is for a 24-47 per cent reduction by 2050 and 10 per cent by 2030, but Shaw has requested the commission review how this relates to the 1.5C target and understand potential reductions that could be required.The Commission is expected to provide its recommendations early next year alongside its advice on emissions budgets.Countries were expected to unveil their renewed pledges at the next global climate change meeting in Scotland this year, however due to Covid-19 it had been delayed.The review comes as the Climate Change Commission, along with a group of environmentally-focused NGOs, have been calling for the Government's to apply a ""climate change lens"" to its Covid-19 economic recovery and not lock New Zealand into a high-emissions future.East Coast iwi are also calling for the Government to back a ""shovel-ready"", job-creating and climate-conscious project to save the Raukūmara forest that is dying under a plague of introduced pests."
614	3	Climate change has made its way into Alaska, causing mudslides, wildfires and record-breaking temperatures – but two new studies have added thunderstorms to the list of effects.The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) warns that if greenhouse emissions are not curbed the number of thunderstorms will triple later this century.The increase of these violent storms would spark widespread flash flooding, landslides and lightning-induced wildfires.The studies found that sea ice around Alaska could soon give way to open water and create a substantial amount of moisture. The moisture will combine with warmer temperatures due to greenhouse emissions, which will form the perfect mixture to fuel storms during the summer months. Climate change has made its way into Alaska, causing mudslides, wildfires and record-breaking temperatures – but two new studies have added thunderstorms to the list of effectsAlaska seems to have been lost in the mix when it comes to climate change, but data shows it is expected to warm about 11 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if society does not reduce greenhouse gases. In Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, warmer temperatures and drier conditions in recent summers have lengthened the fire season across the entire state.And last year, over half of the fires in Alaska were started by lightning.  The two studies were conducted by NCAR and a research team led by scientists at the Paris Sciences and Letters University.In Anchorage (pictured), Alaska's largest city, warmer temperatures and drier conditions in recent summers have lengthened the fire season across the entire state. And last year, over half of the fires in Alaska were started by lightningTogether they showed that the sea ice around Alaska is on track to largely give way to open water in the warmer months, creating an ample source of moisture.The substantial amount of moisture plus warmer temperatures from greenhouse emissions is the perfect combination for intense summertime storms.Basile Poujol, a scientist with the Paris Sciences and Letters University and lead author of both studies, said: 'We suspect that the increasing number of thunderstorms might have significant impacts, such as amplifying spring floods or causing more wildfire ignitions.'The increase of these violent storms would spark widespread flash flooding, landslides and lightning-induced wildfires'Further studies are necessary to determine whether these impacts are likely to occur and, if so, their potential effects on ecosystems and society.'However, the team also notes that the destructive events could be avoided simply by curbing emissions.For the first paper, which focused on how Alaskan thunderstorms may change later this century, researchers compared computer simulations of the state's current-day climate with what is expected at the end of the century.The team used a storm-tracking algorithm and the NCAR-based Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to create simulations of Alaska's weather and climate.The results showed that thunderstorm frequency south of the Yukon River increased from about once a year to every month during the warm season.Hourly rainfall rates increased noticeably, ranging up to 37 percent higher in the cores of storms.However, thunderstorms were found to appear in places they are not know to hit, such as the North Slope and West Coast.The second paper focused on the reasons for the increase in thunderstorms. The team applied  applied a specialized model to trace air parcels back to their sources using the WRF, along with other models that created a simulated atmosphere over Alaska, including temperature, water vapor and seasonal sea ice cover.NCAR scientist Maria Molina, a co-author of the second study, said: 'Our goal was to determine the sources of moisture and associated changes that would fuel such a significant increase in thunderstorms over Alaska.'The results showed that moist air masses from ice-free regions of the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean will be an abundant fuel for storms. The warmer atmosphere will experience increasingly powerful thunderstorms that are more likely to organize and form large-scale clusters, increasing the potential for heavy rain and lightning.
469	5	The Detail is a daily news podcast produced for RNZ by Newsroom and is published on Stuff with permission. Click on this link to subscribe to the podcast. Another year, another report from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change warning breathlessly of the catastrophic impact of global warming unless we humans start to take things seriously. What’s changed? Not a huge amount when it comes to the science, says Stuff climate change editor Eloise Gibson ... but quite a lot when it comes to the messaging. This report was less specialised, less dense, Gibson said, and appeared to have among its aims influencing governments through people power. The more that 'normal people' understood about what was happening, the easier it would be for citizens themselves to hold their own governments to account.  READ MORE: * Is it time to ban onshore exploration for fossils fuels? * Why communicating climate change has never been so important * IPCC report shows that limiting global warming is what matters most * For Jacinda Ardern's Labour, the future of climate change must be now * Planetary healthcheck delivers 'unprecedented', 'terrifying' picture   On today's episode, Emile Donovan sits down with Gibson to discuss the good, bad and ugly headlines from the IPCC's sixth assessment report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed in 1988. It released its first report in 1990. And in the interceding 31 years, the science remained largely the same, Gibson said. “The fundamental message hasn't changed that much. Certainly it's gotten stronger, more solid, more widely accepted, but there's nothing in the latest report that researchers didn't know 30 years ago. “Had we started in earnest on this transition 30 years ago, we would have a lot of these things cracked by now. We're certainly capable of doing it.” While the big picture hasn't changed too much, the language used to communicate its ideas has. “The first take away of the report is: the effects of climate change are here ... and they're here now, it's not something that a model on a computer is telling us is going to happen in 100 years' time. “The second was that it's now inarguable, incontrovertible that these changes are being caused by us – and the signal of that, versus the noise of natural variability, is now very clear as well. “The third take away is that some of these impacts are now baked in. Seas are going to keep rising for centuries or millennia now, because of temperature changes that we've already produced. “We can't do anything about that. And the atmosphere is going to keep warming for 20 or 30 years now, in even the best-case scenario. “But the final take away is that it's not too late to put the brakes on and stop it getting worse.” The IPCC's most recent assessment report before this one came out eight years ago and was criticised for its inaccessibility and dense language: scientists writing for other scientists. However, Gibson said that was very different this year. The summary of the report – the wording of which has to be agreed on by all the governments involved with the IPCC, which is a politically delicate, weeks-long process as representatives veto and sanitise certain words and phrasing – is much more accessible. Gibson suggested this could be a deliberate act on the part of the IPCC to encourage people to engage with and understand the ideas in the report, and force their own governments to act. “This is something that affects all of us ... We should be able to understand it, we should be able to read it.”
339	5	"Growing up in Portland, Oregon, Oswill has become more concerned about the extreme weather changes from wildfires to heat waves she's seeing year after year. The 44-year-old mother of two likens it to a pandemic, but never-ending.""It's like a lockdown, but we're not going to solve it by putting on a mask or getting a vaccine,"" Oswill told CNN. ""It's just sort of perpetual. It's scary.""A historic heat wave is searing much of the Pacific Northwest, and it is not yet July — a month when Oswill and many Portland residents typically experience the hottest days of the year. Portland set an all-time, record-high temperature three days in a row, topping out at 116 degrees on Monday. Seattle hit 108 degrees, besting the all-time record it set just a day earlier.  Across the border, Lytton, British Columbia registered 117.5 degrees on Monday — the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada, and around 48 degrees above what's normal for this time of year.Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the heat wave is ""unprecedented.""""We saw heat records over the weekend only to be broken again the next day,"" Dahl told CNN, ""particularly for a part of the country where this type of heat does not happen very often.""Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, put it very simply: climate change is making heat waves more frequent and more intense. ""You warm up the planet, you're going to see an increased incidence of heat extremes,"" Mann told CNN.Experts like Dahl and Mann say climate change is reshaping the planet's weather patterns. As humans emit more planet-warming greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, more energy is added to the climate system. The excess energy, according to Kristie Ebi, a climate and health researcher at the University of Washington, appears by way of extreme weather events.""Heat waves have always occurred and will always occur, but we've got a very different pattern of heat waves now than we did a couple of decades ago,"" Ebi told CNN. ""And it's not just the intensity, it's also the geographic extent.""In the opposite end of the country, over 40 million people in the Northeast US are also under heat advisories, including the New York, Philadelphia and Boston metropolitan areas. Though the heat won't be as bad as Oregon and Washington, records for the date could be set in the Northeast before temperatures cool off on Thursday. Extreme heat is of the deadliest consequences of climate change, killing more people than any other weather related event. Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, analyzed the number of deaths related to extreme heat in the US each year. A 2020 study, on which Weinberger was lead author, found an underestimated number of heat-related deaths in the country, since records typically only look at medical terms such as heat stroke, and neglects other potentially heat-related causes of death, like heart attacks.""Heat likely contributes to many more deaths from causes other than heat stroke, because heat can exacerbate other chronic diseases, such as heart and lung conditions,"" Weinberger told CNN. ""Given the danger posed by heat, events like the ongoing heat wave in the Pacific Northwest need to be taken very seriously.""Officials in Multnomah County, home to Portland, told CNN as of Monday morning there were at least 43 heat-related emergency department and urgent care clinic visits in the county on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The sheriff's office said Monday that ""ambulances are stretched thin due to demand.""""Normally we would expect about 1 or 2 visits for heat illness in the same time period,"" Kate Yeiser, communications coordinator for Multnomah County, told CNN in an email. ""The visits this weekend alone represent nearly half the heat illness visits we typically see during an entire summer.""One appalling aspect of heat-related deaths in the US is the number of premature mortalities brought by heat exposure, particularly among babies and children left unattended in cars. A 2020 study published in the journal GeoHealth, which Ebi co-authored, found large increases in the number of premature deaths in the US each year due to heat exposure as the planet warms.  ""Many don't understand how fast cars heat up and how babies physiology can't tolerate that,"" Ebi said. ""Ensuring that people are really aware about protecting babies and children during these heat waves is important.""To understand how the climate crisis is changing the playing field, Mann suggests thinking of weather events on a bell curve. The highest point of the curve is where the most common weather takes place and the tails are where the extreme events lie. A warming planet shifts the bell curve to the right, pushing the already-extreme events into uncharted territory.Mann says that climate models, which predict general global conditions well into the future, can well-capture the shift and predict increases in extreme heat. But, he said, they do not paint a full picture of the impacts of climate change during the summer. ""This is an area where current generation models are not capturing a real-world climate connection,"" said Mann, who was also the lead author of a study that shows climate change is causing the summer's jet stream — fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day to day weather — to behave oddly. ""In that sense, climate models are actually underestimating the impact that climate change is having on events like the unprecedented heat wave we're witnessing out West right now,"" Mann added.Climate change can cause the jet stream to get locked into a static wave pattern during the summer. Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles, says this is best illustrated by flicking a jump rope up and down until its waves seem to stand still. Similarly in the atmosphere, high and low pressure systems can get stuck, creating extreme weather events like severe heat, drought or wildfires.That's what happened in the Pacific Northwest this weekend, where a so-called heat dome, a strong ridge of high pressure, acts as a lid on the atmosphere. The lid traps the hot air trying to escape, and warms it even more as it sinks. ""Even if the jet stream does what it historically used to do, with no specific climate change contributions, climate change is still dramatically increasing the likelihood of these extreme heat events,"" Swain told CNN. ""If you warm the atmosphere, you'd expect those heat waves to be hotter than they otherwise would have been.""If the US fails to slash planet-warming emissions and improve climate adaptation systems, climate experts say people across the US and around the world are going to experience more severe impacts of extreme heat. By the middle of this century — 2036 to 2065 — vast swaths of the US that don't typically experience extreme heat such as the upper Midwest region and New England are set to face severe heat on a regular basis, according to a study from the Union of Concerned Scientists which Dahl co-authored. ""When we look at where we're heading in the future, our analysis has shown that if we fail to reduce our heat-trapping emissions, we are poised to see a staggering expansion of dangerous heat across the US,"" Dahl told CNN. But, she adds, if the US aggressively reduces emissions as well as limit future global warming to 2-degrees Celsius, we can ""spare millions of people in the US and many more around the world from relentless summer heat."""

805	3	WASHINGTON — Efforts to undermine climate change science in the federal government, once orchestrated largely by President Trump’s political appointees, are now increasingly driven by midlevel managers trying to protect their jobs and budgets and wary of the scrutiny of senior officials, according to interviews and newly revealed reports and surveys.A case in point: When John Crusius, a research chemist at the United States Geological Survey, published an academic paper on natural solutions to climate change in April, his government affiliation never appeared on it. It couldn’t.Publication of his study, after a month’s delay, was conditioned by his employer on Dr. Crusius not associating his research with the federal government.“There is no doubt in my mind that my paper was denied government approval because it had to do with efforts to mitigate climate change,” Dr. Crusius said, making clear he also was speaking in his personal capacity because the agency required him to so. “If I were a seismologist and had written an analogous paper about reducing seismic risk, I’m sure the paper would have sailed through.”Government experts said they have been surprised at the speed with which federal workers have internalized President Trump’s antagonism for climate science, and called the new landscape dangerous.“If top-level administrators issued a really clear public directive, there would be an uproar and a pushback, and it would be easier to combat,” said Lauren Kurtz, executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, which supports scientists. “This is a lot harder to fight.”An inspector general’s report at the Environmental Protection Agency made public in May found that almost 400 employees surveyed in 2018 believed a manager had interfered with or suppressed the release of scientific information, but they never reported the violations. A separate Union of Concerned Scientists survey in 2018 of more than 63,000 federal employees across 16 agencies identified the E.P.A. and Department of Interior as having the least trustworthy leadership in matters of scientific integrity.Findings published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE in April on a subset of those agencies found that 631 workers agreed or strongly agreed that they had been asked to omit the phrase “climate change” from their work. In the same paper, 703 employees said they avoided working on climate change or using the phrase.“They’re doing it because they’re scared,” said Maria Caffrey, a former geography specialist at the National Park Service who battled managers as they tried to delete humanity’s role in climate change from a recent report on sea-level rise. “These are all people who went to the March for Science rallies, but then they got into the office on Monday and completely rolled over.”Examples are plentiful, not all of them new. But increasingly, scientists are willing to speak out.On April 24, 2017, Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, published a study showing the links between extreme weather events and climate change. Since the research was funded in part by Obama-era Energy Department grants that included more than $1.3 million for Dr. Diffenbaugh’s project, he credited the agency in the paper’s acknowledgments.On April 25, emails show, the researchers were told that acknowledgment of Energy Department support would require additional review.“It was alarming to receive this email because it was so far outside of our normal practice as a scientific community,” Dr. Diffenbaugh said.Full disclosure of funding, he noted, is required by most scientific journals and by the university.The emails said managers in the Energy Department’s biological and environmental research program, known as B.E.R., felt their program was “under attack internally” and were worried about certain terms, including “extreme event attribution,” which refers to how much a given weather event can be linked to global warming.They also worried about references in Dr. Diffenbaugh’s research paper to terms like the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation on coal-fired power plants; the social cost of carbon, a principle that puts a price on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions; and the Paris Agreement on climate change.Citing those three subject areas, a research supervisor wrote to Dr. Diffenbaugh six days after his study was published, “Was trying not to put too much of this in writing, but the concern here is avoiding the impression that B.E.R. is supporting research directly focused on policy evaluation.”Those were exactly the subjects of Dr. Diffenbaugh’s federally funded research.A subsequent paper examined how meeting the Paris Agreement’s carbon reduction targets would affect extreme weather events. When Dr. Diffenbaugh submitted it for approval, he was told Energy Department officials felt it was “solid on the science” but contained “red flag words” like Paris Agreement, emails show.His choice was to either remove those phrases and acknowledge the agency funding, or keep them and not mention the grant.Dr. Diffenbaugh and Stanford decided that the research should not be changed and would be published with the so-called red-flag words and the disclosure of funding sources. Department officials later notified the project leaders that funding would be cut in half. Dr. Diffenbaugh’s project was zeroed out.Jess Szymanski, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said in a statement: “There is no Department of Energy policy banning the mention of ‘climate change’ or ‘Paris Agreement,’ nor is there department guidance to withhold funding for projects including this language. To allege so is false.”Then there is the case of Marcy Rockman. Until she resigned from the Park Service in November 2018, Dr. Rockman served for seven years as a climate change adaptation coordinator; five of those years were spent developing a strategy to protect cultural resources from climate change. But when the strategy was issued in late January 2017, her supervisors decided to drop plans to send copies to each national park.“There was no appetite for any of my management chain to write a memo that would have their signature on it that said, ‘I am distributing the climate change strategy,’” she said.The European Association of Archaeologists took notice anyway and invited Dr. Rockman to present her work in the Netherlands. Her boss approved the trip, and then retired.But several months later, Dr. Rockman said, she was informed that she needed to reapply for approval. Her supervisors suggested she play down climate change. Then the trip was denied.“I was responsible for making and carrying out decisions that no one above me wanted to make,” she said.The Department of Interior declined to comment on Dr. Rockman’s case, citing pending litigation.Patrick Gonzalez, the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service, requested policy approval in March 2018 to publish a paper based on analysis of more than a century of climate data across 417 national parks.His supervisor did not get past the opening sentence: “Anthropogenic climate change is altering ecological and human systems globally.”“Without reading any more of the manuscript, she said, ‘I’m going to have to ask you to change that,’” Dr. Gonzalez recalled. He said in an interview that he was speaking in his own capacity and not on behalf of the federal government.Emails and other documents show that Dr. Gonzalez then approached John Dennis, the agency’s deputy chief scientist, to protest. Dr. Dennis encouraged compromise.Documents show that Dr. Dennis highlighted the phrase “anthropogenic,” or human-caused. “Is this word here necessary to the basic scientific thesis of the paper — which I interpret to be ‘climate change is revealed already to have had major impacts to parks?’” he asked.“From a policy standpoint, it might be too strong for a DOI person to say ‘anthropogenic climate change,’” Dr. Dennis wrote, suggesting instead “carbon dioxide driven climate change.”Dr. Gonzalez refused to make the change and, after three months, the agency backed down. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters in September 2018, without changes.Conner Swanson, an Interior Department spokesman, said Dr. Gonzalez’s research was about “adaptation to climate change rather than cause of climate change and, as a result, the integrity of the science did not require discussing the cause of climate change in a situation where such use could divert attention from the scientific findings of the article.”That same summer, the Park Service tried to delete every mention of humanity’s role in climate change in a report on sea level rise. Its lead author, Dr. Caffrey, objected. It was released after more than a year’s delay without the attempted edits. Dr. Caffrey, however, said she was then demoted before her position was eliminated.Dr. Gonzalez said he was taking a risk telling his story. But, he said, “I aim to serve as a positive example of standing strongly for science.”Mr. Swanson said that since Mr. Trump took office, the Interior Department had “improved scientific integrity by following the law, using the best available science and relying on the expertise of our professional career staff.”Trump administration officials have noted that in almost all of these cases, the science was ultimately published.But scientists said that came at a cost. Dr. Crusius was given informal approval in the summer of 2019 to publish research in the well-regarded journal Earth’s Future, which is published by the American Geophysical Union. Then, in September, after the paper had gone through a round of peer review, his employer, the U.S. Geological Survey, reversed course and opposed publication.“I appealed this decision, and I was allowed to publish this as a private citizen,” he said.Dr. Crusius said the research, on the environmental benefits and risks of storing carbon in trees, soil, ocean and wetlands to delay climate impacts, was important because climate change is a problem the government ultimately will need solid science to confront.“We need all the help we can get, including from both federal and academic scientists,” he said.The U.S.G.S. denied that the paper was not approved because it dealt with climate change.Lawmakers and others who work with scientists said publication of the research did not diminish the hurdles thrown in the way, which served to signal that writing about politically disfavored topics comes at a personal price.At least one case predates the Trump administration. Danny Cullenward, a Stanford Law School lecturer, said the Energy Department tried in 2015 to distance itself from his research, which showed the United States could not meet its Paris Agreement goals with the policies that President Barack Obama was pushing.It is now widely acknowledged those policies most likely would not have cut emissions enough to meet those goals. But at the time, the Obama administration was working to persuade global leaders that the president’s plans would get the country substantially toward that goal.Dr. Cullenward, then a research fellow working with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said a lab adviser initially told him the research could not be released before the Paris Agreement talks. After he objected, he was told the study would require further review.“I interpreted that to be, ‘We’re going to stick this thing in a black hole,’” Dr. Cullenward said. He resigned his affiliation with the lab.John German, a spokesman for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said Dr. Cullenward had been free to publish his work on his own but that Energy Department research must meet strict peer review standards that had not yet occurred.Dr. Cullenward said his experience did not compare with the scale of violations in the Trump administration. But, he said, a pro-climate change president would not automatically make scientists’ work secure.“We can’t get partisan about what scientific integrity means,” he said.

In a five-minute speech Greta Thunberg said “world leaders are behaving like children so it falls on us to be the adults in the room”. “I will not be silent as the world is on fire,” she said. The Bristol Council have jumped on the climate change bandwagon and have considered banning diesel cars and recently rejected plans to expand the airport after climate protests.Image: Associated Press
553	4	There’s no magic bill waiting in the wings—and no quick path to arriving at one.There’s a wrinkle in how the United States talks about climate change in 2017, a tension fundamental to the issue’s politics but widely ignored.On the one hand, Democrats are the party of climate change. Since the 1990s, as public belief in global warming has become strongly polarized, the Democratic Party has emerged as the advocate of more aggressive climate action. The most recent Democratic president made climate policy a centerpiece of his second term, and the party’s national politicians now lament and oppose the undoing of his work. Concern for the climate isn’t just an elite issue, either: Rank-and-file Democrats are more likely to worry about global warming than the median voter.On the other hand, the Democratic Party does not have a plan to address climate change. This is true at almost every level of the policy-making process: It does not have a consensus bill on the issue waiting in the wings; it does not have a shared vision for what that bill could look like; and it does not have a guiding slogan—like “Medicare for all”—to express how it wants to stop global warming.Many people in the party know that they want to do something about climate change, but there’s no agreement about what that something may be.This is not for lack of trying. Democrats have struggled to formulate a post-Obama climate policy because substantive political obstacles stand in their way. They have not yet identified a mechanism that will make a dent in Earth’s costly, irreversible warming while uniting the many factions of their coalition. These problems could keep the party scrambling to face the climate crisis for years to come.* * *The roots of this crisis go back to 2009, when Democrats held unified control of the White House and Congress. The end of the last decade was a unique moment in climate politics: Thanks to a string of intense hurricane years, and the unexpected success of Al Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth, public support for addressing climate change through legislation was higher than it had ever been.Democrats responded with the American Clean Energy and Security Act, widely known as “Waxman-Markey,” after its two sponsors, Congressmen Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts. The bill proposed creating a carbon-emissions trading market across the United States. Under its terms, the government would have distributed a number of “right to emit carbon” credits to companies, which they could then have bought and sold to each other. As the years passed, the government would allot fewer credits, forcing the price of emitting carbon to increase, which would—in theory—ultimately decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.Though more than a little technical, a pollution market was a proven idea in U.S. environmental law: George H.W. Bush established a similar “cap-and-trade” system during his presidency to reduce the pollutants that create acid rain.In June 2009, Waxman-Markey passed the House. But as that summer wore on, the bill’s prospects floundered. By August, the Tea Party rose to command more media attention, and public opinion turned against Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid—focused on passing what would become the Affordable Care Act—declined to take the climate bill to the Senate floor. By the middle of the next summer, Waxman-Markey was effectively dead. Only a few years after it opened, the window to pass climate legislation had already shut.Even in defeat, Waxman-Markey cost the party dearly. More than two dozen congressional Democrats who had supported the cap-and-trade bill lost in the 2010 midterm election. The casualties included Rick Boucher, a 14-term veteran of Congress whose district included much of southwest Virginia’s coal country. Boucher had negotiated concessions for local coal companies into Waxman-Markey, but this could not save his seat. Ten House Democrats, including Boucher, voted for Waxman-Markey and against the Affordable Care Act. Six of them lost their seats in 2010.Indeed, Democrats seemed to prevail only when they ran against the climate bill. Joe Manchin, then the Democratic governor of West Virginia, won a special election that year to serve in the Senate, but only after he ran an ad that showed him shooting a pile of paper with a rifle. “I sued EPA, and I’ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill,” he said in the commercial, which received wide media coverage.So Waxman-Markey failed. And then, freed from a unified campaign, American progressives took climate policy in two different directions.First, the Obama administration pressed ahead with its plans to use the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide. (This power predated his presidency: In 2007, the Supreme Court told the EPA it must consider regulating greenhouse gases under that law.) This push eventually produced the Clean Power Plan in 2015, a set of rules meant to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector by 30 percent from their historic peak.Though it dominated press coverage of Obama’s climate policy, the Clean Power Plan never actually took effect. In February 2016, the Supreme Court blocked it from gaining the force of law. But the administration got many other rules aimed at drawing down carbon pollution on the books by the end of Obama’s term.Second, a swath of environmentalists abandoned the hope of passing climate legislation and returned to a more grassroots, project-by-project approach. Instead of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions through law, these activists hoped to deprive oil companies of their social license to operate altogether.Chief among these new groups was 350.org, led by the author Bill McKibben. 350 opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, a mega-infrastructure project that linked the Canadian tar sands to U.S. export terminals, warning its completion would spell “game over for the climate.”  In 2010, the Sierra Club also began to use environmental litigation and public pressure to shut down hundreds of coal-burning power plants as part of its Beyond Coal campaign.This climate antagonism was one aspect of the left’s general resurgence during this period. Inspired in part by Naomi Klein’s 2014 book This Changes Everything, many activists came to see climate change as one more symptom of a dehumanized and extractive capitalism.These two sides even had something of a proxy battle during the 2016 Democratic primary. During that race, Hillary Clinton opposed a carbon tax and endorsed the Obama administration’s ongoing regulatory efforts. Sanders endorsed a carbon tax and called for more aggressive investment in climate mitigation. Unlike Clinton’s policies, Sanders would surely have required a Democratic Congress to enshrine his policies.In some ways, though, the 2016 primary was an imperfect battleground for climate policy. Sanders did not seek an energy economist’s ideal climate policy. He wedded climate-hawk positions—like his opposition to natural-gas fracking—to the 1970s’ classically green opposition to nuclear power. (Even though his proposed carbon tax would have been the greatest boon to the nuclear-power industry in decades, as nuclear plants emit no greenhouse gases.)And there likely would have been little substantive policy difference between either candidate’s presidency, at least at first. Had Clinton or Sanders won the election, their EPA would have dutifully defended the Clean Power Plan in court. And their administration would have benefited from one more liberal seat on the Supreme Court to help enshrine more aggressive climate protections into law.But Trump won. And that brings us to the present.* * *On October 10, Scott Pruitt formally repealed the Clean Power Plan, the first phase of a planned disembowelment of Obama’s environmental legacy.Pruitt is not assured to succeed in this effort. Many environmental lawyers argue that his legal arguments are not particularly well-supported. To push his repeal through, Pruitt had to muck with the EPA’s internal cost-benefit calculations. His EPA changed how it estimates the social harms of carbon dioxide, calculating a number more than 50 times smaller than what the Obama administration used; it also changed how it values the threat that air pollution poses to the American public.It may all be for naught. Some environmentalists argue that the Clean Power Plan already accomplished its main goal, which was sending an anti-coal price signal to utility managers. Michael Bloomberg, a UN special climate envoy and the former New York mayor, has argued that the falling cost of renewable energy and the availability of cheap, bountiful natural gas will help the United States meet its carbon-reduction goals even without the federal policy.But Pruitt does not need to win a total victory to succeed. The Clean Power Plan repeal will now be litigated in court, with the EPA lobbying on the side of deregulation. The fight will last years. It may even wind up in front of a Supreme Court more conservative than it is now.No one knows the future, but it’s not hard to sketch possibilities. Pruitt may very well secure a ruling that effectively keeps the Clean Air Act from ever regulating greenhouse gases. Even if he fails, a future Trump EPA may succeed in permanently limiting the law’s regulatory power.And when a climate-concerned Democrat next enters the White House, whether in 2020, 2024, or 2028, he or she may find that the Obama administration’s main policy implement for fighting carbon emissions has been dulled into uselessness. Attorneys at some future EPA will, at that point, probably improvise some new way to address climate change in regulation. They will have no other choice. But there will likely be a need, too, for new legislation. What will Democrats do?* * *Democrats face at least three major problems in trying to formulate a climate policy.First, the relationship between environmentalists and labor groups has disintegrated since 2009. Once upon a time, unions widely supported Waxman-Markey. The bill funded assistance for workers put out of work during the transition away from fossil fuels and launched “green-job” retraining programs. It also provided tens of billions in funding for “carbon capture and sequestration,” an experimental technology that would possibly have allowed coal plants to keep running. But when it failed, the pan-Democratic consensus fell apart with it.Neither of the two climate strategies that have succeeded Waxman-Markey offer particular appeal to organized labor. The Clean Power Plan essentially made nonprofits and already-strapped state budgets (in GOP-governed states) responsible for softening the economic blow of carbon regulation. In large part, they declined.The antagonistic approach to pipelines and other fossil-fuel projects has also alienated labor. Construction-union workers still spend much more time building pipelines than installing renewables. Divorced from a unified legislative campaign—and the promise of federal funding—the new environmental antagonism can seem to run directly counter to worker interests.This isn’t necessarily the fault of the antagonists alone: Unionization in the renewable industry is also lagging. Renewable-energy companies are often as anti-union as any other California-based tech firm. In October, for instance, Tesla—which swears it is trying to hire more employees as fast as it can—fired 400 to 700 workers in what many analysts understood as a union-busting move. United Auto Workers has filed a complaint with the National Labor-Relations Board.Green-energy companies don’t only harbor an anti-regulatory, Silicon Valley–style dislike for organized labor. They also see themselves as fighting a desperate battle on price with oil and gas companies. Every cent the union might add to production cost, they argue, is a cent that disadvantages them against fossil fuels.The green-labor breakdown is the party’s biggest political obstacle. But its second problem is that Democratic voters still don’t care about climate change very much. Like other Americans, most of the party’s electorate experience it as a “low-intensity” issue. Though a majority of Americans in every state believe in climate change, very few people use climate policy to decide whom to vote for. Even Democrats say that a candidate’s proposed climate policy matters less when making a voting decision than his or her proposed policies about jobs, health care, the economy, education, income inequality, and terrorism.As it happens, Trump is helping solve this problem: Due to his steady siege on Obama-era climate policy, he seems to be motivating rank-and-file Democrats to address the issue. His withdrawal from the Paris Agreement was much more unpopular than the treaty itself. But it remains unclear whether the passage of climate policy motivates its supporters more than it aggravates and alienates the issue’s “anti-constituency” (such as coal and oil workers).Finally, dealing with climate change through any policy is just hard. Most of the good news in climate change lately has come from the power sector, where emissions have dropped by 18 percent over the last five years. But electricity production only makes up about 29 percent of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. For the United States to decarbonize—which even the newest and most optimistic projections say must proceed at a historically unprecedented pace—it must also tackle carbon pollution from other sectors.Those other sectors will be tougher to crack. Most of the emissions from the transportation sector (which itself makes up more than a quarter of U.S. greenhouse-gas pollution) come from cars and trucks. In order to draw those emissions down by 2050, consumers will have to opt in to electric vehicles en masse and service stations will have to erect electric chargers across the country. Analysts say that’s unlikely to occur without large public investment.And there are few ideas about how to tackle the 21 percent of U.S. emissions that come from the industrial and manufacturing sector.* * *These questions are more pressing than they seem. Eighteen months from now, Democratic policy advisers will meet to develop their chosen candidate’s primary policies. If Democrats win unified control of Congress and the White House in, say, 2020, history suggests they will get a sliver of time to commit any kind of new policy to statute before public opinion turns against them. During that window, dozens of issues will compete for law makers’ attention.In that light, consider how Democrats have treated health care over the past 10 months. While there’s no party-wide consensus, small groups of voters around the country have organized around the issue, calling their senators every day for months. More than a third of Democratic senators have supported a bill to introduce a single national health insurer. And Bernie Sanders, the party’s 2020 frontrunner, has debated Trumpcare (in its many forms) on CNN several times.In sum, many Democrats have coalesced around a single phrase (if not quite a policy to accompany it) and promised to deliver it the next time they’re in power. And even if some Democrats see “Medicare for All” as a base play—as a slogan more likely to be deployed in Vermont than Colorado—it remains a policy-focused promise about future governance. The party has similar promises for other issues, too: On immigration, it can promise the DREAM Act; on LGBT rights, the Equality Act.I suspect that many voters (including most rank-and-file Democrats) believe that there’s a similar strategy on climate change. They think there’s some bill waiting in the wings that would address the issue. They trust that Democrats have a legislative plan to resolve climate crisis, and that the party only needs to be granted control of Congress to pass it.But nothing of a similar scale exists, and some of the Senate’s most vocal Democrats on the issue resist formulating one. Sheldon Whitehouse, who delivers a weekly climate-themed haranguing on the Senate floor, recently told Vox’s Jeff Stein that way to politically solve global warming is to convert Republicans to the cause.There are only two bills that come close to serving as a flagship bill. The first is the 100 by ’50 Act, released in April by Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “100 by ’50” is an ambitious economic-planning package that would require 100 percent of American electricity to come from clean or renewable energy by 2050.The bill’s release was timed to the People’s Climate March in Washington, D.C., and McKibben attended its unveiling. It represents the triumph of the 350.org wing of the environmental movement, blocking future fossil-fuel investment and directing plenty of funding to help historically at-risk and marginalized communities. But the 100 by ’50 Act debuted to a fizzle and Sanders, its more prominent cosponsor, spends little time discussing it publicly.The only other bill is Merkley’s the Keep It in the Ground Act, which would prohibit new oil and gas leases on federal lands. Though cosponsored by Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren, it receives little attention beyond Merkley’s own press statements.Labor sources have also told me that both of these bills would face problems if Democrats tried to run with them. By design, the “100 by ’50” Act includes no economy-wide mechanism to phase down carbon emissions, like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade market. (Many of the more leftist environmentalist leaders reject these arrangement as failed technocratic policies.)Indeed, most Democrats told me that climate change could only make it to the legislative docket through some other kind of bill. The days of a Waxman-Markey climate-only bill are seen to have passed, but it’s possible that climate could be addressed in a tax or jobs bill.If Republicans succeed in overhauling the U.S. tax code, then Democrats could slide a carbon tax into a progressive rewrite of the system. Aging Reaganite Republicans proposed just such a carbon tax-and-rebate scheme earlier this year. Such a policy would bump up the cost of gas by several dozen cents per gallon, discouraging carbon pollution (in theory)—but it would also send every American family a check for $1,500 four times a year. In the eyes of its supporters, this would reduce carbon emissions while also testing an anti-poverty universal basic income.Democrats could also institute a carbon tax that funds renewable-energy development, as Vox’s Dave Roberts has proposed and as some national polling supports. Some economists worry that such a mechanism would be less politically durable at the national level.Or Democrats could choose another route and pass a “green jobs and infrastructure” law that subsidizes renewable-energy construction across the country. They could underwrite the electrification of steel production and impose an import tariff on Chinese steel. They could also compel renewable companies to respect unionization drives—a feasible goal, since the short-term success of the solar and wind industry depends in large part on Democratic victories.The party could do any of these things. But a glance around the infrastructure of the Democratic establishment reveals that little of this planning work is actually getting done. There is no consensus about whether a carbon tax is a good idea. There is no ideal policy embraced by Democrats in lieu of a carbon price. There is, as far as I could find, no think tank putting a bill together or thinking through legislative language. I could barely find professional Democrats planning how a future offensive on the issue would look.Meanwhile, as Kate Aronoff writes at The Intercept, climate change has come to dominate headlines in the past few months like never before. Three historic hurricanes have wreaked havoc across the United States, leaving the worst blackout in American history (which, at writing, is ongoing). Wildfires have destroyed neighborhoods across the West. And 2017 is almost certain to be the second-hottest year ever measured.Against this background, the Trump administration has waged an assault on environmental policy and science with little precedent in U.S. history. In response to this, the Democrats have admonished Trump, have lamented the downfall of Obama-era policy, and have sworn their allegiance to the Paris Agreement’s goals—but have promised no substantive alternative. Waxman-Markey is dead, and the Clean Power Plan is writhing on the floor. What’s next, Democrats?
551	2	A falcon war in Greenland’s frigid north is a preview of habitat contests to come.NUUK, Greenland—Far up the coast of this ice-dominated island—north of the Arctic Circle; north of the glacier that spawned the Titanic-sinking iceberg; and north of the northernmost American military base—two birds of prey are locked in a vicious battle for food and territory.Kurt Burnham has spent the past decade watching the fight take shape. He studies falcons at the High Arctic Institute, in Orion, Illinois, and he has traveled to Greenland most of the summers of his life.For many of those trips, he helped survey peregrine falcons that use western Greenland as a summer nesting ground. But about a decade ago, he began tracking something new. As climate change tempered the Arctic’s frigid summers, peregrines were expanding their range north—farther north, he found, than there were ever records of them traveling before. Peregrine pairs began returning, summer after summer, to nest on the island’s northernmost cliffs.They were not alone there. Another bird of prey, the gyrfalcon, has nested on the same cliffs for millennia. Though it is specially adapted for high-Arctic life, and larger than the peregrine, this gentler and more conflict-averse bird is not prepared to compete with peregrines. Now, the peregrines regularly attack and overwhelm the gyrs.The fight previews battles to come on a fast-warming planet. Global warming can sometimes sound like a passive phenomenon—as if wild animals just wake up one day to discover that the air is hotter and all their food is gone. But Greenland’s peregrine-gyr war suggests that the upheavals to come will be bloody ones. Climate change is not only triggering a kind of slow ecological impoverishment, but also bringing very real, very fast invasions.Burnham is not optimistic about the contest between peregrines and gyrfalcons. “Over the next 10 to 15 years,” he says, “you’ll probably see one of them go extinct in the area.”* * *There are few greater environmental success stories than that of the peregrine falcon. Once widespread across North America, peregrine populations were devastated by the widespread introduction of the pesticide DDT in the 1950s. The chemical dispersed through the ecosystem and built up in the bodies of apex predators like peregrine falcons and bald eagles. It weakened female peregrines’ ability to create strong egg shells: When they were able to lay eggs at all, they sometimes crushed them under their own weight.Rachel Carson’s 1962 book, Silent Spring, brought mass public attention to the crisis and helped spark the modern environmental movement. The U.S. government banned the chemical in 1972.The quest to save peregrines began around the same time—and Burnham basically grew up inside it. In 1970, Tom Cade, a professor at Cornell University, founded the Peregrine Fund specifically to help conserve the endangered birds. Cade recruited one of his students, William Burnham—Kurt’s father—to accompany him on a trip to Greenland.Burnham stuck around, as did his soon-to-be wife, Pat Burnham. In May 1975, the month that Kurt was born, the first falcons were hatching from the Peregrine Fund’s catch-and-breed program. William Burnham ultimately led the Peregrine Fund and the World Center for Birds of Prey for more than two decades.While the Peregrine Fund worked on catch-and-breed programs in North America, the Burnhams’ trips to Greenland were limited to observation. Kurt or his father returned to western Greenland every year between 1972 and 1999, counting the peregrine and gyrfalcon nests they saw there.They watched a remarkable recovery. When the elder Burnham and his colleagues first visited western Greenland, in 1972, they found eight peregrine nests and considered the local population healthy. (At that time there were zero peregrine nests in the eastern United States.) In 1999, the year that peregrines were removed from the endangered species list, the Burnhams found more than 170 nests across the island.Now, thanks to warmer summers, the bird’s profile in Greenland is changing again. In 2016, Burnham’s team estimated there were at least 11 pairs of peregrines north of the American air base in Thule. One pair lives more than 150 miles north of the base, and only about 800 miles from the North Pole.Burnham has noticed the change while doing fieldwork in the high Arctic, too. “A warm day meant 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the early ’90s. Now a warm day means it’s in the low 60s,” he told me. This extra warmth has extended the breeding window for peregrines, letting them survive in Greenland later in the year.That by itself is crucial. As its name suggests, a peregrine—“one from abroad”—is a migratory bird. Every spring, peregrines fly from their winter nests in the tropics to summer nests in the north. Their range seems to expand on both sides at once. “The further north a bird gets, the further south it goes,” Burnham says.This means that the peregrines north of Thule have incredible, almost incomprehensibly lengthy migrations. Burnham estimated that a peregrine from northern Greenland migrates more than 8,000 miles south, to Costa Rica, Panama, or Venezuela. Meanwhile, a peregrine falcon who summers in Washington, D.C., might only winter in the Caribbean or the Texas Hill Country.Greenland-bound peregrines also wait until later in the year to set out, delaying their northerly flight until late May or early June. By that time, the Texas peregrines haven’t only made it to Washington; they’ve also laid their eggs and hatched their chicks.If peregrines are the nomadic generalists of avian world, then gyrfalcons are the specialists. With a warm feather layer, gyrfalcons have evolved over the last hundred thousand years to thrive in the high Arctic. Some Greenlandic gyrfalcons may spend the entire year north of the Arctic Circle. They may alight on icebergs, riding them into the open ocean for weeks at a time, leaving them only to stretch their wings or hunt for seabirds.Gyrfalcons don’t build their own nests. Instead, they appropriate other birds’ nests in the early spring—moving into a nest built by a raven, for instance, in the previous year. Gyrfalcons will then return to that borrowed nest year after year. Eventually, the original sticks and mud that constituted the nest are entirely obscured by centuries of guano.“You see them three feet wide and three feet thick, with no sticks. The guano is just like concrete,” says Burnham. Recently, researchers cored gyrfalcon nests, reading the layers like tree rings. Some of the nests were more than 2,500 years old. Gyrfalcons are raising their young today in nests that are older than the Roman Empire.Except that the peregrines are starting to evict them. Like gyrs, they also move into nests built by other birds, and, as they explore the north, they are finding gyrfalcon homes quite comfortable indeed. And unlike gyrfalcons—large but gentle creatures who will often just fly away if challenged—peregrines are aggressive, defending not only their new nest but also the hunting ground around it.“It’s an F-16 against a Cessna. In one year, we found a gyrfalcon chick that had just learned to fly, on the ground with a broken wing,” says Burnham. “It was probably a result of a peregrine striking the gyrfalcon nest.”Global warming may be helping peregrines move north right now, but not all of its changes have been positive for the birds. During the summer, it now rains regularly in Thule—the only precipitation used to be dry, frigid snowflakes—and, across Greenland, both snow and rain seem to be clumping into large storm systems. Instead of seeing three months of rain fall over the course of three non-consecutive weeks, an entire season’s worth of rain will now fall in three hours.All that water, all at once, can pool in peregrine nests, chilling or even drowning the chicks. “For small, little baby birds, covered in down, the one thing you don’t want is a bunch of rain. It used to be a lot of dry snow that came down, now it’s rain,” Burnham says.Over time, he thinks these large rainstorms could disturb the bird’s delicate demographics. Peregrines generally lay four eggs in a year, and while all four will usually hatch, one or two chicks will die in the nest. If that chick mortality rate rises over time, it could start to curtail the falcon’s population—and its northward expansion.“No matter how warm it gets, the falcons may not be able to produce enough young to move the population further north,” Burnham told me. Maybe peregrines are just like us: Right now, they’re enjoying all the good parts of global warming. The suffering will come later.
1	3	"nzherald.co.nz graphicNew Zealand will become more vulnerable to floods, storms and fire as a result of global warming and climate change over the next century, an international report released today claims. Scientists told media the outlook for New Zealand was not all ""doom and despondency"" despite the report's bleak forecast. New Zealand Climate Science Coalition spokesman Augie Auer said, that the report was more of the same. The projections had no realism at all, with a computer generating different outcomes based on contrived situations, he said. ""They have no way of determining what will happen."" Mr Auer said he had noticed an attempt to not be as bleak in this report as on previous occasions, with the use of a more optimistic forecasts. Despite this the debate was being led by alarmists, he said. ""Jim Salinger has come out and said in drier places, it will get drier. ""In wetter places, it will get wetter. ""Well that's a real no brainer, isn't it?"" Mr Auer said the science was not settled on the issue and debate was needed. The involvement of the MetService in the latest report was also questionable, he said. Coastal communities  Coastal communities will be the worst hit by climate change in New Zealand, according to the report. Sea levels have already risen by about 70mm since 1950 and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns not enough is being done. Coastal development and population growth in areas such as Northland to Bay of Plenty could increase risks from sea-level rise and greater severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding by 2050, the report said. ""Vigorous"" western swells and increasing westerly winds are predicted. The report added that ""differences in political commitment, lack of strong and clear guidelines from government, and legal challenges by property owners"" were significant constraints to tackling the problem. Other major issues facing New Zealand include risks to water security and natural ecosystems. NIWA's Dr Jim Salinger, today releasing the local conclusions of a worldwide report finalised in Brussels last Friday, said: ""The potential impacts of climate change for New Zealand are likely to be substantial without further adaptation."" However, he said a strong economy and advanced technical and scientific skills left the country well placed to tackle the problem. The report's findings include a claim that, as a result of reduced rainfall and increased evaporation, water supply problems will intensify by 2030 in Northland and some eastern regions. Biodiversity could be hit in alpine areas and the sub Antarctic Islands. Agriculture and forestry production is predicted to decline by 2030 over parts of eastern New Zealand due to increased drought and fire.  But western and southern areas and close to major rivers could see initial benefits due to a longer growing season, less frost, and increased rainfall.  A southward shift in agricultural pests and diseases is likely. Changes since 1950: * Mean temperature 0.4 °C warmer* 10-20 days less cold nights and frosts per year* Sea level rise of about 70mm* Loss of at least a quarter of alpine ice mass - NZHERALD STAFF / NZPA"
354	3	The Obama administration announced new regulations Monday meant to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.What do Americans believe about climate change, and how have those beliefs changed? Our overview follows.First, a majority of Americans say that global warming is indeed happening, and the numbers have held relatively steady since the mid-2000s.Every pollster uses different wording, producing varied results, but the overall pattern is consistent. According to Pew Research Center, 67 percent of Americans say there is “solid evidence that the earth is warming.” Gallup shows that 54 percent say the “effects of global warming have already begun.” In a CBS News poll conducted in May, only 11 percent said global warming did not exist.The number of Americans who believe in global warming has declined slightly since 2008, but there is reason to suspect that decline may soon reverse.Temperature trends, not economic trends, seem to drive changes in opinion.Jon Krosnick of Stanford University and colleagues studied the post-2008 drop in the number of people who think global warming is occurring and concluded it had little to do with two major events of that year: the economic recession or the media coverage of “Climategate” — the release of thousands of emails and documents related to global warming research.Rather, they found that opinion about global warming seemed to fluctuate with temperature changes. Although the beliefs of people who trust natural scientists remain steady over time, climate beliefs among the one-third of Americans who don’t trust natural scientists are influenced by the prior year’s average world temperature.“Following record-high-temperature years, low-trust people are more likely to believe that the world has been warming,” Mr. Krosnick said. “Extreme weather events, however, have not had notable impact on public judgments of the existence or the seriousness of global warming.”There is reason to think that global temperatures, after having been somewhat steady in recent years, are likely to begin rising again, thanks to a buildup of carbon emissions and the arrival of El Niño. If so, belief in global warming may soon rise again, too.Democrats trust scientists much more than Republicans do — and believe more in the existence of warming.Eighty percent of Democrats report having high trust in scientists, compared with 63 percent of independents and 46 percent of Republicans, according to the Stanford poll data. Partly as a result, Democrats’ concern about climate change is far higher than Republicans’ concern. Americans, as a whole, are less concerned about global warming than people in other rich countries largely because of low levels of concern among Republicans.While Americans believe global warming is happening, it’s not one of their top concerns.Other policy issues tend to outrank global warming; in recent years, many Americans have instead named the economy, jobs or the deficit as their top worries. Even among environmental issues, climate change is not Americans’ main concern. When Gallup asked about a number of environmental issues, global warming was last on the list, with worry about drinking water pollution ranking 25 points higher.Although the economy’s ups and downs do not seem to affect beliefs about the existence of global warming, the economy’s condition can affect how seriously people view climate change as a problem. When the economy is weak, as it has been in recent years, many people list other issues as higher priorities.But that’s not to say that Americans aren’t concerned at all.More than half of Americans say that global warming is a very serious problem both for the United States and the rest of the world if nothing is done to reduce it. In 2013, polls found that about 7 in 10 Americans said they had seen the effects of global warming, and 4 in 10 Americans said that their local community had experienced an extreme weather event in the past year.Most Americans say they are ready for their government to act. A majority say the United States government should be doing a great deal or a lot about global warming, while just 1 in 5 say the government should do little or nothing. There is majority support for limits on greenhouse gas emissions and for requiring utilities to produce energy from renewable sources, but less support for providing incentives for nuclear power.Poll questions, however, often struggle to convey the political arguments on both sides of the climate debate — which may mean that climate proposals fare less well in actual political debates than in polls. For instance, a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions — the plan the Obama administration favors to reduce carbon emissions — is notoriously difficult to ask about in polling. Few Americans have heard of the policy, which provides pollsters with the dilemma of asking a question that provides an explanation of the issue or asking a question that has minimal detail, relying on what the respondent can bring to the question.In December, the Stanford/USA Today survey  randomly assigned respondents to one of three different questions on the policy, all of which explained a cap-and-trade system. Support ranged from 48 percent to 70 percent. Yet none of the questions warned that consumer prices may rise — the main argument opponents make against cap-and-trade.A February 2010 poll by Pew took the more minimalist route, and after asking about knowledge of the cap-and-trade bill, found that 52 percent supported setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions and making companies pay for their emissions, even if it meant higher energy prices — but offered no details on how the proposal would work.Americans think that climate change will hurt future generations more than current generations. Nearly a third of Americans say that if nothing is done to reduce global warming, they themselves will be hurt a lot or a great deal, according to the Stanford/USA Today poll. As for future generations, two-thirds say they will be hurt a lot or a great deal.

Credits: NewshubPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has no plans to raise climate change issues with the Australian Prime Minister and doesn't plan to raise human rights issues with Fiji's leader, either.However, Ardern is planning to push harder with Morrison than ever against deportations, spelling out the harm Australian gangs are causing in New Zealand.""In friendships there will sometimes be issues that can be corrosive. Deportation continues to be one of those issues,"" she told Newshub ahead of her overseas trip.Despite going in hot on deportations and gangs, Ardern is completely avoiding the issue that ignited Australia during the bush fires: climate change.Australia dragged out discussions on climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum last year, reluctant to commit to emissions reductions, and sparking backlash from environmentalists. Ardern justified not marking the issue as a discussion point with Morrison, telling Newshub: ""It wasn't that long ago we spent the better part of 12 hours debating and discussing that.""In the wake of the bush fires, Australia is talking about climate change like never before, and it could be the perfect opportunity for Ardern to put up a fight for what she's called her ""nuclear-free moment"".Ardern also said she won't commit to raising human rights concerns with Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama when she meets him this week. Just last year, three New Zealand Newsroom journalists were arrested in Fiji filming a news story.The arrests were described by Newsroom co-editor Tim Murphy as ""overreach"" and ""not how things should work in a democracy and a normal open society"".Ardern said she and her Fijian counterpart ""will be spending some time together and I don't predetermine absolutely everything we discuss"". She said she is ""certain there will be issues like, you know, upcoming elections."""
365	4	The Biden administration has reinstalled the director of the federal climate program that produces the U.S. government’s definitive reports on climate change, after the Trump administration removed him in November.Michael Kuperberg, the climate scientist who ran the program for six years during Democratic and Republican administrations, was reinstated Monday, the White House confirmed.As the executive director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, Kuperberg coordinates climate change research across 13 federal agencies and production of the program’s National Climate Assessment, the nation’s most important report on climate change science and its consequences.“I’m really excited to be back,” Kuperberg said in an interview, calling the timing of his return “perfect,” considering the Biden administration’s emphasis on global warming. “I think [the program] is a critical component for advancing the climate agenda of this administration. We have an opportunity to put that science to work in informing decisions on our response to climate change.”When he was exiled from his post and reassigned to the Energy Department in November, Kuperberg said he was “surprised” but knew it was a possibility, because he served at the discretion of the administration in power, whether Republican or Democratic. “It’s their prerogative to make those kinds of changes,” he said.Now that he’s back, Kuperberg stressed that he considers his job responsibilities nonpartisan. “We’re coordinating science and we’re trying to get to the nation the very best possible science,” he said. “This is not politics.”Jane Lubchenco, who oversees the research program as the lead climate official at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, praised Kuperberg’s ability to work across the political spectrum.“Dr. Kuperberg has earned the trust of the science community and policymakers regardless of party stripes,” Lubchenco said in a news release.In a letter to Kuperberg written Tuesday, Lubchenco called on him and the program “to accelerate action on two fronts — advancing science to increase our knowledge, especially on societally relevant topics, and ensuring that knowledge is understandable, accessible and usable to the key stakeholders.”“We are at a critical juncture,” she wrote. “Smart action, informed by science, is paramount. The role of [the program] has never been more important.”Kuperberg’s ouster in the fall came as the Trump administration promoted scientists who questioned the seriousness of climate change. It was an apparent effort to seize control of the report’s scope and direction, in case President Donald Trump won reelection.Under Kuperberg’s leadership, the research program had released the fourth edition of the climate assessment in 2018, detailing the severe consequences the United States will face if it takes little action to cut emissions and prepare for climate change.The report, produced by federal and independent scientists, angered White House officials because Trump consistently played down the seriousness of the climate threat and the scientific consensus that human activities are playing the dominant role in warming the planet.Trump officials placed David Legates, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appointee from the University of Delaware who cast doubt on mainstream climate science findings, into Kuperberg’s position. Legates was assisted by Ryan Maue, NOAA’s chief scientist, also known for contrarian views on the issue.During their brief tenure leading the research program, Legates and Maue helped produce documents that challenged the validity of key climate science findings. The papers, which were not peer-reviewed and bore the seal of the Executive Office of the President, angered then-White House science adviser Kelvin Droegemeier, who had not approved the effort. Droegemeier relieved the scientists of their duties, and they resigned from the government days later, just before Biden’s inauguration.Kuperberg now faces the challenge of producing the fifth edition of the National Climate Assessment, by the end of 2023, having lost more than six months since his removal. But he said work on the project continued in his absence, and he expressed confidence that it will be completed in time.“We’re not starting from zero,” he said. “It is moving forward. I’m very pleased with that. We’re going to put out a document that we can stand behind and be proud of.”One of Kuperberg’s first actions will be to find a new person to lead the assessment.Betsy Weatherhead, the atmospheric scientist selected by Droegemeier to lead the report, was reassigned by the Biden White House in April to the U.S. Geological Survey. Kuperberg said he’s working with the White House to select Weatherhead’s replacement.Kuperberg said he wants the next report to build from previous efforts.Early editions of the assessment were thick, hard-copy volumes that have since evolved into rich multimedia websites. He sees the fifth edition as a “dynamic resource” with customizable data that reach new audiences. “Everybody from farmers, transportation managers, energy producers and citizens in small and large cities will face challenges from climate change,” he said. “We want to put information in their hands to respond to those challenges.”Former program officials and agency leaders lauded the Biden administration’s decision to bring Kuperberg back.“Mike is a humble leader, respected by his agency peers; you’d be hard-pressed to identify a civil servant more prepared to steward [the program] in this time,” Dave Reidmiller, who led the fourth edition of the climate assessment and is the director of the Climate Center at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, wrote in an email. “He not only has the knowledge of how to get things done through the interagency process, but also a keen understanding of the research needed to underpin aggressive, equitable climate solutions.”
496	4	"At the start of this year, Danish economist and environmentalist Inger Andersen was appointed as the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). DW spoke to her about her new role and the environmental challenges of our time. DW: Where does the organization stand as you take over at the helm of the UNEP?Inger Andersen: At this time it may be more where the planet stands because we are in a planetary crisis. What I need to do is to reflect back to the world that we have the actions in our hands and if we take the right choices and make the right policy shifts, we can actually get to solutions.We need to have a conversation about how ambitious we are going to be on climate, on nature and its protection and on the pollution load we are willing to let into our planet and our terrestrial and marine environments.How do you see the relationship between halting climate change and protecting the environment?We need to focus on investing in what I like to refer to as ""nature's infrastructure."" We need to invest in greenery and we need to invest in forests. There are about one to 1.5 billion hectares of degraded forest land which are not used for anything, so let's invest in that, grow trees. If we were to do that, nature would give us a break of about 12 gigatons of carbon.And when we invest in nature, we also get biodiversity back. When we invest in nature we also ensure that we get better health outcomes. So there are lots of good outcomes from investing in nature.Read more: World must invest $1.8 trillion to take on climate change — reportThat all sounds very good, but we're not doing terribly well right now.We are not. And I guess the issue is that these are difficult choices. It's difficult to make those shifts rapidly, but thinking of it on the bigger global scale, shortly after 2050, there will be nearly 10 billion people on this planet. And today we have about 800 million people going to bed hungry and about 1.3 billion living in extreme poverty.These people have every right  to aspire to what you and I have. But if we all live like you and I, we would need five planets. So the truth of the matter is, we need to have this conversation. The good news is that governments are stepping up. Businesses are stepping up. Our children are in the street demanding this and calling us out as a generation that has failed them on climate action.Do you think we could be at a kind of turning point with movements like Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion and so on?I think we have never seen so much awareness around environmental matters. I think that awareness is something that politicians of any shade or color better pay attention to because these young people may be 16 today but a couple of years from now, they will be voting. So I do think that yes, this is part of a turning point but we need to have the solutions and the solutions are there.There are some important governments in the world whose priorities are not protecting the environment. What can an organization like UNEP do for instance when the government in Brazil opens the rainforest to more logging and development?Tropic forest is absolutely keyto ensuring the stability of the planet's climate. We speak to facts and data and to evidence, and the evidence and the data is very very clear that it is absolutely imperative that we protect the large tropical forests wherever they may be in Africa in the Americas or in Asia.If we take another difficult example, for instance the USA under President Trump. How can you still be optimistic with all of those things going on in the background?You can't be an environmentalist in 2019 and not be an optimist. Because clearly there are challenges but there are also solutions. And what I see is that there is a commitment from American CEOs. There is a commitment from the American populace, from state governments and there is a strong commitment amongst the business community to lean in on climate positive actions.Is there a danger that the speed of climate change and environmental degradation is overtaking our scientific research and the speed with which politicians are taking action?There is absolutely that danger. But we still need the science to keep informing us. The science, yes it evolves and it has to be there to tell us other actions that we need to be mindful of. The earlier scenarios, those we discussed in Copenhagen in 2009 when we agreed on the 2 degrees, we now know that those scenarios are no longer as viable as what the 1.5 degree report tells us.Read more: The global injustice of the climate crisisPollution, and plastic pollution in particular, also poses a threat to the planet. Have we reached a point where we have to find alternatives to our lifestyles?I should hope so. By 2050, we will have about a billion metric tons of plastic in our landfills. We need to make a shift. We're seeing a number of countries introduce bans. Today we have 27 countries in Africa that have banned single-use plastic bags.How do you see the role of Africa as we try to bring about a transition to sustainable societies without limiting the opportunities of countries in the developing world?We all need to understand that Africa's aspiration is no different than those of other countries in earlier times. That means Africa will be wanting to invest, and rightly so, in infrastructure. But why go through a polluting age like my country and yours did. Why not leapfrog right into the green economy? And that's a real opportunity that many African countries are grabbing. Kenya has invested more than one billion dollars in renewables.Poorer countries want wealth, they want growth, they want the opportunity to have what you and I have. But in a smarter way. And the solutions are there because today we have energy options that are cleaner. So there is a chance to hop over a polluting age — if we get it right.The interview was conducucted by Irene Quaile and has been condensed and edited for clarity."
423	3	Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.Robert Redford and his son, director James Redford, discussed how the coronavirus pandemic has shown the world how it can prepare for what they see as the inevitable fight against climate change.As COVID-19 has forced people across the country to go into lockdown in order to help curtail the spread of the virus and relieve some of the pressure on America’s healthcare system, the acclaimed actor and his son penned an op-ed for NBC News in which they look at the silver lining that this unprecedented societal change is highlighting.“As everyone continues to adjust to a changed world, we have been sharing a few questions,” the op-ed reads. “What has the scourge of COVID-19 revealed to us? Will any of these hard-won lessons help us as we turn to face the potential calamity of climate change that looms on the horizon?”They go on to criticize President Donald Trump and his “failed leadership” during the onset of the pandemic, joining the chorus of celebrities who have previously bashed his initial response to the virus as slow.“Some lessons have been bitter. Here in the U.S., we have seen the cost of failed leadership. As the pandemic began its global march, President Donald Trump failed to act quickly and decisively, likely increasing its toll and worsening our pain and suffering,” the duo wrote. “As he has done with climate change, Trump failed early on to embrace or even understand sound scientific consensus about what must be done to protect this nation and its people.”      Robert Redford penned an op-ed with his son about climate change amid the coronavirus pandemic.      (Roy Rochlin/FilmMagic)The op-ed goes on to note that while they feel the federal government has failed the United States, its frontline workers, including medical staff, grocery store workers and warehouse staff, have stepped up. He also thanked the millions of Americans who have willingly sheltered in place to “protect their families and communities.”That’s when they turned their attention to climate change, noting the various “pleasant surprises” that a decrease in things like transportation are having on the environment.“There have also been some pleasant surprises. As many of the world's transportation and industrial sectors have reduced operations, there has been a remarkable decline in global levels of carbon dioxide emissions,” the article reads. “Of course, the cost in life and livelihood negates any celebration. Nonetheless, there is no denying that we have gotten a very real glimpse of the potential for global environmental repair.”They add: “COVID-19 has shown us the power of sound science, true leadership and early action. We must honor this knowledge if we want to avoid what is coming.”The father-and-son team ended their lengthy op-ed with a call to action for the American people to both demand and take action in the fight for climate change by learning from the ongoing pandemic.      Robert Redford penned a short op-ed for NBC News in which he asked people to demand action on climate change.      (Reuters)“As COVID-19 began its lethal march across our nation, most Americans embraced scientific consensus and understood that collective grassroots action could protect us from the worst-case scenarios,” they conclude. “This actionable wisdom should be at the core of our fight against climate change. If we come together to do what we can, we can and will blunt the curve of climate change and create a better world for the many generations to come.”As of Friday morning, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 3,271,961 people across 185 countries and territories, resulting in over 233,704 deaths. In the U.S., all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, tallying over 1,070,032 illnesses and at least 63,019 deaths.

Photo / Mark MitchellAudrey Young is political editor for the New Zealand HeraldIf you get the feeling that debate about climate change policy has been going on for years and years, that's because it has for some.For millennials, it has been a whole lifetime.         The first         report on climate change by a New Zealand government was commissioned in 1988, a year when David Lange was Labour Prime Minister, the first Die Hard movie was in cinemas and All Black Ryan Crotty was born.        It was a 28-page report by the Royal Society of New Zealand titled Climate Change in New Zealand.The most recent big deal event was the Paris Agreement on climate change.Much happened in between those two significant events.Debates have raged within politics about the possible and the necessary. Targets have been set and un-set. Sometimes the big parties have agreed and sometimes they have been hampered by smaller parties.There have been debates about what position to take at international forums and then debates about how New Zealand should meet the commitments made and what part agriculture should play.The debate going in the select committee rooms at present over the Zero Carbon Bill directly relates to the Paris Agreement and how New Zealand will play its part.The Paris Agreement was negotiated in the French winter of 2015 to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the previous global agreement to reduce the emissions of six greenhouse gases.Paris followed the failed climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 which had been attended reluctantly by the Prime Minister at the time, John Key, on the basis that it always looked like it would flop.Paris was an incredible event, according to National leader Simon Bridges, who attended as Associate Climate Change Minister.""These conferences of the parties make you both incredibly cynical and somewhat hopeful that the world is working together on some sort of climate change solution.""He said it was a mixture of high-pressure politics and theatrics (there was a shoe-thumping of a desk a la Nikita Khrushchev) and a carnival-like atmosphere with thousands of people wondering between warehouses on the outskirts of Paris.""You've got stalls from Greenpeace down to the smallest NGOs and the Amazon Rain Forest Protection Society.""It's like any multilateral organisation … it's hugely flawed but no one has come up with a better way to do it.""The Paris Agreement on climate change settled on a target of limiting the rise in temperature this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels but with a higher hope to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.""Paris is generally regarded as a real success,"" said Bridges ""Albeit in truth the hard work is still to come.""Whatever New Zealand's pace on climate change, it has rarely been fast enough for the Green Party, which has long championed the cause of addressing climate change.Climate Change Minister and Green Party co-leader James Shaw has been relatively patient in a consultative process over his bill, setting up New Zealand's long-term target of zero carbon emissions by 2050, other targets for methane,  and a climate change commission to advise on how to get there.But the Greens were by no means the first parliamentary advocates for action on climate change.Sir Geoffrey Palmer was Environment Minister in the Fourth Labour Government, which commissioned that report from the Royal Society.It was the same year the United Nations set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a significant date in the evolution of political responses to climate change.Before getting his teeth into climate change, Palmer had been working on the Ozone Layer Protection Bill to cut emissions of substances that depleted the ozone. Coincidentally, the chloroflurocarbons and halons that were being targeted were greenhouse gases and led Palmer to say in his ""Greenprint for New Zealand"" book at the time that the measures in the ozone bill were ""an important first step towards solving the much more complex problem of global warming"".Those were Sir Geoffrey's optimistic days.""It is a very unfortunate thing that New Zealand hasn't been able to lead on this in the way it should have been able to and I'm very sad about it,"" he told the Herald this week.""The real difficulty with climate change issues is that the political reaction to them has been at all times, I think, insufficient to the size of the problem.""If it was not tackled with international action, there was no hope of dealing with it.""The international action needs to be determined and it needs to be decisive and I am not sure those things will occur.""The economic impact of dealing with climate change are ""quite profound"", Sir Geoffrey said.""Transforming the New Zealand economy is an enormously difficult job and the later you start the harder it is.""His successor as Environment Minister in the government that followed Labour was Simon Upton, now the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, who is making a strong contribution to the climate change debate.Palmer wasn't so happy about the fact that Upton did not maintain Palmer's strategy for dealing with climate change, which was published in August 1990.The Labour government established the aim of a 20 per cent reduction of 1990 carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 as an interim objective. It commissioned a group known as the New Zealand Climate Change Programme to develop a carbon dioxide reduction strategy based on energy management across all sectors.The big international initiative of the 1990s was the Kyoto Protocol, debated in Japan, in which countries negotiated their commitments among others.The big debate of the next decade was whether to introduce a simple tax on carbon or an emissions trading scheme. Labour initially favoured a carbon tax, as did the Greens, but it was not willing to proceed without wider support from United Future and New Zealand First.Labour's Environment Minister David Parker developed the Emissions Trading Scheme with the support of National. But National diluted it soon after gaining power, arguing that the global financial crisis was not a time to be overly restraining business.The Emissions Trading Scheme is designed to use carrots and sticks – financial incentives and disincentives – to change polluting behaviour of big emitters. But critics say the New Zealand scheme does not work properly because the government does not put a sinking cap on emissions.And one of the big debates right now, as it has been for almost 20 years, is the role agriculture should play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both within the stated targets in the Zero Carbon Bill and within the Emissions Trading Scheme.Some of the questions look set to be resolved in the bill in the next few months.But in an area in which policy has been more accustomed to lurching than developing, any resolution may not necessarily be permanent.• 1988 UN establishes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – New Zealand Labour Govt starts developing policy for climate change co-ordinated by Ministry for the Environment.

856	4	"Scientists have for decades warned that climate change will make extreme weather events, including heavy rain and deadly flooding, more likely.Around 100 of those killed after torrential rainfall since Wednesday were in Germany's western states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, where local leaders are urging the world for swifter action on climate change as villages under their watch become a new and unexpected epicenter of global warming. Neighboring Belgium has also been hit hard by the floods, which have killed 20 people in the country and could rise further, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden said Friday at a press conference.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday that flooding in northwestern Europe was evidence of the need for urgency in acting on climate change.""Science tells us that with climate change, we see more and more extreme weather phenomenons that last longer,"" said von der Leyen, two days after unveiling an ambitious package of climate change proposals for the EU.""It is the intensity and the length of these events when science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency to act.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday met with US President Joe Biden in Washington, DC, where she welcomed America's return to the Paris agreement on climate change, saying it would strengthen this year's annual climate talks -- known as the Conference of the Parties -- in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. ""We talked about the challenges of climate change, and I'm very, very glad that the United States have returned to the Paris Accord, and that this gives us a very different basis in Glasgow to fight for more climate protection at the Conference of the Parties,"" she said. ""I think the meteorological events -- whether it's fires hitting the United States, dramatically high temperatures, or just sudden irregular rainfalls -- indicate that the number of extraordinarily weather events has increased dramatically in recent years. We need to respond to that.""Her comments echoed those of her environment minister, Svenja Schulze, who tweeted Thursday: ""Climate change has arrived in Germany.""The events show with what force the consequences of climate change can affect us all, and how important it is for us to adjust to extreme weather events in the future.""There is growing acknowledgement and acceptance now from many politicians that anthropogenic -- or human-induced -- climate change plays a role in extreme weather events.Biden, for example, recently linked the extreme heat and prolonged drought in the US to climate change.Scientists are now able to estimate just how big a role climate change has played in a particular event. It's too soon to make conclusions about current flooding in Europe, but estimates are likely to be made in coming days.A similar, though less extreme, flooding event in Western Europe in 2016 that killed 18 people in Germany, France, Romania and Belgium, for example, was found to be 80-90% more likely to occur than it was in the past before anthropogenic climate change.While officials at the national and EU level are sounding the horn on climate, so too are local leaders on the disasters' front lines.The premier of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany -- Armin Laschet, who is also the Conservatives' candidate to succeed Merkel -- said the floods in his state were ""a catastrophe of historic proportion,"" calling on the world to speed up its efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.""The floods have literally pulled the rug from under people's feet,"" Laschet said.""We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures, on European, federal and global levels, because climate change isn't confined to one state,"" he said.What's causing this heavy rainfall?As the Earth's atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which in some cases leads to unprecedented rainfall. It may be that the total average rainfall in an area doesn't change, but extremes are amplified, which can mean longer dry periods or more intense storms.Flash flooding occurs when rain falls faster than the ground can absorb it. It is ""flash"" because its onset is rapid -- water levels can rise meters in minutes. When there is more water vapor in a warmer atmosphere, rainfall rates can increase and flash flooding is more likely to occur.And drought can actually compound this effect. Very dry soil can't absorb water efficiently -- think of trying to wet a very dry sponge. While the rain is ultimately beneficial, if a region that has been experiencing intense drought gets hit with heavy rain, flash flooding is more likely to occur.That's the dynamic in Germany and Belgium at the moment. Just a few months ago, there were historically low water levels on the Rhine in Cologne, which were disrupting shipping along the river, but now the river has swelled from two months of rain falling in just one day.The projections for how much the Earth would warm have largely been correct, said Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. But there have been outliers -- namely, the warming in Europe has been faster than predicted.Allen said scientists expected more extreme weather events, but records are being blown away at a concerning clip -- the unprecedented heat wave in the Northwest US in late June is another recent example.""Extreme events happen and records get broken all the time,"" Allen said, ""but it is worrying that we're seeing such rapid intensification.""With more action, he said, climate change could be addressed in a generation. Deadly flooding and heatwaves serve as a reminder of the climate crisis' reach. ""A problem is that every climate documentary starts with an image of a polar bear, which send the message that climate change happens in the Arctic, on the other side of the world,"" Allen said. ""But these events show that's not true."""
567	4	"Wildfires like that which blazed through Canterbury's Port Hills in 2017 are predicted to become more frequent in a New Zealand warmed by climate change. Photo / Alan Gibson.Science Reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand is expected to declare a climate change emergency tomorrow. What does that mean exactly? Science reporter Jamie Morton explains.We can generally think of it as a symbolic acknowledgement at the highest levels that we're facing a climate change crisis - and a commitment to meet the challenge.Climate Change Minister James Shaw described the motion, expected to pass with flying colours when it's tabled in Parliament tomorrow, as a ""clear statement"" of intent to tackle the crisis.He said the Government would develop policy over the next three years to ensure it's backed with action to bring emissions down.New Zealand wouldn't be the first country to make the gesture.As of this year, 28 countries - including the UK, Ireland, Canada, France, Austria, Spain, Japan and South Korea - had done so, as has the state of South Australia, and more than 1400 local governments.Nelson City Council declared an emergency in May last year, followed by Wellington and Auckland councils a month later.But a declaration didn't commit a body to any binding set of actions and in Auckland Council's case, it hadn't come with any new specific plan or code.As it stood, climate change wasn't included in the formal definition of an ""emergency"" under the Civil Defence and Emergency Management Act 2002.A declaration also had no other inherent statutory or legal implications - it merely signalled the council's intention to put climate change at the centre of work programmes and decision making.Dr Raven Cretney, a Waikato University researcher who's been studying declarations with Lincoln University colleague Dr Sylvia Nissen, described those made here as largely symbolic.""While this is not a bad thing in and of itself, I have some concerns around the use of emergency language as potentially nurturing an approach to climate action that is built on fear and panic.""However, she said it was also important to recognise the emergency declaration campaigns have been supported by groups such as School Strike 4 Climate.""So this announcement may, for some, represent the power that social movements, and young people especially, can have in shaping political change in Aotearoa.""Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Labour had always considered climate change to be ""a huge threat to our region"".""[It's] something we must take immediate action on.""She said the previous Government was unable to declare a climate emergency in the last term, but was now able to.As more than 11,000 international scientists put it last year, the planet ""clearly and unequivocally"" faces a climate emergency.Despite 40 years of global negotiations, the world had largely failed to arrest the crisis - and they called for ""bold and drastic"" changes in economic growth and population policies to cut emissions.A recent, sweeping Government report set out how New Zealand's own climate was already transforming.New Zealand's national average temperature has risen by 0.10C per decade since 1909 - but that rate has quickened to 0.31C per decade in the last 30 years.Places around the country have been seeing more heatwave days, fewer frosts, shifts in rainfall and higher seas, with implications for everything from human health to more pressure on our threatened species.Within just 20 years, days with very high or extreme fire danger are projected to increase by an average of 70 per cent, due to hotter, drier and windier conditions.If global emissions continue to increase, by 2090, warm days – where the maximum temperature is 25C or higher – are projected to occur four times as often in Auckland.Even if emissions are reduced to limit global warming below 2C, these days would still increase by just over half.Extreme weather will become more common, as will devastating droughts and flooding events.New Zealand might contribute just 0.17 per cent to global emissions - but that contribution is embarrassingly out-sized.Our net emissions have shot up by nearly 60 per cent in just two decades - and three years ago, the 7.7 tonnes of CO2 that each Kiwi pumped into the atmosphere put our country at 17th out of 32 OECD countries for emissions.Our largest source of CO2 emissions come from road transport - utes and SUVs particularly use more fuel - and we effectively import emissions when we use goods and services from overseas.But most of New Zealand's greenhouse gases still stem from agriculture. Methane - mainly burped from livestock - made up nearly half of our gross emissions in 2018.Globally, emissions are expected to keep rising.At the current rate, the global average temperature is likely to cross the threshold of 1.5C above the pre-industrial level within the next 10 to 30 years.And a rise of 3C by the end of this century is projected, even if all the current emissions reduction commitments and goals are met by the international community.Deep cuts to net emissions would be needed to hold warming to 1.5C - about 45 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030, and net zero by about 2050.It halted new offshore oil and gas exploration permits, overhauled the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and placed a cap on it to make it a more effective carbon price tool, and invested in alternative energy efforts - namely green hydrogen.Last month, it launched a new $70m fund to help Kiwi companies switch from coal and gas to clean energy for process heat.It's set up an advisory Climate Change Commission, and can boast about finally putting in place binding, climate-targeted legislation.Yet the Zero Carbon Act's net-zero 2050 target doesn't apply to biogenic methane, which makes up a third of our gross emissions, and instead needs to come down by between 24 and 47 per cent by mid-century.But while Ardern has hailed climate change as this generation's ""nuclear free moment"", environment groups have been widely critical of falling short on meaningful action.That included failing to bring in repeatedly recommended ""feebate"" schemes - although its Clean Car Standard would achieve some of the same impact when it arrives in 2025 - and there's no sign of any future ban on fossil fuel vehicles more generally.Along with walking away from a previous pledge to electrify the government fleet by 2025, the Government has drawn scorn in opting against bringing agriculture - our biggest emitting sector - into the ETS, in favour of an industry-government partnership.And if agriculture is eventually forced into the ETS, that won't happen until 2025, when it would receive the same 95 per cent discount deal ""carbon-intensive"" industries like steel have been given.It already looks unlikely New Zealand's climate pledges under the Paris Agreement will be strong enough to meet the UN's aspiration to limiting warming below 1.5C.Cretney hoped it would prove more than just that.""If the emergency declaration remains a symbolic gesture, as we have seen elsewhere in the world, then I think it will be important that our communities continue to hold the Government to account for their pledge to take real action on the climate crisis.""Dr David Hall, a lecturer at AUT University's School of Social Sciences and Public Policy, pointed out that when a council or government made a declaration, it wasn't suspending laws to make a decision it otherwise wasn't able to.""On the contrary, the New Zealand government, after declaring a climate emergency, will face the same political constraints that it did prior to the declaration,"" he said.""So there isn't likely to be any clear link to action, except indirectly through that greater prioritisation of the issue.""As it stood, Hall argued New Zealand was already gaining momentum on climate action, even without a declaration.""Indeed, we already had a taste of emergency-style politics with the surprise suspension of offshore oil and gas permits in early 2018, before climate emergencies became a thing.""While that move sent a strong signal to the energy sector, it also burned a lot of political capital, in a way he said wasn't typical of Ardern's style.""So it isn't easy to see this style of climate politics becoming the norm, even after a climate emergency declaration - not unless the Government's hand is really being forced by extreme events like energy shocks or climate-related catastrophes,"" he said.""Urgent action is required, but the fastest transition will be the one that buoys people along, rather than makes them dig in their heels.""Kiwi climate campaigner David Tong, of Oil Change International, nonetheless saw tomorrow as a unique opportunity.""For this week's declaration to be meaningful, policymakers across government will need to use it to justify rapid, transformative action and New Zealanders will need to use it to push the government to take real action now.""While New Zealand's response to the Covid-19 emergency had been extraordinary, our response to the climate emergency had often lagged behind even the insufficient actions of countries like the UK, he said.The UK's Parliament also declared a climate emergency in May 2019 - and then one month later approved a 2050 target of net zero emissions.""Critically, both the UK's 2050 and 2030 targets are more ambitious than ours – but, like ours, both fall drastically short of the transformative actions needed to meet our countries' fair share of limiting warming to below 1.5C.""Ultimately, Tong felt that while our government had incrementally built up a strong legislative and policy architecture for climate mitigation and adaptation, it had done too little to actually cut emissions urgently.""Treating the climate crisis like the emergency it is requires transformative, urgent action,"" he said.""Putting a cap back on the emissions trading scheme is critical, but that's undercut by plans even now to give polluters free allocations until 2050 and beyond."""
583	2	An arrow-shooting drone has been created by researchers that can be used to monitor climate change in forests and jungles, and warn of impending fires.  Specialists from Imperial College London installed dart-mounted sensors on the bespoke drones with sensors to measure changes in the environment. Sensors for forest monitoring are already used to track changes in temperature, humidity and light, as well as the movements of animals and insects through their habitat, but some areas are inaccessible to scientists working on foot. The new drones can fire darts into trees several metres away even in cluttered environments - placing them on tree branches or by puncturing the tree trunk. Specialists from Imperial College London installed dart-mounted sensors on the bespoke drones with sensors to measure changes in the environmentThe new drones can fire the sensors on a dart, place them on a branch or even drop them in the ground to ensure as wide of a spread as possible in areas humans find it hard to accessScientists have been placing sensors in forest and jungle environments for a range of purposes, including to monitor and even detect forest fires, provide data on climate change and to track animal movements. However, placing these sensors can prove difficult in large, tall forests, and climbing trees to place them poses its own risks - the the scientist and the tree.The new drones are able to get over this problem by flying into a cluttered area and shooting the sensor, attached to a dart, at the target tree. The researchers hope the drones will be used in future to create networks of sensors to boost data on forest ecosystems, and to track hard-to-navigate biomes like the Amazon rainforest.Lead researcher Professor Mirko Kovac said drones could deploy whole networks of sensors to boost the amount and precision of ecological data available. 'I like to think of them as artificial forest inhabitants who will soon watch over the ecosystem and provide the data we need to protect the environment.'The drones are equipped with cameras to identify targets, and a smart material that changes shape when heated to launch the darts, which then stick to the trees. The new flying devices can also perch on tree branches like birds to collect data themselves, acting as mobile sensors.Researchers tested their drones at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) and on trees at Imperial's Silwood Park Campus.The drones are currently controlled by people: using control units, the researchers watch through the camera lens to select target trees and shoot the darts. The drone is fitted with cameras that can be used to guide it towards a target, it is then able to fire the drones into a tree even in very dense forest environments with minimal movementThe first generation of the drones require a human pilot, but developers hope next generation versions will be autonomous, opening up very inaccessible parts of rainforests and junglesThe next step is to make the drones autonomous, so that researchers can test how they fare in denser forest environments without human guidance.  Co-author André Farhina, of the Department of Aeronautics, said there are plenty of challenges to be addressed before the drones can be used regularly in forests.That includes 'achieving a careful balance between human input and automated tasks so that they can be used safely while remaining adaptable to unpredictable environments,' Farhina added.Co-author Dr Salua Hamaza, also of the Department of Aeronautics, said they are working on new design and control strategies to allow drones to better operate.'Exploiting smart mechanisms and new sensing techniques we can off-load the on-board computation, and create platforms that are energy-efficient and better performing,' Hamaza explained.
373	3	"A team of more than 100 scientists from 36 countries are raising a red flag on the world’s oceans. The group has authored a report on the risks and threats associated with rising levels and temperatures of Earth’s oceans.The heat was on last month.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday the global average land and ocean surface temperature in May was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit (0.95 degrees Celsius) above the average monthly temperatures for the 20th century, tying with May 2016 as the hottest May on record.""May 2020 was characterized by warmer-than-average temperatures across much of the globe,""  scientists at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information noted in their report.Last month the global average temperature was 60.3 degrees, according to NOAA.In 141 years of record-keeping, researchers at NOAA noted that the 10 warmest Mays have all occurred since 1998.

(NOAA)""However, the 2014-2020 Mays are the seven warmest in the 141-year record,"" researchers noted.The temperature on land set a heat record, while ocean temperatures ranked second.Warmer-than-average temperatures were reported across much of the globe.Parts of Africa, Asia, Western Europe, South and Central America all had record warmth in May.The only places that saw a notable cool temperature departure from average last month were much of Canada, the eastern U.S., eastern Europe, and Australia.Researchers also noted that this past spring was the second hottest on record behind 2016. The Southern Hemisphere had its third-warmest autumn on record.This year so far is also the second hottest five-month start of a year on record, after 2016.“We continue to warm on the long term and in any given month we're likely to be knocking on the door, close to a record in the era that we're in,” NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt told The Associated Press.Arndt said it's highly likely that 2020 will be one of the two hottest years since 1880.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
492	5	"Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions in the UK is achievable with current technology, according to a new report.The Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) said a net zero-carbon Britain is already possible, without relying on future developments.The Powys-based charity said changes to buildings, transport and industry could help slash UK energy demand by 60%. ""We have the technology to combat climate change and we can start today,"" said project coordinator Paul Allen.The CAT report - Zero Carbon Britain: Rising to the Climate Emergency - also claims making further changes to energy, diets and land use could help provide 100% renewable energy and cut emissions from agriculture and industry.That would mean the UK would not be reliant on ""as yet unproven"" technologies, such as carbon or air capture, said Machynlleth-based CAT.Mr Allen said using alternatives to technology that is ready to be rolled out at scale was ""not worth the risk"".However, the UK government described carbon capture as a ""game-changing technology"" in addressing climate change and said the country's first project should be operational next year.Britain was the first major nation to propose cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero, promising to do so by 2050.Reducing energy useCAT said more new houses should be built to high Passivhaus standards that can reduce energy costs to just Â£15 a year by using insulated masonry and concrete, triple-glazing, LED lighting and air-source heat pumps.Some of these changes could also be fitted to existing buildings to improve temperature control and potentially reduce heating use by around 50%.Transport energy demand could also be cut by 78% by increased use of public transport, walking, cycling and using electric vehicles while cutting flights by two-thirds.Increasing energy suppliesBased on the past decade's weather and energy use, it is possible to fully match the UK's entire energy demand with renewable and carbon-neutral energy, the report claims, if CAT's recommendations are carried out.Half of that would be provided by wind while other sources suited to the UK climate - including geothermal, hydro, tidal and solar - would produce most of the rest.Carbon-neutral synthetic fuels are also an important alternative to electricity, especially in some areas of industry and transport.Transforming land and dietsSwitching from meat and dairy to plant-based proteins, reducing food waste and improving agriculture could go a long way to cutting carbon emissions, the report said.CAT says the UK can:""We can still have coffee, chocolate and tea in a zero-carbon Britain, but the UK currently imports many foods that we can easily grow here,"" said Mr Allen.""By changing what we eat and how it's grown, and by wasting less food, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase resilience and improve health and wellbeing.""CAT is urging politicians to come up with action plans with policy frameworks and large-scale investment as a matter of urgency.Recent polling said the environment was one of the top priorities for voters at this year's general election.As well as the 2050 pledge, the Conservatives announced a halt to fracking, the controversial process of extracting gas from shale rock. Labour derided the halt as a pause rather than a total ban.Labour followed that with a warm homes plan to insulate the country's nearly 27 million households and help with solar panels and heat pumps. The Tories dismissed the scheme's Â£250bn bill as unaffordable and unrealistic.The Liberal Democrats have pledged a Â£100bn climate fund over five years to be funded through borrowing and tax changes.The Green Party has gone further, promising Â£100bn, every year to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030."
57	4	Areas of the country Trump won by large margins are particularly vulnerable to the environmental devastation wrought by climate change.On the heels of President-elect Donald Trump’s meeting this Monday with environmentalist and former vice president Al Gore, 97 percent of the world’s scientists might have breathed (just a little) easier. Here was a signal—however tentative—that the incoming president was at least interested in hearing the views of those who consider climate change to be a looming threat, and who would prefer the United States do something about it. The meeting, as my colleague Robinson Meyer writes, was arranged by the first daughter, Ivanka Trump. Presumably, it is part of a reported effort to make climate change “one of her signature issues” in a bid to win over “liberals disgusted and depressed with the tone and tenor of the new leader of the free world.”It is worth noting that not only liberals are concerned with climate change: According to Gallup, 40 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of independents are “worried a great or fair deal” about it, an increase of nine points since the question was asked last year. And then there’s the rest of the world, where not only is the existence of climate change broadly agreed upon, but is seen as a something that must be combatted—which is why nearly the entire planet signed on to the Paris climate-change accords earlier this year. To be clear: Ivanka Trump’s potential “outreach” on the subject would be as much international diplomacy as it would be an olive branch to distressed Democrats and concerned Republicans.But other indicators relating to the incoming administration do not bode as well for those who care about the warming of the earth’s surface: Myron Ebell, a prominent climate-change denier, continues to head the Trump transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. And The New York Times yesterday reported that:Among Mr. Trump’s current top candidates for E.P.A. administrator are Jeffrey Holmstead, a lead lawyer representing states and fossil fuel companies suing to overturn Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations; Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, who has been a key architect of that legal fight; and Kathleen Hartnett White, the director of a Texas think tank who served as a top environmental official under the former Texas governors Rick Perry and George W. Bush. Ms. White has denounced “global warming alarmism” and called last year’s international Paris Agreement on climate change a “tragedy.”The environmental picture remains equally grim over at the Interior Department, where the incoming president is considering appointing Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, a strong critic of the clean power regulations set in place by the Obama administration, and a forceful advocate for oil and gas. Remember, this is the governor who responded to a question about climate change—and whether it was to blame for a prolonged and historic drought that was crippling her state—in 2013:It's just nature itself and the patterns that flow and so we're going to continue to pray for rain in the state of Oklahoma and hope we that we get some relief.At this point, no one can know where the Trump White House will land on a number  of environmental concerns, but what we do know is this: The men and women who are likely to feel the most catastrophic effects of a warming planet are not West Coast Gore acolytes or compost-obsessed Northeastern liberals. The people on the front lines of climate change in the America are Trump voters: residents of the deep-red states in the Southeastern United States.Last year, an initiative called Risky Business, put together by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and the philanthropist Tom Steyer, released a report detailing the catastrophic effects of a changing climate on various regions of the United States. The Southeast—precisely the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia—is, according to Kate Gordon, editor of that report, “the most vulnerable.” Gordon explained that, “the global South starts to encroach in the U.S. through the Southeast.”Excepting Virginia (which Clinton won), these are also states where Trump claimed victory, mostly by very large margins. In Alabama and Arkansas, states Trump won by nearly 30 points each, temperatures are expected to soar in the coming years, thanks to climate changes as the result of increased greenhouse-gas emissions. Since 1980, the typical Alabaman has experienced an average of 12 days per year of temperatures above 95 degrees, while the typical Arkansan has had 19 days of it. According to the report, by 2050, there may be as many as 75 days of 95-plus degree heat. In Arkansas, over the same time frame, there may be as many as 82 days of scorching heat—a nearly three-month long heat wave.The same goes for Mississippi, where Trump won by nearly 18 points and where, on average, residents experience of 13 days per year of 95-plus degree heat. The state is on track to reach up to 85 days of those temperatures by 2050.The effects of this heat are not simply discomfort, according to the report. In Texas, where Trump won by over 9 points and where the typical year sees an average of 43 days above 95 degrees, by 2040-2058, that number is likely to reach up to 106 days per year. In tandem with this, heat-related deaths are likely to increase by more than 4,500 in the same frame, the report projects.In a state like Florida, which Trump won narrowly, nearly one-fifth of the population is over the age of 64. With the largest share of elderly residents in the country, the effects of extreme and prolonged heat in Florida could be devastating: By mid-century, Florida is projected to have as many as 5,080 additional annual deaths, of which 90 percent are expected to affect people over age 64.Prolonged high temperatures will take a toll on the state’s energy grids, which will be taxed with over-consumption, necessitated by over-reliance on air conditioning—and state energy costs are expected to rise by billions of dollars, come mid-century. Worker productivity will also decline. Remember, Gordon told me, these are states where “it gets really hot and humid, so you have heat stroke issues.”State economies will equally be under pressure: Increased temperatures would have potentially devastating effects on the agriculture industries. Currently, Tennessee (which Trump won by nearly 25 points) has more than 79,000 farms, which cover more than 40 percent of the state’s land area. Among the crops grown in the state are corn and soybeans, both of which, Gordon said, “are very vulnerable” to climate change.  Without significant agricultural adaptation, Tennessee’s soybean yields will drop by as much as 31 percent by mid-century; corn yields may plummet by as much as 47 percent.In Alabama, where soybeans were the state’s second most valuable crop, absent significant agricultural adaptation, soybean yields will likely decrease by as much as 44 percent by midcentury. In Arkansas, corn yields will likely decrease by up to 59 percent in the following 20 years, so long as nothing is done to adapt the industry.Georgia, which Trump won by 5 points, is the country’s largest producer of broiler chickens. (Alabama is second and Arkansas is third.) According to the report:Because poultry flocks can only tolerate narrow temperature ranges, higher temperatures can disrupt performance, production, and fertility, limiting a bird’s ability to produce meat or eggs. Higher temperatures can also increase animal mortality. In addition, climate change can affect the price and availability of water, feed grains and pasture, and change patterns of animal diseases. And because energy costs comprise more than 50% of growers’ cash expenses, higher energy costs due to climate change have the potential to put additional pressure on this sector.Some crops that are grown in the region, like wheat, may have increased yields due to increased carbon levels in the atmosphere, but Gordon cautioned, “the report wasn’t exhaustive [in its breakdown]. Heat and humidity bring new insect species and things like mold”—both of which can have devastating effects on crops and livestock.And then there is the issue of the coast. The southeast, Gordon told me, “has the worst sea level rise in the U.S.”That is due to a number of factors, she explained, including, “the way land is at bottom the of ocean, geological formations, and Arctic versus Antarctic melt.”Whatever the reason, this part of the country is on track to lose considerable (and valuable) coastal real estate with rising seas. In North Carolina, where Trump beat Clinton by almost 3 points, according to the report:By 2030, up to $4.4 billion in coastal property is likely to be flooded at high tide. By 2050, the value of property below the mean high water mark will likely increase to up to $5.6 billion.In South Carolina, where Trump won by over 4 points, the projection is almost identical: By mid-century, an additional $5.7 billion of South Carolina property is expected to be below the mean high-water mark.Louisiana, which Trump won by 20 points, faces the highest rate of sea level rise in the United States. If the country continues on its current emissions path, the mean sea level at Grand Isle, Louisiana, is likely to rise 1.9 to 2.4 feet by 2050—and 4.1 to 5.8 feet by the end of the century. Mean sea-level impacts are similarly dire: By 2050, $44.8 billion worth of Louisiana property could be below mean sea level.But nowhere is this picture more grim than in Florida: According to projections, by 2050, about $152 billion worth of property in the state will be below local high-tide levels.Water problems caused by a changing climate will be particularly unkind to this section of the country: Storm surge and nuisance flooding will increase. Subsequent flooding of the Mississippi River will slow transportation of goods, complicating supply chains. And droughts elsewhere are projected to wreak havoc on the water-intensive oil and gas industries.Some of the most immediate projections included in the report will come to pass no matter who is in the White House and what their climate agenda happens to be, according to Gordon. “The heat and sea level rise impact—that’s baked into next 10-20 years. That’s the result of emissions we put in the atmosphere,” she said.“But 2040 and 2050 we could actually affect.”The coming years, “are critical for mitigation in the next 30 years. And frankly, for adapting—which you cannot ignore.”To some degree, the president-elect can trust that states will continue to combat climate change on their own (as California has done), regardless of what his environmental agencies unwind or reverse in terms of environmental regulation. But state action and industry reform are not a substitute for a national policy (nor international policy). And having an administration that acknowledges the reality of climate change—and the significant threat it poses—will be imperative in the medium and long term.“We have to accept—and we have to have as a fundamental narrative in this country—that climate change is a serious economic and security risk and needs to be addressed,” said Gordon. “We need to be global and local in addressing this issue.”Trump thus far has shown haphazard allegiance to the voters who swept him into office: He appears intent to follow through on his populist promise to prevent companies from moving American jobs overseas, but he aims to fill his cabinet with billionaires whose track records display little concern for the same working class voters whose fortunes most depend on Trump’s commitment to populism.Despite the fact that a significant part of his voting base, the Southeast United States, lies at the frontline of the climate battle, this region’s residents have not been vocal about the peril they face—indeed, its state leaders have been downright skeptical about the very existence of the threat. Without a sizable and voluble coalition of his own supporters engaged on the issue, it is hard to imagine this particular president caring much at all. Even if that wasn’t the case, its unclear how beholden Trump might feel to them in the long-term.Perhaps the best hope for the millions of Americans—and billions of people around the world—concerned about the threat of climate change is that Trump’s preoccupation with the fizzy high of positive press, coupled with his daughter’s apparent desire to find common ground with Democrats, will result in something other than climate denialism and the unwinding of critically-important regulatory reform. As it concerns the environment, the country has little idea of  where it is headed in the short-term—even if there is broad consensus as to where it may end up in the long-term.
436	4	"Extreme events linked to climate change, such as the heatwave in Europe this year, are occurring sooner than expected, an ex-chief scientist says.Prof Sir David King says he's been scared by the number of extreme events, and he called for the UK to advance its climate targets by 10 years.But the UN's weather chief said using words like âscaredâ could make young people depressed and anxious.Campaigners argue that people won't act unless they feel fearful.Speaking to the BBC, Prof King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: âItâs appropriate to be scared. We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didnât foresee these sorts of extreme events weâre getting so soon.âHe said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014.He referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role.Several other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language.The physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: âDavid King is right to be scared â Iâm scared too."" âWe do the analysis, we think whatâs going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way. ""Then we have a human response to thatâ¦ and it is scary.âPetteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world.Itâs the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public. Dr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but heâs concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis â and also to mental health problems amongst the young. âWe are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit"", he said.âBut I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much. âWhen I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought itâs better not to have children. âIâm feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.âHe said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range.The polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment.He also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: ""I  would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice.""It seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.The Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath are counselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiety. However, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.We tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014. The consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature.But the models hadnât been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this yearâs extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian â described by Nasa as âextraordinaryâ and âa nightmare scenarioâ.Others mentioned severe ice melting at the poles; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years; record wildfires in the Arctic and an unprecedented two large cyclones in Mozambique in one year. Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us heâd been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive.âI have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,â he said. Few of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time.Theyâre alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change. Prof King argues that some changes were not well forecast.The loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in GreenlandThen thereâs this yearâs French heatwave.Dr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change.She told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years. In a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon. In other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating. âWith European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,â she said. ""It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude."" Researchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said. With some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change. And it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change. Prof King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. âScientists like to be certain,â he said. âBut these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? Iâm going to say âvery highâ.âI canât say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.â      He continued: âIf you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared. âBut we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.â Pierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly.Prof King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040.Some of the IPCC scientists we contacted didnât share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level. Others agreed with him.Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: ""Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections.  âIn my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections.âWhat is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.â "
210	4	"The Climate Change Commission – the expert panel tasked with getting New Zealand carbon neutral – has written to the government asking it to apply a ""climate change lens"" to the post-Covid-19 spend-up.  In a letter to Climate Change Minister James Shaw, the commission warned that locking New Zealand into a high-emissions future ""will only compound today's crisis with a future one"". ""An economic stimulus package can either speed up or stall our progress on climate change,"" said the letter.  The commission is worried about boosting emissions, but also concerned that the wrong investments will make people and costly infrastructure more exposed to damage from climate change. READ MORE: * Wellington's traffic pollution drops * Reducing emissions starts at home * Countries ranked on climate action * The Forever Project: full coverage The letter was copied to Finance Minister Grant Robertson and several other ministers as well as Shaw. While it was too soon to supply a list of climate-friendly projects, it said, the government should follow certain principles. These included saving on future spending by accelerating climate change investments that need to happen anyway, and investing in educating and retraining workers so they're ready for jobs in a low-emissions economy. One of the commission's specific concerns was that Covid-19 would derail reform of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). That should not be allowed to happen, the letter, signed by commission chair Rod Carr, told Shaw and the others. The ETS is supposed to lower emissions by putting a price on greenhouse gases, however low prices, free allocations and exemptions have hampered its impact.  Even assuming the scheme is strengthened, Carr previously said he believes pricing carbon will only be ""a wee piece"" of the climate solution, at least in the next five to 10 years.  The United Kingdom has successfully lowered its emissions by using carbon budgets designed by a climate commission – a set-up similar to New Zealand's. Yet in Britain, ""they think pricing carbon emissions might have accounted for 10 per cent of their reduction,"" said Carr. In New Zealand: ""If you look at the Ministry for the Environment's work, even at $50 per New Zealand Unit [twice the current emissions price] the lowest decile households' weekly spending would change by $2.40 per week and the highest decile by between $3 and $4, so the price impact at the household level is pretty modest,"" he said. ""If you then factor in that only half of our emissions are in the ETS anyway, and then you think about the free allocations, you've got some pretty muted price signals,"" he said. ""As a consequence you can't assume the ETS is going to do a lot of the heavy lifting here."" The ETS currently excludes agriculture, which produces roughly half the country's emissions, and allows industrial emitters substantial free credits. Carr said the ETS remained an important policy despite its light touch. ""Let's not undermine the ETS. We do believe pricing can play a part. The question for us (at the commission) is, what do we assume that part will be, particularly in the first two (emissions) budgets?"" In recent weeks, a variety of environmental groups and professional bodies, such as Lawyers for Climate Change Action, have called on the government not to repeat mistakes made in 2008. Then, governments' responses to the global financial crisis derailed climate change action and weakened the ETS in the name of strengthening a weak economy.  The Climate Change Commission is inviting public participation as it works on its first draft carbon budget, due in February. Once the budget is out, the government will decide whether to adopt it. The commission will report each year on how well the country is tracking. Carr said work on the budget had to press on, despite it being harder than usual to model how people would act in the future. Petrol prices have fallen, and spending is down, and the length of those impacts isn't yet clear. ""We can't stop the clock on climate change just because it's become a little harder,"" he said. ""We know we have to reduce emissions, we know have to reduce them quite a lot and we know we need to get on and do it now."" ""As a relative newcomer to working in climate, one thing that's been slightly surprising to me how much is already underway across New Zealand,"" he said. ""It's not like everyone's waiting for the Climate Change Commission to cast its spell."""
574	4	President Joe Biden on Friday said he was heartened by Russian President Vladimir Putin's call for collaborative efforts on removal of carbon dioxide to combat climate change, and looked forward to working with Russia.Biden spoke Friday morning as part of the second day of the White House's Leaders Summit on Climate, which featured appearances from Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates as well. 'Today's final session is not about the threat climate change poses, it's about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides,' Biden said. 'It's an opportunity to create millions of good paying jobs around the world in innovative sectors.' President Joe Biden said Friday he was heartened that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to work with world leaders to decrease carbon emissions as he opened day No. 2 of the White House's Leaders Summit on Climate Russian President Vladimir Putin virtually attended day No. 1 of the White House's Leaders Summit on Climate He touted the great progress the leaders had already made, adding more efforts were needed by governments and the private sectors to ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy future.'When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create opportunities for everyone,' Biden said.   The president used that moment to promote his American Jobs Plan, which is still being negotiated on Capitol Hill.       'This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our children, our grandchildren,' the president continued. Biden said America 'is once again stepping into a leadership role' and pledged to cooperate with other nations in researching and deploying new strategies to decarbonize key industries.Biden said future jobs will involve installing electric-vehicle charging stations, manufacturing solar panels, researching sustainable farming practices and working in other new industries. But he said economic transitions shouldn't leave other workers behind. He said, 'We must ensure that workers who thrived in yesterday's and today's industries' also have a bright future.Billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who briefly ran against President Joe Biden in last year's Democratic primary, argued Friday that combatting climate change will depend on improving financial transparency about the risks of global warming Bloomberg, the billionaire ex-New York City mayor who briefly was Biden's Democratic primary rival last year, and Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, helped pitched Biden's climate-friendly transformation of the U.S. economy on day No. 2 of the summit.  Bloomberg said combatting climate change will depend on improving financial transparency about the risks of global warming.Bloomberg said Friday that companies need to provide financial disclosures on climate risks, so that investors can direct funding to businesses that are mitigating the threats of climate change. He said it will take historic investments to beat the challenge of global warning.Bloomberg said mayors and CEOs tell him they want to do more to tackle climate change but need more help. The multibillionaire founder of a financial data and news company is a special U.N. envoy on climate change issues.Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thanked President Joe Biden and U.S. climate envoy John Kerry for re-establishing America’s leading role on climate,' which some interpreted as a dig at former President Donald Trump Gates thanked Biden and U.S. climate envoy John Kerry 'for re-establishing America’s leading role on climate' - which some considered a dig at former President Donald Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement in the early months of his administration. 'This is a promising moment,' Gates said.   Gates said activists and young people are rightly demanding action. He said, 'Governments around the globe are meeting those demands with ambitious commitments.'
796	5	At least $67bn of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 can be attributed directly to climate breakdown, according to research that could lead to a radical reassessment of the costs of damage from extreme weather.Harvey ripped through the Caribbean and the US states of Texas and Louisiana, causing at least $90bn of damage to property and livelihoods, and killing scores of people.Conventional economic estimates attributed only about $20bn of the destruction to the direct impacts of global heating. Climate breakdown is known to be making hurricanes stronger and may make them more likely to occur, but separating the effects of global heating from the natural weather conditions that also cause hurricanes is complex.In a study published in the journal Climatic Change, researchers used the emerging science of climate change attribution to calculate the odds of such a hurricane happening naturally or under increased carbon dioxide levels, and applied the results to the damage caused.Similar methods were used in a separate study, published last month in the same journal, that found that droughts in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 cost the economy about NZ$4.8bn, of which $800m was directly linked to climate change. Floods caused insured losses of about NZ$470m over the same period, of which NZ$140m was linked to the climate.The researchers say the new tools are a more accurate way of estimating the economic damage caused by climate breakdown.“We’re pretty sure the climate change-related damages associated with extreme events have been underestimated in most assessments of the social cost of carbon,” said David Frame, a professor of climate change at the Victoria University of Wellington and the lead author of the studies. “We think this line of research, as it matures, should provide a really valuable input.”Friederike Otto, the director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said the method could make it possible to generate global estimates of the true cost of climate breakdown, which could have a profound effect on how governments and businesses approach the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“We have known about the costs of climate change theoretically,” said Otto. “It’s all very well in the abstract, but the global mean temperature does not kill anyone – extreme events cost money and lives. Being able to attribute these impacts to climate change means being able to convey what climate change really means.”She said it would become possible to compile an inventory of the damage that could be attributed to climate change around the world, which governments and businesses could use to bring about change. “Hopefully this will speed up the process of moving to net zero [carbon].”Estimating the true costs of the climate crisis could also help developing countries seeking recognition of the loss and damage they face as a result of climate breakdown, which they argue should spur rich countries to provide more assistance. Loss and damage is likely to be one of the most vexed issues at next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit.Legal actions around the world would also be affected, said Tessa Khan, a co-director of the Climate Litigation Network. Activists and local governments around the world are taking fossil fuel companies to court over their greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they knowingly caused damage while profiting from raising carbon dioxide levels.“[The two new studies] are opening to door to stronger evidence to persuade courts that fossil fuel companies should be held accountable for their role,” Khan said. “This will strengthen the legal basis of these lawsuits.”
531	5	As climate change negotiations come to a close in Cancun, Birginia Suarez-Pinlac is seeing red. The environmental lawyer from the Philippines is worried that a plan for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) constitutes a land grab, transferring natural wealth from the poor to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet.Last year, she says, an Australian coal company tried to forge an agreement with an indigenous tribe on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, a poverty stricken area known for its high mountains and lush green rainforest. “The company offered poor tribes people money in exchange for their atmospheric space. They don’t want to cut their own emissions domestically. They want to find a way to profit from the carbon they produce.”Forests help take climate changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing global warming – a human induced process linked to wild weather patterns including this year’s deadly flooding in Pakistan and crop destroying wild fires in Russia.Green-washingThe world is losing about six million hectares of forests each year – an area roughly the size of Greece – due to human activities like logging. REDD is supposed to be designed to allow companies to buy clean air credits from people who live in forests to encourage them to protect the trees. But some environmentalists say that when companies buy credits abroad through what is now a voluntary scheme, they feel entitled to pollute back at home.“The biggest buyers of REDD credits are the worst polluters – big oil and big coal,” says Bill Barclay, the research director for the Rainforest Action Network in California. “They are looking for a cheap ‘get out of jail free card’ – it’s basically green-washing.”In the Philippines, indigenous people “didn’t understand that they were giving away their atmospheric space to Australians” when they were approached by a non-governmental organisation working with the coal miners, Suarez-Pinlac says. But REDD and similar initiatives based on trading credits in carbon dioxide are not just about companies purchasing environmental legitimacy from communities who actually take care of forests; the schemes being discussed in Cancun could increase lucrative business opportunities for hedge fund traders and financers.“There is a lot of concern REDD will be brought into a carbon offset trading scheme,” Barclay says.Carbon trading is based on the idea that a price should be placed on emissions. Companies or countries would have a cap set on the amount of pollution they could spew. Those who curtail their emissions below targeted levels could sell atmospheric space to polluters who exceed their limits.The European Union has such legislation; the 27-nation bloc has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. And carbon trading figures prominently into this plan, as the EU is by far the world’s largest carbon market. And, while Europe has done far better than other industrialised regions in reducing its emissions compared to the size of its economy, some analysts think the moves are too little, too late.“We still aren’t seeing key reductions that climate scientists say are necessary,” says Rachel Cleetus, an economist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US.‘Carbon cowboys’Environmental scientists estimate that the world needs to see emissions cuts of at least 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 to 90 per cent by 2050 to stop catastrophic climate change.While Cleetus supports carbon trading as one of many policy tools for tackling global warming, she says: “The carbon market only gets at one market failure: the lack of a price on carbon. We need to get renewable energy strategies in place.”Hedge fund brokers and the speculators Barclay calls “carbon cowboys” believe the free market is the best tool for tackling climate change and better than an extension of internationally mandated emissions targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012.“The lack of a post-Kyoto agreement means that countries won’t have legal responsibilities to reduce emissions. They will have voluntary ones,” says Steven Sorrell, the deputy director of the Sussex energy group in the UK, a university based think-tank.The 2009 Copenhagen Accord, an attempt to extend the Kyoto Protocol, does not include binding targets. However, rich countries responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions pledged to create a fund worth $100bn per year by 2020 to invest in clean technologies and to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the global south.Eric Bettelheim, an author and CEO of Forest Landscape Development, a company that invests in products that “have a carbon and commodity value” believes turning nature into a tradable resource is crucial for protecting it.“Everyone who is rational about this realises global warming will probably never be solved without the participation of businesses and markets,” Bettelheim says. “Progress will be made on the recognition of forest carbon credits from developing countries as being good currency in the [carbon trading] system.”He accuses certain environmentalists and political leaders – specifically Evo Morales, the Bolivian president – of having an “anti-capitalist agenda”.Morales, whose country faces a major climate crisis resulting from pollution it did not create, wants reparations from the rich industrialised countries in the form of “climate debt”.  Bettelheim’s view on leaders like Morales is shared by politicians with some of the worst environmental records. The US refused to ratify the original agreement while Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia have indicated that they will not sign onto a second commitment extending the Kyoto Protocol past its 2012 expiration date.Before becoming Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper called Kyoto “a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations”.‘Two faced initiative’But good capitalists, it seems, can even make a profit from a “socialist scheme”. About $64bn changed hands in the emissions trading market in 2007, according to the World Bank.Bettelheim wants environmental regulations for the same reason that General Motors believes in stop signs and other rules for driving: he says they are good for business – and for the environment. Like grain, gold and oil, he hopes trading in carbon emissions will become a fundamental activity in the global economy.“With oil the question is scarcity, which creates a value people pay for,” he says. “In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the problem is surplus. How do you create a market from that? Legislation.”The commodities trader does not believe an extension of Kyoto is feasible because of domestic political and economic concerns in the countries which pollute the most. On this matter he may be right on the money.Regional carbon trading markets, similar to that practiced in the European Union, are being developed in East Asia by Japan and Korea and in the western US with California’s state government taking the lead in representing a “simpler way forward than having more than 190 countries sign onto rules” as Kyoto attempted to do. But that approach does not work for Suarez-Pinlac who believes carbon or offset schemes including REDD are a “two faced initiative” from major polluters in the developed world. Even if poor people in forests are paid by polluting companies to protect the land, she wonders “how the money [will] be managed when there is so much corruption?”Even in Europe, which has stronger institutions than other regions, carbon trading schemes have been hit by billion dollar scandals involving corruption and speculative trading which does not take carbon out of the air.“Negotiators talk about ‘safe guards’ for REDD, but really these are non-binding guidelines,” says Barclay. “This has Interpol [the international law enforcement agency] alarmed about the potential for corruption.”
132	5	The Australia Institute’s Ebony Bennett says the Coalition has an “abysmal record on climate change”, as industries and towns have been “wiped out” as a result of bushfires “accelerated by the mining and burning of fossil fuels”.On Sunday, the prime minister announced he would put a proposal for a royal commission into the bushfire crisis to Cabinet as he seeks to quell community anxiety around climate change and the government's emissions reduction target. Ms Bennett said the prime minister is “reliant on an accounting trick” to “meet and beat out targets”.Ms Bennett told Sky News it is “not credible” for the prime minister to make the claim Australia will meet the targets set by the Paris climate accord and “not back it up by lifting our ambition”.“Whole industries and towns who have been wiped out in certain sections of the country due to these bushfires that are accelerated by the mining and burning of fossil fuels”.Image: Getty
828	3	At least 9,000 years ago, humans began domesticating corn for the first time near Tehuacan, in the central Mexican state of Puebla, laying the foundation for permanent settlements in the Americas.But in the past few years, more frequent and longer droughts have forced many farmers in the area to give up corn and other cereals in favour of alternatives requiring less water, such as pistachio nuts and cactuses.Agricultural experts predict parts of Mexico will feel the effects of climate change more than many countries, not least because its location – between two oceans and straddling the Tropic of Cancer – exposes it to weather volatility.Sol Ortiz-Garcia, director of the agriculture ministry’s climate change group, noted that 75 percent of Mexico’s soil is already considered too dry to cultivate crops. In regions such as Tehuacan, temperatures may rise more than the global average.“We know there are areas where the increase is going to be greater. That will obviously affect rain patterns, and in turn, agriculture and food security,” Ortiz-Garcia said.The area under corn cultivation in Tehuacan decreased 18 percent to about 40,000 hectares between 2015 and last year, shows a Reuters news agency calculation using statistics by the agriculture ministry, outstripping a nationwide decline.In the five years before that, the area planted with corn had been slowly increasing in Tehuacan. Nationally, the area under corn cultivation declined four percent from 2015 to 7.4 million hectares last year.While factors leading farmers to switch crops are complex, in Tehuacan farmers and local officials describe a fast-changing climate as a leading cause. Mexico’s rainy season last year was the driest since 2011, which in turn was one of the driest on record, numbers from the country’s national water agency showed.Climate change is expected to cause substantial declines in yields of corn globally, especially in the tropics, concluded a 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. There may be exceptions. The corn belt in the US Midwest is so vast that one recent study concluded the expanses of lush fields were actually helping increase rainfall locally and also cut temperatures, thus allowing even more corn to be grown.Under this model, intensive farming meant more moisture being released into the atmosphere from plants on a scale great enough to create more rainfall. The greater humidity also contributed to summers up to one degree Celsius cooler, concluded the study, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In Tehuacan, however, conditions are fast changing for the worse. In a field where dried-out plants have been lingering in the dust since the last drought, farmer Porfirio Garcia, holding a stunted cob, was struggling to make sense of it all.Corn has for thousands of years been a symbol of Mexican pride, a staple of local and national cuisine from tortillas to tamales and the backbone of civilizations that gave rise to modern Mexico. But climate change has jeopardised that.Garcia, who has 12 children, half of them working with him on the farm, recalls how one hectare in some years yielded as many as four tonnes (8,800lbs) of corn. In the past five years, he said, with luck that hectare yielded 700kg (1,543lbs).“The corn harvest has shrunk because in the months of June, July, August and September there was no rain,” said Garcia, 59, who uses ancestral farming techniques to grow corn, beans and pumpkin, an ancient system called a “milpa”. “Our lives center on corn, so what do we do without it?”Eusebio Olmedo, director of rural development, agriculture and livestock in Tehuacan, recalls that it began to get hotter at the turn of the millennium. Having worked in the department for five years, Olmedo said the area used to be characterised by a “very pleasant, very benevolent” climate.Last year was the warmest on record in the state of Puebla – where Tehuacan is located – with thermometers reaching an average maximum temperature of 26.8 Celsius (80 F). In 1985, the first year that state records were available, Puebla registered an average maximum temperature of 24.7 Celsius (76 F).A 2016 study commissioned by the environment ministry and backed by the United Nations Development Programme concluded that climate change in Mexico will mean less rain, lower yields for basic grains such as corn, beans and wheat, as well as “unexpected effects on food security”.“When rain patterns change, agriculture becomes risky,” Olmedo said.Mexican corn farmers have suffered major shocks in the past – most notably the arrival of cheap imports from the US under the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. In the north of Mexico, where large cornfields are irrigated, climate change may initially have little impact, studies show.But in the south, where the oldest corn strains on Earth are grown using traditional methods without irrigation, the changing rain patterns and temperatures are already being felt. Agricultural consulting group GCMA estimates Mexican corn production will continue to decline in 2020, and that corn imports mainly from the US will reach a record 18 million tonnes.Mexico is now the world’s second-largest corn importer thanks to a reliance on US grain for animal feed. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador calls that “a contradiction”, and has implemented programmes to boost national production.Garcia, however, chose to diversify into other crops, planting 300 trees of pistachio, a desert plant that can withstand temperatures between minus 10C (14F) and 40C (104F).Nearby farmer Natalio De Santiago also abandoned the corn that he, his father and his grandfather used to plant for other crops that require less water. Those include maguey, a raw ingredient for mezcal, a Mexican liquor.“I stopped sowing [corn] because the weather is changing,” said De Santiago, 56. “Now I plant maguey because it needs less water.”Wearing a cowboy hat to shield his face from the sun, he said he irrigates 400 maguey plants every month with a litre of water each. When he planted corn, he said, his crops needed four months of rain.Others in the area gave up agriculture altogether and sold land to real estate developers. In an attempt to stop this trend, local authorities developed a bank of native corn seeds that are more resistant to pests and that need less water.“We have to adapt to climate change, and these are the best varieties to recover food self-sufficiency,” Olmedo said of the seeds.Other government measures meant to help farmers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change include agricultural insurance, alternative crops and campaigns to reduce agricultural burning.“It’s very difficult to reverse the tendency to increase CO2 [carbon dioxide] in the atmosphere,” said the agricultural ministry’s Ortiz-Garcia. “That’s why we’re prioritising adaptation.”“Climate change is here to stay,” she added.
524	3	"New Zealand is now seeing five more extra-hot days than it was in 1950. By 2080, the summer heatwave the country saw in 2018 could be the norm, a climate scientist says. Photo / Doug SherringScience Reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand is having five more hot days than it was 70 years ago – as the number of frost days slowly drops away.The fresh insights have been captured in a global index of extreme weather trends, bringing together a century of data from more than 36,000 stations.Kiwi climate scientist Professor Jim Salinger, who calculated New Zealand's data, said shifts in local extremes were consistent with global warming trends: extra-warm days are becoming even hotter and more common.His analysis showed the frequency of those days, where temperatures reached 25C or more, climbed from 8 per cent to 12 per cent between 1950 and 2018, or from 19 to 24 average hot days in a year.""Warm spells of three days or more have similarly increased.""At the other end of the scale, the picture was just as striking.""In many parts of New Zealand cold extremes are changing faster than the hot extremes, which is entirely consistent with global trends.""New Zealand had an annual average of 30 frost days – below 0C - 70 years ago, but that had fallen to about 25 days now. Over the same period, the annual proportion of cool nights fell from around 15 per cent to about 5 per cent today.""With anthropogenic global warming, the extra greenhouse gases in the air keep more heat in at night like putting an extra blanket around the planet to keep it warmer,"" Salinger explained.""Thus, low temperatures aren't so low and there are fewer frosts.""The shifts were particularly dramatic in different parts of the country. Northern New Zealand had effectively become ""frost free"", he said, enabling subtropical crops and pastures to be grown.At the same time, crops in the region that required winter frosts to set fruit were no longer successful, or could only be grown with chemical treatments.Across the country, the amount of heat available for crop growth during growing season had been rising, which meant winegrowers had to shift some varieties further south.Meanwhile, the annual rate of very wet days increased from 15 to 20 per cent over the 20th century in the east of the North Island, while a slight rise was also observed in the west and south of the South Island.""The trends in consecutive dry days contrast across New Zealand.""Salinger said the general trends would continue under climate change: the dramatic heatwave that marked the sweltering summer of 2017-18 would be the norm by 2080.Future warming – coming on top of an average 1C temperature rise over the past century – is also expected to lift snowlines, melt glaciers and raise flood risks in many parts of the country.By 2040, the frequency of drought could double or triple in eastern and northern New Zealand, while the average fire season length could soar by about 70 per cent.Scenarios calculated by Niwa found mean temperatures could rise by between 0.7C and 1C by 2040, and by between 0.7C and 3C by 2090.The number of days reaching more than 25C could increase by between 40 and 100 per cent by 2040, and between 40 and 300 per cent by 2090, and the average number of frost days could fall between 30 and 50 per cent by 2040, and 30 and 90 per cent by 2090.Globally, the new index, called HadEX3, suggested the intensity, frequency and duration of extreme weather such as heatwaves and heavy rain would increase as the planet warmed.One of the clearest trends among 29 indices was an upward trend in daily maximum temperature, showing a clear increase in the number of warm days globally, when compared with the number of warm days between 1961 and 1990.The greatest increase had been observed in tropical regions of South America, northern Africa and through Asia.Similarly, the number of warm nights in these regions had risen by more than eight days per decade, doubling since the late 1970s.""Looking at the changing climate by studying the frequency of extreme weather events provides a different perspective on climate change, complementing other metrics such as annual average temperature rise,"" said the index's lead author, Dr Robert Dunn of the UK Met Office.""It is extreme weather events which make the impacts of climate change real for people, and these events also present the greatest shocks to human health and wellbeing, financial economies and of course, the biosphere.""The index has been published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research – Atmospheres."
758	4	Last year saw a string of temperature records broken as climate change continues to heat Britain up, the Met Office has warned.The hottest temperature ever recorded came in July last year, when Cambridge University Botanic Gardens reached 38.7C.And a new publication by the Met Office, its annual State of the UK Climate report, published on what was due to be the hottest day of the year, has laid out a series of other records broken in 2019, all of which confirm the UK is getting hotter and hotter.Last year also saw the hottest ever winter temperature of 21.2C, measured at Kew Gardens in London on 26 February.And the mildest February day on record was logged last year, when the lowest temperature was only 13.9C, at Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands on 23 February.The hottest ever December day was 28 December 2019, when the mercury soared to 18.7C at Achfary, also in the Highlands.Although 2019 was only the 12th warmest year on average since records began, its average temperatures were still 1.1C higher than the long-term trends from 1961 to 1990.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereAll of the 10 warmest years on record have come since 2002, and one data series for central England which stretches back even further to 1659 shows the 21st century has been warmer than the three preceding centuries.“Our report shows climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK’s climate,” said Mike Kendon, the report’s lead author from the Met Office.“This year was warmer than any other year in the UK between 1884 and 1990, and since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series.“By contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963 – over 50 years ago.”Climate change was not just having a warming impact but was also making other kinds of weather more extreme, the Met Office reported.Last year saw significant flooding across Britain, including in Lincolnshire, the Pennines, South Yorkshire, and the East Midlands.Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre, said 2019 was the latest in a series of especially wet years, and for northern England marked the ninth most rainfall in a year since records began in 1862.“It’s worth noting that since 2009 the UK has now had its wettest February, April, June, November and December on record – five out of 12 months,” he told the BBC. Professor Richard Allan, a climate scientist from the University of Reading, said: “The record hot days and sticky nights observed in the UK during 2019 are an expected result of a warming climate that is intensifying heatwaves as well as heavy rainfall events, whenever they occur.“What is not captured in these reports are the remote consequences of climate change that are increasingly affecting our country through effects on global food prices, environmental degradation and national security.”Dr Friederike Otto, from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said the Met Office report was just another piece of evidence which showed how climate change could already be felt in British weather.“For heatwaves, climate change is a real game changer. Rapid analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative showed that the record-breaking 38.7C heat in Cambridgeshire in 2019 was made at least twice as likely due to climate change.”As the UK’s warming continued, we should expect to see more and more heatwaves, as well as both droughts and floods, as a result of climate change, she warned.“Climate change isn’t happening gracefully,” said Professor Martin Siegert from Imperial College London. “The weather records that have been broken inform us to expect more records as global warming continues; more heatwaves and droughts, more rainfall and floods, and more snow and icy-cold blasts.“The longer we leave it until we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, the worse our future weather is likely to be.”
802	5	Progressive climate activists plan to occupy the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC today in protest of Joe Biden’s early hires of key staff with connections to the oil and gas industry.They hope to send the president-elect the message that they helped him win and expect him to follow through with his commitments for significant and justice-focused climate action, including as he makes decisions about his cabinet, which will have a substantial role in carrying out his plan.The groups – which include the US Climate Action Network, the youth-led Sunrise Movement, the Climate Justice Alliance and the Indigenous Environmental Network – will camp overnight on the sidewalks around the building, despite chilly temperatures.They will hold a rally this afternoon with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, who co-sponsored a proposal for a Green New Deal. Other members of Congress scheduled to speak include Ilhan Omar and Ro Khanna, and recently elected Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush. The participants said they will take steps to maintain distance to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The action is an early sign that environmental advocates who supported Biden and worked to oust president Donald Trump intend to keep pressure on the administration.“We don’t feel like we want to be in a confrontational pose, but if we need to, we will be,” said Keya Chatterjee, executive director of the US Climate Action Network. “Right now is the moment where a lot of decisions are being made about whether or not the right personnel are going to be in place to actually be ambitious in a green recovery and get done everything that they ran on.”One of Biden’s first hires was congressman Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana representative who has come under scrutiny for accepting donations from the fossil fuel industry. His constituents have complained he would not previously engage with them in their campaign to reduce toxic air pollution and address serious public health problems.“[Knowing] how he’s so deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel industry does not give us a lot of hope or faith that the Biden administration is going to make good on their promises around climate,” said Ashley McCray, an organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network.Aside from Richmond and other rumored hires, the groups said they have been disappointed to see that Biden’s transition website seemed to include climate justice as an afterthought and did not specifically include the campaign’s commitment to directing 40% of green spending toward the vulnerable communities.However, Biden has also been praised for stocking his agency landing teams with climate and justice experts, and for raising climate in talks with world leaders.One contender to run the energy department, the Obama-era energy secretary Ernest Moniz, has done research paid for by the gas industry and is on the board of a pollution-heavy power company.Justice advocates are hopeful, though, that Biden could name representative Deb Haaland from New Mexico, to run the interior department. She would be the first Native American cabinet secretary.Biden during the campaign repeatedly insisted that he would not ban fracking – a drilling method that spurred a boom in gas production in the US. He also said he wouldn’t pursue a Green New Deal – a progressive proposal for extensive spending to fight both climate change and societal inequity.McCray said indigenous communities worry that Biden’s climate work might not help them personally – if he allows the oil and gas industry to continue to pollute near them by accepting emission trading schemes or technologies to capture planet-heating gases from fossil fuels.“We recognize that although these moves seem radical or progressive to centrists or moderates or to just the general American public, for indigenous communities who are literally on the ground fighting for their communities, fighting for their lives and fighting for future generations, this is something we’ve been keeping a good eye on,” McCray said.Anthony Rogers-Wright, policy coordinator for the Climate Justice Alliance, said “the only reason why there is a Biden administration is because environmental justice communities – black people, specifically, brown, indigenous, Asian people – voted for this now president-elect.“We want to make sure we’re sending the message clearly, we expect him to follow through and center environmental justice communities, and not just treat them as a box to check.”
392	5	Six years ago, a huge part of the Pacific Ocean near North America quickly warmed, reaching temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Nicknamed “the blob,” it persisted for two years, with devastating impacts on marine life, including sea lions and salmon.The blob was a marine heat wave, the oceanic equivalent of a deadly summer atmospheric one. It was far from a solitary event: Tens of thousands have occurred in the past four decades, although most are far smaller and last for days rather than years. The largest and longest ones have occurred with increasing frequency over time.On Thursday, scientists revealed the culprit. Climate change, they said, is making severe marine heat waves much more likely.The study, published in the journal Science, looked at the blob and six other large events around the world, including one in the Northwest Atlantic in 2012. Human-caused global warming made these events at least 20 times more likely, the researchers found.“Some of these couldn’t even have occurred without climate change,” said Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland and the lead author of the study.In a world with no human-caused warming, a large marine heat wave would have had about a one-tenth of 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year — what is called a thousand-year event. But with the current rate of global warming, an ocean heat wave like that could soon have as much as a 10 percent chance of occurring, the study found.Dr. Laufkötter said the likelihood of these large events would continue to increase as the world keeps warming. And if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at a high level for decades and average global temperatures reach about 5 degrees above preindustrial levels, some parts of the oceans may be in a continuous state of extreme heat.In effect, the blob may become permanent. Already, a marine heat wave resembling the blob has emerged in the past year off northwestern North America.Pippa Moore, a marine ecologist at Newcastle University in England who was not involved in the study, said earlier research had found links between climate change and major marine heat waves.So the new study isn’t surprising, she said. “But what’s really nice is they’ve done a formal attribution study that shows it.”An attribution study looks for the connection, if any, between climate change and extreme weather events by comparing simulations of the current warming world with simulations of a world in which human activity had not pumped billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These kinds of studies have been done for many events on land, including atmospheric heat waves and extreme rainfall, but very few have been done on marine heat waves.The oceans absorb most of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But Dr. Moore, who studies the ecological impacts of these heat waves, said it is how fast the water warms, rather than its ultimate temperature, that is most damaging to marine organisms. “That rate of heat rising is just too quick for their physiology to cope with,” she said. “It leads to reduced growth rates, heightened risk of disease and greater mortality.”But for sea lions and some other creatures, she said, the effects may be indirect. The heat wave may cause a source of food to die off or migrate. Heat waves can also lead to toxic algae blooms that can kill fish.The events can affect humans, too. The blob in the Pacific may have influenced weather patterns on the West Coast, worsening drought in California, for example. The 2012 heat wave in the Atlantic affected the lobster harvest in the Gulf of Maine and raised trade tensions between the United States and Canada.There are many reasons the heat waves form, Dr. Moore said, including the influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño. The blob was affected by a persistent ridge of high-pressure air over western North America that allowed stagnant air to linger over the ocean, leading to rapid warming.A separate study published on Tuesday in Nature Communications identified a novel mechanism by which a heat wave could develop: through the compounding effects of two successive extreme weather events.That study showed that a 2018 marine heat wave off the Gulf Coast formed when the passage of a tropical storm, Gordon, in early September was followed by an atmospheric heat wave.Brian Dzwonkowski, a researcher at the University of South Alabama and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and the study’s lead author, said the tropical storm had stirred cold water up from the bottom, mixing it with warm surface water to make uniformly warm conditions. The atmospheric heat wave then warmed the waters further, putting them past the heat threshold that defines a marine heat wave.The relatively shallow coastal waters were “supercharged from top to bottom,” Dr. Dzwonkowski said.In mid-October another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Michael, came along. The warm water helped it rapidly strengthen to a powerful Category 5 storm, with a devastating result. Nearly 60 people were killed when the hurricane made landfall in Florida.

Photo / Dean PurcellScience Reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand can and must do more to fight climate change on the home front, say authors of a high-level report out today.In the second of two major papers published by the Royal Society of New Zealand, researchers have laid out a range of actions they say the country could start taking now.An initial report, issued last week, warned several degrees of temperature increase by the end of century would put the country further at risk of flooding, drought, storm surge and put even greater pressure on waterways and ecosystems.A follow-up being launched in Wellington today provides a blueprint for shifting to a low-carbon economy through improvements in energy, transport, building, agriculture, industry and land use.Massey University sustainable energy expert Professor Ralph Sims, who led the panel of authors, said there were already many options that were well understood, achievable and likely to have flow-on benefits.""Business-as-usual approaches will not get us where we need to be; ambitious action is needed now by all New Zealanders.""The report noted how the impact of New Zealand's Emissions Trading Scheme - used to meet our emissions target through buying carbon credits from a range of overseas sources - had been limited in reducing actual domestic emissions.Around half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions stem from burning coal, oil and gas for electricity, transport, industry heat processes and other everyday uses, with the rest coming from agriculture through emissions of nitrous oxide from animal waste and methane, mainly belched from ruminant cattle.Ways to improve transport, still 99 per cent dependent on fossil fuels, included setting vehicle fuel efficiency standards, encouraging the use of low or zero-emissions vehicles and prioritising walking, cycling and public transport in urban design.Considerable emissions savings could be made by moving road freight to shipping or rail, Professor Sims said. ""As an example, the transport of one tonne of freight by diesel-powered rail produces less than a third of the emissions than transport over the same journey by road.""Professor Sims thought it was possible to reach - and even surpass - New Zealand's goal to be generating 90 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.This would require a more flexible grid that would incorporate small-scale, renewable electricity generation systems, along with energy storage and back-up generation.Buildings could be retrofitted to improve energy balance, hungry appliances could be replaced, codes and standards could be strengthened and the use of fossil fuels for industrial heat supply could be reduced by greater uptake of solar thermal, geothermal and biomass resources.Planting new forests was one practical method to remove large volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the short- to medium-term.Making a big dent in agricultural emissions would be challenging unless the country reduced its reliance on animal protein production.Smarter farming practices, selectively breeding stock and adjusting rumen biology to reduce emissions would help.Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett said the report would be a ""useful resource as we transition to a low-emissions economy"".""I hope it sparks more innovation and discussion on how we can achieve this. I want to hear from all sectors on how we move forward.""Labour climate spokeswoman Megan Woods said the report showed our present pathway was ""inadequate"".""It's time for the Government to ditch its old-fashioned approaches ... and move into the 21st century.""Greens co-leader James Shaw said top scientists had already pointed out that delaying action isn't an option.""The report shows the Government will fail to cut emissions if it relies on finding a technological silver bullet,"" he said. ""The Government should be investing for the future in a high-value, clean-tech, jobs-rich economy rather than in sunset industries like offshore oil and gas."""
746	5	EDITORIAL: Those trenchant holdouts still in denial about climate change nowadays find themselves in conflict not only with the present and the future, but with the past. It’s now a year since the floods of 2020 when two states of emergency were declared in the south within the space of 24 hours. Unprecedented, but hardly unpredicted. It was entirely in accord with what science had been foreshadowing for a long time, showing up pretty much on cue. READ MORE: * February 2020 flood: What will our future be with climate change? * Climate Commission report levels with public on true costs of a total economic overhaul * 'The Government will not hold back': Jacinda Ardern on how NZ could go zero carbon  Dramatic weather events coming around with increasing frequency; a compounding problem growing in magnitude and effect, requiring emphatic and urgent action. There’s a phrase applied to the two testaments of the bible: The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed. In some respects the same applies here. What we experienced a year ago had been predicted as part of a pattern that more recent experiences have left us better placed to appreciate. For neither the first nor last time we can readily acknowleged that there’s a difference between weather, with its variations of short term conditions rolling around, and the longer-term patterns of climate. The carbon reduction blueprint arrived at by the Climate Change Commission could be called ambitious in what it addresses, and criticised for lacking ambition in what it fails to address, at least with sufficient urgency. Whether that’s a case of necessary prioritisation, or a persistence of timidity in the face of urgent need, will be legitimate parts of the consultation process ahead. Denial of the underlying need, however, is madness. At a provincial level, we have climate projections that will require us to maintain vigilant assessments of the adequacy of our infrastructural and social mechanisms to best withstand the more turbulent times that are upon us. We will be tested like never before for our ability to withstand and react to more heavy rain days, and also more vulnerability to drought pockets. Life on a flood plain will become increasingly challenging, not only for riverside farmers but for a host of communities. Clearly the flood protection/mitigation work, which we should gratefully acknowledge stood up well to the extremities of last year, will be tested more extravagantly and more frequently. Same goes for emergency response professionals and volunteers, who will be entitled to expect more than the gratitude of their community after the events. They’ll need substantial functional assistance betweentimes. Many rural communities, while hardly novices at rallying to react to emergencies, can expect to be assailed not only more frequently, but quite likely more powerfully. And that’s the thing. Considering the mounting pressures that have come to play in recent times, the south is entitled to assess that for the most part it’s been so far, so good. But as things intensify, our reactive capacities needs to improve proportionately, at the same time as addressing the considerable demands of reducing our contribution to the causes of anthropogenic climate change.

854	5	From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with? I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
675	4	During a recent virtual fundraiser focused on climate action, former vice president Joe Biden made a direct appeal to voters young enough to be his grandchildren.“I want young climate activists, young people everywhere, to know: I see you. I hear you. I understand the urgency, and together we can get this done,” said the 77-year-old Democrat, who days earlier had announced a $2 trillion plan to combat climate change and environmental racism — the most ambitious blueprint released by a major party nominee for president.The moment marked a shift months in the making.Biden had rolled out a proposal during the primaries  — a $1.7 trillion plan that aimed to make the nation carbon neutral by 2050 — that did not impress many young activists who view climate change as an existential crisis.The youth-led Sunrise  Movement gave Biden an “F’ rating, saying his plan lacked detail and paled in comparison to the aggressive action proposed by rivals such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had embraced the far-reaching Green New Deal.This spring, with the Democratic nomination locked up, Biden’s campaign faced an imperative challenge: to demonstrate to the liberal wing of the party — including skeptical environmental activists —  that he was their guy, that he understood the urgency of the problem and that he would craft a transformative plan to meet the moment.Over three months, the campaign invited ideas from the young climate crusaders, union officials, environmental justice leaders and former Democratic rivals.Graphic: Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here’s how far we have to go.The result was a more aggressive and extensive plan that called for the elimination of carbon pollution from the electric sector by 2035, rejoining the international Paris climate accord and spending $2 trillion over four years to boost renewables and create incentives for more energy-efficient cars, homes and commercial buildings.“We’ve seen a pretty huge transformation in Biden’s climate plan,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder and executive director of the Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden, Prakash said.“What I’ve seen in the last six to eight weeks is a pretty big transition in upping his ambition and centering environmental justice,” she said.In recent meetings with donors and volunteers, Biden has repeatedly flagged climate as one of central crises facing the country, along with the coronavirus pandemic, the struggling economy and racial justice.By elevating climate, Biden is trying to channel the enthusiasm of voters who backed Sanders, as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and executive Tom Steyer, who made saving the planet a centerpiece of their failed primary campaigns.In addition, Biden hopes to appeal to moderate Republicans who say they, too, are concerned by impacts that scientists say are inevitable in a warming world: rising sea levels, devastating droughts, crippling floods and wildfires and more frequent and costly extreme weather events.Biden has framed his climate plan as a jobs program, making clear that he is prepared to pour unprecedented resources into transitioning the United States away from fossil fuels as part of the effort to boost an economy battered by the pandemic.Climate change also presents Biden with one of the most dramatic ways to distinguish himself from President Trump, who has dismissed the science behind climate change, rolled back scores of Obama-era environmental protections, announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris accord and heavily promoted the fossil fuels linked to rising temperatures.The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has called Biden a “puppet” of activists who “are plotting to strangle American energy producers, sacrificing millions of good-paying, blue-collar jobs on the altar of their extreme climate agenda.” And the president has insisted that Biden’s plans will kill the economy.“If these far-left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry but the entire U.S. economy,” Trump said Wednesday during a speech in Texas oil country.The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, says Biden’s plan to boost renewable energy will hasten the decline of union jobs as their businesses reel from the coronavirus pandemic.A poll conducted last summer by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that a growing number of Americans describe climate change as a crisis, and two-thirds said Trump is doing too little to tackle the problem. The poll found that about 8 in 10 Americans say human activity is fueling climate change, and roughly half believe action is urgently needed to avert its worst effects.Still, climate change has never ranked as a top priority for most voters, and recent polling suggests that many have put the issue further on the back burner amid the turbulence of recent months.In May, a KFF poll found ­that 33 percent of registered voters nationally said climate change is “very important” in their vote — down 10 percentage points from when the group asked the same question in February. Respondents said the economy, health care, the coronavirus pandemic, taxes and immigration were more important.In crafting his plan, Biden wanted to win over younger and more liberal voters but also avoid alienating voters in swing states. The plan notably does not ban hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, known as fracking, or rule out nuclear power and other technologies that have divided environmental advocates.“The campaign is trying to reconcile a combination of demands that no political candidate for president to date has been able to successfully navigate,” said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “All [Biden] needs to do is blend the ambition of progressives and scientists with the pragmatism of organized labor, the energy industry and moderate Republicans. That’s no easy task.”As the pandemic raged this spring, Biden asked longtime policy aide Stef Feldman and others to craft a more detailed set of climate proposals.“That was right around the moment when we were starting to recognize the full depth of the coronavirus, both its health impact and economic impact,” Feldman said in an interview. “And so that required us to scale up with the plans we had since the beginning of the campaign to recognize that we were in a new moment, which really demanded a jobs agenda.”Biden’s campaign reached out to several key groups: mainstream green organizations, labor unions and environmental justice advocates. Harold Mitchell, Jr., a former South Carolina lawmaker who has spent decades fighting pollution in communities of color, had toured his native Spartanburg with Inslee and had campaigned for Steyer. But in early April, he got a surprise email from the Biden campaign.“They asked, ‘What matters?’ I told them, ‘What matters is getting it right,’” said Mitchell, who is now part of a group advising Biden on environmental issues.Cecilia Martinez, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Center for Earth, Energy and Democracy, found herself on an hour-long online discussion with Biden this month about environmental racism.The new Biden plan includes a commitment to invest 40 percent of the clean energy money in historically disadvantaged communities — prompting Martinez to call it “the most innovative and bold plan in a presidential campaign that we’ve seen from an environmental justice standpoint.”Lonnie Stephenson, head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, started talking to Biden about energy policy in August. “I said, ‘Truly, nuclear needs to be in the mix,’” said Stephenson, whose union representing about 775,000 current and retired power sector workers endorsed Biden. Stephenson cautioned against the Green New Deal, which he considers “not achievable or realistic.”Inslee, the former rival, also consulted with Biden, and a small group of Inslee’s former advisers helped to persuade both Biden and congressional Democrats to adopt pieces of Inslee’s far-reaching climate plan.Biden “recognized this as a unique moment, when you could combine the economic benefit of clean energy with the environmental benefits,” Inslee said in an interview. “He had internalized that. It wasn’t just a talking point.”He called Biden’s recent proposal “ambitious enough for the moment,” but also realistic enough to win votes in Congress. “This is a real plan that can be executed,” Inslee said. “It’s not a pipe dream or a wish list or a fantasy.”The campaign also convened a climate task force led by two very different Democratic archetypes: John F. Kerry, the patrician 76-year-old former secretary of state and 2004 presidential nominee, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old first term congresswoman from a working-class Bronx district who had endorsed Sanders and helped craft the Green New Deal.Logging on to Zoom each Wednesday for about six weeks, the nine-person panel hammered out an outline of a climate plan designed for broad appeal. The group debated  difficult choices, such as whether to support nuclear power or to call for a ban on natural gas fracking.Despite being the nation’s biggest source of carbon-free electricity, nuclear energy has long drawn concerns about the storage of radioactive waste and the risk of accidents. And more recently, a boom in fracking has fed concerns about how the practice can pollute drinking water while also emitting methane, a potent greenhouse gas.“There were some people on our side that would have wanted to get rid of all fossil fuels ASAP,” said Catherine Coleman Flowers, a Sanders surrogate on the panel.Toward the end of the panel’s work, the Biden campaign added Rep. Conor Lamb, a Democrat from a ruby-red stretch of western Pennsylvania, to represent oil and gas workers in the crucial swing state. The task force eventually recommended a clean-energy standard that included both nuclear and gas-fired generation, as long as the latter captures the carbon it emits.The Sanders camp did secure one big win: A commitment to eliminate carbon emissions from power plants on an accelerated 15-year timeline.The vice president’s approach also is largely in line with a package from Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis steering the economy toward net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Two select committee members, Reps. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) and A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), served on Biden’s task force.“It is not coincidental that there are similarities in those plans,” McEachin said.Even after rolling out his new plan, Biden has continued to face pressure from the left. Last week, more than 100 liberal groups, including Greenpeace, called for the next president to commit to executive actions “to address the systemic inequalities of pollution and the climate crisis.”Prakash, the Sunrise Movement leader who served as a Sanders surrogate on Biden’s task force, said her group still wants Biden do more to wean the country off fossil fuels.Meanwhile, environmental advocates have begun to work to elect a candidate who might not have been their first choice, but one who stands in sharp relief to Trump.Recently, a group that includes the League of Conservation Voters announced an ad campaign across six states. “When it comes to climate change, there’s no comparison,” reads one ad. “Trump denied it. Biden will combat it.”Michele Roberts, national co-coordinator of the Environmental Justice Health Alliance, was among those consulted about climate by the Biden campaign this spring. She remains cautiously optimistic, both that Biden wins the election and that he actually follows through on his new promises. But she is also thankful that his campaign sought a wide range of voices that have been overlooked in the past.“Everybody knows that Joe Biden can do a whole bunch of talking. But what he did do was that he also listened,” she said. “We needed that. We needed someone to listen.”Scott Clement contributed to this report.
275	4	Critical United Nations climate negotiations, at which nations were expected to ramp up plans to combat global warming, have been pushed back a full year to November 2021.The deferment has been done in light of the coronavirus pandemic and other concerns, British politician Alok Sharma, who is also the president of the talks, announced on Twitter on Thursday.“Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26,” wrote Sharma, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021.”While many climate observers consider the delay understandable given the circumstances, they warn that any postponement could risk further stalling time-sensitive actions needed by countries across the globe to slow global warming.The UK proposed the new dates for the Glasgow conference – which had already been suspended – in a letter to the UN climate forum, citing health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the need for more time to prepare for the 30,000-strong meeting.    Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26 with our Italian partners and the @UNFCCC.#COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021.The new date will also allow the UK and Italy to harness the #G7 and #G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition.— Alok Sharma (@AlokSharma_RDG) May 28, 2020The revised schedule was vetted and approved on Thursday night.However, possible drawbacks of the delay were laid out in a briefing note, obtained by the AFP news agency and drafted before the deliberations.They included “the potential loss of momentum” going into the forum.One of the time-sensitive issues is a 2020 deadline in the original schedule for the submission of revised, and possibly more ambitious, “nationally determined contributions” of each country’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Current national pledges, submitted in an annex to the 2015 Paris Agreement, would allow the planet’s surface to warm at least three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, far above the upper limit of “well below” two degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius if feasible, agreed to in the landmark treaty.The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has made it clear that time is not the planet’s side, especially if global warming is to be capped at the safer level of a 1.5-degree Celsius rise.Carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere must be halved by 2030, and reach “net zero” by mid-century, if that more ambitious goal is to be met, the IPCC has said.While the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to reduce global CO2 emissions this year by four to seven percent, it will have scant impact on global warming’s long-term trajectory, according to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change.Most observers endorsed the postponement, but cautioned against inaction.“Shifting the date of COP26 is understandable, but there can be no let-up in tackling the climate crisis,” said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC, in the United States.Trillion-dollar recovery packages across Europe, North America and East Asia offer a “once-in-a-generation moment to rebuild societies to be more sustainable, equitable, resilient and healthy,” he said in a statement.Global warming continues to gather pace, other experts pointed out.“The coronavirus pandemic has not placed the climate crisis on hold, as the continuing spate of extreme weather across the world makes clear,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC.Last week, South Asia’s first super cyclone in two decades ravaged eastern India, including Kolkata, while northern India was hit by searing heatwaves and locust swarms linked to climate change.Scientists in the US, meanwhile, warned of a more severe-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season.Other important environmental conferences have also been pushed back in response to the pandemic.The critical COP15 UN conference on biodiversity, originally slated for October this year, will almost certainly “not happen before May,” a source involved in its organisation told the AFP.A quadrennial meeting in Marseille of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which manages the Red List of endangered species, was postponed from June to January 2021.
937	5	Shaun Hendy has known about climate change since he was 12, but it took Donald Trump to make him act on it. The physicist – who was part of an influential team that warned the Government how many deaths could result if Covid-19 spread unimpeded – spent most of his science career leaving the climate crisis to other people to solve, he says. Hendy was a kid when, reading a Scientific American magazine his father had left lying in his office, he discovered human-made gases were heating the planet. He did his school science fair project on sea level rise, roughing out a map showing his home in Palmerston North could be affected (bad news) but not his school (more bad news). “It was my first experience of science telling me something I didn’t want to know.” READ MORE: * About the Forever Project * 'Making homes affordable is taking climate action' – Greens co-leader Marama Davidson  * More profitable to sell NZ biofuel to the United States than to sell it here - Z Energy boss  As a student, he went into physics and materials science, and scientific modelling. One reason he didn’t become a climate scientist is because he wrongly assumed climate change would be solved by the time he was an adult. Then, in 2016, Donald Trump became president of the US and, Hendy says, “paralysis hit the international community on climate”. After decades of leaving solving climate change to others, he decided he had to do something. The most obvious way to signal that he was genuinely worried was to stop flying for a year, Hendy says. In a bad year, he’d travel to Europe twice, North America twice and Australia three or four times. “It was crazy.” “If you're a Koru club gold or gold elite member you've racked up a lot of time on planes, you've probably got 3-4 times the emissions rate of the average New Zealander, so you're living this really privileged life,” he says. “If you're a scientist, you're living this really privileged life at the same time as telling other people to cut back. We're really concerned about climate change in the scientific community, and we're really concerned that governments haven't acted, but then we're not acting ourselves.” Hendy is used to criticism that his actions were empty, or just for show. But he doesn’t buy the idea he was ‘virtue signalling’ – or rather, he does, but he’s happy to own it. “It’s very hard for someone who’s not an expert to pick apart the evidence and to weigh up who’s credible and who’s not, so to have scientists who are talking about carbon emissions, emitting as they do it, how does that look from an outside perspective? Your actions do count.” That’s not to say he solved the emissions crisis in a year. Although his personal impact dropped by over 90 per cent, “the planes still flew” he says. “That was one of the things I had to grapple with. New Zealand’s carbon emissions didn't drop that year.” Hendy has since gone back to flying, but has cut his trips significantly. He says the lack of regular trains between our biggest cities is a major problem. He wants the Government – through Kiwirail – to bring back a daily commuter train service between Auckland and Wellington. “It’s really been viewed as a tourist jaunt and it's not something the average New Zealander has really taking advantage of, but there's a growing concern people have about their carbon footprint. Taking the train is one of the lowest-carbon ways of getting across the country and at the moment we don't have that option,” he says. As concerned as Hendy is about Covid, he says the virus will likely disappear within a couple of years, while our children and grandchildren will still be dealing with climate change – particularly if post-lockdown make-work schemes lock in our reliance on carbon dioxide.  “The easiest way to do that, for many people, is to kick start fossil fuels again, but there are opportunities to do that differently.”

The company's listed address matches that of the Heinz Family Foundation.The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Neither did the Heinz family office. According to FAA records, the jet's registration certificate was issued in July of 2005 and expires in October of 2023.While it's unclear exactly how much Kerry benefited from his wife's company, private jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights.""We look forward to the anti-carbon lectures from a guy who travels the globe on private jets and luxury yachts,"" read a New York Post editorial last year.During his 2004 presidential run, Kerry's campaign made 60 payments to his wife's charter jet company, totaling $273,171, the New York Post reported.As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure showed Kerry owning ""over $1,000,001"" in assets for ""Flying Squirrel LLC"" through his wife.Kerry's financial disclosures from 2009-2012 also show that amount. "

Damien goes and negotiates essentially country by country ... the nature of COP26 is there are about 30 different parallel steps of negotiations going on and of course, we only have coverage for about half of that.""By comparison, Fiji was sending around 50 negotiators ""because they actually see climate change as an existential threat,"" Shaw said.""So they take it more seriously than we do. Ultimately that's because they're feeling the effects of it in ways that we aren't.""Listen below:Mackay asked if Shaw was being ""a wee bit alarmist"" with his statements.He referred to an interview on The AM Show when Shaw said to host Ryan Bridges, ""what you're saying is making money is more important than a breathable atmosphere?""Shaw disagreed.""If he's going to dish it out to the Climate Change Minister for taking up MIQ spots, why isn't he dishing it out to the Trade Minister for taking MIQ spots?""They said that's because it's trade and that's clearly more important. So that just shows the sort of priorities there.""New Zealand was in a ""climate crisis"" and the time to act was now, Shaw said.""If you talk to the people of Westport about the effects of climate change, if you talk to the people who lived around the fires in Nelson ... if you talk to the farmers experiencing ever-increasing drought...then you know this thing is upon us.""""It's not happening to in the future somewhere else to somebody else - it's not about polar bears in the arctic anymore - it's about us.""Also in today's interview: Shaw defended the Government's Three Waters programme, saying the ""status quo is dire""."
352	4	"Activists, world leaders and civil society responded on Monday to the new ominous report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that warned that the world is on track to surpass the warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) within 15 years.The report laid out the undeniability of human emissions being the cause of the rise in temperature, which has already sparked environmental catastrophes around the world.The planet has already warmed up by 1.1 degrees and just a handful of countries are on course to reduce their emissions to a sufficient extent.However, as climate activist Greta Thunberg pointed out, the report ""contains no real surprises.""""It confirms what we already know from thousands previous studies and reports — that we are in an emergency,"" the 18-year-old wrote on Twitter.""We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis,"" she added.In light of the report, Thunberg told Reuters news agency she now plans to attend the upcoming UN climate conference in Scotland. She'd previously said she would boycott the conference due to the unequal rollout of COVID vaccines around the world.Nigerian activist Oladosu Adenike had a similar response to Thunburg, writing on Twitter that ""the commitments from world leaders aren't enough to tackle the current projections of the impact.""UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the report a ""code red"" for humanity, adding that it ""must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy the planet.""The US government's Climate Envoy, John Kerry, said the IPCC report shows that ""we cannot afford further delay,"" adding that ""climate change is transforming our planet in unprecedented ways, with far-reaching effects that we are already seeing – making heatwaves, extreme rainfall, fire weather, and droughts more frequent and severe.""UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is facing pressure at home to stop the planned opening of a coal mine, said in reaction to the report: ""We know what must be done to limit global warming – consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.""The EU's chief for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermann joined in the chorus on Twitter, saying that ""it's not too late… if we act decisively now.""Earlier in the day, German politicians also urged for increased cooperation to tackle the crisis, including a global green deal to expand renewable energies. Friederike Otto, one of the author's of the report, spoke to DW about its conclusions, stating that ""it is a fact: there is no uncertainty that human greenhouse gas emissions are the cause of the warming we observe.""She explained that we can expect to see more extreme weather and climate events, such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts, that we are already observing.""In addition to that, what we will also, no matter at what level we constrain global mean temperature rise, continue to observe further sea level rise for decades and centuries to come, and also glacial melt, because these are the slow responding parts of the climate system,"" Otto added.She also emphasized that the report is about the climate science which provides governments with the data they need for policy decisions, but does not make any policy recommendations. But if we want to limit warming to just 1.5 degrees, then we ""have to reach net-zero by the middle of the century.""The European Space Agency's Climate Office spoke to DW about the IPCC report and the recent wildfires in southern Europe.Climate expert Clement Albergel said that the new report ""echoes previous findings linking human activities, greenhouse gas emissions in particular, and climate change.""In reference to the fires that have devastated large parts of Greece, Turkey and Italy in recent days, he said: ""When high temperatures are combined with low humidity, low rainfall and/or high winds there is an increased risk of wildfire...

526	3	"Photo / SuppliedMany hands are making light work of improving water quality in the Manawatū-Wanganui region, with landowners and local communities chipping in to re-forest hill country as climate change's impact is felt.Despite delays caused by the Covid-19 lockdown, this winter community groups around the district are coming together at weekly native planting sessions –  one of a number of initiatives designed to arrest erosion and help save the region's rivers.One of the Horizons Regional Council's recent stream-planting projects was on Mike and Lindsay Will's 480-hectare sheep and beef farm in the Kiwitea catchment, northeast of Feilding.A steep and erodible gully system at the headwaters of a stream that flows into the Kiwitea Stream and then the Ōroua River has been retired as farmland, fenced to exclude stock and re-planted in native trees.It is one of many such projects – as a region, Horizons has the greatest area of highly erodible land in the country, with over 220,000ha of high-priority land.""As a result of the 2004 storm events [which caused major flooding in the Manawatū], the community came together and said we need to get ahead of this and keep the soil on the hills,"" Horizons' group manager natural resources and partnerships Dr Jon Roygard says.""Since then we've put nearly 20m trees in the ground and the Landcare Research model tells us there has been a 27 per cent improvement in sediment in the rivers overall.""Unfortunately, some reduction in that figure is likely because of climate change and more frequent high-rainfall events, which will continue to impact on hill-country erosion. What we're trying to do is get ahead of these storm events and build resilience as fast as we can.""As landowners, the Wills received a 30 per cent subsidy from Horizons for fencing, as well as another 50 per cent grant to plant the riparian area directly alongside the stream.Horizons Regional Council freshwater and partnerships manager Logan Brown says this planting, and other projects like it, help to reduce sediment, nutrients and e. coli bacteria from stock faeces entering waterways – by capturing farm run-off as it works its way down gullies.""The plants also contribute to improvements in aquatic habitat as well as benefit terrestrial biodiversity by providing food and shading,"" he says.Around 5500 young native plants went into the Wills' farm over three days, funded by a Manawatū River Leaders' Accord community grant supporting projects aiming to improve water quality in the wider Manawatū catchment. Among many helping hands on the planting days were staff from civil works contractors Higgins, students and staff from Waituna West School and other local community members.Landowner Mike Will says the gully was ""a pretty special place, as it has some regenerated bush including rewarewa, rimu and tōtara, so protecting it was important. The area also feeds a dam for stock drinking water so not only will cleaner water get to the Kiwitea Stream, but also to our stock"".The gully was identified as suitable for retirement when a Horizons Sustainable Land Use Initiative (SLUI) Whole Farm Plan was drawn up for the property. The council has now developed around 700 of these plans for farms around the region.Roygard says, when creating a Whole Farm Plan, council consultants look at the land use and farming practices, then work with farmers to identify ways to start implementing change to reduce erosion and improve water quality.""We've been doing these for 12 years, covering around 550,000ha, which is about a quarter of the region and around half the land in sheep and beef farming,"" he says.Based on these plans, Horizons last year completed around 500 jobs across the region reducing erosion and improving water quality – from planting native species and poplar poles in unstable slopes to stream fencing, retirement of farmland and conversion to forestry.Roygard says landowners play a big part in the solution and taking a non-regulatory approach has been highly successful: ""We don't only work with Whole Farm Plans — we are also working with farmers who want to go some of the way. It gives us the ability to start a relationship with farmers and continue to work with them.""The council runs several programmes helping landowners engage in riparian fencing and planting – the main one combating hill country erosion and nutrient enrichment of waterways. Areas suitable for fencing and retirement are identified and grants provided to cover costs. Another project works with lowland farmers and communities on fencing and planting of waterways.With over half the region's land classified as hill country, the council's SLUI takes a ""mountains to the sea"" approach to keep soil on the hills and out of waterways, enhancing water quality and increasing farm productivity.Watch Higgins planting day below:"

237	4	"OPINION: Climate change is genocide. That's right, I said it. And on Monday, I will say it to the Select Committee for the Zero Carbon Bill. As a child of the 80s, I grew up watching the nuclear-free protests. Jacinda Ardern is right. The Zero Carbon Bill is indeed the nuclear-free moment of our generation. Growing up at the end of the Cold-War, at school I learned about the risk of mutually assured self-destruction through nuclear war. For me, it was personal. My grandfather was sent to Hiroshima with J-Force to clean up the H-bomb. I had been on the Rainbow Warrior on a school trip. And now that the world has survived the nuclear stand-off, we have graduated to an even more horrific fate: the slow and painful extinction of the entire human race. I do not say this lightly. As a lawyer who has worked as a war crimes investigator for nearly 20 years, I understand the intricacies of proving the legal tests of specific intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. READ MORE: * New Zealand must listen to Pacific voice on the climate crisis * Kids, don't let climate grief stop you looking forward to the future * Does the Government have stomach to tackle its 'nuclear-free' moment? * Why these climate change activists are ready to break the law In the drafting of the Genocide Convention, the New Zealand delegation is recorded asking a hypothetical question about the legality of a genocide ""in fact"" such as when a whole ethnic group lives in a village which is accidentally destroyed. Therefore, without intent to destroy that whole group, the group was in fact destroyed. There was no answer to the New Zealand delegation. And with a terrible irony, we face the same question now, but this time, for the whole of humanity. The scientifically established facts underpinning the climate emergency are shocking. Today's school kids are learning about these scientific facts which lead to only one conclusion: that we are already on an irreversible path to a climate which will not support human life. As the greenhouse gases and various tipping points are crossed with no way back (melting permafrost, retreating glaciers etc), the changes in the climate will become increasingly ferocious. The earth will be fine – it has gone through millions of years cycling from high to low carbon in the atmosphere. It is life in all its forms, including our own, which will not be fine. Compared to my school days of people chaining themselves to boats and taking fun sailing trips to protest at Moruroa Atoll, our kids of today are crushed under climate-change-induced clinical depression. The obligation on us is clear: we have to do more for our kids and our planet. The eventual extinction of the human race is self-evidently, and horrifically, the most extreme act of genocide. Lawyers will point out the legal tests are stretched under this argument, but the question of genocide ""in fact"" even over a protracted time period, at least deserves a serious conversation. We need a legal framework or test cases which examine the tough legal questions of causation, inchoate crimes, conspiracy etc. Because at the end of the day, someone has to pay for the expensive palliative care of our species.  The most important aspect for our survival is to amplify the role that everyday citizens like you and me have in finding the solutions and pushing our elected representatives into action.  I have seen time and time again in my work that when people can take steps to create and enforce legislation directly, we have the most complete contribution to the balance of powers, as envisioned in a healthy democracy. Just last week, the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva found the State of Paraguay responsible for the violation of the right to life by not maintaining a healthy environment. This case was brought to the UN through a direct individual petition. For this reason, my submissions to the Select Committee focus on our global commitments to support the rights of citizens to have access to the courts through judicial review, which is currently excluded under the draft Bill. Judicial review is essential. I support the rights of youth and Te Ao Māori to lead this conversation and engage directly through the courts, such as already happening in the Waitangi Tribunal claim concerning climate change by representatives of the Mataatua District Māori Council.  So that's why I'm using my voice and the privilege of my life experience to call for our country's elected representatives to prevent us from being privy to polices which shock the conscious of humanity. To call for us to NOT be part of the acts which may lead to our own extinction. Alison Cole is a war crimes investigator and international lawyer specialising in climate justice.

892	2	The recent horrors in Texas, as millions went without electricity and water during a historic winter storm and cold snap, remind us of the ticking time bomb that is our nation’s aging infrastructure. In the early 20th century, we made bold investments in our infrastructure that powered our success, and our continued prosperity depends upon our ability to innovate and adapt. Yet we have failed to invest for decades, leading to the American Society of Civil Engineers consistently giving America’s infrastructure C-minus to D-plus marks.As climate change brings more frequent and intense weather events, our infrastructure will continue to face challenges it was not built to withstand. The most vulnerable among us will suffer disproportionately. If this is to be a time of equitable renewal amid a global pandemic, then we must meet this once-in-a-generation opportunity to address our crumbling infrastructure, climate change and social equity with a natural solution.A 21st-century infrastructure system should incorporate conventional approaches using rock, concrete and steel that are strategically designed to work with natural infrastructure. Imagine a concrete flood wall with an expansive reef and marsh in front of it. The wall provides flood protection benefits during storms but does little on a sunny day. In contrast, the reef and marsh system not only reduces the power of waves but also self-adjusts to rising seas, captures carbon, improves water quality, and provides places for us to hunt, fish and recreate.Further inland, river floodplains, parks and greenspaces can serve as pressure relief valves to help protect downstream communities from flooding and pollution. When conventional engineering and Mother Nature join forces, our communities are protected by multiple lines of defense that generate a wide range of economic, environmental and social benefits.Importantly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will soon release new guidelines outlining how natural infrastructure can best support resilience and flood-risk reduction. This four-year effort, involving scientists and engineers from around the world, will, for the first time, outline in a comprehensive fashion how to best conceptualize, plan, design, engineer, construct and maintain natural infrastructure.One of the primary barriers to implementing this approach are benefit-cost analysis requirements for federal projects. BCA requirements are rooted in an intuitive approach that most of us use every day. When faced with a decision, we consider our alternatives, weigh the pros and cons, and pick the solution that provides the greatest benefit for the lowest cost. This approach makes sense for a fiscally responsible government but falls on its face when we don’t consider some of the most important benefits. What if the greatest benefit of the project is a more equitable and resilient future?Current practice focuses on monetizing the economic benefits of concrete flood walls and levees based on the property values they protect. For decades, many of the engineers and economists who design and evaluate federal infrastructure projects have not fully considered the benefits and costs related to the environment, human health and social equity. As a result, the deck is stacked against progress.The science of monetizing environmental and social benefits has dramatically advanced, and it is time for federal policy and practice to catch up. Tools like social return on investment employ well-established economic, accounting and social science research to measure what we know to be true — our communities and our environment are worth far more to us than their property values alone.When we limit ourselves to old ways of thinking about costs and benefits, we tend to invest in protecting wealthier communities. This approach perpetuates climate injustice: Multimillion-dollar condos on Miami Beach are deemed worthy of protection while less wealthy neighborhoods, disproportionately communities of color that have been underserved or actively harmed by past infrastructure investments, are neglected.But there’s reason to be optimistic. President Biden has rightly made environmental justice a core priority and called for modernizing the regulatory process to account for environmental and social factors. Tucked away in last year’s coronavirus relief bill was a provision that, for the first time, clearly permits the Army Corps of Engineers to consider environmental and social factors when developing infrastructure projects. In its 2021 “Report Card for America’s Infrastructure” released Wednesday, for the first time, the American Society of Civil Engineers recognized natural infrastructure as a key solution for building resilience and raising the grade across all infrastructure sectors.While these are encouraging developments, change of this magnitude is never easy. Consistent leadership from the White House and relevant federal agencies will be needed to break decades of federal practice in which exclusive reliance on outmoded economic calculations and conventional infrastructure has limited progress. If we do not act today, it’s not a question of whether another extreme weather event will expose our growing vulnerabilities but when and at what cost.Brian Bledsoe is the director of the Institute for Resilient Infrastructure Systems and a Georgia Athletic Association distinguished professor in the College of Engineering at the University of Georgia.

552	4	The most aggressive dismantling of the former president’s environmental rules yetTen months in, and the presidency of Donald Trump has acquired a reputation for ineffectiveness. Trump’s attempt to repeal Obamacare has failed three times; he has taunted and alienated some congressional Republicans; he has hemorrhaged senior administration officials while struggling to contain an FBI investigation.But Trump has found near-total success in a few areas of lawmaking—and few are as expansive, with consequences as long-lasting, as environmental policy. Since January, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s broad legacy of EPA rules meant to lessen the blow of climate change. It has largely succeeded. This week, Trump’s team opens a new front in that war.Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, announced Monday that he will fully repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s signature plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the U.S. electricity sector.It’s the new administration’s most aggressive attempt to materially transform U.S. climate policy since its departure from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June.The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower greenhouse-gas emissions from American power plants by 32 percent by 2030, as compared to their historical peak in 2005. It constituted the central legal mechanism to meet the American commitments made under the Paris Agreement.Speaking in the coal-mining town of Hazard, Kentucky, Pruitt alleged that the Clean Power Plan represented illegal executive overreach. He also linked it to a “war on coal” that he says was waged by the Obama administration.“The past administration was unapologetic. They were using every bit of power [and] authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers on how we generate electricity in this country. That is wrong,” he said. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a longtime Republican of Kentucky, appeared by his side.Environmentalists condemned the repeal and promised to fight it in court. Ditching the Clean Power Plan, they said, would further degrade the planet’s climate by leading to the release of more heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere.Public-health groups, including the American Lung Association, also condemned the planned repeal. Nearly half of Americans already live in counties with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the organization has said, adding that climate change appears to makes conventional air pollutants worse.“Science shows that warmer temperatures can reduce air quality, due to increases in ozone and particulate matter,” said Laura Anderko, a professor at Georgetown University. Air pollution poses a particular health threat to children, she noted.The Clean Power Plan was sold in part on its public-health benefits. A 2015 study in Nature Climate Change found that a set of rules similar to the Clean Power Plan would prevent 220 heart attacks and 3,500 premature deaths per year. Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas would all see the greatest gains under the simulated plan, each avoiding hundreds of early deaths annually.But the Clean Power Plan has also long contained a tension inherent to American environmental law. Since 2007, the Supreme Court has held that the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.The Obama administration didn’t pursue regulation at first, attempting to pass the Waxman-Markey climate-change bill through Congress. That bill would have allowed companies to bid on the right to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, mirroring previous federal laws to reduce acid rain. But after it failed in the Senate—and Democrats lost control of Congress in 2010—Obama’s EPA turned to the Clean Air Act. Over the course of several years, the agency studied, issued, and revised state-by-state rules guiding how local governments should reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from their power plants. The final version of the Clean Power Plan was released in August 2015, months before the Paris conference on climate change.Almost immediately after the Clean Power Plan was published, dozens of state attorneys general sued the Obama administration, alleging the rules were illegal. They were led by Pruitt, then the Oklahoma attorney general and the chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Despite the Supreme Court’s finding that the Clean Air Act allowed the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, they argued that this plan, the Clean Power Plan, was illegal.Did the Obama rules break the law? We may never know. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was still considering the case on Election Day last year. Trump ordered the EPA to revisit the plan in an omnibus executive order in March.Due to the Supreme Court’s 2007 ruling, the Trump administration will have to issue a new regulation to replace the Clean Power Plan. But it has great leeway in when it may issue that new rule, and it appears to be taking its time.Of course, the Clean Power Plan is not the only change convulsing the U.S. power sector. While solar and wind energy are on the rise worldwide, they have mostly displaced nuclear power in the United States. Coal use has indeed been plummeting in recent years, but this has mostly been due to cheap natural gas made available by fracking.“You want to know how you bring the coal jobs back? Ban fracking,” said Ted Thomas, the chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission and a former Republican legislator in the state, in March. “When you talk to utility professionals, there are more of them who think Elvis is still alive than believe that” the Obama administration’s rules are to blame for the decline in coal, he told me then.Indeed, energy experts say that the United States may meet the ostensible emissions-reduction goals of the Clean Power Plan. The Rhodium Group, an energy consulting firm at the forefront of climate-economic forecasting, projects that the U.S. power sector will fall by between 27 and 35 percent by 2030 without the Clean Power Plan. But its experts also caution the 32-percent figure was just an estimate, and the real emissions gains of the Clean Power Plan may have been higher than anticipated. Historically, energy forecasts have undershot the rise of solar and renewable energy.And there are graver implications to the rollback. The United States is not on track to reduce its carbon emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic global warming—even under the most optimistic economic forecasts. A recent study on the world’s carbon budget found that the world would need to reduce its emissions in ways that parallel “the Great Depression, the years following World War II, and during the collapse of the Soviet Union” to stave off the worst of global warming.
204	3	Hundreds of butterfly species across the American West are vanishing as the region becomes hotter, drier and more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, according to a study released Thursday.In a swath of 11 states, from California to Montana, and from New Mexico to Washington, the populations of a majority of 450 butterfly species are dropping, according to observations by professionals and amateurs stretching back to the 1970s.The loss of butterflies across Western forests and prairies, like the similar drop in bumblebees nationwide due to rising temperatures, is troubling because both insects play a key role in pollinating crops and wildflowers. And the findings may add to fears among researchers of a broader die-off of insects that could be underway everywhere from Germany to Puerto Rico and beyond — a potential and debated bugpocalypse that threatens to upend ecosystems across the world.In the United States, the alarming butterfly decline is most evident in Western areas where balmy summer temperatures creep well into the fall, drying out vegetation and potentially disturbing the seasonal cycles of the fluttering insects as they prepare for cooler months.“The influence of climate change is driving those declines, which makes sense because they’re so widespread,” said Matt Forister, a biology professor at the University of Nevada at Reno and co-author of the study published in the journal Science. “It has to be something geographically pervasive.”Scientists have long known that roadways, farms and other human development are stamping out meadows and other habitat for butterflies, while pesticides have further culled their numbers. Conservationists have taken to cordoning off areas as butterfly sanctuaries, planting vegetation such as milkweed for monarch butterflies as they migrate from Mexico across the Lower 48.But the fact that widespread warming is weighing on such large numbers of butterflies across a vast geographic area suggests a more dire situation that cannot be abated simply by setting aside habitat. While the populations of butterfly species can vary widely from year to year, the researchers found an annual 1.6 percent drop in butterfly numbers in the Western United States over the last four decades.Put another way: A butterfly spotter going to the same site every year saw about 25 percent fewer butterflies on average than 20 years ago.David Wagner, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut who was not involved with the latest research, said the new findings are startling because “this is one of the first global cases of declines occurring in wildlands, away from densely populated human-dominated landscapes, and the rate of 1.6 percent is calamitous.”The best-known butterfly on the decline in the drought-plagued region is the once-ubiquitous monarch, which used to arrive in California in such abundance every spring they regularly formed “a golden carpet” on the ground and filled the skies with “orangy” clouds, as John Steinbeck once wrote.Now those orange itinerants are showing up in far fewer numbers. Since 1990, about 970 million monarchs have disappeared, according to a 2015 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report.Other species, such as the common cabbage white butterfly and the imperiled, multicolored Edith’s checkerspot, are on downward trends, too, according to the analysis from Forister and his team.“Rare species, common species, widespread species, local species,” said Forister, each had “detectable declines.”The formal scientific findings jibe with what many motorists driving across the West have noticed recently: fewer bugs splattered across the front of their cars than during past road trips. Entomologists even have a name for it: the “windshield phenomenon.”Forister said he has seen it “personally because I’ve been driving back and forth over the mountains for 20 years” from Reno and elsewhere on Interstate 80 to visit his parents in California’s Central Valley.“It used to be that as soon as I showed up, my dad would get the hose out and obsessively clean the window,” Forister said. “He just doesn’t even do that anymore.”The latest research is built on not only data collected by scientists across central California but observations across 10 other Western states scribbled into notebooks by butterfly enthusiasts out in the field or simply uploaded from smartphones by amateurs who make a hobby out of spotting rare species in their backyards.“Even if you just took the professors that were on this paper, all of us, we couldn’t cover that geographic area,” said Katy Prudic, an entomologist at the University of Arizona who helps run one of the online butterfly databases. “There’s just not enough of us. So this work, the comparison across the entire West, could not be done without citizen science.”Among the data used in the study are field notes from Marilyn Lutz and her husband, Joe Zarki, who have volunteered to run a butterfly count in Joshua Tree National Park for 25 years. The couple has been cataloguing birds and butterflies together ever since meeting in Yellowstone National Park in 1985.They used to think they had trouble finding certain butterflies at higher elevations due to lack of experience. “But over time, we’re wondering if some of these are species that may be climate-change influenced,” said Zarki, who used to run educational programs at the park and is now retired.Not every type of butterfly is in decline. Some are finding an edge in environments dominated by humans. The bright-orange Gulf fritillary, for example, is thriving not on native plants but on flowers popular in home gardens, Forister said.And climate change itself may be a boon to butterflies in some places outside of the arid West. Using some of the same data as Forister and his team, Matthew Moran, a biology professor at Hendrix College in Arkansas, is working on a paper that he says will show an uptick in butterflies in the southeastern United States, where climate change is leading to more precipitation and plant growth.“They got a really strong climate signal,” Moran said of the study published Thursday. The Western United States, he said, is “one of the more rapidly changing places in the continent. … If you look at it more continentwide, you will see more balancing-out.”Still, efforts by federal wildlife officials to protect those butterflies in danger of vanishing entirely have had limited success. Of the 31 butterflies protected under the Endangered Species Act, only three are increasing in number, according to Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.Conservationists have struggled to get other imperiled butterflies added to the endangered list. In December, the Trump administration declined to declare the monarch endangered, citing limited resources, even as wildlife officials admit the decline is severe enough to warrant federal protection.And the Center for Biological Diversity has fought for years to get the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly, a native of New Mexico’s high-elevation meadows, listed as endangered, filing multiple petitions with the Fish and Wildlife Service, including a new one this week.Even so, it could be too late. “Now they can barely find it,” Greenwald said. “It may be extinct.”
789	5	As the climate crisis intensifies, U.S. environmental policy has moved dangerously backward, with nearly 70 environmental rules reversed during this administration, and 30 more reversals in process. This intransigent, head-in-the-sand approach will not alter the reality of climate change, nor the risks and opportunities it presents the economy. The private sector understands this.Many large businesses and their investors, recognizing the urgency of the threat, are already attempting to protect their assets and investments from climate risks. As some continue to publicly question the science, they are shifting their capital to prepare for a future low-carbon economy. They know that a significant percentage of the U.S. equity market, as much as 93 percent by one estimate, is already exposed to harms from climate change, with this year’s intensified fire and hurricane seasons offering a devastating preview of more to come.Both investors and the broader public need clear information about how businesses are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, and how they are managing — or not managing — climate risks internally.Realistically, that can happen only through mandatory public disclosure. A recent report, “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” by an advisory group to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, warned that “a world wracked by frequent and devastating shocks from climate change cannot sustain the fundamental conditions supporting our financial system.”The report emphasized that greater public disclosure of companies’ in-house risk calculations will be essential in helping governments (local and federal) as well as other businesses (large and small) measure and manage their climate risks.Financial regulators around the globe, from New Zealand to the European Union, are beginning to require that this information be made public. As the report notes, “existing legislation already provides U.S. financial regulators with wide-ranging and flexible authorities that could be used to start addressing financial climate-related risk now,” however, “these authorities and tools are not being fully utilized.”Indeed, some U.S. regulators have even blocked progress. That needs to change.A core purpose of the Securities and Exchange Commission, where I serve, is to develop and enforce disclosure requirements for public companies. rooted in the interests of investors and the public. Outdated thinking is stopping us from reducing climate risk through strengthening disclosure.One prominent outdated notion is that investments made on the basis of environmental, social and governance risks — known in the industry as E.S.G. — are merely about one’s policy preferences or moral choices. That might have been closer to reality over a decade ago, but as E.S.G. investing has grown and matured, so too has an understanding of its value.Today, lenders, credit rating agencies, analysts, stock exchanges and asset managers representing trillions in investments use E.S.G. as a significant driver in capital allocation, pricing and value assessments. A major study recently found that a large number of powerful institutional investors rank “climate risk disclosures” as being just as important in their decision-making processes as traditional financial statements and other metrics for an investment’s performance — like return on equity or earnings volatility.Researchers at the Bank of International Settlements have called climate change “a colossal and potentially irreversible risk of staggering complexity.” It is a systemic risks that will threaten global financial stability and spare no corner of the earth: Health, food security and water supplies across the globe will be disrupted.In the United States, we may experience the sort of climate-related migration that has begun elsewhere as Americans flee pockets of searing heat, seasonal fires, rising sea levels and flooding. Some of the worst-hit regions — the coasts, the West and the South — could experience damage totaling more than one-third of their economy, forcing the entire national economy to contract.Dealing with and adapting to the coming calamities means we must price climate risk accurately and drive investment toward an orderly, sustainable transition to green portfolios — rather than panicked scrambles and stock sell-offs as we see more and more climate disasters.The International Energy Agency estimates that globally it could take $3.5 trillion in energy sector investments alone every year through 2050 to reorient toward a climate-neutral economy. This pivot is not an ideological preference. It is an economic imperative. And it can effectively start only with accurate information.There is a misconception that securities laws already operate to produce enough climate risk information through existing broad requirements to disclose important or “material” information. If not, the argument goes, the S.E.C. will come after them.As a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer who spent over a decade spotting failed and misleading disclosures, I can attest that enforcement of broad-based materiality requirements does not work with this kind of near-magical efficiency.That’s why securities laws sometimes require very specific data and metrics on certain important matters like executive compensation. But, so far, not for climate risk. There are no specific requirements, and without that clarity how can companies be sure what is expected of them? As of now, there is little for us to enforce.The voluntary disclosure that companies have increasingly provided in recent years is still largely regarded as insufficient. It’s not standardized, it’s not consistent, it’s not comparable, and it’s not reliable. Voluntary disclosure is not getting the job done. And without better disclosure of climate risks, it’s not just investors who stand to lose, but the entire economy.We face an enormous task with a tight time frame and the highest of stakes — the livability of the planet. The S.E.C. can act now.We can bring companies, investors and innovators to the table, and build on the work of organizations such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures to identify which specific climate risks and metrics should be disclosed and how.That’s the only way to get investors and the broader public the tools they need to protect their investments, instill corporate accountability and create a sustainable economy.Allison Herren Lee is a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

12	4	"The report found climate change would cause increased risks to Auckland's electricity network, mainly from weather-related causes, and we should prepare now. Photo /  Mark Mitchell COMMENT:New Zealand has $200 billion of assets at risk from climate change and we're not doing enough to protect them. That's one reading of the last report from the Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group, appointed by the last Government to look at how New Zealand should  get  ready for climate change.And while consultation on the zero carbon bill has led to public debate around the merits of bundling methane emissions and other short-lived gases into the ""net zero by 2050"" target, the conversation about what it means to adapt the way we live to become more resilient, how much it costs, and who pays, hasn't even begun.As the company that provides electricity in Auckland, Vector has looked at those questions. We've sought to  assess the risks to those assets from the physical impacts of climate change through to 2050. We thought it was prudent given the life spans of our assets (concrete power poles can last 60 years).The research we commissioned considered climate change pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that correspond to rises in global surface temperatures of 2C, and more than 2C — the scenarios seen broadly as being ""most likely"".The research took these scenarios and modelled how they might change Auckland's sea level, the frequency and severity of wind and storms, change rain patterns and temperature extremes.The report, from EY, titled The Physical Risks from Climate Change — Report of Findings for Vector Limited (November 2017)*, looked at how the network would be impacted around Auckland either directly, with king tides and storm surges, combined with rising sea levels, causing a critical substation to be inundated during flooding; or indirectly — more frequent, strong winds bringing down more trees on to power lines.The report found climate change would cause increased risks to Auckland's electricity network, mainly from weather related causes, and we should prepare  now. That big April storm,   when  nearly a third of Auckland had no  power at one stage, was a classic example. Hurricane-force winds, in part  due  to climate change, blew thousands of trees and branches on to  lines all over Auckland.We have a  vegetation management programme  to manage the risk trees pose. But given the scale of destruction from the April  storm,   it's clear there's room for more understanding of the role lines companies, landowners and government must play in managing that risk.What Vector can do about trees is governed by 15-year-old regulations which also set out what private landowners should do. With extreme weather events expected to increase,  it's time to  decide who needs to do what, and the choices and trade-offs required to achieve different levels of resilience, especially given electricity's  increasing criticality  in a low-carbon world.The report provided  recommendations to mitigate the increased risks from climate change. Many are  well under way.Our approach involves maintenance and strengthening programmes covering  8000km of overhead lines and 10,000km of underground lines, managing  trees near  lines, and increasing the share of distributed generation, storage, and demand management across the network to improve the ability to absorb storm events.Technology is dramatically changing the way electricity is provided. If a storm hits and a tree knocks out a line on your street your power might not have to go off if there's an alternative  source nearby. This could be  a domestic solar and battery system, a community microgrid, or even an electric vehicle whose battery could  power your home.The research Vector commissioned was  a drop in the bucket of what's needed to get New Zealand prepared for the worst impacts of climate change.  Vector is also  looking past the physical effects of climate change and towards what economic adaptation might be needed in the  transition to zero carbon by 2050.* EY Disclaimer:  The report has been prepared for Vector. EY disclaims all liability in relation to any other party who seeks to rely upon the report or any of its contents.Kate Beddoe is Vector's chief risk officer."
232	5	"It might seem premature when people in the Caribbean, Florida and Texas are still mucking out their flooded homes.And no, changes in our planet's atmosphere did not cause Hurricanes Harvey or Irma. But the consensus among scientists is that the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and warmer oceans, made those storms far more destructive than they would have been in previous decades.""The short version is, climate change makes these very bad storms worse,"" said Sean Sublette, a meteorologist with Climate Central, a nonprofit group that studies climate change. ""It's not the proximate cause of the storm, but it makes these bad storms worse. And in the case of a really bad storm, climate change can make it totally disastrous or catastrophic.""The data on how our warming planet specifically impacted Harvey and Irma won't be known for quite some time. It can take months and even years to collect and analyze that information.  But the science is this: Hurricanes thrive over warm water and strengthen in intensity; oceans have warmed on an average 1 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and sea levels have risen about 7 inches during that time. Throw in compound flooding -- the combination of rising sea levels from global warming, storm surge and extreme rainfall -- and you have the perfect mix for record flooding.We saw this in greater Houston from Harvey and along the 240-mile stretch of the Atlantic coast from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina as a result of Irma's storm surge and heavy rains.Both storms were massive in scope. Harvey dumped a record 51 inches of rainfall as it sat over Texas and Louisiana, saturating the region with 27 trillion gallons of water in six days. Irma was the strongest Atlantic-basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, spending three days as a Category 5 hurricane, the longest Category 5 on record. Irma maintained winds of 185 mph or above for a total of 37 hours, the most ever for a storm. ""If this isn't climate change,"" Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado said as Irma bore down on Florida, ""I don't know what is.""'This brings it home'Last week, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said it would be ""insensitive"" to talk about global warming as Irma took aim at Florida. Other administration officials also refused to address the matter. When asked Thursday whether the recent hurricanes had changed his views on climate change, President Trump said, ""we've had bigger storms than this"" -- contradicting the hyperbolic language he had used to describe Irma days earlier as it neared Florida. In the past, Trump has said climate change is a hoax.But scientists said that talking climate change amid major storms is in their DNA. In August 2016, prolonged rainfall caused catastrophic and deadly flooding across southeastern Louisiana. A team of scientists studied the storm and determined within weeks that climate change had made it at least 40% more likely to occur. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month called it ""premature"" to conclude that human activities have had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane activity, although it added that global warming by the end of the century will probably make tropical storms more intense. Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, agreed that now is not the time to lecture hard-hit Florida and Texas residents about hurricane preparedness or how their energy consumption might impact the planet. But ""now is absolutely the time to be having this conversation"" about climate change's real-time effects, she said. ""The most dangerous myth that we have bought into as a society is not the myth that climate isn't changing or that humans aren't responsible,"" she said. ""It's the myth that 'It doesn't matter to me.' And that's why this is absolutely the time to be talking about the way climate change amplifies or exacerbates these natural events. This brings it home.""Sublette and Hayhoe said they are all too familiar with the arguments of climate-change deniers. People point to images of devastating hurricanes from the early 1900s as examples of how extreme weather has always been part of coastal living. Or they say things like, ""You can't even get a weekly forecast correct, let alone predict stuff happening decades from now."" But Hayhoe said people shouldn't cherry-pick scientific facts or think that their beliefs somehow trump reality.""You can say you don't believe in gravity, but if you step off a cliff, you're going down,"" she said. 'The public wants answers'Hayhoe and other climate scientists say it's important to emphasize their belief that climate change didn't cause Harvey and Irma. ""No scientist ever said that,"" Hayhoe said. ""What you will find is that we're basically saying the same thing, which is that climate change exacerbates those risks"" posed by the storms.For example, Tropical Storm Allison dumped more than 30 inches of rain over Texas in 2001, causing widespread flooding around Houston. But Harvey was an even bigger storm, fueled by warmer waters, than was Allison. As a result, it dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the region, causing massive flooding stretching more than 150 miles from Houston to Lake Charles, Louisiana.""Are Irma and Harvey affected by climate change? Absolutely,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller, who has studied global warming for more than a decade. ""But everything in the atmosphere now is impacted by the fact that it's warmer than it's ever been,"" Miller said. ""There's more water vapor in the atmosphere. The ocean is warmer. And all of that really only pushes the impact in one direction, and that is worse: higher surge in storms, higher rainfall in storms.""There's some debate among scientists as to whether future tropical storms will be stronger or more frequent. The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes have increased since the early 1980s, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, a periodic report by a team of more than 300 scientists and other experts. The 2014 report also found that the frequency of the strongest storms -- Category 4 and 5 hurricanes -- has increased in recent decades.But other scientists say the evidence is less conclusive. ""The historical Atlantic hurricane record does not provide compelling evidence for a substantial greenhouse warming-induced long-term increase (in storms),"" said Ryan Maue, a research meteorologist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In the future, most scientists say, there won't necessarily be more hurricanes -- just the potential for more hurricane-related flooding and destruction. ""More than 90% of the people doing the research are in very good agreement about what's going on,"" Sublette said. ""As we go forward in time, there's going to be a tendency for the hurricanes that do form to have heavier rain and, perhaps, stronger winds.""Asked whether it's appropriate to talk about climate change while hurricane victims are suffering, Sublette said, ""The public wants to know, the public has the right to know, and the public wants answers. I think it's up to us to give the most scientifically accurate information possible.""Hayhoe added, ""You can say, 'I don't believe in climate change,' but the planet is warming, humans are responsible, and the risks are becoming increasingly serious and even dangerous."""
514	3	"Climate change has become a factor in climbers' decisions about when to venture into the Southern Alps.While climbing in spring risks avalanches, climate change is - more frequently than in the past - presenting another obstacle for climbers who wait for summer.Owner of Wanaka guiding company Adventure Consultants, Guy Cotter, said yesterday this is the time of the year when climbing begins to ""ramp up"".""This whole November, early December period is a very popular time for climbing the big mountains here.""And one of the reasons, he said, is access.""With the snow left over from winter we have very good access around the glaciers and up the mountains.""But, he said, ""glacial recession"" meant some areas are not accessible from about New Year, because of crevasses opening up in glaciers ""a lot more quickly than what they used to"".""The crevasses open up because the snow melts that's covering them ... and filling them up.""That all ablates over the summer and we're down to the raw skeleton of the glacier with all of its crevasses.""So it really does make a very big difference in what you can access.""Cotter said Mt Hicks was one of those mountains where there was now an issue with access in summer and it was ""very rarely climbed"" for that reason.Climbing guides Martin Hess and Wolfgang Maier were killed on Mt Hicks yesterday - and adventurer Jo Morgan was lucky to survive - after an early morning avalanche.Cotter said the loss of snow was happening earlier than it did 30 years ago when he started climbing.""We could access most places all through the summer.""Now it's a lot more difficult to get to some of the mountains and get off.""For example, climbs like Aoraki-Mount Cook, we can't even go past New Year most of the time.""Cotter said regular snow falls protected the surface of the glacier by reflecting the sun.""But if we've got long, fine periods and lots of rain then that does deteriorate the snow very quickly, and we are not able to climb Aoraki-Mt Cook until the following October or November.""It's definitely part of climate change and the glaciers are definitely disappearing.""Anyone who's denying global warming is not a mountaineer because we can see it first hand.""Cotter said he knew the Mt Hicks area well and had climbed the mountain several times, but was not aware yesterday morning of where the avalanche occurred.""The south face of Mt Hicks is well known for technical climbing, so it's got some good solid routes on it that are at the high end of the technical spectrum.""It's definitely one of our steeper mountains."""
172	4	" Experts have warned that inaction on climate change has put the world on a ""suicidal"" path leading to an ""uninhabitable hell."" And President Donald Trump has done little to help matters. During his presidency, Trump has shown us the damage that comes from his misguided ideas about global warming and his bent toward a pro-polluter agenda. The Trump administration has moved to reverse more than 100 environmental safeguards and weakened our global standing by withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization. Now his administration wants to allow fossil fuel companies to drill in the Arctic national refuge, while refusing to tighten soot pollution standards in his 11th-hour attempt to deregulate and degrade environmental standards before he leaves office.   What's worse is that Trump has made these decisions despite record high temperatures, intense hurricanes and scorching wildfires, which are impacting millions of people, even as a deadly pandemic has led to both a public health and economic crisis.  The incoming Biden administration presents a new era in the fight against climate change. His team isn't just faced with the challenge of undoing the damage to our environment caused by the Trump administration over the past four years -- but it must also meet the rapidly worsening climate crisis with bold, historic climate action. Even before he enters the Oval Office, Biden has pledged that he will act on his climate mandate promptly. He has vowed to rejoin the Paris agreement and World Health Organization, prioritize climate action and restore the United States' reputation as the world's clean energy leader. His roster of senior economic advisers -- Janet Yellen, Neera Tanden, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey -- are climate champions who have proven their commitment to addressing climate change and will bring that perspective to their leadership roles as they advise the President on how to rebuild our economy in a sustainable fashion. During the event where Biden announced these appointments, Yellen even opined that we need ""to address the climate crisis with American ingenuity and American jobs."" Biden knows that building a clean energy economy and ensuring American workers have good green jobs is key to the fight against climate change. Putting these climate advocates in charge of our economic policies will ensure that the American economy is actually built back better and ready for the future by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, while investing in green infrastructure and clean energy jobs that pay workers a good wage. The historic appointment of former Secretary of State John Kerry as a special presidential envoy for climate is also critical because of his expertise and experience on the global stage. Biden has repeatedly emphasized that his administration's climate ambition will touch all aspects of government, including national security, public health, foreign relations, economic policy and racial justice. Kerry will be able to implement Biden's plans.  To meet these public health needs, Biden has picked Xavier Becerra to run the Department of Health and Human Services. As California Attorney General, Becerra created the first environmental justice bureau and successfully fought Trump's environmental rollbacks. Biden also named Vivek Murthy, a vocal advocate on the consequences of climate change for public health, to serve as Surgeon General.  Finally, Biden's announcement this week that he has nominated New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as Secretary of the Interior is historic, as she is the first Native American to hold the position and will spearhead efforts to protect land, air and water -- especially on tribal land that has long been exploited by the department -- from pollution. Biden has also named Michael Regan, who has significant experience with fighting pollution, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Regan is a smart pick to have at the forefront of prioritizing environmental justice and making Biden's bold climate agenda a reality. As Trump uses the final moments of his presidency to advocate an anti-environment agenda, Biden is setting the framework for his administration with a team of experts that will  focus on the whole picture -- including the role of climate change and environmental injustice -- as they engage the most pressing public health issues of our time."

""Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad."" Biden said the U.S. and Canada will launch a high-level climate ambition ministerial to align both countries’ policies and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.Trudeau said the top priority for the U.S. and Canada remains keeping people safe and ending the pandemic.The Canadian leader also said he and Biden are on the ""same page when it comes to standing up for the middle class"" and discussed leveraging supply chains and supporting businesses to create good, well-paying jobs to help people get back on their feet.Biden noted that his first call to a foreign leader as president was made to Trudeau.In his very first days in office, Biden revoked a key cross-border permit that effectively halted construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline, which Trudeau said at the time ""disappointed"" his administration.The project was expected to move oil from Canada to regions in the U.S."
662	4	"The Antarctic Peninsula has been cooling over the past 15 years, but experts say it doesn't mean climate change is a myth.It's the opposite of what's happening in the rest of the world. Ice in the Arctic is retreating fast, and we're cracking temperature records on a monthly basis.But after decades of warming, measurements taken on the Antarctic Peninsula - the continent's most northern part - have recorded cooling.The study, published in Nature, says it's a result of ""natural variability"" in the climate.Despite the cooling, temperatures in Antarctica are still warmer than in the middle of the 20th century, so the ice is still melting and glaciers are continuing to retreat.The team behind the says their findings only cover about 1 percent of the continent, so it's only accurate for that particular area, not the whole of Antarctica.The study's authors are careful to say it's a localised pause in global warming, rather than a reversal. And experts around the world agree, warning climate change deniers not to get too excited.""While some sceptics may see this paper as an apparent 'debunking', the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made it clear... unlike the Arctic, overall Antarctica had not warmed any faster than the global average temperature increase since the mid-20th century,"" says Antarctic Research Centre director Professor Tim Naish.""It also noted that during past warmer-than-present climates, when carbon dioxide levels reached 400 parts per million or more, Antarctica did display an amplified warming pattern up to two times more than the global average.""Australian National University's Nerilie Abram says the paper ""definitely"" doesn't imply global warming has stopped, but instead highlights how yearly variability has an impact on long-term trends.""For a remote place like Antarctica, where climate measurements are especially short and those year-to-year swings in climate are very large, our records really aren't long enough yet to see the full picture of human-caused climate change.""Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, says it's unsurprising that there's some data that ""buck[s] the trend"".But the warming of the air isn't the biggest threat the ice faces.""The real threat is ocean warming, which has triggered widespread loss of ice just around the corner in West Antarctica,"" Prof Shepherd says.""And we should not lose sight of that because there are early signs in the satellite record of similar effects at the peninsula too."""
403	4	Paul J. Crutzen, a Dutch scientist who earned a Nobel Prize for work that warned the world about the threat of chemicals to the planet’s ozone layer and who went on to push for action against global warming, died on Jan. 28 in Mainz, Germany. He was 87.The Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz announced the death, in a hospital, but did not state the cause. Susanne Benner, a spokeswoman for the institute, said Dr. Crutzen had been treated for Parkinson’s disease.Martin Stratmann, the president of the Max Planck Society, said in a statement that Dr. Crutzen’s work had led to the ban on ozone-depleting chemicals, “a hitherto unique example of how Nobel Prize-winning basic research can directly lead to a global political decision.”Dr. Crutzen popularized the term “Anthropocene” to describe Earth’s current geological era. The name, which he proposed in 2000 but which others had brought up in the same or slightly different spelling, suggests that we now live on a planet shaped by humanity.The term “continues to teach us that our collective human activities are now the most powerful geological force on Earth,” Al Gore, the climate activist and former vice president, said by email, “and his life’s work continues to inspire us to take responsibility for how that force affects our planet’s ecological integrity.”Dr. Crutzen shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina. He found in 1970 that certain chemicals could break down ozone, a molecule that, high up in the stratosphere, absorbs dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Four years later, Dr. Rowland and Dr. Molina were able to show that gases known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, could break down in the upper atmosphere and attack the ozone layer.After years of skepticism and pushback from industry, British scientists in 1985 discovered a hole in the ozone layer, leading to the landmark international treaty known as the 1987 Montreal Protocol and a ban on production of CFCs. (Those chemicals would later be shown to contribute powerfully to global warming, and the ban kept climate change from being even worse than it is today.)The 1995 Nobel citation said the three scientists had “contributed to our salvation from a global environmental problem that could have catastrophic consequences.”The New York Times wrote in 1995 that Dr. Crutzen was “known among his colleagues as a nonconformist who shows up in an open shirt and sandals at conferences where everyone else is in formal attire.”“Instead of delivering formal papers at scientific meetings,” the Times article continued, “he fumbles a few handwritten notes, then ends up mesmerizing his audiences.”Paul Jozef Crutzen was born on Dec. 3, 1933, in Amsterdam to Jozef and Anna (Gurk) Crutzen. His father was a waiter, and his mother worked in the kitchen of a hospital.In an autobiographical essay on the Nobel website, Dr. Crutzen recalled profound privation during the Nazi occupation and the “hongerwinter,” or winter of famine, in 1944-45. “Many died of hunger and disease,” he wrote, “including several of my schoolmates.”His path to atmospheric chemistry was indirect; he first set out, in 1951, to train as a civil engineer in a three-year program at a technical school so that he could save his parents the expense of college programs that might take four years or more. His father, he said, was frequently unemployed.From 1954 until 1958, in addition to serving in the military, Dr. Crutzen worked in Amsterdam’s bridge construction bureau. During that time, as he recalled, he also met “a sweet girl,” Terttu Soininen.“A few years later I was able to entice her to marry me,” he wrote. “What a great choice I made!”His wife survives him, as do their two daughters, Sylvia and Ilona Crutzen, and three grandchildren.In 1958, Dr. Crutzen saw an advertisement in a Swedish newspaper for a job programming computers in the department of meteorology at what is now Stockholm University. “Although I had not the slightest experience in this subject,” he wrote, “I applied for the job and had the great luck to be chosen from among many candidates.”At the meteorology institute, he began studies that would lead to his receiving, in 1963, the equivalent of a master of science degree that combined mathematics, statistics and meteorology. That was followed by a Ph.D. in meteorology in 1968 and a doctorate of philosophy, the most advanced degree in the Swedish system, in 1973.In choosing a specific topic of research, he said, “I picked stratospheric ozone as my subject, without the slightest anticipation of what lay ahead.”He later served as director of research at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., from 1977 to 1980, and at the Max Planck Institute from 1980 until 2000.In a 2002 article in the journal Nature, Dr. Crutzen wrote of the increasing threat of climate change. A “daunting task,” he said, “lies ahead for scientists and engineers to guide society towards environmentally sustainable management during the era of the Anthropocene.” In that essay and elsewhere, he raised the prospect of employing geoengineering, the field that looks for ways to combat climate change through interventions like spreading sulfur in the atmosphere to help cool the planet. The idea of geoengineering remains controversial, not only because of potential unanticipated side effects, but also because of the suspicion that the technologies could be used to postpone action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Later, in an interview for a 2014 virtual exhibition on the Anthropocene, Dr. Crutzen said, “I share that fear,” adding that using the technology to avoid acting on emissions “would be totally wrong,” and that he doubted it would ever be used.In that same interview, the journalist Christian Schwägerl asked, “Have you remained an optimist?”Dr. Crutzen replied, “Did I say I am an optimist?”Mr. Schwägerl then asked what made him feel optimistic, and the reply was less curt. There were the “beautiful things around us like arts and literature,” Dr. Crutzen said. “There are so many beautiful things humankind is creating that I wonder when we will make Earth more beautiful again instead of depleting everything.”

If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see. No actual proof, as it is understood in science, exists.’Heated debate: Patrick Moore, pictured here giving a speech in Montreal, has claimed that there's no scientific evidence for man-made global warming Moore pointed out that there was an Ice Age 450million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higher.He said: ‘There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.’Even if the earth does warm up, Moore claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life, as ‘humans are a tropical species’.Patrick Moore pictured talking about nuclear power in Augusta, Georgia, in 2011 in Mayor Copenhaver's officeThe largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes, according to the Florida State study  'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see. No actual proof, as it is understood in science, exists.'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” (My emphasis)“Extremely likely” is not a scientific term but rather a judgment, as in a court of law. The IPCC defines “extremely likely” as a “95-100% probability”. 'But upon further examination it is clear that these numbers are not the result of any mathematical calculation or statistical analysis. They have been “invented” as a construct within the IPCC report to express “expert judgment”, as determined by the IPCC contributors.'When modern life evolved over 500 million years ago, CO2 was more than 10 times higher than today, yet life flourished at this time. Then an Ice Age occurred 450 million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higherthan today. 'There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.'Today, we live in an unusually cold period in the history of life on earth and there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species. There is ample reason to believe that a sharp cooling of the climate would bring disastrous results for human civilization.'The IPCC states that humans are the dominant cause of warming “since the mid-20th century”, which is 1950. From 1910 to 1940 there was an increase in global average temperature of 0.5C over that 30-year period. Then there was a 30-year “pause” until 1970.'This was followed by an increase of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This in itself tends to negate the validity of the computer models, as CO2 emissions have continued to accelerate during this time.'The increase in temperature between 1910-1940 was virtually identical to the increase between 1970-2000. Yet the IPCC does not attribute the increase from 1910-1940 to “human influence.”'He said: ‘It is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today’s would be far better than a cooler one.’Humans, he added, just aren’t capable of predicting global temperature changes.Moore said that he left Greenpeace because it ‘took a sharp turn to the political left’.Dr Doug Parr, Chief Scientist at Greenpeace UK, told MailOnline: 'On climate science, Greenpeace accepts the consensus view put forward by 97 per cent of climate scientists, every national and international scientific institute and every government in the world – climate change is happening, it’s caused mainly by human activity, and it’s highly dangerous for the future well-being of people on this planet.'Moore has made several other assertions over the years that have been at odds with Greenpeace's views. He has advocated logging, claiming it actually causes reforestation, and attacked campaigners for fear-mongering over nuclear energy.His latest comments came as two of the world’s leading scientific organisations warned that man-made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society.The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society, which is the national scientific academy of the United Kingdom, are releasing an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues in a question-and-answer format. ‘People do have persistent questions all about climate change,’ said study author Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California. ‘This is a one-stop shop for many of those questions.’ The report, released on Thursday, addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat-trapping gases are connected to extreme weather. Increases in extreme weather, melting glaciers, rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening, the 36-page report said. And those changes ‘are expected to increase greater warming and will threaten food production, freshwater supplies, coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge population currently living in low-lying areas,’ the report said. The report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than it was in the 1990s it doesn't negate the 150 years of observations that show the world is warming. The report also says that more the 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans' deep water, which for a while slows surface warming but not the long-term trend. There is enough evidence on the science to warrant action, Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, said in a news release.

868	4	Discussions of a Green New Deal (GND) have been all the rage these days, as hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets around the world to demand action on climate change.First proposed in 2008 to initiate a comprehensive action plan to combat climate change in the UK, the Green New Deal (GND) has come to global attention, gaining particular traction in North America.Its vision goes beyond the “green,” “hip,” “vegan,” and “mindful” lifestyle choices of a burgeoning elite social class or the tried and failed policies of carbon-offsetting, cap and trade, and sustainable development of green capitalism. It proposes definitive steps to help combat impending climate crises and to give the younger generation hope in the face of rapidly accelerating socio-ecological breakdown and unprecedented inequality.It puts forward a plan to shift the economy away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy; to eliminate polluting practices in industrial production; to provide affordable housing for all, free education and health care; to create jobs with dignified working conditions and security, and to promote racial, gender and socio-economic equity and justice.But for the GND to work and, indeed, transform the economy and our lives, it must be decolonial. This means, its application must go hand in hand with a concerted effort to rethink relationships to land, labour, and our collective imaginaries from the structural and historic injustices of Western-style development.The understanding that development policies and ideas rooted in European and North American notions of “progress” are destructive and exploitative by their nature must be at the heart of the GND. In seeking to build a new economy and another way of relating to the environment around us, we must heed the advice of indigenous people, in their historical and ongoing demands for cultural autonomy and self-determination, on the need to restore a diversity of relationships with our environment.The GND is meant to halt the loss of biodiversity, the degradation of soils, water, and rapidly decelerate global warming to pre-empt further the catastrophic impacts of climate change that a failure to stay below two degrees of warming will bring.To achieve all these things, however, technological fixes, such as carbon capture and storage, bound to market economy forces cannot be the solution. The relationships we must develop with our living environment cannot depend on policies regulated by costly, unpredictable and market-driven accounting metrics, which defy the speed and severity of the social and climate shifts we are experiencing.While all efforts to put the “emergency brake” on ecological degradation are needed, we must recognise the roots of how today’s custodianship and caretaking of land and waters was established and how it is linked to Western notions of development.Our development trajectory has been marred by the idea that humans are the overlords of the world, who have to tame nature and submit it to exploitation for their exclusive benefit. It implies that human civilisation is somehow separate from nature, whose only role is to provide unlimited resources to feed and expand the human material world.The separation between humanity and nature is also implied in how environmentalism has been approached in Western societies. It implies that environmental degradation is merely a symptom of bad management in an otherwise non-negotiable economic development model. The arrogance of this logic is deeply embedded in the mechanisms adopted by the international community to respond to social and ecological crises, including its sustainability policies.As long as we erroneously see ourselves as outside and above the rest of the living world, we will continue to contribute to its destruction. A decolonial GND, therefore, requires repositioning ourselves vis-à-vis nature as an integral part of it – just as many indigenous peoples have consistently sought to do in their historical and ongoing struggle for cultural autonomy and self-determination.GND policies must not simply aim to rectify harmful human activity that destroys biodiversity, soil fertility, and greenhouse gas pollution but engender a completely different approach to producing food, building human settlements and meeting human needs.Under a decolonial GND, agricultural practices, for example, will have to be completely overhauled. Mass production and distribution will have to be phased out, as should the current practices of optimising yields through monoculture farming. Instead, transitions are required that focus on regenerative agricultural practices to return nutrients to soils; encourage and recognise knowledge passed down between generations farming the land; ensure healthy non-GMO food production that is affordable to all; and rebuild relationships between producers and consumers.The GND must also adopt a completely different approach to the human economy. First, it must recognise that the crises produced by capitalism cannot be solved by capitalism itself. Capitalism, much like the burning of fossil fuels which feeds it, should rather be phased out and replaced with a diversity of decentralised solidarity economies that put social justice and both individual and collective welfare at the core of their mission.A GND can therefore only be “new” if it is premised upon a commitment to limiting and redistributing wealth, is oriented towards understanding well-being as sufficiency rather than ceaseless desires and ensures that the means of production are re-localised to transfer decision-making power to communities at the frontlines of resource extraction.Second, any GND for the Global North must embrace degrowth, which means scaling down overall material consumption and energy use rather than simply making them more efficient, which would still expand growth and enable further extraction. It also means moving society away from wealth accumulation and expansion as a goal in itself and towards wealth distribution and social justice.In this sense, changing one’s lifestyle choices – buying “green” and eating vegan or organic food – is not a solution to environmental and social justice problems. Rather people require support systems to radically alter the way they live and consume. These support systems might involve fostering conditions of solidarity, connection, and joy that are otherwise sapped from the individuality of materialism masquerading as “happiness”. Doing so means that learning to live with what is enough to provide for basic needs and good health should not be seen as a sacrifice, but as something to gain. This is the first step to building a society for everyone, radically different than the one we have now that favours the pursuit of self-enrichment and indulgence.Third, the GND must also create the conditions for poorer countries to develop according to their own democratically chosen development path. For that to happen, degrowth policies have to be coupled with decolonisation of the global economy. Although the age of colonialism is supposedly over, colonial dynamics still very much dominate relations between the “developed” and the “developing” and determine hegemonic patterns of production and consumption.If the GND does not address the uneven patterns of where production and consumption take place then it threatens to derail “green” or energy-efficient transformations in the global South. For example, if the shift to renewable energy is carried out without a parallel decolonisation of trade relations, then countries like Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, rich in coltan, lithium, antimony, nickel and other materials used in green technologies, would still face the dangers of extractivism.Even if measures are taken to ensure that renewable energy production does not contaminate and deplete water, destroy habitats, and displace communities – hardly likely in any economic model predicated on optimising outcomes while minimising costs – unequal economic relations would doom these countries to a new form of domination known as “green colonialism“.A decolonial GND must therefore prioritise restructuring global trade relations and reversing the enormous imbalances of cultural, economic and political power between Western governments and the global South.When the prefixes of “green” and “new” are removed, we are left with “deal”. This requires understanding what the current “deal” is and why it must be fundamentally restructured.Apart from embracing workers’ rights and progressive social policies, a decolonial GND must also actively interrogate the racial, gender and class supremacies which have ruled the world and extracted wealth for the benefit of a privileged minority for centuries.This is because, the ongoing and increasingly dire ecological collapse is very much the result of a perverse “social contract” in which patriarchy, capitalism and white supremacy shape human behaviour.We live in a world where black, brown, feminine, queer and working-class bodies have faced unthinkable acts of violent dehumanisation under the banner of contemporary Western development.This way of making and shaping the world and its inhabitants has not gone away with the introduction of symbolic laws forbidding discrimination. It remains fundamental to the socio-economic relations which dominate our lives and which tie ecological destruction and racialised cheap labour to the maintenance of uneven relations of trade across the world.Take historical plantations as an example. The production of commodities like sugar and cotton involved both the brutal enslavement of people and the ruthless abuse of the environment, which led to severe deforestation, soil erosion and habitat destruction. The goods extracted through violent exploitation of both humans and nature were then sold for the benefit of wealthy white settler colonialists.This plantation model has not fundamentally changed since slavery was officially abolished. It has rather become more sophisticated with the liberalisation of the economy and the advent of digital technology which today ensures greater predictability and control in yields, labour hours and profits. Today, agriculture and other sectors around the world are still dependent on a largely racialised and marginalised labour force, coerced in myriad ways to accept harsh working conditions. And again the outcomes are the same: destruction of the environment and ever-burgeoning profit for a select few.A decolonial GND must break the bonds of the plantation model of social relations by introducing a new “social contract” rooted in ethical and political commitment to social, racial and gender justice. It must seek to establish a completely new set of rules for socio-economic relations in our society – one based on acceptance, respect for human life and dignity, solidarity, and equity.Under a decolonial GND, temporary, underpaid employment will be discontinued. Job creation will be generated by the economic transformation away from fossil fuels and overexploitation of resources and towards worker-owned renewable energy and the relocalisation of industry that puts collective interests over individual ones.Jobs will have to pay enough for the employee to sustain a dignified life; they will have to provide social security and desirable working conditions that are free of abuse and discrimination and stimulate creativity.Worker-owned cooperatives could be one model to follow to create jobs and provide various community services, from health care and child care to recycling and security. However, this will only work if cooperatives are themselves embedded in globally decolonised economies geared towards responsible relations between people and the land.A decolonial GND must also recognise and seek to compensate for the ills that centuries of racial, gender and social oppression have produced. It must, therefore, pay special attention to historically marginalised groups and indigenous communities dispossessed of their lands and ways of knowing and being. As part of this transformation, it should also make provisions for reparations for colonial injustices.Thus, I suggest three organising principles for a decolonial GND: 1) “Going green” must rethink and experiment in alternative human relationships to each other and to non-humans, rooted in reciprocity and responsibility. 2) The world economy must be reoriented towards principles of degrowth, decolonisation and relocalisation 3) The unequal power relations underlying the “social contract” of Western development models must be democratised to eliminate discrimination and racial supremacy in all its forms.For a GND to work however, it cannot be limited to discussions and action within the borders of a single country or region. The dehumanising and ecologically destructive forces of capitalism have proven to adhere to no borders, so any response strategies under a GND must have a global scope.A GND requires collective commitment to resist oppressive forces that are literally waging a war against a good life for all. This means political resistance and action in the streets, each in their own way responding to the induced austerity policies of state and market that together reinforce the “social contract” responsible for ecological collapse.At the same time, “decolonial” cannot be another prefix to tack on along with “green” and “new” to make a status-quo development “deal” appear more inclusive. It must recognise both the global power of Western development models in organising people and nature in violent ways, but also more regional and historically-specific variants. These may include the subjugation of people and their relationships to the land in places like Kashmir or West Papua and the rising demonisation of indigenous worldviews in Brazil and Bolivia.A decolonial GND requires constant learning, building mutual consent and trust, and self-reflection of the embedded thought processes and habitus patterns that we all hold in contributing to such oppression, whether we realise it or not.We have reached a point of no return and we must realise that there is no saviour and no quick-fix solution for the climate catastrophe we currently face. While the “mess” we are in was not created by all of humanity equally (and we must recognise this!), it is a “mess” of such proportions that we need committed and unconditional solidarity to get ourselves out of it.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.
720	5	The government’s 2050 target date of reducing the UK’s net carbon emissions to zero is “too far away”, Boris Johnson’s climate change spokesperson Allegra Stratton has said.Ms Stratton said that the science was clear that faster action is needed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in order to stop global temperature increases by 2030.Her comments are likely to alarm backbench Conservative MPs who fear that voters are being asked to shoulder too great a financial burden to give the UK a world-leading role in the fight against climate change.The UK was the first major industrialised country in the world to sign the 2050 target into law in 2019, and is aiming to persuade other nations to follow suit at the COP26 summit which Mr Johnson is chairing in November.But Ms Stratton stressed that the plan envisaged immediate action, with interim targets of 68 per cent reductions by 2030 and 78 per cent by 2035 to put the UK on a “glide path” to net zero.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend, Ms Stratton said that the technology needed to reduce emissions was becoming cheaper all the time, making the net zero target no more expensive than the previous 80 per cent target, at about 1 per cent of GDP.And she made clear that urgency was needed to meet the COP26 target of keeping global warming to a maximum of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.“We have to feel the fierce urgency of now,” she said. “I feel the fierce urgency of now. We have to bring countries to COP26 in November in Glasgow with real substantial plans.”Ms Stratton, who speaks on COP26 on the prime minister’s behalf, pointed to the government’s 10-point plan for a “green industrial revolution” and to pledges from FTSE100 companies to go net-zero as signs of progress towards the 2050 goal.But she added: “Every bit of society is moving in tandem towards this net zero in 2050, but let’s be honest that’s too far away.“Net zero is the glide path. What we have to be doing more quickly – the science is clear – [is] we have to be changing our carbon emissions output right now, so that we can stop temperature increase by 2030.”Amid growing concerns that the UK is lagging behind in its drive to secure international agreement on ambitious targets, Ms Stratton acknowledged that progress had been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.But she said that plans will be unveiled when parliament returns in September for projects like the replacement of gas boilers with more climate-friendly alternatives over the coming decade.Ms Stratton admitted that ministers had to overcome distrust from voters in light of fast-changing advice on issues like diesel cars – which were promoted as environmentally friendly for many years before the harmful effects of their exhaust became known.“My granny says to me ‘Why would we believe government when look what they encouraged us to buy and how quickly they changed their opinion?’” she said.“But that only underscores the reason why this has to be done properly so we take people with us because it would be so damaging to have another version of that.”She said that the government had a “balancing act” between moving swiftly enough to respond to the scale of the challenge and taking enough time to ensure that new technology like electric cars works as it should.“This is a long-term journey we are all on,” she said. “This is a journey to 2050.“This is not going to happen overnight. This is going to be a conversation we have with the British people about what is fair, protecting vulnerable families from some of the more difficult decisions they will have to make.”Ms Stratton declined to discuss reports that chancellor Rishi Sunak is holding out against green taxes to pay for action on climate change.“What worries me and what worries members of the government is the extreme climate change and weather events that we are seeing in this country now,” she said.“The climate has warmed by 1.2 degrees. We are trying to limit that increase to 1.5. Everyone can see that the margin we have right now is not big. We are headed for 3. If we think about the weather we’re seeing right now at 1.2, what the weather be like at 3 doesn’t bear thinking about.”
315	5	"Though separated by nearly 1,000 miles, these two extreme weather incidents are examples of the same phenomenon: human-caused climate change supercharging extreme rainfall events. And these types of extreme rainfall events are likely to become more common, too, as long as the planet continues to get hotter.The reason is based on a physics principle known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, which relates temperature, pressure and water vapor. The principle shows that warmer air can hold more water vapor -- about 7% more water vapor per 1 degree Celsius. More water vapor in the atmosphere means more moisture available to fall as rain, which leads to higher rainfall rates.On average, the planet has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times, according to a major UN climate change report published earlier this month. Over land areas there has been even more warming, and particularly in the Eastern US, which has led to a noticeable increase in heavy downpours that lead to flash flooding, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment.This dynamic played out in Tennessee this weekend as more than 17 inches of rain fell in just 24 hours around McEwen and Centerville -- a third of the region's typical annual rainfall -- which would set a record in the state of Tennessee once made official.Krissy Hurley, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told CNN that one of the biggest factors contributing to this amount of rain was that the atmosphere had ample moisture to work with. When meteorologists launched a weather balloon over the weekend to collect data, they found the moisture in the air was at record levels -- a ""recipe for disaster,"" according to Hurley.The flooding was caused by several storms that developed one after the other over the same area, which took advantage of that moisture and led to extreme rainfall rates.""We had a stationary boundary set up over western part of middle Tennessee that provided the perfect set up conditions,"" said Mark Rose, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ""A constant training of [storms] over that one area for several hours right along that boundary.""Meanwhile, in New York City on Saturday night, residents saw extreme rainfall rates unmatched in the city's history.Heavy rainbands associated with the leading edge of then-Hurricane Henri resulted in a torrential downpour in New York City. Between 10 and 11 p.m., 1.94 inches of rain fell in Central Park, setting the all-time record there for the largest amount of rain in a single hour, according to the National Weather Service.In total, 4.45 inches of rain fell in the city on Saturday night, also setting a record for the date -- the old record of 4.19 inches had stood since 1888.Hurricanes are essentially massive engines of wind and rain that are fueled by warm ocean water and air. Over the last two-plus centuries, human activity -- mainly the burning of fossil fuels -- has added lots of heat to the oceans and air where hurricanes are spawned.These extreme rainfall rates are becoming more common because of human-caused global warming, scientists say. According to the UN's report on climate change, ""the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area.""Deadly flash floods have made headlines around the world this summer, including in Western Europe in July. In that incident, several months-worth of rain fell in hours, turning city streets in Belgium and Germany into torrents of water that pushed cars and debris into homes and businesses and killed hundreds of people.Heavy rainfall also caused floods in Central China last month that led to over 300 deaths. Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of 12 million people, was one of the hardest hit areas, with entire neighborhoods submerged and passengers trapped in flooded subway cars."
44	4	"People are planting more trees, thinking carefully about coastal development, and anticipating the future of California's wineries.In March of this year, a Gallup poll highlighted an interesting tension in American thinking on global warming: While a majority of respondents said they believe global warming has already begun, a majority also said they don’t expect to suffer any hardships from global warming within their lifetimes. What the survey didn’t ask was how many people across the country are already reacting to rising temperatures—and preparing for those ahead.This past summer, twenty-somethings Allie Goldstein and Kirsten Howard took a road trip to document stories of what they call “climate resilience” – examples of individuals and communities finding creative ways to adapt to hotter summers, stronger storms, bigger wildfires, rising sea levels, and more. They visited 31 states and offset their minivan’s carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from Terrapass. Whether learning about Ann Arbor, Michigan’s newly structured stormwater utility or evaluating the use of public art to mark evacuation routes in New Orleans, Goldstein and Howard found these examples everywhere they looked — suggesting that perhaps the rest of us don’t have to travel far at all to witness similar initiatives being implemented.In some places, climate change is an explicit factor driving a city’s action; such is the case in Baltimore, Maryland, which has a Climate Action Plan and a recently appointed “Hazard Mitigation and Adaptation Planner” who is trying to build more tree canopy in the city’s neighborhoods so that residents may benefit from increased shade during heat waves. In addition to combating the “urban heat island effect” (increased canopy can cool the city by up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit), planting more trees has a host of other benefits: increasing property values and decreasing crime, according to Goldstein. These “co-benefits” were observed all around the country, Goldstein says, pointing out that sometimes “responding to climate change” is a co-benefit in itself, tertiary to the main goal of attracting tourists or reducing crime.“When we started this trip,” says Goldstein, “someone told us we wouldn’t find anyone to talk to about climate change in the south.” That prediction proved false.  “There are definitely people who are still skeptical of the science or don’t really believe that the impacts of climate change will come to their community in particular, but in general we found that this kind of politicized, black and white, ‘believe or don’t believe’ thing that’s presented in the news a lot is really a lot more nuanced than that.”On the coast of North Carolina, they met Tom Thompson, the Chairman of the Board of NC-20, a conservative organization that Stephen Colbert poked fun at in 2012. Thompson may be “skeptical” of projections of a 39-inch sea-level rise in his area, but his objection to the plans to prepare for it — elevating homes, raising flood insurance rates – has more to do with his concerns about impoverishing the community, Goldstein and Howard write on their blog. “My view of the world,” he tells them, ""is as someone who has seen a lot of poverty … I just love this area and I want to protect it.”Goldstein and Howard have also talked to Colorado fruit growers who are adapting to fluctuations in temperature without necessarily agreeing on the cause of the changes. “The farmers we spoke with, for the most part,” they write, “aren’t attributing the longer growing season to climate change.” The farmers view fluctuating weather patterns as normal. But in response to the latest variations, they are diversifying their harvests in anticipation of losing some crops each season, and using wind machines to nudge the air temperatures in the fields by half degrees to prevent freezing.Howard tells me she was “amazed by the number of places where at the municipal level they had some sort of effort to actually identify their climate variability and predict what the local impact to their communities would be.” The great takeaway from this project, she says, seems to be that “people are really in touch with ‘their place.’” Even if they aren’t concerned about climate change on a global scale or they think it doesn’t affect them, “once you get down to talking about their neighborhoods, their cities, they know so much… and are, in a lot of cases, working really hard to make it the best place to live.”Changing attitudes toward climate change on a larger scale were evident at the 7 national parks Goldstein and Howard visited. At Montana’s Glacier National Park, for example, more and more tourists are attracted precisely because of scientific estimates that the park’s glaciers will be gone by 2030. In addition, learning about glacial retreat is now an integral part of the visitor experience at GNP. On their blog, Goldstein and Howard quote a National Park Service staff member who gives weekly presentations titled “Where Have All the Glaciers Gone?” and said: “At first, [the Park Service’s] attitude was, ‘people are on vacation, don’t upset them by talking about global warming.’ Now, we have a mandate to talk about it.”Besides communicating more explicitly about the effects of global warming, Park Service staff are also initiating ecological interventions – “perhaps a little more heavy-handedly than they have in the past,” Goldstein and Howard write. In 2003, the Park Service deliberately directed a forest fire away from the region’s huckleberries, which bears eat; to prevent invasive species from reaching the park’s Quartz Lake, they constructed a barrier in Quartz Creek.It’s a similar story at Joshua Tree National Park in California, where, like Montana’s glaciers, Joshua Trees are disappearing. Park Service specialists are trying to better understand the factors determining survival and death of the trees, and they’re also weighing some drastic interventions to preserve the tree population, such as manually relocating trees to areas with “future favorable climates.”It would be a shame for these parks to lose their namesakes, but Goldstein and Howard’s observations across America suggest that cities and towns may be better poised to adapt to climate change than wilderness areas are. The stories from the cities seem hopeful; the dispatches from Glacier and Joshua Tree, less so. Perhaps that is because existential threats – changes that would alter the defining characteristics of a place – are more difficult to contemplate before they occur. Who would have thought, ten or twenty or fifty years ago, that a glacier-less Glacier National Park was possible?In Napa Valley, though, exactly that kind of forethought is taking place. The region is well-known as wine country. Local vintners, write Goldstein and Howard, formed a climate task force in 2006 to meticulously track temperature changes and develop strategies to manipulate microclimates in the vineyards. They installed weather stations in the vineyards, sifted through farmers’ harvest logs from past decades, and are even testing solar-powered sensors on their vines to monitor plant hydration day by day. What they have found is, so far, a much slower progression in temperatures in Napa Valley than has been measured elsewhere, allowing growers to put scientists’ projections into context, and gauge when it might be time to start switching cultivars. They’re doing their homework, in other words, and providing a standout example of what it takes to stay ahead of existential threats — climate change may mean the end of glaciers, but it won’t, hopefully, mean the end of California wine.We want to hear what you think about this article.

480	3	Hundreds of climate change experts have urged Theresa May to confront Donald Trump over his approach to the emergency during his state visit.As the US president arrived in the UK, the letter signed by 250 scientists and other academics states his “refusal” to tackle global warming is “increasing risks for lives and livelihoods” worldwide.The experts from UK universities and research bodies praise the UK’s international role in tackling climate change but say Mr Trump’s visit is incompatible with it while he is undermining US and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.It reads: “The president’s refusal to tackle climate change, and particularly his initiation of the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, is increasing risks for lives and livelihoods in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.”They urge the prime minister to tell Mr Trump to accept the scientific evidence of the threat of man-made climate change; support policies in the US to reduce greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and collaborate with international efforts to combat climate change.The president has previously called climate chaos a “Chinese hoax” and “b******t”.He has been a strong supporter of fossil fuel industries, reversing environmental regulations on oil, gas and coal.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereAfter his own administration last year published a report on the dire effects of climate change compiled by 13 federal agencies, he said he did not believe it. Then six months ago, his administration held an event promoting the use of fossil fuels at a major UN climate summit. Scientists on the IPCC have warned the world has just 12 years left to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C, beyond which they would rise exponentially, causing irreversible disaster.The Paris deal aims to limit rises to 2C, and to strive for 1.5C if possible.Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, who coordinated the letter, said: “President Trump’s refusal to accept and address global climate change is putting at risk lives and livelihoods of current and future generations in the UK.“The state visit is an opportunity for the prime minister to challenge the president’s reckless approach and advance the UK’s reputation as an international leader on climate change before she steps down as prime minister.“The special relationship between the UK and USA is meaningless if the government does not use it to confront the actions of a president that are a threat to UK citizens.”Additonal reporting by the Press Association
30	0	"Wellington issues reporter, NZ HeraldWellington apartment owner Michael Cummins is facing a $400,000 earthquake strengthening bill effectively ""wiping out"" his retirement plan.His situation is echoed across the capital as hundreds face sleepless nights, losing their home, and are on the brink of ""financial disaster"".They live in buildings that have been deemed earthquake prone, meaning they have a rating of less than 34 per cent of the New Building Standard.Many owners in Wellington have just seven and a half years to get their buildings strengthened because they're on main thoroughfares and in a high-risk seismic area.Those in multi-owned residential apartment buildings say the legislation is being used as a ""blunt instrument"".Owners are over-capitalising their homes, using tax-paid income and savings to comply, and say they're funding public safety outcomes even though their buildings are not used by the public.Many simply can't afford the bill and want more help than what they see as an exclusive loan scheme from the Government.In 2010 the estimated cost to strengthen the entire building where Cummins lives at 80 Kent Terrace was $600,000, making the average cost to each apartment owner about $40,000.But an engineer advised the body corporate to hold off, as incoming legislation would result in the standards changing.That legislation, combined with the failed Basin Reserve flyover bid and Former Hawkins Group companies going bust, held up the project for years.By the time owners received a costing for a detailed design last year, the bill for strengthening the building had risen to about $4m. Add to that things such as deferred maintenance, and the final bill is about $6m.The building, after strengthening, would be worth only about $13m.""It just doesn't make sense"", Cummins told the Herald.His share of the cost amounts to about $400,000, wiping out his retirement plan.Meanwhile, he said others in the same position were already past retirement age but had continued to work to help cover the cost.""It actually got so stressful for one couple in here that they moved out. Basically this was their nest egg for retirement. They've tried to sell but they can't even sell it to redeem anything out of their investment.""With the exception of maybe three owners in the building, all of the owners are just ma and pa people.""Cummins is ""over"" the emotional side of the situation and just wants to get what he can for building owners.His preference is to go ahead and strengthen the building but the problem is at least four owners have already indicated they can't afford to do that.Their banks won't lend them the money and they aren't owner-occupiers, which excludes them from the Government's loan scheme designed to help those who can't afford this strengthening without assistance.This month the body corporate will vote on whether to pursue putting the building up for sale, as is, to see what owners can get for it, and walk away.Mel Johnston, who is the body corporate chair for another apartment block in Wellington, is facing an almost identical set of circumstances.After that building was deemed earthquake-prone in 2010, an initial strengthening estimate cost came back at $30,000 per owner.But that cost has since skyrocketed to $240,000 each.If they went ahead with the strengthening work, the apartments would sell on today's market for just over $400,000.""We started out with a genuine belief that this was the right thing to do but now we're looking at this group of people for whom this is going to be a financial disaster, Johnston said.""It's been a huge burden for us as an owner group and after eight years of hard work it's depressing to be in the situation that we're in when we don't have a viable path ahead.""Inner City Wellington, a residents' association, has identified 40 earthquake-prone multi-owned residential city apartment buildings, affecting about 880 households.President Geraldine Murphy recently addressed a select committee in support of a petition asking for the House of Representatives to review the earthquake-prone building provisions in the Building Act 2004 because they are unfair.""Keeping people safe from harm when disasters strike is important, but if how we do that is by ruining the lives of more people than will be saved, and forcing apartment owners out of their homes, then we must think again.""Last year the Government announced a loan scheme to help people find the money to strengthen their buildings, but it's only available to owner-occupiers.Building and Construction Minister Jenny Salesa said it was targeted at those in genuine hardship, who couldn't afford to remediate their buildings without assistance.""The loan is not available to residential property investors because investment in residential property is essentially a commercial undertaking - if the owner is unable to raise the finance to strengthen the building, they have the option to sell their property.""MBIE has received only 19 expressions of interest in the loan to date.Salesa said the Government considered several options when developing a support scheme and the loan was considered the fairest for taxpayers and provided broad access.She said it was possible the Government might review the scheme after implementation.Wellington-based National list MP Nicola Willis endorsed the call for an independent review of the impacts the legislation was having on apartment owners.She understood when Cabinet originally agreed to the changes, the average cost for owners was estimated to be about $25,000 each.""If that is the case, it does change very much the context for these decisions and it's a materially different set of facts.""It's also a balancing act; we can't lose sight of the fact New Zealanders want to live in cities and buildings where people are safe from the impact of a major earthquake."""
750	5	The idea that climate change is a vast global conspiracy -- involving everyone from Nasa and the British Met Office to Chinese government scientists and – has persisted in the United States to an alarming degree.So much so that more than 180 members of Congress are believed to be climate deniers, including Senator Jim Inhofe, who once tossed a snowball to the presiding officer in February, saying: “You know what this is? It’s a snowball, from outside here. So it’s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable.” Washington DC gets an average of about 12cm (5 inches) of snow in February.Now 31 major scientific organisations in the US – including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Meteorological Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics – have signed a joint letter to Congress urging them to accept that climate change is real and action needs to be taken.“Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research concludes that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver,” they write.“This conclusion is based on multiple independent lines of evidence and the vast body of peer-reviewed science.“There is strong evidence that ongoing climate change is having broad negative impacts on society, including the global economy, natural resources, and human health.“For the United States, climate change impacts include greater threats of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and increased risk of regional water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires, and the disturbance of biological systems. The severity of climate change impacts is increasing and is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades.”Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereThe letter adds that to reduce the risk of the “most severe” impacts of climate change, “greenhouse gas emissions must be substantially reduced”.“In addition, adaptation is necessary to address unavoidable consequences for human health and safety, food security, water availability, and national security, among others,” the signatories say.“We, in the scientific community, are prepared to work with you on the scientific issues important to your deliberations as you seek to address the challenges of our changing climate.”They can expect a frosty reception from some, particularly Mr Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and is also the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.Last year, during the talks about the Paris climate agreement, Mr Inhofe told a meeting of sceptics: “I look forward to hearing what kind of cover-up deal emerges from this international climate conference.“And you guys here in this room, as you always have, just keep it up. Our progress would not have happened without you. You’re doing the Lord’s work, and we’re going to win this thing together.”
501	4	"David BellamyInternationally renowned environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy has joined the New Zealand group of scientists trying to refute what they believe are unfounded claims about man-made global warming. Dr Bellamy, who joins scientists such as former MetService chief meteorologist Dr Augie Auer in the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition, was introduced to the group through a member in England. The coalition has set down ""seven pillars of climate wisdom"" that include: * Historically, conditions in many parts of the world have been warmer and cooler than they are now. * A major driver of climate change is variability in solar effects, such as sunspot cycles, and not increased carbon dioxide. * Global temperatures have not increased and a projection of solar cycles suggest cooling could set in and continue to about 2030. * Stories of impending climate disaster are based almost entirely on global climate models. Dr Bellamy said: ""I look forward to working with the New Zealanders to create an international coalition to serve as a united voice for the many scientists around the world who believe climate science is not settled, that the world is not on the brink of a man-made global warming catastrophe and that we have much more to learn about this planet of ours that has been through and survived many natural upheavals and climatic cycles."" In 2004, Dr Bellamy described man-made global warming as ""poppycock"" then asserted last year that a large percentage of the world's glaciers were advancing, not retreating, but later admitted the figures were wrong. NIWA climate scientist Brett Mullan, who is also a member of the Royal Society's New Zealand Climate Committee, said the coalition's refusal to believe in man-made global warming was a ""frustration"". ""I am disappointed. We point them to the evidence and they just don't seem to wish to accept it."" He said climate modelling had proven effective, such as in projecting temperature increases after the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. Solar activity, monitored over the past 30 years, did not account for the climate changes being experienced now. Temperatures varied from year to year, with the last peak in 1998, but overall temperatures were still much higher now than in the 1950s or 60s. Dr Mullan said the world's top climate scientists had formed a consensus through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""We are seeing warming and it's caused by human activities."""
379	4	Canberra, Australia – Australia’s worst-ever bushfires have thrust climate change into the political spotlight, but one of the country’s most powerful media conglomerates continues to deny the links between extreme weather events and climate change: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.On January 2, following weeks of horrific losses and fatalities, newspapers around the world put Australia’s bushfires on their front pages.But in Australia, The Australian – News Corp’s flagship newspaper – dedicated its front page to a photo of a new year’s day picnic, and its tabloid Herald Sun relegated the story to page four.At that point, eight people had died in the bushfires, mass evacuations were underway from Victoria’s East Gippsland region, and the New South Wales (NSW) south coast had seen whole villages wiped out.It is now believed that 28 people have died in the bushfires across three states since September 2019. More than a billion animals have been killed, over 2,000 houses lost, and at least 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) burnt.News Corp’s newspapers account for 60 percent of Australia’s newspaper sales.The company also owns some of the world’s most influential television channels, including Sky News in Australia and the UK and Fox News in the US. Fox News is US President Donald Trump’s favoured television station.Murdoch’s papers in Australia are known for their conservatism, and their columnists frequently rage about the threat posed to the country by immigration, Muslims, and increasing recognition of LGBTQ rights.The Australian’s associate editor once said that climate change was “not the era’s burning issue”, and the paper published an article that argued climate change activists were “global catastrophists” and part of a “socialist plot”.The Australian public is largely in support of taking more action on climate change.According to the 2019 Climate of the Nation survey, 61 per cent of Australians believe that climate change is caused by humans and 64 per cent think the country should have a national target for net zero emissions by 2050.“There is already a strong, broad sentiment in Australia about the increasing importance of reducing emissions,” science communicator Ketan Joshi told Al Jazeera earlier this month.Even James Murdoch, the younger son of the 88-year-old media mogul, publicly criticised News Corp and Fox Corporation’s coverage of climate change this week via a statement with his wife.James Murdoch is the former CEO of 21st Century Fox and currently sits on the News Corp board of directors.“[James and Kathryn Murdoch] are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial of the role of climate change among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary,” the spokesperson said.Journalism academic and media expert Margaret Simons believes it is significant that the younger Murdoch has spoken out.“It’s rare that the Murdoch family criticise each other in public,” she told Al Jazeera. “The fact that the came out so strongly is significant and sent a bit of a shockwave through News Corp in Australia.”Susan Forde, journalism professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, said News Corp has always been “very conservative on climate change.”“There are many people out there – and we know this from the 2019 federal election – who are very ill-informed,” she explained.“They are reading this content and believing it, and they agree with Murdoch that we should be focusing on creating more jobs.”Earlier this month, a News Corp finance manager sent an incendiary email as she resigned that was addressed to chairman Michael Miller and copied to all staff.“I find it unconscionable to continue working for this company, knowing I am contributing to the spread of climate change denial and lies,” the woman wrote.She described the news reports that came out of The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun as “irresponsible” and “dangerous”.The email was reportedly removed from staff inboxes within an hour.Faced with increasing criticism, The Australian published an editorial on 11 January, denying that it misrepresented the facts on climate change.“The evidence of global warming since the Industrial Revolution is clear,” the editorial said, before going on to blame “progressive elites” for overlooking “the hard work of persuasion and coalition-building” that is needed on climate change.News Corp did not respond to requests for comment from Al Jazeera.Forde of Griffith University has conducted research on media coverage of climate change. She said one problem at News Corp is that its media outlets do not take the reality of climate change as their starting point.“We tend to think that everything is up to editors, but this is clearly not true. The tone set by the owners of media organisations does in fact have a big impact on content,” she said.Former News Corp journalists have also gone on the record about climate change coverage.In 2019, Rick Morton, at the time employed by The Australian, said “We kind of know what the editorial line is at the paper… It’s not always a Murdoch line; it’s just that Murdoch hires editors who are very much like him.”Simons. the journalism academic, predicts that the longer the debate continues, there will be more resignations from News Corp journalists.“Some of the Australian’s best journalists have been leaving [News Corp] in the last 18 months and some have been very vocal about the reasons why,” she said.“For any journalist who is early on in their career, they’d have to ask themselves whether they really want to belong to an organisation which is not contributing to a positive fashion to the defining debate of our times.”“It will become harder for News Corp to get good journalists to work for them, and this will change the culture.”There have long been concerns about the Murdoch empire’s domination of the Australian media, which led to a government inquiry in 2011, after a phone hacking scandal at the Murdoch-owned News of the World in the UK.The review found that existing self-regulation mechanisms were insufficient to ensure accountability by media outlets, and recommended that a News Media Council be established to set journalistic standards.“No-one else is publishing work like News Corp,” Forde explained. “They argue that it’s under the guise of ‘we’re the only ones who are balancing the reporting’.”“It’s part of their political and ideological narrative that natural disasters like bushfires have always happened, and if they admit they’re out of the ordinary, then they’re accepting that climate change is real. So they play it down and employ [writers with] quite extreme views.”With Australia’s largest activist group GetUp! launching a new anti-Murdoch campaign, asking advertisers to pull out of News Corp, Forde believes that people are slowly becoming more aware of Murdoch’s influence.“More people are talking about the ‘Murdochracy’ and the significant impact that he and his organisations are having on debate, as well as the diversity of public debate and the spreading of false information,” she said.Change will probably require an economic threat to Murdoch’s outlets, however.“Editorial positions would need to change for their views to change, and the direction needs to come from Rupert or Lachlan Murdoch themselves,” Forde concluded. “They would need to see that they’re losing readers, advertisers or shareholders as a result of their current views for there to be a shift.”Simons agrees change will take time. “There was a reshuffle of editors in late 2019, but there has been no sign of an appetite for cultural change,” she said.“If anything, it was a reinforcement of the existing culture.”
905	4	"Recycling and growing your own vegetables are popular with those who care for the environment, but a new report says such activities do little to stop climate change.Instead, researchers say two changes will have the biggest impact: cutting back on red meat and driving an electric car.As they don't need fuel or oil, independent think-tank Motu says electric cars make the biggest difference to household emissions and therefore climate change.With the vehicles priced from as little as $20,000, electric car retailer Henry Schmidt says it's a no-brainer.""New Zealand's about 90 percent renewable energy, we're an ideal country for electric cars.""Motu researched what people could do to make the biggest difference to emissions. As well as driving, they concluded air travel and consuming red meat and dairy are major contributors.Dr Suzi Kerr, a professor at Victoria University and Senior Fellow at Motu, says families all around New Zealand could benefit from looking at ways to decrease their household's emissions. That could just be looking at what they are buying, and what they actually need.""One of the biggest drivers of your household's emissions is simply what your income is and how much you spend.  As they're getting more income they're simply buying more stuff,"" she says.Dr Kerr also adds that households that are trying to reduce emissions sometimes go about it the wrong way. ""A lot of people think they should be recycling or growing their own veges in order to affect climate change. We don't even include those because they are so small. They're not bad things to do for environmental reasons, but they're not about climate.""Dr Kerr says wealthier, higher-emitting households fly internationally more often. And regardless of income, the households that emit the most are the ones that drive a lot."
860	3	SEATTLE -- With every flood, devastating wildfire and even a deep freeze, climate change seems to get the blame. News headlines sound alarms with fears about survival, destruction of the planet and the end of humans.It’s all apparently too much for some to cope with, which is the reasoning behind a first of its kind class at the University of Washington Bothell. It’s titled, “Environmental Anxiety and Climate Grief: Building Resilience in the Age of Consequences.”According to the school, Camilo Acosta, a student who enrolled in the class, explained her decision this way, “For the longest time I didn’t let myself feel the pain and anguish that was building up due to the destruction of our earth,” Acosta said.High profile Democrats are fueling the panic as they push for a Green New Deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made headlines when she recently said, “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” Several Democrats running for president in 2020 also support the Green New Deal, including Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who said on the campaign trail, “The future of the human race literally depends on it.”The Climate Grief class has students spending one hour each week outside in nature in a quiet place. They’re required to write about what they see and feel. Students also take part in a group project in which they assemble a climate change survival kit. But it’s not to be filled with flashlights and emergency food, but rather books and poems that can help others deal with their emotions tied to the environment.Cliff Mass, a meteorologist and professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, agrees humans are playing some role in the warming planet, but he also thinks this class on grief and anxiety should flunk out.“I think the best thing to do now is not play on people’s fears and anxieties, and not reflect on some of the exaggerated headlines that we have in the paper,” Mass said.That assessment is shared by Benji Backer, a UW student and member of the American Conservation Coalition. Backer also believes humans bear some responsibility.“The climate is a slow change, a slow but steady change, and saying that people will have to deal with massive problems that they’ll need survival kits for is just not accurate,” Backer said.The World Meteorological Organization just released its 2018 report to the United Nations. It concluded the planet has warmed 1 degree Celsius since the pre-Industrial Age in the 1850s and 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record. The report documents a loss of sea ice, rising sea levels and says nations are not on track to meet carbon emission standards set in the Paris Climate Accord.A recent study done at Yale found 29 percent of Americans are “alarmed” about climate change. That’s double the number from an identical survey done in 2013.Dennis Hartmann, who was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and is a former Chairman of the University of Washington’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, said it’s not healthy to be anxious about climate change all the time, but it’s rational to worry about the future.“Young people have a lot of anxiety, for many reasons, and anything we can do to help them cope with that is good,” Hartmann said.The Climate Grief class instructor, Jennifer Atkinson, calls her course a kind of boot camp for students willing to fight for the planet, giving them tools to survive emotionally.  But she does have her detractors, who mocked the class as a 12-step program for a generation of snowflakes.
533	3	"Three in four Americans want to know more about presidential candidates’ plans to fight global warming, according to data compiled by Yale University.With just over a month to go until election day, an average of 76 per cent of US adults expressed interest in news stories about the plans that President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden intend to deploy in response to the climate crisis.Maps were published last week based on a survey gauging Americans’ interest in climate news by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication,. The data was compiled from a national survey of more than 5,700 respondents this summer. At a state level, interest in the presidential candidates’ climate change policies was above the national average in certain regions, particularly in the northeast - New York (83 per cent), Massachusetts (83 per cent), New Jersey (80 per cent ) and Maryland (80 per cent).In the west, where states have suffered historic wildfires and soaring temperatures driven by the climate crisis, residents were also interested in the candidates’ plans. In California, 80 per cent of respondents expressed interest, and 79 per cent in Oregon and Washington states. In the swing states which are likely to decide the next president, interest remained high on the candidates’ climate plans but slightly dipped in those in the south. Arizona was two points off the national average (74 per cent) and the same in Florida. In Georgia, it was 73 per cent and slightly lower at 72 per cent in North Carolina.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereWisconsin saw 75 per cent interest, rising by a percentage point in Michigan. Minnesota and Pennsylvania both tied with 77 per cent expressing in interest in new stories about the candidates’ climate change policies.Climate change is only one of a number of pressing issues for Americans as they go to the ballot box this year. However a study by the Pew Research Center in April found that the number of Americans who say global climate change is a major threat to the country jumped from 44 per cent around a decade ago to 60 per cent in 2020. But the level of concern is split along party lines and mostly comes from Democrats while Republicans’ views on the issue remain largely unchanged. The new Yale study also found that interest is high across the US for news stories on a variety of climate issues.On whether global warming is or is not happening - 74 per cent were interested and 25 per cent were not interested at all. (Some 97 per cent or more of climate scientists agree: climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities, NASA reports.) Some 77 per cent  said they would read news stories on the causes of global warming.According to the survey, 78 per cent were interested in the impacts of global warming on their local community, and the same percentage of people on the impacts of global warming around the world. The highest percentage of respondents (79 per cent) were interested in new stories about the response of the US government to global warming.For President Trump’s re-election campaign, the Republican party has recycled its 2016 platform that says the climate crisis will be best solved by the market and tech solutions.The GOP platform also states that ""climate change is far from this nation’s most pressing national security issue. This is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.""The recycled platform underlines how much President Trump has achieved in curbing plans to tackle the crisis. The platform references plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and roll back aspects of the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. On these, Mr Trump made good on the promises.In mid-August, Mr Trump's re-election campaign posted his second-term agenda, titled ""Fighting for You!"" The brief document made no mention of the climate or environment but noted that: ""Over the coming weeks, the President will be sharing additional details about his plans through policy-focused speeches on the campaign trail.""During a meeting earlier this month in California, Mr Trump made his feelings on climate change clear, telling public officials: “It'll start getting cooler. You just watch.”In a rare public rebuke of a sitting president, one replied: ""I wish science agreed with you.""Mr Trump shot back: ""Well, I don't think science knows actually.""In July, Joe Biden released a $2 trillion plan to tackle the climate crisis, with aims to boost investment in clean energy and wind down fossil-fuel power plants by 2035."
167	4	Australia should establish a new “Pacific Access” visa category that could be used by Pacific islanders forced from their homes by climate change and natural disasters, a new policy paper has argued, warning of growing displacement in Australia’s region in coming decades.Disasters displaced three times as many people as conflict around the world last year, the paper from University of New South Wales’ Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law says, and the Asia-Pacific region is the hardest hit. Between 2008 and 2018, the Asia-Pacific saw more than 80% of all new global displacement.“Australia cannot afford to ignore the fact that in its own region, internal and cross-border displacement within and from the Pacific islands is likely to increase as disasters intensify and become more frequent, exacerbated by the impacts of climate change,” authors Jane McAdam and Jonathan Pryke write.“While Australia cannot stop such displacement altogether, it can implement policy changes now that would help to reduce its scale and impact.”New Zealand has, for decades, run a Pacific Access Visa category, allowing residents of Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga and Fiji to apply to permanently migrate under a ballot system. Residents of Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau are automatically New Zealand citizens. The Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia and Palau are in ‘compacts of free association’ with the US, allowing free movement.The Kaldor policy paper argues for an expansion of Australia’s existing seasonal worker program and Pacific labour scheme, and for the creation of a Pacific access-style visa category similar to New Zealand’s model. It would be for countries in the Pacific without free movement to other large Pacific rim countries.Director of the Kaldor Centre, Prof Jane McAdam, said that while Pacific islanders overwhelmingly want to stay in their homes, and their governments were focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation, that migration planning would be needed as part of a “suite of policies” for coming decades.She said governments around the world, but particularly in the Asia-Pacific, needed to put in place migration policies to allow planned and controlled movement before displacement became acute and forced.“Policymakers look at this as a future issue, but we are seeing the impacts already driving people to move. These policies are about supporting Pacific islands communities to themselves cope with disasters and climate change. This is not an either-or argument, it’s not adaptation and mitigation or migration, we need a suite of policies to address these challenges, and migration can provide an important relief-valve.“This isn’t just about protecting people when it’s almost too late, it’s about devising proactive policies, including migration policies to let people move now, with safety and with dignity.”Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands Program, said beyond the humanitarian and legal arguments in favour of greater Pacific access, Australia was a beneficiary of enhanced migration from the Pacific.“We benefit greatly from the contribution the Pacific islanders are already making to Australia’s economy as seasonal and temporary workers, particularly in the era of Covid-19 where our borders remain shut to other sources of labour.”He said labour migration benefited Pacific economies too, with Pacific labourers in Australia able to earn between eight and 10 times what they could in their home countries: money repatriated directly to families and communities.“It is economic support directly into communities, to improve livelihoods back in the Pacific.”Other models of pan-Pacific migratory cooperation have previously been mooted.In 2019, former prime minister Kevin Rudd proposed a “formal constitutional condominium” with Pacific nations, where Australia would offer citizenship to the residents of Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Nauru in exchange for control of their territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, and fisheries.The idea was not well-received in the Pacific: Tuvalu’s then prime minister accused him of “imperial thinking” and said his country would “not to be subjugated under some sort of colonial mentor”.Prof John Blaxland from the ANU proposed Australia establishing a “grand compact” with Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu and Nauru: akin to the arrangements the US and New Zealand have with Pacific states.Recruiting Pacific islanders to the Australian defence force – as a pathway to citizenship – has also been proposed.The Australian government’s 2017 foreign policy white paper said Australia would move to “integrate Pacific countries into the Australian and New Zealand economies and our security institutions”, arguing it was “essential to the long-term stability and economic prospects of the Pacific”. Australia and other allied countries are also concerned about China’s rising presence and influence across the region.Last month, Danielle Heinecke from the department of foreign affairs and trade told a parliamentary inquiry the government was looking at “pathways towards further integration” with Pacific states.“Typically, we’ve had an economic response to migration, rather than necessarily a strategic look at migration, so there are a lot of interesting policy questions that government needs to unpack,” she said.“What we really want to do is build on the [Pacific] Step-up and build on a lot of the existing education relationships and labour mobility pathways. We particularly want to use this where we can with micro states, because micro states have fairly small populations of around 140,000.”
797	3	This story is co-published with Columbia Journalism Investigations, the Center for Public Integrity and Covering Climate Now. Read the full investigation here.Charlie Rhodes lived alone on a tree-sparse street with sunburned lawns just outside Phoenix, Arizona. At 61, the army veteran’s main connection to the world was Facebook; often, he posted several times a day. But as a heatwave blanketed the region in June 2016 – leading to temperatures among the highest ever recorded – his posts stopped. Three weeks later, a pile of unopened mail outside his door prompted a call to police.When officers arrived, they were overcome by the odor of rotting garbage, worsened by the still-searing heat. Inside the home, they found the air conditioner broken and its thermometer reading 99F. Rhodes lay dead in the bedroom, his body decomposing. The cause, his autopsy shows: “Complications of environmental heat exposure.”Yearly heat-related deaths have more than doubled in Arizona in the last decade to 283. Across the country, heat caused at least 10,000 deaths between 1999 and 2016 – more than hurricanes, tornadoes or floods in most years.Scientists link the warming planet to a rise in dangerous heat in the US, as well as the spread of infectious diseases and other health conditions. Federal research predicts heatstroke and similar illnesses will claim tens of thousands of American lives each year by the end of the century. Already, higher temperatures pose lethal risks: the five warmest years nationwide have all occurred since 2006. In the last six decades, the number of annual heatwaves in 50 US cities has, on average, tripled. In contrast to a viral pandemic, this is a quiet, insidious threat with no end point.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is charged with helping cities and states adapt to threats like extreme heat. Its climate program, created more than 10 years ago, is the federal government’s only sustained effort to bolster state and local health departments’ fight against global warming. But the program has been hampered by a decade of underfunding, limited expertise and political resistance, Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity found.Interviews with more than 100 people and a review of hundreds of pages of government records show the Obama administration, while pushing measures to combat climate change, missed opportunities to expand the program. Under Donald Trump, officials have tried to eliminate it.The tepid federal response has left state and local health workers ill-equipped to act, exposing communities to underappreciated threats that will only get worse. Arizona’s health department receives around $200,000 a year to fund its climate team. But for a state with 7 million people – including a growing number of isolated, older residents like Rhodes – experts say it’s not enough to pay for research and, most importantly, action.Rhodes, a once gregarious jokester who cut himself off from family and friends after the loss of his job and father, had devised a method to handle the heat: he covered his windows with aluminum foil and ran the air conditioner in his bedroom. But as the temperature hit 120F near his home, no one checked on him.Asked what the program has done to prevent people like Rhodes from dying of heat, the Arizona health department spokesperson Holly Poynter said its advisories on the hottest days include a sentence encouraging people to check on at-risk friends, family and neighbors twice a day. “Heat-related deaths are preventable,” she said, “and continued work is needed due to increasing vulnerable populations within the state.”The CDC defended its efforts on climate change, saying its program has assisted health departments successfully for years. “We’re proud of the work that our program is doing,” said Patrick Breysse, who heads the agency’s environmental health center and oversees its climate activities. “We’re excited about the leadership role we play.”Some CDC-aided health departments lead the nation in heat illness prevention. San Francisco’s climate program helped devise heat emergency response plans and mapped vulnerable city neighborhoods. Now, officials use these maps to encourage neighbors to check on each other. Climate programs elsewhere helped change the threshold for heat advisories from 100F to 95F after finding residents get sick at lower temperatures.Yet many departments funded by the CDC are struggling to fulfill the program’s mission, according to government and academic reports and interviews with state and local health workers.In North Carolina, program employees asked their CDC counterparts for guidance and expertise to identify the state’s climate health threats. Records show the agency failed to provide the assistance it promised early on. After nearly a decade of research, health workers only recently began reaching out to the most vulnerable residents.In Florida, heat-related hospitalizations are on the rise. But health officials there barred the state climate team from publicly acknowledging global warming’s link to heat. Then, with the CDC’s imprimatur, they evicted the program from the health department.Most of the country’s 3,000 state and local health departments, meanwhile, get no such funding. They’re on their own to figure out what to do and how to pay for it.Federal officials have known for decades that climate change poses a public health crisis. In 1989, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a 100-page report on how global warming could affect human health. It urged public health agencies to fund research on extreme heat and provide health departments with “trained professionals”. By 2000, the US released its first recurring assessment of the changing climate’s impacts. Again, it called for “investments in advancing the public health infrastructure”.Five years later, Dr Howard Frumkin, a veteran epidemiologist hired to run CDC’s environmental health center, brought the nation’s leading public health agency into the battle against climate change. “We knew that the climate was warming,” said Frumkin, who viewed the CDC as “past the point where we needed to be stepping up”.In 2009 – then the second-hottest year on record – Frumkin seized an opportunity to expand the CDC’s climate efforts. That February, he testified before a congressional committee about challenges brought by global warming. Health departments, he said, require climate and health training and data to plan for impacts. “CDC has in place many of the building blocks,” he told the committee, but it needed to assemble them into a serious effort.A month later, a Democratic-led Congress gave the CDC $7.5m for its climate program, to be renewed yearly with congressional approval. The new initiative seeded climate and health activities in 10 health departments. Frumkin hoped it would eventually expand to all 50 states.Shortly after Congress funded the program, Dr Thomas Frieden, then the newlyappointed CDC director, introduced his “winnable battles” – seven health initiatives that his agency prioritized. Climate was not among them. Most of those programs – nutrition, food safety – received an annual $50m to $700m by the end of his eight-year tenure. The climate program, by contrast, never exceeded $10m. In 2013, the CDC recommended reducing that budget.As the CDC’s director, Frieden rarely used his bully pulpit to address threats posed by the warming planet. During a 20-minute keynote speech at a national environmental health conference, he discussed the topic for 13 seconds. A 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, criticized the CDC for failing to provide leadership on the issue.Frieden, for his part, disputes claims that he did not prioritize climate change and insists he cares about the issue, pointing to the CDC’s work combating dangerous particulate matter produced by cars and coal plants. “It will have major public health consequences,” he said of climate change. “But there’s only a certain amount that public health programs can do.”The CDC’s lackluster response contrasted with President Barack Obama’s public overtures and policy initiatives on climate. Former senior White House officials – including those who helped implement climate policies – admit the administration didn’t apply enough pressure on the CDC to act.In December 2015, Republicans in Congress rejected a proposal to boost spending on the CDC program to $18m. The increase would have more than doubled its size.The summer of 2016 – when Charlie Rhodes died – showed there was no time to lose in the push to understand and stem heat death. The previous eight years, the number of heat-related fatalities in Arizona had averaged 145. That jumped to 219 in 2016, and 264 the year after. A report produced by Maricopa county – where the largest number of the state’s heat deaths have occurred – found that men, Native Americans and people 75 and older were most at risk.Gene Moore, 82, fit all three categories. A Quechan tribe member, he spent much of his life on its reservation, near Yuma, Arizona, before moving near Phoenix in 2010 to live with his son. Over the years, Moore’s health declined, but he remained mobile and enjoyed talking on the phone with friends, according to his son, Ivan.In June 2017 – several weeks after Ivan had his home air conditioner repaired – he took his family camping in the mountains. Gene stayed behind. The day Ivan left, the temperature hit 118F. Phoenix went 11 days at or above 110F, one of only five such stretches on record. Four happened in the last three decades.A week later, Ivan’s brother called to say Moore had stopped answering his phone. Ivan dialed the police. They found Moore dead on his bedroom floor, his window open. The air conditioner had broken again, and the temperature inside topped 105F. Moore’s autopsy shows cardiovascular disease caused his death, while heat played a significant contributing factor.Arizona health officials still don’t know why more residents like Moore are dying or how best to protect them. Temperatures are rising in the state, but the hottest summers don’t always match the highest death tolls. The Arizona State University researcher David Hondula, who works with the state’s climate team, contributed to a study ruling out temperature as the only reason. Other factors such as homelessness and substance abuse may play a role, he said, but the climate program doesn’t have money to keep studying the problem.“If additional funding existed, we could really dive in to answer this question,” Hondula said. Instead, the limited CDC money – budgeted before the spike in deaths – supports awareness campaigns in poorer areas such as Yuma county.Many Arizona cities offer cooling centers – air-conditioned libraries, churches and other shelters – for residents to escape the heat. Moore and Rhodes both had access to a vehicle. Cooling centers were nearby. Health workers are now surveying residents who visit cooling centers, but they say it takes money to determine why so many others don’t.Ivan Moore, who grew up hearing about heat death victims on the radio, blames himself for what happened to his father. “I should have had someone check on him sooner,” Ivan said, even though less than 36 hours had passed between Gene’s last email to his family and when police found him. “He had quite a few years left on him.”In North Carolina, the CDC-funded program has helped enable what health department spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor described in an email as “the substantial growth in climate and health adaptation”. Even so, documents show the climate team ran into roadblocks almost as soon as it tried to evaluate the state’s preparedness for climate change. It was still seeking the agency’s assistance when, in 2015, it completed an analysis showing heat-related mortality would increase over the coming decade.On 22 June that year, Sherion Winfrey, 63, had just returned to work after vacation and had nine days before she was due to retire. For nearly 40 years, she worked at the same oil- and air-filter factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city in the Sandhills. She’d learned to pack frozen water bottles in a cooler to keep herself refreshed on the hot assembly line. But that day, as the temperature outside hit 96F, she collapsed during her shift. Rushed to a hospital, she died early that afternoon.A state inspection of the factory the next day found that heat from industrial ovens and the metal walls and roof of the un-air-conditioned production line raised the indoor heat index – a combined measure of temperature and humidity – to over 106F and into the Occupational Safety and Health department’s “danger” heat classification. The inspector recommended the factory allow employees time to acclimate to the heat after an absence. But the investigation into Winfrey’s death ended after a medical examiner found that Winfrey suffered “a fatal pulmonary embolism and did not die from exposure to extreme temperatures”. Recent research suggests this type of blood clotting may be brought on by daily temperature swings.Danny Muhammad, Winfrey’s son, has no doubt heat contributed to her death. Winfrey complained to family about the factory’s stifling environment. “The heat index was out of this world that day,” Muhammad said. It was the ninth consecutive day that temperatures had reached at least 94F – seven degrees hotter than the June average. Winfrey’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017 against the factory, citing extreme indoor temperatures as the cause of her death, but the case was later dismissed. A spokesperson for the factory declined to comment.It took another three years after Winfrey’s death for the North Carolina program’s heat education efforts to begin in four Sandhills counties – and not where she had lived.In the years since the Trump administration took over, the political pressure hampering some of the CDC climate program’s grantees has also been applied to the program itself. Former and current staff said senior agency officials, aware of Trump’s denials of climate science, have tried to keep the program operating under the radar.Self-censorship surfaced quickly after the 2016 election, even before Trump assumed office. In December of that year, the CDC environmental health director, Patrick Breysse, indefinitely postponed a first-ever climate symposium that was scheduled for after the inauguration. George Luber, then the CDC’s climate chief, remembers his superiors warning the event would be poorly timed; Breysse said the postponement was for budgetary reasons.The environmental health chief acknowledges that his staff debated whether to use the term “climate change”. He later combined the climate and asthma programs and, internal documents suggest, omitted the word “climate” from the new branch’s title.Breysse insists the White House never directed his actions. But they served as the basis for a whistleblower complaint filed by Luber, who was removed from his CDC post in 2018. The complaint alleged that Luber was ousted because of his outspokenness on global warming. It stirred a hornet’s nest of public attention, but some program insiders allege his removal had more to do with his mismanagement and mistreatment of employees than his advocacy.The CDC, which refused to comment on “personnel matters”, said its climate program was running better than ever. The agency pointed to the “mini grants” it has doled out through partner organizations to help another 10 health departments, one-time funding of $5,000 to $50,000.Meanwhile, every one of Trump’s budget proposals has tried to eliminate the program.The inaction in Washington contrasts with some local efforts to save lives endangered by the climate crisis. In Phoenix, spurred on by the sustained surge in heat deaths, some groups hand out 250,000 bottles of water annually to the homeless. Others distribute heat awareness magnets and brochures to the elderly. Still others are developing home sensors that will notify friends and family when indoor temperatures climb.Many vulnerable residents fall through the cracks. Arizona medical examiner records of heat deaths are filled with accounts of ageing and isolated people who hadn’t been heard from for days before a wellness check was requested.Among them were Larry and Kathleen Purchase, 69 and 68 respectively, who died from environmental heat exposure in their Phoenix home during an unusual string of triple-digit days in September 2018. Married for almost 50 years, the two were active in their community and ran a small computer repair service, said Larry’s brother, Terry. When their 1970s rooftop air conditioner broke, they didn’t have the several hundred dollars to fix it.Terry remembers them as “good stewards of the environment”, a tenet of their Christian faith. They didn’t believe in human-caused climate change, he said.The day they were found, the temperature in their home hovered around 100F.Dean Russell, Elisabeth Gawthrop, Veronica Penney, Ali Raj and Bridget Hickey are reporting fellows for Columbia Journalism Investigations, an investigative reporting unit at the Columbia Journalism School.

110	5	"Councils can already protect communities from rising sea levels. Photo / Brett PhibbsScience Reporter, NZ HeraldCouncils don't need to wait for new laws to act on climate change risks that threaten coastal homes and communities, experts say.About 675,500 Kiwis live in areas already prone to flooding, with a further 72,065 living in the firing line of where some of the most dramatic effects of sea-level rise could hit.How to meet this threat has increasingly proven a headache for local councils, given thorny issues around legal powers, resourcing, funding and the risk of litigation that come with it.While many mayors have turned to the Government to provide them the laws, guidance and help they need, which is all expected to arrive through an overhaul of the Resource Management Act (RMA), a new report finds that action can be taken right now.It finds greater use of existing legislation can help reduce and avoid coastal hazard risks in the period before the legislative reforms are implemented – a process likely to take many years.Its authors, working under the Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge, also highlight critical issues that require specific attention in the reform process to remove barriers and to assist adaptation to climate-change impacts in coastal areas.""The report analyses the current difficulties of planning for ongoing sea-level rise under a planning regime that is largely permissive and enables land-uses with very long timeframes,"" said Victoria University adaptation expert Dr Judy Lawrence, who authored the research with planning experts Sylvia Allan of Allan Planning and Research and Larissa Clarke of GNS Science.""Our observations and research confirm that in Aotearoa New Zealand, developments continue to be located and intensified in areas prone to coastal erosion and flooding.""In February, the Government announced it would repeal the RMA and enact new legislation including a Strategic Planning Act and a Climate Adaptation Act.""In the meantime, current council policies, plans and practices are not adequately managing risks from ongoing sea-level rise, rising water tables, and increased flooding,"" Lawrence said.""Under current development and planning practices, we're seeing attempts to manage these risks, for example by raising houses or building hard barriers.""But these practices are virtually certain to have only a temporary effect and can make problems worse by lulling people into a sense of misplaced security.""They transfer large costs to future generations as the sea continues to advance inland.""Specifically, the report called greater collaboration between regional and district rules, and applying regional rules that have an immediate effect on land use change and development.The researchers recommended regions use strategic spatial plans, more effective use of subdivision controls, and offering greater clarity around how many legacy subdivision and planning consents are not yet activated.They suggest a strategy called ""dynamic adaptive pathways planning"" to allow a shift away from mitigating climate impacts using hard structures like sea walls, and avoiding decisions on consent applications that could prove costly in future.Councils, for instance, could review the status of subdivision, land use, building and infrastructure rules.They could also make greater uses of certain sections of the RMA, such as one enabling application to the Environment Court to request that new rules intended to reduce exposure to coastal natural hazards have immediate effect - and another where subdivision consents could be turned down using best practice information.Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) president Stuart Crosby said several councils, such as Hawkes Bay's and Dunedin's, were already working with their communities to adapt to climate change.""However, these are complex issues and challenging conversations for communities to have,"" he said.""Local government has long been calling for the Government to work with it to address the critical issue of who pays for climate change adaptation.""Crosby said the Productivity Commission, the Future for Local Government Review Panel and councils have identified funding the costs of adapting to climate change as a ""significant cost"" for councils and their communities.""It's a cost councils and their communities are unlikely to be able to meet alone,"" he said.""That's why LGNZ has long advocated for the creation of a national climate change adaptation fund – and a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities for funding across local and central government and communities.""""We understand that part of the Government's work on a Climate Change Adaptation Act is working through a framework for adaptation and managed retreat – including how this is paid for.""The Government needs to partner with local government on how to allocate roles and responsibilities for funding and on the design of a national adaptation fund.""Last year, a major Government risk stocktake found nearly 50,000 buildings were already exposed to coastal flooding, and at the highest range of warming scenarios, that could rise to nearly 120,000 this century.Particularly, it assigned an ""extreme risk"" around governance - council plans, legislation and funding mechanisms weren't fit for adaptation – and to the economic impact on government, directly from lost productivity and covering disaster relief bills."
520	4	"Every aspect of our lives has been affected by the coronavirus. The global economy has slowed, people have retreated to their homes and thousands have died or become seriously ill.At this frightening stage of the crisis, it's difficult to focus on anything else. But as the International Agency has said, the effects of coronavirus are likely to be temporary but the other global emergency – climate change – is not.Stopping the spread of coronavirus is paramount, but climate action must also continue. And we can draw many lessons and opportunities from the current health crisis when tackling planetary warming.S&P Global Ratings this week said measures to contain Covid-19 have pushed the global economy into recession.Economic analyst Lauri Myllyvirta estimates the pandemic may have reduced global emissions by 200 megatonnes of carbon dioxide to date, as air travel grinds to a halt, factories close down and energy demand falls.In the first four weeks of the pandemic, coal consumption in China alone fell by 36 per cent, and oil refining capacity reduced by 34 per cent.In many ways, what we're seeing now is a rapid and unplanned version of economic ""degrowth"" – the transition some academics and activists have for decades said is necessary to address climate change, and leave a habitable planet for future generations.Degrowth is a proposed slowing of growth in sectors that damage the environment, such as fossil fuel industries, until the economy operates within Earth's limits. It is a voluntary, planned and equitable transition in developed nations which necessarily involves an increased focus on the environment, human wellbeing, and capabilities (good health, decent work, education, and a safe and healthy environment).Such a transformation would be profound, and so far no nation has shown the will to implement it. It would require global economies to ""decouple"" from carbon to prevent climate-related crises. But the current unintended economic slowdown opens the door to such a transition, which would bring myriad benefits to the climate.The idea of sustainable degrowth is very different to a recession. It involves scaling back environmentally damaging sectors of the economy, and strengthening others.Climate change has been declared a global emergency, yet to date the world has largely failed to address it. In contrast, the global policy response to the coronavirus emergency has been fast and furious.There are several reasons for this dramatic difference. Climate change is a relatively slow-moving crisis, whereas coronavirus visibly escalates over days, even hours, increasing our perception of the risks involved. One thing that history teaches us about politics and the human condition in times of peril, we often take a ""crisis management"" approach to dealing with serious threats.As others have observed, the slow increase in global temperatures means humans can psychologically adjust as the situation worsens, making the problem seem less urgent and meaning people are less willing to accept drastic policy measures.The global response to the coronavirus crisis shows that governments can take immediate, radical emergency measures, which go beyond purely economic concerns, to protect the wellbeing of all.Specifically, there are practical lessons and opportunities we can take away from the coronavirus emergency as we seek to tackle climate change:Act early: The coronavirus pandemic shows the crucial importance of early action to prevent catastrophic consequences. Governments in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore acted quickly to implement quarantine and screening measures, and have seen relatively small numbers of infections. Italy, on the other hand, whose government waited too long to act, is now the epicentre of the virus.Go slow, go local: Coronavirus has forced an immediate scale-down of how we travel and live. People are forging local connections, shopping locally, working from home and limiting consumption to what they need.Researchers have identified that fears about personal well-being represent a major barrier to political support for the degrowth movement to date. However with social distancing expected to be in place for months, our scaled-down lives may become the ""new normal"". Many people may realise that consumption and personal wellbeing are not inextricably linked.New economic thinking is needed. A transition to sustainable degrowth can help. We need to shift global attention from GDP as an indicator of wellbeing, towards other measures that put people and the environment first, such as New Zealand's well-being budget, Bhutan's gross national happiness index, or Ecuador's social philosophy of buen vivir (good living).Spend on clean energy: The International Energy Agency (IEA) says clean energy should be ""at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the coronavirus crisis"".The IEA has called on governments to launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. It says hydrogen and carbon-capture also need major investment to bring them to scale, which could be helped by the current low interest rates.Governments could also use coronavirus stimulus packages to reskill workers to service the new ""green"" economy, and address challenges in healthcare, sanitation, aged care, food security and education.As climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe said this month:What really matters is the same for all of us. It's the health and safety of our friends, our family, our loved ones, our communities, our cities and our country. That's what the coronavirus threatens, and that's exactly what climate change does, too.The coronavirus crisis is devastating, but failing to tackle climate change because of the pandemic only compounds the tragedy. Instead, we must draw on the lessons of coronavirus to address the climate challenge.The Conversation"
679	4	"Almost 40% of plants are at risk of extinction, scientists have warned.  A global report published on Wednesday by Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said land clearing, over-harvesting of wild species and changing weather patterns all posed significant threats.Of the almost 4,000 new species of plant and fungi botanists registered last year, many were already facing extinction. Researchers said they were now in a ""race against time"" to catalogue unknown species before they disappeared for good. Ecologist and conservationist Gerardo Ceballos is the founder of the Stop Extinction campaign, which aims to raise awareness about species loss. He co-authored a seminal 2015 paper defining what has become known as the sixth mass extinction. That paper has recently been updated.DW: What is this sixth mass extinction all about?Gerardo Ceballos: In the past, there has been what we call five mass extinctions. Those mass extinctions are basically of a catastrophic nature. They have caused the destruction of around 70% of all the animals and plants on the planet. And we call them mass extinctions because they're much, much higher than the normal background extinction.We found that species of vertebrates, mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians that have become extinct in the last 100 years, would have taken 10,000 years to become extinct under the normal background extinction rates. In other words, in 100 years, we have lost species that would normally have taken 10,000 years to lose. In one year, we lost the species we would have lost in 100 years. That's the magnitude of the problem. So we conclude that we have entered the sixth mass extinction. And in this case, the sixth mass extinction is caused by humans.What is actually driving that extinction? What are we doing that's causing species to go extinct?The ultimate causes are basically three things: Human population, consumption and the use of faulty technologies like fossil fuels. Things that are more easily tracked, and that we can change are habitat destruction and the illegal trade, which is this gigantic enterprise run by international mafias — in Mexico, the US, Europe, China — that make a gigantic profit by exploiting species.This, plus things like air pollution, invasive species, and now global warming is causing this mass die-off of populations and species. And what is very important to emphasize is that this sixth mass extinction is accelerating and unless we do something, the rate of extinction will double.Why should people be concerned about species dying out at accelerated rates? If we are very selfish and we want to keep humanity and civilization on Earth, we need to care for the wild plants and animals because they are part of the machinery that keeps conditions on Earth able to support life. All the benefits that we get from well-functioning nature and the proper combination of atmospheric gases to sustain life on Earth, depend on wild plants and animals.We have 15 years only, we think, to change the course of the extinction path. The survival of all living things on this planet, including humans, will depend on what we do.What needs to happen to get a handle on this crisis?We need to think globally. We need to act together to fight the illegal trade. We probably need to create or strengthen new parts of the United Nations. Next year, there is a big biodiversity conservation conference in China and one of the main points now is how do we stop the illegal trade.The second thing will be that we need to really find ways to reduce inequity between countries and within countries. And finally, we need to work and understand that destroying the environment is an existential threat.We are proposing a new strategy called Stop Extinction. Everybody knows now about climate change and its impact. Nobody basically knows about the magnitude of the extinction crisis and its impact. So what we need now is a massive campaign that tells us, every day: This is an existential threat.On the one hand it is really bad, but on the other hand, it can be solved. There are many success stories in conservation. What we need to do first is to have a massive campaign of understanding, making people, corporations and countries aware of the problem, but also empower them to know that this gigantic challenge can be solved and we can all be part of that.The Convention on Biological Diversity is this very important international tool to conserve biodiversity. And there was this biodiversity plan that went through 2020. What do you think it needs to look like looking forward from 2020?There are three things we need to do. One, we need to change the rules for wildlife trade. We need to stop the illegal trade and we need a massive effort to do it. We need to increase the number of protected areas throughout the world and find incentives to maintain all the natural habitats still left that are not protected. I think the world needs to invest probably $50 billion or $100 billion (€43 billion or €85 billion) a year specifically on these issues, on how to protect biodiversity.What you're describing sounds almost like a Paris Agreement for species.It is different to the Paris Agreement because we don't need to change the economy of the world to do it. And by doing it, we can create a lot of wealth. We know what to do. We just need to have the rules and the incentive to do it properly. This has to be like the Paris Agreement for biodiversity - but let's understand that if we lose all these species and the whole full range of climate change unravels on Earth, there is no way we will survive.This interview was conducted by Sonya Diehn for DW's Living Planet and has been edited and condensed for clarity."
449	4	"Despite the pandemic, almost two thirds of people around the world now view climate change as a global emergency.That's the key finding from the largest opinion poll yet conducted on tackling global warming. More than a million people in 50 countries took part in the survey, with almost half the participants aged between 14 and 18.Conserving forests and land emerged as the most popular solution for tackling the issue. The poll, called the ""People's Climate Vote"", has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme in conjunction with Oxford University.The organisers distributed poll questions through adverts in mobile gaming apps across 50 countries, between October and December last year. Around 1.22 million people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds took part, but with significant numbers of younger people. Some 550,000 people aged 14-18 took part. Across all countries, 64% of participants saw climate change as an emergency, requiring urgent responses from countries.  The margin of error was +/- 2%.This result varied somewhat by age and location.In the UK and Italy, 81% agreed with the question, while this dropped to 50% among those responding from Moldova.Newly installed US President Joe Biden can take some comfort that 65% of those in the US taking part now view climate change as an emergency.Overall, younger people were more likely to agree with the view that rising temperatures were an emergency, with nearly 70% in favour. For people over the age of 60, this dropped to 58%. ""People are scared, they are seeing the the wildfires in Australia and California, they're seeing the category five storms and in the Caribbean, they are seeing flooding in in Southeast Asia,"" said Cassie Flynn, strategic adviser to the UNDP.""And they're looking around them and they're saying, this is a real problem. We have to do something about this.""The actions that people tend to favour when it comes to tackling climate change depend, to some extent, on where people live. In eight of the 10 countries with the highest emissions from generating electricity, there were majorities in favour of using more green energy.But in countries with bigger emissions from deforestation and land use changes, there was majority support for conserving forests and land. This emerged from the overall survey as the most popular policy for dealing with climate change, by a narrow margin.The least-favoured options for tackling climate change in this survey were a plant-based diet, with only 30% of respondents believing it to be the best. Germany, with 44%, and the UK, with 43%, were the countries where plant-based diets received the strongest support. The authors say that across all countries, remarkably few people declined to support any policy.Pakistan emerged as the country with the greatest number of people not favouring any policy, at 5%.It was followed by the United States, with 4%.One of the key differences that emerged in the data was the level of education. ""When it comes to demographics, something that we saw very clearly was that there is a high correlation between a level of education and belief in the climate emergency. The more educated you are, the more likely you are to believe that there is a climate emergency,"" said Cassie Flynn.""And this is really, really powerful, because it doesn't matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your age, education really, really is important.""While the overall findings show roughly the same responses from men and women, there were quite pronounced differences at the country level.In Canada, women and girls were 12% more likely to say that climate change is an emergency than men and boys.The US, UK and Australia had smaller differences in the same direction. In contrast, India, Georgia, Vietnam and Nigeria went in the opposite direction, with men and boys being 9-12% more likely to say that warming is an emergency. With a new president in the White House who is making climate change a priority, and with a key global conference taking place in Glasgow later this year, the organisers of the poll believe that it is an important time for world leaders to hear a wide range of voices on climate change.""How they respond to the climate crisis, how they respond to the Covid crisis, is really going to chart an entirely new pathway. And so in many ways, it is this moment of choice,"" said Cassie Flynn from UNDP.""And what we wanted to do with the people's climate vote is to bring people's voices to that decision making, to bring people's voices to the climate debate."""
88	4	By Michael Hanlon for the Daily Mail  Published:  00:02 AEDT, 18 July 2012   |  Updated:  03:28 AEDT, 18 July 2012    23View  commentsWhat is causing our bad weather? Is it climate change? This is important because if we decide it is then we are going to have to take a lot of decisions very quickly that will be different to the decisions we make if we decide that the wind and endless rain have nothing to do with global warming.The picture is confused. Last week a report by Met Office scientists suggested that melting Arctic sea ice could weaken the summer jetstreams and push them south – the situation seen this year where depressions have come marching in across northwest Europe in rapid succession.Perhaps the most dramatic and visible impact of climate change to date has been the reduction in Arctic sea ice cover and, particularly, thickness, seen in the last 20 years or so. The ice grows back in winter of course but, the evidence suggests, each year (on average) perhaps a little thinner than before. This makes the North Atlantic a little warmer than otherwise, reducing the temperature gradient between Polar and Tropical air and hence taking some of the wind (literally) out of the jetstream’s sails.Global warming: It's tempting to think this might be the future of British summersSo, the overall effect of global warming will be to make our summers cooler and damper. The trouble is, this contradicts what most of the computer models have been saying to date, namely that in Britain we can expect hotter, drier summers and milder, damper winters. I spoke to Kate Willett, a climate scientist at the Met Office who agrees that the picture is confusing. “Yes, this contradicts the model of wetter winters and drier summers,” she says. It is also true, she adds, that since 2007 Arctic sea ice levels have been exceptionally low but it is not true that the last five summers have been exceptionally bad – those of 2010 and 2011 were average or a little above average in terms of sunshine and temperature.To confuse matters further, there is some evidence that general oceanic warming may be having a more profound effect than even melting ice, increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere (up by 4% since the 1970s) and causing huge amounts of rain to be dumped on places fringing the oceans, including Britain.If you ring up the Met Office and ask them ‘what is causing this terrible summer?’ the official line is ‘we don’t know’. The weathermen and women understand the immediate cause, of course, that now-famous misbehaving North Atlantic Jetstream, but just why it is misbehaving and whether this forms part of a long-term trend or is simply a one-off remains a mystery.Terrible summer: A graffiti artist in Liverpool reflects the national moodThe effects of climate change on Britain are unlikely to be straightforward. I have never had much doubt that those models of the 1990s, the ones predicting endless heatwave summers in the decades ahead, vineyards coating the Pennine fells, fields of maize replacing barley and wheat, were little more than fantasies. The fact is that the British archipelago lies betwixt two huge and competing weather systems, that of the Atlantic and that of Eurasia. The former warm, wet and windy the latter more stable, cold in winter and hot and dry in summer. A change in prevailing wind direction by just a degree or two, the movement of a Jetstream by a few tens of miles is enough to make the difference between a summer scorcher and a washout.So are there any predictions we CAN make? Well, despite the confusion over how the individual seasons will pan out, there does seem to be a consensus that in a warmer world generally we will see more extremes. We might expect to see rainfall becoming more concentrated, for instance. It is not generally appreciated that Britain, at least its southeastern half, is a rather dry place (the oft-quoted fact that London receives less rain than Rome is as true as it is widely disbelieved). Because it is dry places like London do not have an infrastructure in place to cope with heavy rain, and this is getting worse as population increases and land use changes. If we believe that the late 21st Century will be a time of summer flash-floods, it would make a great deal of sense to revisit our planning laws and see if we can do something about the tendency to cover all exposed land in concrete or tarmac. In a more extreme world it makes sense for cities to build high and dense, rather than to sprawl.We need to think about how we manage our rivers and invest as heavily in new drains and sewers as we do in supply pipes. This is not glamorous stuff – like sunbathing on the Cornish costas and the Cumbrian wines predicted by the old global warming forecasts – but it needs to be done nonetheless.The good news is that if you average out what the models say it is clear that our part of the world may come out of climate change relatively unscathed. It is places like central and West Africa, the Amazon Basin, the American Mid-West and southern Asia that are likely to see the really spectacular effects of climate change, and these effects will for the most part not be pleasant.In the short term, it is looking like the weather may at last be about to get back to normal, with several days of warm sunshine predicted for the week or two ahead. If August 2012 is a time for barbecues and record-breaking Olympic sprints under sizzling skies, the early-summer washout will be forgotten as quickly as it became a national talking point.
383	5	"US President Joe Biden has signed a new batch of executive actions placing the climate crisis back on the United States government agenda and elevates science to presidential advisory status.Climate change has been blamed for severe weather conditions and climate-related catastrophes such as storms, flooding, heatwaves and wildfires in recent years. According to the think-tank Germanwatch, these disasters have killed 500,000 in the last 20 years and have cost the global economy a staggering $2.56tr in the last 100 years.Biden’s orders on Wednesday map out the direction for the Democratic president’s climate change and environmental agenda and mark a reversal from policies under his predecessor Donald Trump, who sought to maximise US oil, gas and coal output by removing regulations and easing environmental reviews.“In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis,” Biden said at a White House ceremony, noting the threats the nation faces from intensifying storms, wildfires and droughts linked to climate change.“This is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one and the same. When I think of climate change and the answers to it, I think of jobs,” Biden added.“The stakes on climate change couldn’t be higher than they are right now,” Biden’s climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, said in earlier news conference on Wednesday.“It is existential.”“By instituting a holistic approach, the President is ensuring that climate change becomes a priority for every relevant federal agency and the federal government will lead by example."" https://t.co/cPY477NiMX— WWF News (@WWFnews) January 27, 2021Biden’s focus on climate change has cheered international partners and environmental advocates.In a statement, the World Wildlife Fund welcomed the White House’s decision and vowed to help “turn these bold promises into ambitious and effective action.”“By instituting a holistic approach, the President is ensuring that climate change becomes a priority for every relevant federal agency and the federal government will lead by example.”The Big Oil lobby, however, expressed disappointment, saying the decision will cost the US millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.But the Biden administration argued that by tackling climate change, the country will be able to save billions more in the long-term, instead of spending money dealing with natural disasters.Biden also set a goal to conserve 30 percent of federal land and waters by 2030 to protect wildlife.The orders affect large swaths of acreage onshore in mostly Western states, as well as offshore drilling acreage located mainly in the US Gulf of Mexico, which combined make up about a quarter of the nation’s oil and gas supply.“We can’t afford to play games with the millions of hardworking Americans whose livelihoods depend on a vibrant energy sector,” Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz said in a tweet.“President Biden and radical environmentalists are trying to eviscerate our energy independence and our blue-collar economy,” he said.WATCH: Hundreds laid off last week because of President Biden’s decision to cancel the #KeystonePipeline. pic.twitter.com/1jiDqwR3jX— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) January 26, 2021On Wednesday, Kerry also announced that Biden will host an international climate summit on Earth Day on April 22.The sweeping new change come with the creation of new interagency climate task force, which will be led by White House domestic climate policy adviser Gina McCarthy.During Wednesday’s news conference, McCarthy stressed that the executive order makes good on several of Biden’s campaign promises to tackle climate change while also securing good paying union job and achieving climate justice.“Today’s executive order starts by saying that it is the policy of this administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of US foreign policy and national security,” McCarthy said."
755	5	"Scientists are normally a pretty measured bunch. But in recent months, they've been resorting to some unusual language to get our attention. One top climatologist recently tweeted: ""If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd."" When scientists start swearing in public, it is time for everyone to start worrying. It's not just the scientists that are raising the alarm. This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history. If they weren't listening before, our leaders should tune in now. The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time it's no longer an environmental issue, it's an everybody issue.And time is short. The world is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic feedback loops and tipping points in the climate system, which could see the support system of life itself irrecoverably disrupted. From the release of gigantic amounts of arctic methane gas, to the rapid carbon acidification of our oceans, to apocalyptic flooding, the continued warming of our planet is the greatest challenge our species has faced.  The stakes seem too gargantuan to grasp, but it's this leap in consciousness that's required for our survival. Our civilization is built on a fragile, delicately interdependent, and unsustainable relationship with the natural world. We can't afford to underestimate the massive footprint that humans have on this planet. One quarter of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere came from our industries. Our oceans are acidifying 10 times faster than at any point in earth's history. We are stretching the limits of this world. But none of this is grounds for despair. The solution to the nightmare of runaway climate change is crystal clear, and beautiful. We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation. This goal is entirely achievable. Already, 22% of the world's electricity comes from clean energy and the sector is growing fast -- we just need to put our foot on the accelerator.   'I'm on the front lines of this crisis'Getting to 100% clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies, profits and influence are all at stake. But this change is possible - we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels. In May, Denmark published a plan to get to 100% clean by 2050, at a cost of less than 20 Euros per Dane per year.   Countries as diverse as Norway and Uruguay are already nearly at 100% clean. Even China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on Earth. The question is not whether we will make this breakthrough, but whether we do so before it is too late. The clock is ticking, the increase in temperature rising steadily towards the 2 degrees Celsius mark - the red line that both scientists and governments have said poses unacceptable risk of the unthinkable.And that is why the People's Climate March is so critical. There is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking. The street is how we close that gap, because politicians will move faster when people move them. Most large-scale social change has been spurred by movements, from ending slavery to giving women the right to vote. Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements we've ever seen.  On Sunday, that movement will step forward. A new cast of characters in an unprecedentedly broad coalition and cross section of society will take to the street. Climate change has gone beyond environmentalism, it's now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security. It's about the survival of everything we love.  The UN Climate summit happening two days after the march is an opportunity to build momentum, no more. The Paris summit next year is when we'll need our leaders to sign a new global agreement. If we learned one thing from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, it's that one global summit will never be a panacea. But the thud of peoples boots marching across the planet together with 130 leaders meeting to discuss a collective response to this crisis heralds a fresh momentum for the road ahead. Even before the mobilization has happened, political leaders are responding to it. Some are even joining the march.   In the final analysis, the question is whether we human beings are capable of being wise, farsighted, and unified enough to pass this test of survival. Many civilizations have fallen to the consequences of outstripping their environments. But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life. One way or another, we may be the last civilization. For the sake of our children and their children, we must find the hope, wisdom and unity to save it.

690	0	The unbeaten Central Pulse appear to be certain winners of the 2020 ANZ Premiership, after a dominant 44-38 win over the Northern Mystics.  A dismal first quarter showing from the Mystics in the top of the table clash on Saturday in Auckland made it impossible for the side to recover from.  Down 13-5 after twelve minutes, the Mystics only made one change, bringing Saviour Tui on for Asher Grapes at goal attack, but this didn’t seem to help the Mystics on attack.  The Pulse have now recorded seven wins from as many matches and appear to have too many weapons for whichever teams will meet them in the finals series, with the Mystics second on the table.  READ MORE: * ANZ Premiership: Tactix pip Mystics, Stars edge Magic in pair of Sunday night thrillers * ANZ Premiership: Central Pulse edge Northern Mystics to remain undefeated * ANZ Premiership: Mystics beat Magic in first game back after Covid-19 lockdown * Central Pulse the side to beat as ANZ Premiership netball returns  Mystics star shooter Grace Nweke had little support from her respective goal attacks, with Grapes having no attempts in the first quarter and Tui ending on 1/1 after three quarters on court.  The 1.93m shooter had a rough first half, being marked by fellow tall timber Kelly Jury, with only fourteen attempts and five turnovers over 24 minutes. Nweke improved her volume in the second half, but the Mystics could not overcome their sloppy start.  Down by fourteen goals at half time, the Mystics redeemed themselves in the second half, reducing the deficit to only six goals at fulltime, barely missing out on a bonus point.  Pulse wing defence Karin Burger shut down the usually impressive connection between Toeava and Nweke, with Burger having a 23cm height advantage over 1.61m Toeava.  Toeava was taken off in favour of Emma Iversen in the second quarter, but Burger still dominated her opposition for the full game, coming away with four gains and three intercepts in her MVP performance.  The Pulse’s shooting stats of 44/59 at 75 per cent were well below their usual standards, with the side averaging 89 per cent from the first five rounds. Despite the Pulse having 19 more attempts, the accuracy of Nweke ensured the margin was a lot smaller.  Silver Ferns captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio shared the goal attack role for the Pulse with Tiana Metuarau, being rested for part of the game after rolling her ankle.  Katrina Rore was a key player for the Pulse, playing a full game at goal defence and shutting down the Mystics goal attacks. The Pulse captain reflected on her role: “As a shorter goal defence, my job is to get the goal attack’s possession rate down.” Mystics coach Helene Wilson defended the lack of volume from her goal attacks, saying that neither Grapes or Tui normally play at goal attack, so their team has had to adapt following the loss of Bailey Mes.  “Playing a full game back to back against Silver Ferns is a massive ask for any player and they are both doing a good job. We need to keep supporting them because they’re the future of netball in New Zealand and they’re getting out there and giving it a go and we can’t ask any more of that.”
794	4	The massive melting of glaciers as a result of global heating has caused marked shifts in the Earth’s axis of rotation since the 1990s, research has shown. It demonstrates the profound impact humans are having on the planet, scientists said.The planet’s geographic north and south poles are the point where its axis of rotation intersects the surface, but they are not fixed. Changes in how the Earth’s mass is distributed around the planet cause the axis, and therefore the poles, to move.In the past, only natural factors such as ocean currents and the convection of hot rock in the deep Earth contributed to the drifting position of the poles. But the new research shows that since the 1990s, the loss of hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice a year into the oceans resulting from the climate crisis has caused the poles to move in new directions.The scientists found the direction of polar drift shifted from southward to eastward in 1995 and that the average speed of drift from 1995 to 2020 was 17 times faster than from 1981 to 1995.Since 1980, the position of the poles has moved about 4 metres in distance.“The accelerated decline [in water stored on land] resulting from glacial ice melting is the main driver of the rapid polar drift after the 1990s,” concluded the team, led by Shanshan Deng, from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Gravity data from the Grace satellite, launched in 2002, had been used to link glacial melting to movements of the pole in 2005 and 2012, both following increases in ice losses. But Deng’s research breaks new ground by extending the link to before the satellite’s launch, showing human activities have been shifting the poles since the 1990s, almost three decades ago.The research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, showed glacial losses accounted for most of the shift, but it is likely that the pumping up of groundwater also contributed to the movements.Groundwater is stored under land but, once pumped up for drinking or agriculture, most eventually flows to sea, redistributing its weight around the world. In the past 50 years, humanity has removed 18tn tonnes of water from deep underground reservoirs without it being replaced.Vincent Humphrey, at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and not involved in the new research said it showed how human activities have redistributed huge amounts of water around the planet: “It tells you how strong this mass change is – it’s so big that it can change the axis of the Earth.” However, the movement of the Earth’s axis is not large enough to affect daily life, he said: it could change the length of a day, but only by milliseconds.Prof Jonathan Overpeck, at the University of Arizona, US, told the Guardian previously that changes to the Earth’s axis highlighted “how real and profoundly large an impact humans are having on the planet”.Some scientists argue that the scale of this impact means a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene – needs to be declared. Since the mid-20th century, there has been a marked acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the destruction of wildlife and the transformation of land by farming, deforestation and development.
719	5	"A report released by the World Health Organization on Wednesday details the public health benefits that could come with tackling the issue.Meeting the commitments of the 2015 Paris climate agreement could save millions of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars by the middle of the century, according to the report.Meeting the goals put forth in the Paris agreement would be expected to save more than 1 million lives a year from air pollution alone by 2050, it says. Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.The Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.Global leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that ""we are in deep trouble with climate change.""What needs to be doneThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.""The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,"" the authors wrote.""Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,"" according to the report.The report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.Those recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.The report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies. General climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.Only about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'The new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication. She was not involved in the report.In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.Then, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change showed how extreme heat from climate change already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide.Also last month, the US government's National Climate Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to climate change-related impacts.The new WHO report comes with a message that ""addressing climate change is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,"" Sarfaty said. ""The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit."" As for the Paris Agreement, ""there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,"" she said.""This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,"" she said. The drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health, who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento were the world's three ""most polluted cities"" in mid-November due to those wildfires, according to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites.The air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area. For instance, ""after the 2017 Northern California fires were out -- Sonoma and Napa were two of the counties -- survivors who did not have a pre-existing respiratory condition were reporting respiratory symptoms still six months out,"" Hertz-Picciotto said.""So that's some of what we're seeing,"" she said. ""And that's just one tiny piece"" of this larger discussion around climate change and health.As mentioned in the new WHO report, ""at the local level people can make really important changes, and that can help empower communities and in fact make meaningful changes at those local levels that will both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be helpful in improving health and in terms of making cities more livable,"" she said. ""One of the main -- and critical -- messages in this report is that you can't really separate climate changes from health -- both in the short-run and the long-run."""
561	5	The state’s heat waves, blackouts, and fires—amid a pandemic—offer a warning of our fossil-fuel future.When I moved to California five years ago, I planted a tree in my yard. It was a Red Baron peach, chosen for its showy, bright-pink blossoms and its ability to grow fruit with few cool nights. For the past nine centuries, Southern California has been perfect for this tree, with mild winters and mild summers.I planted the Red Baron for the climate we once had. That climate is no more. My neighborhood has already warmed by more than 2 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial period—twice the global average. In my short time as a Californian, I’ve seen a years-long drought. I’ve evacuated my home as a wildfire closed in. I’ve lived through unprecedented heat waves.Annie Lowrey: California is becoming unlivableTrees, like all living beings, need time and stability to grow. But these essentials are no longer available. And it’s not just my backyard trees that are threatened under a changing climate. Many people have been grieving from the news that we may have lost some of the most majestic coastal redwoods to these latest fires. These giants have stood for more than a thousand years.For my generation, and the ones coming up behind us, the simple act of planting trees now requires a leap of faith. I worry about how long they will last before they are taken by drought or fire. And if we can’t plan for our trees’ future, how are we supposed to plan for our children’s?Right now my friends across the state are staring down disaster after disaster, suffering through climate change in action while they struggle with the ongoing pandemic.Last week, a heat wave baked the West. In Death Valley, a world record may have been set for the hottest temperature observed on Earth: 130 degrees Fahrenheit. From Phoenix, Arizona, to the Bay Area, people turned up their air-conditioning, straining California’s electricity infrastructure, because the state imports power from its neighbors. Demand outstripped supply, and the grid operator started rolling blackouts. The cause is climate change: It has made heat waves five times more likely to occur in the western United States.During the blackouts, California had unusually intense lightning strikes, which dotted the darkened landscape with electricity from the sky. These storms triggered fires across Northern California, forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes. Climate change has increased fire risk, and lengthened the fire season. It’s only August, and already more land has burned in California this year than all of 2019.These climate disasters are happening against the backdrop of the still uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak, which makes it harder for people to flee to safety. Evacuating to a friend’s house or a community center when a highly contagious illness is circulating is not a simple choice.Read: Two disasters are exponentially worse than oneThose theoretically “safe” in their homes don’t have it easy, either. Without electricity, many Californians have to choose between opening the windows and breathing in air choked with smoke, or keeping them closed in a hot house. My friend posted a picture of herself wearing an N95 mask with an exhalation valve, and a surgical mask on top: the first to protect herself against the smoke, the second to protect others from the virus.I don’t want to live in a world where we have to decide which mask to wear for which disaster, but this is the world we are making. And we’ve only started to alter the climate. Imagine what it will be like when we’ve doubled or tripled the warming, as we are on track to do.Climate change is not just destabilizing California’s grid. The East Coast is facing down a deadly hurricane season and has already seen outages for 1.4 million people. An unprecedented wind storm—which some are calling an “inland hurricane”—left a quarter million people in the Midwest without power.Yet some people refuse to acknowledge that climate change is the cause of the problems California is facing. The Wall Street Journal published a misleading editorial blaming the state’s reliance on renewable energy for the outages.In reality, several fossil-gas plants unexpectedly went offline when the heat wave struck, resulting in less available power. Gas plants can struggle to operate in the heat. In an ironic twist, burning fossil fuels will become less reliable in our hotter world. And California’s grid is connected to other states’, so when a heat wave spikes electricity demand from Arizona to Nevada, that leaves less power to import. With lower rainfall and many years of drought—again, caused in part by climate change—many of the state’s hydropower plants were also underperforming.Read: This is what adapting to climate change looks likeSimple human error also contributed to the blackouts. The agency in charge of operating the grid was confused about which plants were available to make electricity. One renewable-energy plant—a geothermal power station—was actually providing more power than the grid operator expected. The CEO of California’s grid operator put it simply: Renewables “are not a factor” in the blackouts.My electric utility echoed this view in an email that urged people with solar power at home to help out. Despite electric utilities attacking rooftop-solar policy for the past decade, homes that produce extra power deliver excess energy to the grid, helping neighbors in need. More clean energy is a good thing.California must continue on the path it has been on for years: leading the world in building the clean economy. In 1978, the state set its first goal for clean energy, aiming for 1 percent of power from wind energy. Forty years later, we now have a goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2045 in state law.If anything, California must move faster. And we must get states from the Midwest to the South to do the same. The Biden campaign’s pledge to reach 100 percent clean power by 2035 exemplifies the kind of leadership we need in this time of crisis. Cleaning up our electricity system will allow us to eliminate about 80 percent of our carbon emissions, because we can use this clean power to fuel our cars, our homes, and some of our industries. Doing this will be a lot of work—so it will create millions of good-paying jobs that can’t be taken overseas.We have seen what using fossil fuels has done to California. They have poisoned communities. Dirtied our air. And led to record fires, heat waves, and drought. We are not going back.I still believe we can tackle the climate crisis. I’m still planting fruit trees in my backyard. At last count, I have 34—one for each year I’ve circled the sun. I don’t know how long they will stand, but I will keep doing everything I can to ensure their future.What’s happening in California has a name: climate change. It doesn’t have to be this way. A better world is possible. For all of us, for all of our children, and even for our trees.
375	3	WASHINGTON — The White House has removed the scientist responsible for the National Climate Assessment, the federal government’s premier contribution to climate knowledge and the foundation for regulations to combat global warming, in what critics interpreted as the latest sign that the Trump administration intends to use its remaining months in office to continue impeding climate science and policy.Michael Kuperberg, executive director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which produces the climate assessment, was told Friday that he would no longer lead that organization, people with knowledge of the situation said.According to two people close to the administration, he is expected to be replaced by David Legates, a deputy assistant secretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who previously worked closely with climate change denial groups.Dr. Kuperberg’s departure comes amid a broader effort, in the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s defeat last week by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., to remove officials who have fallen afoul of the White House. Also on Friday, Neil Chatterjee, head of the agency that regulates the nation’s utility markets, was demoted by the White House, after he publicly supported the use of renewable power.In a message to colleagues, Dr. Kuperberg said he was returning to his previous job at the Department of Energy. He was removed from the list of staff on the research program’s website on Monday.Dr. Kuperberg did not respond to requests for comment. The Global Change Research Program reports to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Asked why Dr. Kuperberg had been removed from the role, Kristina Baum, a spokeswoman for that office, said on Monday that “we do not comment on personnel matters.”Dr. Kuperberg’s dismissal appears to be the latest setback in the Trump administration for the National Climate Assessment, a report from 13 federal agencies and outside scientists that the government is required by law to produce every four years. The most recent report, in 2018, found that climate change poses an imminent and dire threat to the United States and its economy.A biased or diminished climate assessment would have wide-ranging implications.It could be used in court to bolster the positions of fossil fuel companies being sued for climate damages. It could counter congressional efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming.And, ultimately, it could weaken what is known as the “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that said carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and therefore are subject to government regulation. Undercutting that finding could make it more difficult to fight climate change under the terms of the Clean Air Act.The agency most involved in that report is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the country’s premier climate science agency. In September, the White House installed at NOAA new political staff who have questioned the science of climate change. People familiar with the administration’s strategy said the aim was to use NOAA’s influence to undercut the National Climate Assessment.“They’re trying to just do a takeover of all this stuff so they can control the National Climate Assessment thinking,” said Judith Curry, a former chairwoman of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in an interview Monday.One of the new political hires was Dr. Legates, a professor at the University of Delaware’s geography department and now a deputy administrator at NOAA who has worked closely for years with climate denial groups and has argued that carbon dioxide “is plant food and not a pollutant.” Dr. Legates is now being considered to take Dr. Kuperberg’s position as head of the Global Change Research Program, according to two people including Myron Ebell, a director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and a former member of Mr. Trump’s transition team.Mr. Ebell, whose organization has championed the appointment of Dr. Legates and others who question the established science of climate change, said the intention is for him to lead the program while continuing to hold his position at NOAA. “It might be a short-term appointment,” Mr. Ebell said, given the election of President-elect Biden, who has said he will embrace aggressive efforts to tackle climate change.“If he only directs it for two months and a week, then he may not get very far, but let’s see what can get done in two months. Maybe the next administration will throw it all away, but maybe some changes will be adopted, who knows,” Mr. Ebell said.Marc Morano, a prominent denier of established climate change science, cheered the departure of Mr. Kuperberg and said he expects Mr. Legates to be named. “The Trump administration is ‘listening to the science’ by clearing out the anti-science promoters of extreme climate scenarios. These moves are long, long overdue,” he said.Dr. Legates did not respond to a request for comment.Federal employees, who asked not be identified because they were concerned about retaliation from the White House, said they worried that the administration’s goal in removing Dr. Kuperberg was to make it easier to pick authors for the report who also question the severity of climate change. Those who have publicly attacked climate science, like Mr. Ebell and Mr. Morano, said that is the goal.While the incoming Biden administration could reverse those decisions, doing so would slow down the production of the climate assessment. The next edition, which was supposed to be released by 2022, has already been pushed back to 2023.Dr. Kuperberg’s removal isn’t the only example of the Trump administration taking steps that could impede climate policy in its final months. Mr. Chatterjee, a Republican who was demoted Friday as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, had recently drawn White House ire. He had supported a series of proposals that would expand use of large-scale battery storage in the power grid, thus encouraging the use of wind and solar power, while allowing electric utilities to charge a user fee for power generated from coal and natural gas, which would discourage the use of those fossil fuels.Like the findings of the National Climate Assessment, the moves by Mr. Chatterjee were at odds with Mr. Trump’s policies, which have been aimed at aggressively increasing the use of coal and other fossil fuels, chiefly by reducing regulations. The White House replaced Mr. Chatterjee as chairman of the panel with another member of the commission, James Danly, who has opposed efforts to promote renewable power.“It is 100 percent retribution,” said Mr. Chatterjee in a telephone interview, of the White House move to demote him from his chairmanship. “This validates my independence and integrity. I’m going to hold my head up high.”A White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said that the White House would not comment on personnel matters. Mr. Chatterjee will remain on the five-member commission, and said he intends to serve out his current term, which ends in June.Rachel Licker, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, criticized the actions of Trump administration officials. “Even in their final days, they are continuing to attempt to bury the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.”
177	5	“Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing.”That was what Bill Gates recently told me.At a time when companies and investors increasingly say they are focused on climate and sustainability issues, some of them may be about to collide with the reality of another financial trend, one currently worth about $1 trillion: Bitcoin.The cryptocurrency has become inescapable, with big companies like Tesla and individual investors alike rushing to stock up on the digital token.But depending on which study you read, the annual carbon emissions from the electricity required to mine Bitcoin and process its transactions are equal to the amount emitted by all of New Zealand. Or Argentina.To put this into perspective, one Bitcoin transaction is the “equivalent to the carbon footprint of 735,121 Visa transactions or 55,280 hours of watching YouTube,” according to Digiconomist, which created what it calls a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. (Critics of this comparison point out that the average Bitcoin transaction is worth about $16,000, while the average Visa transaction is worth $46.37, but you get the point.)And as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the more resources its ecosystem consumes. What’s happening, in a nutshell: So-called miners verify transactions involving the cryptocurrency by using computers to solve increasingly complex mathematical equations. They earn bitcoins for their work, meaning that the more popular the currency becomes, the more competition there is to mine new tokens.“As the resource intensity of running Bitcoin has increased over recent years, it has become a serious concern for its potential impact on health and climate,” Alex de Vries, a data scientist who put the index together, wrote in the journal Energy Research & Social Science.All of which raises a crucial question: Does the movement among investors toward companies that rank highly for environmental, social and governance issues pose an existential threat to Bitcoin’s success?After all, Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock — the largest money manager in the world, with $9 trillion under management — has said that all investments the company makes in the future will be evaluated, in part, on how they plan to meet the climate challenge. Perhaps more important, investors are clamoring for companies to disclose their carbon footprint, and a group called the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures is working on creating a global standard.If that’s the case, how will investors view the likes of PayPal, which has been a vocal proponent of climate initiatives — but last fall announced plans to allow customers to conduct transactions in Bitcoin?Or what about Square, the payments company founded by Jack Dorsey? It has become one of the most public proponents of Bitcoin, both dealing with transactions and also keeping the cryptocurrency on its own balance sheet. It holds about 5 percent of its cash reserves in Bitcoin, whose price has historically been deeply volatile.Then there is Tesla — a company whose entire premise is to help reduce climate change through lower carbon emissions — which has invested more than $1.5 billion of its balance sheet in Bitcoin. How would its Bitcoin holdings affect its sustainability score?Other companies are also considering whether to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. And financial firms like Guggenheim Partners have already invested in Bitcoin while Bank of New York Mellon says it will start financing Bitcoin transactions.Even Mr. Fink’s BlackRock has started to, in the words of a senior executive, “dabble” in the cryptocurrency by potentially allowing two of its funds to invest in Bitcoin futures. Rick Rieder, the firm’s chief investment officer of fixed income, cited investors’ interest in the asset and its increasing adoption by younger, tech-savvy customers.So far, Bitcoin’s carbon problem hasn’t slowed down its price, which was hovering Monday night around $50,000 for a token, up from about $8,000 a year ago.Its carbon problem is hardly a secret. As The Independent recently noted, Hal Finney, one of the early cryptologists, posted on Twitter in 2009: “Thinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation.”Will owning Bitcoin become a status symbol — or a scarlet letter for a new generation of climate-focused investors wise to the challenges it poses?The answer is complicated.Bitcoin supporters say that estimates of its carbon footprint are overstated. And if the computers that mine and help transact bitcoins are attached to an electric grid that uses wind and solar power, they add, mining and using it will become cleaner over time.“We believe that cryptocurrency will eventually be powered completely by clean power, eliminating its carbon footprint and driving adoption of renewables globally,” Mr. Dorsey of Square said in a statement as part of a commitment for his company to be net-zero on carbon emissions by 2030. The company committed $10 million to invest in new “green energy technologies within Bitcoin mining, and aims to accelerate its transition to clean power.”On this point Mr. Gates, who considers himself a Bitcoin skeptic unrelated to the climate issues, says it is possible that the challenges could be overcome, but he wasn’t convinced just yet.“If it’s green electricity and it’s not crowding out other uses, eventually, you know, maybe that’s OK,” he said.Several companies are working on some counterintuitive ideas to turn Bitcoin green. On Monday, Seetee, an investment company involved in cryptocurrency, said it planned to invest in Bitcoin “min­ing op­er­a­tions that trans­fer strand­ed or in­ter­mit­tent elec­tric­i­ty with­out sta­ble demand lo­cal­ly — wind, solar, hy­dro pow­er — to eco­nom­ic as­sets that can be used any­where.”In other words, the company plans to build wind and solar in places that might not be perfectly situated for the technology and will use the extra power to mine Bitcoin, making money in the process. “Bit­coin is, in our eyes, a load-bal­anc­ing eco­nom­ic bat­tery, and batteries are es­sen­tial to the en­er­gy tran­si­tion re­quired to reach the tar­gets of the Paris agreement,” the company said in its announcement.There are also new ways to conduct greener Bitcoin transactions. For example, users could batch transactions on something called a Lightning Network, essentially a payment channel between two users that would use less power to process transactions.PayPal, too, argues that those new protocols may change Bitcoin’s carbon footprint: “Not only are we assessing the climate impact of cryptocurrency, which is concentrated on Bitcoin, but also the entire industry is evolving in the assessment and measurement standards of the potential environmental impacts and more energy-efficient protocols are emerging.”In the near term, nearly two-thirds of all Bitcoin mining is taking place in China, and “mining activities can also be found in regions with coal-heavy power generation, such as in the province of Inner Mongolia,” according to a study in the scientific journal Joule, which also raises the idea of imposing a carbon tax. “Regulating this largely gambling-driven source of carbon emissions appears to be a simple means to contribute to decarbonizing the economy.”As for Mr. Fink of BlackRock, he said he was still skeptical of the entire idea of Bitcoin, before he can even contemplate the climate issues. “We are watching it,” he said. “Right now I’m more focused on efficacy.”
680	3	"The decision by the court came just a day after Brazil's National Environment Council, known as Conama, voted to overturn the measures that had defined the ecosystems along Brazil's coastline as ""permanent preservation areas"" and restricted commercial development projects. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles defended the move and said the changes provided greater ""balance"" in order to protect the environment. ""This government is concerned with the environment, with people and with sustainable economic development,"" Salles told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil during an interview Monday. ""You can't create legislation that is so excessive that it asphyxiates the economic sector completely.""Federal judge Maria Amelia Almeida Senos de Carvalho overturned the decision Tuesday, saying the repeal of violated the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment. ""Considering the evident risk of irretrievable damage to the environment, I defer the anticipation of the effects of the protection to suspend the effects of the revocation,"" she said in the judgment.  Mangroves are trees and shrubs that grow along tropical coastlines. They are rooted underwater in salty sediments, thriving in conditions few other plants can withstand. They tend to have large root systems that protect coastal areas from erosion and act as a bridge between the ocean and land. They are a home to numerous species of sea birds and are considered ""nursery habitats"" because they provide safe haven for young fish, crabs and shrimp. Crucially, mangroves are also some of the world's most effective carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide per area than rainforests. By removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, mangroves are playing an important part in climate change mitigation. According to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, mangroves, sea grasses and other marine living organisms capture more than half of the world's biological carbon. The commission estimates that these ecosystems absorb the equivalent of more than half of the emissions from the entire global transport sector each year.Critics said removing the protections by Brazil would endanger an essential part of the global fight against climate change and the preservation of Brazil's Atlantic coastline. Greenpeace said the decision was an example of ""calculated environmental destruction"" in Brazil.Carlos Bocuhy, the president of the Brazilian Institute of Environmental Protection (PROAM), called it the ""worst attack"" carried out by the Federal Government against the environment.""As the world witnesses the exponential burning of the Amazon and the Pantanal region, two of the world's richest and most important biomes, in shock -- Conama now opens the door to eliminate the rules that protect the mangroves and vegetation of our country's coastline,"" Bocuhy wrote in an op-ed.Bocuhy, who had previously been a member of the National Environment Council, was removed last year when the government reduced the seats from 96 members to 23.Bocuhy and others said the reducation was done, partially, in order for the federal government to have ultimate majority over the Council that is a key voice in the country's environmental regulations.The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for its approach to environmental regulations. In May, a video of a governmental meeting showed Salles, the environment minister, saying that the government should take advantage of the media's focus on the Covid-19 pandemic to loosen the environmental restrictions. The video from April 22 was disclosed during an investigation by the Supreme Court into allegations that Bolsonaro was trying to interfere with the Federal Police.The quote from Salles caught the media's attention. ""There is a need to have an effort on our side here, while we are at this moment of tranquility in terms of press coverage, because it only talks about Covid, and let the cattle herd run and change all the rules and simplifying standards,"" he said.Later, in an exclusive interview with CNN Brasil, Salles defended his stance saying it was aimed at reducing bureaucracy. ""What I defended in the meeting were regulations that do not need to go through Congress [to be approved],"" he said. Bolsonaro has also rejected criticism of his government's environmental policy, even as data from his own agency shows a growing problem, especially in the Amazon and the Pantanal.In 2019, his first year in office, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) counted 126,089 fires in the Amazon -- a rise of nearly 40% over the year before he took office. And despite a government ban on fires in the Amazon imposed in mid-July, INPE reported more fires in August and September than in the same period a year ago. INPE data also showed fires raging in the Pantanal, home to alligators, jaguars and many other animals. By mid-September, it had registered 16,119 heat spots in Pantanal in 2020, the most since 1998, when the institute started keeping record.Yet Bolsonaro has remained defiant.  Addressing UN member states in a pre-recorded address last week, Bolsonaro accused foreign actors of a ""brutal disinformation campaign"" about the supposed degradation of the Amazon as well as Brazil's Pantanal wetlands."
424	0	Saroj Khan, a Bollywood choreographer whose film career spanned more than 60 years, and who created some of the industry’s most famous dance scenes in the 1980s and ’90s, died on Friday morning in Mumbai. She was 71.A spokesman for Guru Nanak Hospital, where Ms. Khan had been hospitalized since mid-June, said the cause was cardiac arrest. She tested negative for Covid-19 a few days ago, according to The Indian Express.As Bollywood’s first female choreographer, Ms. Khan was a pioneer, one of the few women working behind the camera at a time when nearly all the technicians were men. She joined the industry as a 3-year-old child actress in the early 1950s, and she became an assistant choreographer at the age of 12.She choreographed nearly 2,000 songs, including many Bollywood classics. There was the frenetic “Ek Do Teen” from the movie “Tezaab” (1988), the raunchy “Choli Ke Peechay Kya Hai” from “Khalnayak” (1993), “Hawa Hawai” from “Mr. India” (1986), the sizzling “Dhak Dhak Karne Laga” from “Beta” (1991) and the lush songs from the period drama “Devdas” (2002). Much of her best-known work was in collaboration with the actresses Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi, who died in 2018.“I’m devastated by the loss of my friend and guru, Saroj Khan,” Ms. Dixit said on Twitter. “Will always be grateful for her work in helping me reach my full potential in dance. The world has lost an amazingly talented person. I will miss you.”Ms. Khan was known for outdancing some of Bollywood’s most famous dancers, teaching them to sway their hips, move their feet and emote in a dozen different ways. She incorporated elements of Indian classical and folk dances into her choreography.Saroj Khan was born Nirmala Nagpal on Nov. 22, 1948, in Mumbai. Her father, Kishanchand Sadhu Singh, had been a prosperous businessman in Karachi, in what is now Pakistan, but lost everything in the violent partition that divided the two countries in 1947. He and his wife, Noni, moved to Mumbai, where they started over in a tiny room in a slum.Ms. Khan was born in that room, the first of six children. She recalled dancing with shadows there as a toddler, fascinated even then by what would become her calling. To supplement the family’s income, her father managed to get her work in Mumbai’s booming film industry as an actress at the age of 3, under the name Saroj. She had small roles in a number of films before becoming a background dancer at age 10, appearing in the 1958 classic “Howrah Bridge,” starring the actress Madhubala.Soon afterward, Ms. Khan’s father died suddenly. In a 2012 documentary, “The Saroj Khan Story,” Ms. Khan described how her mother struggled to feed her and her siblings, and how they often went to bed hungry.On the eve of the Diwali holiday, Ms. Khan worked up the courage to ask the matinee star Shashi Kapoor for help. “I had just finished one song with him, I was the group dancer,” she said. “I went to him and told him, ‘Tomorrow is Diwali and I have nothing at home. I will get paid only after a week.’ He said, ‘I have 200 rupees right now, please take it.’ I’ll never forget it, that money helped me so much.”Ms. Khan never formally trained as a dancer. Most classical dancers spend years studying under a teacher before they ever perform in public, but with a family to help support, that was not an option for Ms. Khan.While still a young girl, she became an assistant to the choreographer B. Sohanlal, working with him on some of the biggest films of the time. He taught her the basics of kathak, a classical Indian dance.“When he started teaching me, I realized that I can’t keep a posture, I don’t know how to do this,” she recalled in the documentary. “He made me work very hard, I had to remain in the same posture for hours at a time, but he turned me into a good dancer.”She said that in 1961 she and Mr. Sohanlal, who was 43 and married, became a couple, though she was only 13 at the time. She referred to the relationship as a marriage, but it is unclear whether it was legally recognized. They had two children, but Mr. Sohanlal refused to give them his surname, and he left the family in 1973 to return to his first wife in the city of Chennai.In 1975, she married Sardar Roshan Khan, a businessman, taking his surname. They had a daughter, and Mr. Khan adopted Ms. Khan’s children from her relationship with Mr. Sohanlal.Her survivors include their daughter, Sukaina Khan; a son, Raju Khan, also a choreographer; and grandchildren. Another daughter, Kuku Khan, died in 2011.Ms. Khan struggled for years as an assistant choreographer before getting a break in 1974 with the thriller “Geeta Mera Naam,” the directorial debut of the actress Sadhana, who was a fan of her work. In the 1980s, she choreographed the sensual dances of Sridevi in a series of blockbusters: “Nagina” (1986), “Mr. India” (1987), “Chandni” (1989) and “Lamhe” (1991). But it was her work with Madhuri Dixit in the 1990s that made her a household name in India.The last film Ms. Khan worked on was the 2019 period drama “Kalank,” which reunited her with Ms. Dixit. Over the past two decades, Ms. Khan had also become a familiar face on Indian television, as a judge on dance shows like “Naach Baliye,” “Boogie Woogie” and “Jhalak Dikhla Ja.”Ms. Khan won three National Film Awards and eight Filmfare Awards, the most any choreographer has received.
413	4	"The Government have appointed the seven people who will shape climate change policy for the next half-decade. Climate Change minister James Shaw announced the full seven-person team of Climate Change Commissioners on Tuesday. The Commission was created by the Zero Carbon Act and will provide independent advice for governments on how to meet the emissions reductions targets put into law by the act, with regular ""emissions budgets"" set for governments to follow if they wish. While it will have no formal power the commission will be able to independently set out what it believes governments need to do to lower emissions.READ MORE: * James Shaw won the battle on climate change, not the war * Zero Carbon Bill comes back from select committee with controversial methane target intact * Emotional Dr Rod Carr says family pushed him to take top climate role The team is to be led by former Reserve Bank chair and University of Canterbury vice-chancellor Dr. Rod Carr, an announcement made earlier this year. He will serve a five-year term. Joining him is Ngāi Tahu kaiwhakahaere Lisa Tumahai as deputy commissioner and five other commissioners, who will stay for terms of between two and five years. Included are Dr. Harry Clark, the head of New Zealand's Agricultural Research Centre; Victoria University Professor James Renwick, one of the most visible and colourful climate scientists in the country; Dr. Judith Lawrence, a climate change research fellow with government experience; Motu economist Catherine Leining; and Massey University professor Nicola Shadbolt, who has extensive experience in agribusiness - including as a director at Fonterra. The commissioners were whittled down from around 200 nominations and a short list of 100, and were selected by Cabinet. Every political party in Parliament was consulted, according to a spokesman for Shaw. Shaw said the issue of climate change was ""too big for politics"" and the commission would protect climate policy from political mood swings. ""Our decision to create the Climate Change Commission was about protecting climate policy from political mood swings, meaning every future government can stay focused on the job at hand: to help solve climate change and make our communities are cleaner and healthier,"" Shaw said. ""We provided a bold legislative framework for what we need to do build a climate-friendly future for New Zealand; it is the Commission who will now advise us on how best to do that."" ""Whilst it is an advisory body, I fully expect that the impartial and scientifically rigorous analysis it will provide will help keep future governments' climate policy in check."" Shaw himself had an ambition that the Commission would have real power, not just advisory power, but this was stymied by NZ First. National's agriculture spokesman Todd Muller said he was pleased with the calibre of the candidates. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who was at the announcement, said the commissioners would provide a ""balanced"" view. ""When we started this Commission we were looking to provide a balance of Commissioners who are greatly experienced over a number of areas including agriculture,"" Peters said. ""There are 23,000 stakeholders out in rural New Zealand who need to be assured they can be in front of this change and not be the victims of it."""
816	4	With the rapid spread of the coronavirus beyond China, the president of the United States is hoping that spring temperatures will halt the contagion in its tracks the same way that common cold strains abate by summer.“You know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away, that’s true,” US President Donald Trump said last month.The mercury is once again rising faster, with January 2020 posting the highest temperatures on record for the first month of the year.But health experts are loath to assume that the number of new cases will fall as the northern hemisphere emerges from a mild winter.“No one knows for sure what warmer temperatures will mean for COVID-19 because it is a novel virus, but WHO [World Health Organization] has said that there is no evidence currently that we should expect this outbreak to subside with warming temperatures,” Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera.While global warming may not make the coronavirus go away, the outbreak is temporarily curbing carbon emissions. And financial experts say new sustainability criteria for assessing investment risks could help governments and the private sector initiate measures that could avoid future outbreaks.  ‘Falls in economic activity’More than 4,000 people have died of COVID-19, with 113 confirmed cases across 109 countries and territories, according to WHO. Regardless of how climate change might impact the dissemination of the coronavirus droplets, the disease is temporarily reducing carbon emissions in China and elsewhere as many factories remain shuttered and fuel consumption goes down.“The most immediate impact of coronavirus is falls in economic activity, which will reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions,” Faith Ward, chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership, told Al Jazeera.And as the spread of COVID-19 slows in China, some experts have called attention to major environmental improvements around Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began.“There do seem to be good data supporting the conclusion that emissions of GHGs and conventional air pollutants have gone down in China,” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.He told Al Jazeera that the airline industry is the best current example of such a decline in emissions.During a three-week span in China, daily flights went down from over 15,000 to barely 2,000, according to tracking firm Flightradar24.With Italy and other nations likely to copy aspects of China’s lockdown model, demand for air travel, oil and electricity could keep declining.Automobile use, manufacturing and industrial production have clearly dipped, causing fewer emissions. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that is released when fossil fuels are burned, have decreased some 40 percent in China – according to Washington Post analysis of data from the Sentinel-5P satellite.But if history is any guide, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may not last. The 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, oil shocks of the 1970s, and the 2008 financial crisis caused ephemeral drops in polluting activities – before the economy fell back into high-emissions mode.  Some business sustainability experts believe that as the public and private sectors become more cognizant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, this prism could provide a framework for more effectively meeting the challenges of climate change and viral epidemics.“Both coronavirus and climate change reinforce the need for investors to manage ESG issues or face rapidly escalating and global financial risks,” said Maria Lettini, executive director of the FAIRR Initiative, a collaborative investor network that represents $20 trillion in assets under management.“Mainstream investors such as BlackRock are now taking climate risk seriously and urging companies to do the same through processes like scenario analysis and setting science-based targets,” she told Al Jazeera.FAIRR – which raises awareness about sustainable food investment – is particularly focused on how the coronavirus itself is believed to have emerged from a live-animal market in Wuhan.“We need urgent engagement on diseases originating in animals destined for the food system, whether it’s coronavirus, African swine fever, or avian flu, or the many other animal pandemics in recent years,” Lettini added.She said coronavirus highlights “critical safety issues” and raised “a serious red flag”.With the next United Nations climate conference in Glasgow eight months away, it is too soon to tell whether governments will be still be too consumed by the fight against coronavirus to make meaningful progress in the battle to stem global heating.But with quarantines and lockdowns set to multiply exponentially, the connection between human and ecological well-being is becoming ever clearer.“Regulation may need to evolve to better safeguard public health and environmental outcomes,” said Lettini.
761	3	"Watch Climate Change Minister James Shaw on The AM Show.   Credits: Image - The AM Show / Twitter; Video - The AM ShowClimate Change Minister James Shaw copped criticism over plans to attend COP26 in Glasgow, but he's questioning why the same outrage didn't apply to Trade Minister Damien O'Connor. ""I do notice that none of this criticism was levelled at Damien O'Connor, our Trade Minister, and he's taken two trips this year so far,"" Shaw told The AM Show on Tuesday.Host Ryan Bridge questioned the need for Shaw to travel across the globe to attend an event, when O'Connor has been travelling abroad to secure trade deals - even if he did accidentally pose by an Australian flag.""So, what you're saying is making money is more important than a breathable atmosphere?"" Shaw shot back, to which Bridge replied: ""Well, that's a good point...""Shaw acknowledged the thousands of Kiwis stuck overseas unable to secure a place in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) - precious space taken up by the Green Party co-leader and 10 officials. ""Look, I really feel for those people who have been stuck overseas. I know you get contacted a lot by those people a lot - so do we - so we know the scale of tragedies that people are facing,"" Shaw said.  ""We've been quite strong advocates that MIQ should be more needs-based rather than more random at the moment.""If we want New Zealand to participate in international diplomacy whilst there is a pandemic on, that does mean that some ministers have to travel and so do some of our officials.""Shaw is adamant that attending COP26 via Zoom wasn't an option. ""We can't do it by Zoom. That was made abundantly clear over a year ago. When I talked to MFAT officials I said, 'Is this an option?' and they said, 'No, it isn't'. The United Kingdom has been abundantly clear that this will be an in-person event. ""If I'd been given the option, I would rather that that was available to us - and it isn't.""He said attending via Zoom probably wouldn't be possible. ""You've got to remember that there's about 30 different parallel rooms that are negotiating. They generally run for about 16 hours a day for a full two weeks. They involve 200 countries from around the world. ""Some of those negotiating rooms will have dozens and dozens of negotiators from dozens and dozens of countries in them, and I think the United Kingdom probably took the view that there isn't decision-making software available that would allow that to occur for 16 hours a day in 30 different parallel rooms for two weeks.""Shaw also defended the $1.3 billion the Government has committed over four years  to support countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. At least 50 percent of funding will go to the Pacific and the rest will go to international climate funds. ""We do have some concerns about our ability to deploy that amount of resource in the Pacific over the next few years but we will be aiming to deploy as much of that as we can in the Pacific because they are our closest neighbours, they are the most susceptible to the effects of climate change,"" Shaw said. He said the funding would be used in various ways. ""In Tokelau, you're seeing sea level rise come up over the atoll and it's getting into their freshwater supplies and so we're looking at freshwater remediation there. ""Fiji has asked us to help them move 43 villages away from the coastline to higher ground. ""And the Cook Islands, who of course have suffered a huge blow with the loss of their tourism industry, even before that, they think that they spend about 25 percent of their annual budget on either recovering the last cyclone or preparing for the next one.""Shaw recognised that Kiwis struggling financially through the COVID-19 lockdown might not understand why the Government is spending money on other countries. ""It's about $325 million a year is what we're deploying and you compare that to a government budget of over $110 billion a year ""If you look at what we're deploying in order to support people through the COVID crisis - the wage subsidy, business subsidies, and so on - it pales in comparison versus what we're spending here. ""I think the Government can walk and chew gum at the same time. People in the Pacific desperately need this support, they are not in a position - especially given COVID - to be able to build up that resilience themselves. ""This is a commitment that was made by the previous National Government when they signed up to the Paris Agreement, that we would be one of the countries that supported developing countries like those in the Pacific - and we can do that as well as looking after our people here at home. "
248	3	"A headteacher of an English primary school has banned students from sending Christmas cards out of concern for the environment.Jonathan Mason, head of Belton Lane Primary School in Grantham, Lincolnshire, said the holiday tradition contributes to carbon emissions. He also claimed a number of ""concerned"" students had approached him regarding the environmental impact of Christmas cards in the school.""Throughout the world, we send enough cards that if we placed them alongside each other, they'd cover the world's circumference 500 times. The manufacture of Christmas cards is contributing to our ever-growing carbon emissions,"" Mason told parents in a letter, published by the Daily Mail.""So in order to be environmentally friendly in school we will not be having a post box for Christmas cards from this year onwards.""He also encouraged parents to send one card to the whole class if they wished to make a holiday gesture. ""Teachers can then display the cards in the classroom for everyone to see,"" he wrote.Mason has since been labelled as a ""grinch"" by a number of unhappy parents, claiming the headteacher had ""the joy taken out of Christmas"".""Why can't all these cards be recycled anyway... these are a few Christmas cards once a year and to be told about this on a piece of paper seems contradictory,"" one unidentified parent told the Daily Mail.""Telling people to stop sending cards in a letter sent out to hundreds of kids stinks of rank hypocrisy,"" another said.""I hope parents boycott these Grinch-like plans and keep this tradition alive by sending lots of cards to their little pals."""
491	5	"One world problem, one corner of Wales - climate change is already ""happening before our eyes,"" according to a man watching the coastline closely.Aberystwyth is a seaside town which has already had experiences of extreme weather. Five years ago, properties were evacuated as waves crashed onto the promenade. It seems as good a place as any to take a look at what impact climate change may be having on communities.Its university is also the base for scientists who are researching the wider climate issues - and how we might adapt.And travel along the nearby Dyfi estuary and you find some of Wales' most important nature reserves and wildlife, which are vulnerable.Alun Williams, cabinet member for carbon management in Ceredigion, said rising sea levels were threatening its flood defences.The local authority is trying to plan how to manage the effects of climate change along the coast.Stood on the shingle ridge which acts as a barrier between land and sea at Tanybwlch beach near Aberystwyth, Mr Williams said: ""The sea is overtopping this bank much more regularly than it used to - it's just a matter of time before it breaks through and moves inland.""Rising sea levels and more frequent storms mean there are fears this defence could soon be breached.It is an example of how global warming is already affecting Wales - the country's 1,680 mile-long (2,700km) coastline is on the frontline, leaving local authorities like Ceredigion with difficult decisions to make.Mr Williams highlighted one area where the waves have carried an avalanche of pebbles down into the River Ystwyth on the other side of the ridge. Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. The council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.No homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.Elsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.""We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,"" Mr Williams urged.The changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.Some 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes ""all around us"".They include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.""A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,"" he said.But overall he claimed there were more ""losers than winners"" for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.""We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,"" he added.The salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.As a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.The ""headache"" - as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.""Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.""Farmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.Dr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.Hundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.""This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,"" Dr Corke explained.""Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.""By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,"" she said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to ""re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency"".""Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market. They require collective action and the government has a central role in making collective action possible,"" she said."
35	3	"The huge chunk of ice has broken away in Greenland. Photo / APAn enormous chunk of Greenland's ice cap has broken off in the far northeastern Arctic, a development that scientists say is evidence of rapid climate change.The glacier section has an area of 110km sq. It came off of in the fjord called Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, which is roughly 80km long and 20km wide, the National Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said on Monday.The glacier is at the end of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, where it flows off the land and into the ocean.Annual end-of-melt-season changes for the Arctic's largest ice shelf in northeast Greenland are measured by optical satellite imagery, the survey known as GEUS said. It shows that the area's ice losses for the past two years each exceeded 50km sq.The ice shelf has lost 160km sq, an area nearly twice that of Manhattan in New York, since 1999.""We should be very concerned about what appears to be progressive disintegration at the Arctic's largest remaining ice shelf,"" said GEUS professor Jason Box.""Another massive chunk of vital sea ice has fallen into the ocean,"" said Greenpeace spokeswoman Laura Meller, who is aboard the organisation's ship Arctic Sunrise at the edge of the sea ice. ""This is yet another alarm bell being rung by the climate crisis in a rapidly heating Arctic.""Last week, Ruth Mottram, an ice scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, said: ""Again this year, the ice sheet has lost more ice than has been added in the form of snow.""""What is thought-provoking is that if we ... had seen this meltdown 30 years ago, we would have called it extreme. So in recent years, we have become accustomed to a high meltdown.""In August, a study showed that Greenland lost a record amount of ice during an extra-warm 2019, with the melt massive enough to cover California in more than 1.25 metres of water."
873	5	"A legal loophole that allowed consents for large climate polluting projects to be granted without consideration of environmental impacts has been closed. Changes to the Resource Management Act (RMA) passed their final reading on Thursday, meaning consents for large projects can be declined if they will have significant climate change implications. Previously, under the RMA, decision-makers could not decline projects like coal mines and fossil fuel power stations, even if they thought the climate impacts were problematic and should be considered. Climate Change Minister and Green Party co-leader James Shaw said the passing of the Resource Management Amendment Bill was one of the most significant policy changes to address climate change made this parliamentary term. READ MORE: * Jobs or the environment - will the Govt have to choose? * A push for new coal mines amid 'alarming' fast-tracking of infrastructure * 'I will miss her dearly': Former Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons has died  The party has long called out the loophole, with former co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons having a member’s bill on the issue and campaigning for change up until her death last year, he said. ""She, and other former and current Green MPs, particularly Gareth Hughes, raised this as an ongoing problem that needed solving. “We are so glad in Government to have got it sorted. This aligns with our net zero carbon ambitions and will ultimately result in a safer planet for future generations. Environment Minister David Parker said the bill makes crucial environmental improvements to the RMA, particularly for freshwater. “[The bill] reduces complexity, increases certainty in the RMA and makes significant improvements to environmental outcomes,"" he said. As well as speeding up the process for regional freshwater plan changes, it introduces mandatory, enforceable farm environment plans and requires fertiliser sales to be reported on a regional basis. The bill also increases infringement fees for polluters, increases timeframes for councils to file prosecution charges, and gives the Environmental Protection Authority new enforcement powers. The changes will come into effect when government has developed national policy guidelines."
603	4	Gas boilers will be banned within 14 years under the Government's plans to tackle climate change.Ministers are discussing a cut-off date of 2035, after which the installation of conventional gas boilers will be outlawed.The target date, to be included in a new Heat and Buildings Strategy next month, comes amid growing concern about the impact of domestic heating systems on the UK's carbon emissions.Under one proposal designed to accelerate take-up, homeowners could be required to switch to a 'green' heating system in order to sell their house.Another idea could see a surcharge on gas boilers in order to subsidise the production of greener heat pumps. Oil-fired systems will also be phased out and there will be another push to insulate homes.The installation of conventional gas boilers will be outlawed after a potential cut0ff date of 2035If hydrogen is part of a zero-carbon future, it could have to be produced by electrolysis (as shown above), which sees electric currents passed through water. Another option is for the plants to capture the carbon emissions and pump them undergroundA source said the Government had ruled out the idea of fining those who refuse to get rid of their gas boiler.The 2035 target date will dismay hardline climate change campaigners, who argue that much swifter action is needed. But ministers fear a consumer backlash if they move faster.Target - Cut meat and dairy consumption by a fifth over the next decade Impact - Someone who has meat for every three meals could only do this twice a week under the new plans.Similarly, the average Briton would need to shave a fifth of the average milk consumption down to 16ml a day - or roughly three teaspoons.Target - Ban new fossil-fuelled cars - including hybrids - by 2033 Impact - The average cost of buying a new electric car in the UK is £44,000, according to industry figures.  Target - Ban the sale of oil-fired boilers by 2028 and gas boilers by 2033; require all homes to be insulatedImpact - Energy efficiency measures - such as improving insulation and installing low carbon boilers - could cost £10,000 per home. Target - Stop expanding UK airport capacity and impose a frequent flyer levy with the aim of reducing the number of flights by 15%Impact - The average Briton currently takes 10 foreign holidays every five years, which would need to reduce to around 8. This is the equivalent of around three foreign holidays every two years. Eco-friendly heat pumps, which extract warmth from the ground or air, can cost more than £10,000 to install. There are concerns that some may struggle to provide enough heat to keep the UK's draughty housing stock warm.A Whitehall source told the Mail: 'There are people calling for a ban in 2025, but that is just ridiculous. We have to take people with us. Setting a target date is the right way to drive change.'But it has to be affordable and practical and that means doing it over a reasonable timescale to give time for technology to improve and get cheaper.'Tory former minister Steve Baker warned that the move could spark consumer anger. He said: 'The policy elite have persuaded themselves there is a consensus for net zero without anyone bothering to explain the implications to the public.'When people do work out the cost and impact on their lives there is going to be a huge backlash. If we go down the road of forcing people to replace their boiler at a cost of thousands of pounds it will make the cladding scandal look like a walk in the park.'Gas boilers are already due to be banned from new homes by 2025. But ministers fear the process of removing them from around 25million existing homes will take another decade. Traditional boilers are seen as one of the biggest barriers to the UK's target of achieving 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2050 – meaning greenhouse gas emissions would be dramatically slashed and any remaining emissions offset, slowing climate change.Gas boilers are estimated to account for about one tonne in every seven of the carbon dioxide produced by the UK each year. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the Government, last year said they should be banned from 2033.The independent body said replacement boilers should only be permitted from 2025 if they were capable of using hydrogen.Privately, ministers warn that the UK is not ready for an overnight transformation. Around 85 per cent of homes currently rely on gas for heating.Some boilers could be converted to run on hydrogen but this is unlikely to account for more than ten per cent of the total due to supply constraints.This graphic from the Government's Hy4Heat innovation programme shows how hydrogen homes would be poweredThe inside of a Worcester Bosch hydrogen boiler, a prototype of which is being developed.  Hy4Heat has said the development of 'hydrogen-ready' appliances such as this one could have a huge effect on the cost and impact on the public of a potential conversion of the gas grid from 100 per cent methane to 100 per cent hydrogenTory former minister Steve Baker, pictured, warned that the move could spark consumer angerA Whitehall source ruled out fining those who do not switch.Experts stressed there was a huge amount of work to be done before gas boilers could be replaced across the board. Peter Thom, of Cambridge-based energy efficiency specialist Green Heat, said he feared the change may 'scare the public to death'.
402	4	When a major study was published last month, showing that the global population is likely to peak then crash much sooner than most scientists had assumed, I naively imagined that people in rich nations would at last stop blaming all the world’s environmental problems on population growth. I was wrong. If anything, it appears to have got worse.Next week the BirthStrike movement – founded by women who, by announcing their decision not to have children, seek to focus our minds on the horror of environmental collapse – will dissolve itself, because its cause has been hijacked so virulently and persistently by population obsessives. The founders explain that they had “underestimated the power of ‘overpopulation’ as a growing form of climate breakdown denial”.It is true that, in some parts of the world, population growth is a major driver of particular kinds of ecological damage, such as the expansion of small-scale agriculture into rainforests, the bushmeat trade and local pressure on water and land for housing. But its global impact is much smaller than many people claim.The formula for calculating people’s environmental footprint is simple, but widely misunderstood: Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology (I = PAT). The global rate of consumption growth, before the pandemic, was 3% a year. Population growth is 1%. Some people assume this means that the rise in population bears one-third of the responsibility for increased consumption. But population growth is overwhelmingly concentrated among the world’s poorest people, who have scarcely any A or T to multiply their P. The extra resource use and greenhouse gas emissions caused by a rising human population are a tiny fraction of the impact of consumption growth.Yet it is widely used as a blanket explanation of environmental breakdown. Panic about population growth enables the people most responsible for the impacts of rising consumption (the affluent) to blame those who are least responsible.At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, the primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, who is a patron of the charity Population Matters, told the assembled pollutocrats, some of whom have ecological footprints thousands of times greater than the global average: “All these things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.” I doubt that any of those who nodded and clapped were thinking, “yes, I urgently need to disappear”.In 2019, Goodall appeared in an advertisement for British Airways, whose customers produce more greenhouse gas emissions on one flight than many of the world’s people generate in a year. If we had the global population of 500 years ago (around 500 million), and if it were composed of average UK plane passengers, our environmental impact would probably be greater than that of the 7.8 billion alive today.She proposed no mechanism by which her dream might come true. This could be the attraction. The very impotence of her call is reassuring to those who don’t want change. If the answer to environmental crisis is to wish other people away, we might as well give up and carry on consuming.The excessive emphasis on population growth has a grim history. Since the clergymen Joseph Townsend and Thomas Malthus wrote their tracts in the 18th century, poverty and hunger have been blamed not on starvation wages, war, misrule and wealth extraction by the rich, but on the reproduction rates of the poor. Winston Churchill blamed the Bengal famine of 1943, that he helped to cause through the mass export of India’s rice, on the Indians “breeding like rabbits”. In 2013 Sir David Attenborough, also a patron of Population Matters, wrongly blamed famines in Ethiopia on “too many people for too little land”, and suggested that sending food aid was counter-productive.Another of the charity’s patrons, Paul Ehrlich, whose incorrect predictions about mass famine helped to provoke the current population panic, once argued that the US should “coerce” India into “sterilising all Indian males with three or more children”, by making food aid conditional on this policy. This proposal was similar to the brutal programme that Indira Gandhi later introduced, with financial support from the UN and the World Bank. Foreign aid from the UK was funding crude and dangerous sterilisation in India as recently as 2011, on the grounds that this policy was helping to “fight climate change”. Some of the victims of this programme allege that they were forced to participate. At the same time, the UK government was pouring billions of pounds of aid into developing coal, gas and oil plants, in India and other nations. It blamed the poor for the crisis it was helping to cause.Malthusianism slides easily into racism. Most of the world’s population growth is happening in the poorest countries, where most people are black or brown. The colonial powers justified their atrocities by fomenting a moral panic about “barbaric”, “degenerate” people “outbreeding” the “superior races”. These claims have been revived today by the far right, who promote conspiracy theories about “white replacement” and “white genocide”. When affluent white people wrongly transfer the blame for their environmental impacts on to the birthrate of much poorer brown and black people, their finger-pointing reinforces these narratives. It is inherently racist.The far right now uses the population argument to contest immigration into the US and the UK. This too has a grisly heritage: the pioneering conservationist Madison Grant promoted, alongside his environmental work, the idea that the “Nordic master race” was being “overtaken” in the US by “worthless race types”. As president of the Immigration Restriction League, he helped to engineer the vicious 1924 Immigration Act.But, as there are some genuine ecological impacts of population growth, how do we distinguish proportionate concerns about these harms from deflection and racism? Well, we know that the strongest determinant of falling birth rates is female emancipation and education. The major obstacle to female empowerment is extreme poverty. Its effect is felt disproportionately by women.So a good way of deciding whether someone’s population concerns are genuine is to look at their record of campaigning against structural poverty. Have they contested the impossible debts poor nations are required to pay? Have they argued against corporate tax avoidance, or extractive industries that drain wealth from poorer countries, leaving almost nothing behind, or the financial sector in Britain’s processing of money stolen abroad? Or have they simply sat and watched as people remain locked in poverty, then complained about their fertility?Before long, this reproductive panic will disappear. Nations will soon be fighting over immigrants: not to exclude them, but to attract them, as the demographic transition leaves their ageing populations with a shrinking tax base and a dearth of key workers. Until then, we should resist attempts by the rich to demonise the poor.• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist• A response to this column from Population Matters is published here.

The tool takes the platform's static imagery and turns it into a dynamic 4D experience, allowing users to click through timelapses that highlight melting ice caps, receding glaciers, massive urban growth and wildfires' impact on agriculture. Timelapse compiles 24 million satellite photos taken from 1984 to 2020, an effort Google (GOOG) said took two million processing hours across thousands of machines in Google Cloud. For the project, the company worked with NASA, the United States Geological Survey's Landsat program — the world's longest-running  Earth observation program — the European Union's Copernicus program and its Sentinel satellites, and Carnegie Mellon University's CREATE Lab, which helped develop the technology behind Timelapse.To explore Timelapse in Google Earth, users can type any location into the search bar to see it in motion, whether it's a landmark or the neighborhood in which they grew up. Google said it removed elements such as clouds and shadows from the images, and computed a single pixel for every location on Earth for every year since 1984; ultimatel stitching them together into a timelapse video. For example, it's possible to see the Cape Cod coast slowly shifting south, agriculture growth in the middle of a desert in Al Jowf, Saudi Arabia, and the development of Songdo beach, a man-made beach in Busan, South Korea.""Visual evidence can cut to the core of the debate in a way that words cannot and communicate complex issues to everyone,"" said Rebecca Moore, a director of Google Earth, in a blog post on Thursday.Google also created various guided tours through Voyager, its storytelling platform, around some of the broader changes seen in the imagery. The company said it hopes governments, researchers, journalists, teachers and advocates will analyze the imagery, identity trends and share their findings.""We invite anyone to take Timelapse into their own hands and share it with others — whether you're marveling at changing coastlines, following the growth of megacities, or tracking deforestation,"" Moore said. ""Timelapse in Google Earth is about zooming out to assess the health and well-being of our only home, and is a tool that can educate and inspire action."""
511	3	"Science Reporter, NZ HeraldScores of dead little blue penguins that have washed up on northern beaches this year probably died of starvation in extreme sea conditions, researchers say.And they warn that climate change and its big storms could mean many more mass deaths of cherished bird and other vulnerable marine species.Extreme weather, including several ex-tropical cyclones and record-hot sea surface temperatures, led to high numbers of reports of dead penguins washing up on beaches across the upper North Island.The Department of Conservation's Tauranga office has had an average of five calls a week since February, and Western Bay Wildlife Trust's Julia Graham said the trust had 58 calls about dead penguins in two weeks.""All of the penguins were dead, or died within a short time of arriving on land,"" Graham said.Researchers who did necropsies of 11 birds collected in March and April from Omaha Beach and Tawharanui Peninsula near Auckland indicated that they were starving when they died.Forest and Bird seabird expert Dr Karen Baird and Massey University's Dr Daniel Thomas, along with students, found all of the birds had depleted fat reserves and had started using pectoral muscle for energy, resulting in wasting.Ten of the birds had empty stomachs, one had eaten a small amount of grass, and all showed other signs of starvation.""These birds starved after experiencing a series of severe weather events, which may have prevented them from feeding, and these results may also explain the deaths of many hundreds of other little penguins around northern New Zealand,"" Baird said.""We also found that most of these birds had recently completed moult suggesting they also hadn't been able to put on enough condition prior to the moult.""Moulting could take three to four weeks, during which the birds could not feed.""Once they head back to sea they need to forage successfully to quickly regain lost body weight.""Baird noted the record marine heatwave in the Tasman Sea, which also affected the East Auckland Current as it flowed into the Hauraki Gulf, raising sea surface temperatures around the north of New Zealand.""High temperatures could affect productivity and hence food supply but high temperatures have likely exacerbated a series of summer storms causing turbidity and hence poor visibility at critical times for little penguins.""Penguins were visual predators, and needed to see to be able to feed.""We are concerned that with climate disruption causing high sea temperatures, summer storms could become more common and what has been previously seen as a one in 20-year event could become more frequent,"" she said.""Populations like little blue penguins and other species can recover from infrequent bad events by breeding, but if it happens much more frequently, the population doesn't get a chance to recover.""I think it's a wake-up call that we can't expect always to have penguins, unless we start to think more about how we can actively manage them.""The now-dissipating marine heatwave was the most significant recorded in New Zealand, and would be considered unusual even under climate change projections for 2050. But new research has found such events were becoming more frequent as the planet warmed.Hundreds of shearwaters, petrels, fairy prions and shags, along with dead poisonous pufferfish, were also reported to have washed up along coastlines in January.Little penguins were widely distributed around New Zealand, and other populations such as those in Oamaru have not suffered the same fate.""We have very little information on the population trend of little penguins and necropsies like those performed here provide crucial data,"" Baird said.""Outside of reserves and protected populations their distribution appears to be shrinking and populations declining.""We don't know what the population is in the Auckland region or how much these deaths could have affected it.""• Additional reporting by Zoe Hunter of Bay of Plenty Times"

He said Indonesia's important fishing trade would be adversely affected, citing a study that said catches in the island nation will decline by 40 percent.Kerry recalled a meeting in Brazil where many experts described the growing problem caused by climate change. The session was in 1992. Very little has been done sine then, he said.Opinion: Why global health security is a national priority""It is time for the world to approach this problem with the cooperation, the urgency, and the commitment that a challenge of this scale warrants,"" he said.The secretary acknowledged the role the United States plays in greenhouse gas emissions and referred to the President's Climate Action Plan, which calls for cutting emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels. ""That's because we're going straight to the largest sources of pollution,"" he said. Kerry said he and Obama had no time for what he called the ""Flat Earth Society."" It will soon be too late for action to prevent the immense costs of doing nothing. People who refuse to look at the evidence and agree on change are ""burying their heads"" in the sand, he said.On Friday, Obama toured a California farm hit by serious and prolonged drought. He warned that some damage to the climate had already been done and will continue unless countries ""do more to combat the carbon pollution that causes climate change.""Kerry was fresh off a Saturday meeting in China, the No. 1 producer of greenhouse gas emissions. He said the two nations have agreed to a partnership that will share ""information and policies so that we can help develop plans to deal with the U.N. climate change negotiation that takes place in Paris next year.""But, Kerry added, while industrialized countries produce a majority of emissions, other nations shouldn't get a free pass.He called on Indonesians to push their government to change policies.The United States will help, too, he said. He announced $332 million in funding through the Green Prosperity program to help Indonesia tackle unsustainable deforestation and support clean-energy projects.The United States has also forgiven some of Indonesia's debt in a debt-for-nature swap in exchange for forest conservation.The World Wildlife Federation estimates that half of Sumatra's forest cover disappeared from 1985 to 2008. The government has halted the cutting of virgin forest, also known as primary forest.

601	4	"The coal burneIn Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study saysEven now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. ""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. ""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. ""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them."" He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level. What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month. d for electricity production in New Zealand more than doubled in the January-March 2021 quarter, making it the highest quarter since 2012. Above, the Huntly Power Station. Photo / Doug SherringPolitical reporter, NZ HeraldNew Zealand burned more coal for electricity production in the first quarter of this year than any quarter in nearly a decade.The revelation comes the day after a ""transformational"" climate change report that slated successive governments for its inaction on reducing greenhouse gas emissions that continue to rise.The latest New Zealand Energy Quarterly for the period January-March 2021, released today, showed the amount of coal burned for electricity production had more than doubled from the previous quarter to nearly 430,000 tonnes.This was the highest burned in a quarter since 2012, and helped bring the overall share of renewable energy down to 79 per cent, three percentage points lower than this time last year.MBIE manager of markets, evidence and insights Daniel Griffiths said driving this shift was low hydro lake storage levels and less wind.With below-normal rainfall, hydro generation was down 9 per cent on the back of lower hydro lake storage levels and generators preparing for a drier than usual winter.This factor, coupled with a tight gas supply which saw an 18 per cent drop in the past year, saw higher coal imports to meet demand for electricity generation.Importation of coal was 0.3 million tonnes this quarter (up 25 per cent since March 2020, but down 21 per cent since December 2020).Coal imports for 2020 were 1.08 million tonnes, and 798,723 tonnes of that was used to generate electricity.Meanwhile, industrial electricity costs rose sharply, increasing by 17 per cent since the year ended March 2020. Over the same period, residential electricity costs rose only 0.9 per cent.""Coal-fired generation was used to help make up the shortfall from other sources with a third Rankine unit at Huntly brought online during the period which contributed to a near doubling of coal-fired generation for the quarter compared to the same period a year earlier,"" Griffith said.""The share of electricity generated by coal rose to just over 10 per cent.""Nationally, demand for electricity fell 3 per cent on the same quarter in 2020 with a large decline in demand from the pulp, paper and printing sector.""Act Party leader David Seymour said the figures ""make a mockery"" of the Climate Change Commission's dream of a ""painless transition"" away from fossil fuels.""In the real world, lake levels are low, gas production is down, the sun doesn't shine at night, we are dependent on coal, and power prices are going up.""Right now, Kiwi industry faces shutdown because of high power prices. When contracts are renewed those prices will filter through the retail market, and people will see how expensive the Climate Change Commission's hot air really is.""The Climate Change Commission's report warned New Zealand was off track to meet its international obligations to reduce emissions, and laid out an ambitious path to reign them in and transition to a clean energy economy, including substantially increasing renewable sources.At a select committee meeting on Thursday Energy Minister Megan Woods said in light of New Zealand's climate change commitments burning coal at such levels was ""unsustainable"".The electricity system was designed to shift to fossil fuels as backup in times of low renewable sources, such as low hydro dams, she said.Gas, which produced less emissions, was the priority. However, due to supply issues coal was currently being burned at higher rates.""The system is doing exactly what it is set up to do but I don't think that is acceptable.""The gas deliverability situation was expected to improve over the next year or so, so there would be less reliance on coal if there were still a dry year situation, she said.Woods said this situation highlighted the urgency to develop a backup energy battery using renewable energy, such as the proposed Lake Onslow pumped hydro storage dam.The multi-billion dollar scheme, announced last year, would turn a South Island basin into a 5000 gigawatt rechargeable battery to power the country during periods of little rainfall or wind, ending its dependence on gas and coal generation.Water would be pumped up into the dam during times of excess energy, such as when hydro dams need to be spilled.Woods said planning work was continuing on this and an interim update was expected this year.Good progress on feasibility, including conducting Lidar (3D laser) imaging of the site, and engagement with landowners and the local runanga, she said.""It is moving at pace. If we are to decarbonise we need to find a solution.""Woods said there were many in the industry who ""openly resistant"" to the change to using a renewable source of ""dry year"" storage, and who would have questions."
290	5	Even before catastrophic fires broke out in Australia in late fall, climate change was at the top of the list of priorities at the 50th anniversary of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.But those fires — preceded by others in California — along with rising sea levels, flooding and supercharged storms, are putting more pressure on the politicians, business executives, financiers, thought leaders and others who attend to show they are part of the solution to one of the world’s most pressing challenges.In a nod to a younger generation most at risk and demanding action on climate change, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has become a prominent environmental activist, is scheduled to appear. In a column this month in The Guardian that she wrote with other environmental activists, they demanded an end to investments in fossil fuels.“Anything less than immediately ceasing these investments in the fossil fuel industry would be a betrayal of life itself,” they said. “Today’s business as usual is turning into a crime against humanity. We demand that leaders play their part in putting an end to this madness.”Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and a regular attendee at the Davos forum, agreed that “climate is going to loom larger than ever before.” And Ian Bremmer, founder and president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group, said: “These issues are becoming more real, more salient every day, whether you are talking about Venice or California or Australia or Jakarta. These are real events with enormous direct human and economic costs.”But an overriding question as the Davos gathering gets underway is: Will all the talk matter?Mr. Bremmer, who plans to attend, said the forum could help force change because it brings together big players, like chief executives of banks, money management firms and hedge funds, who are rethinking their investments. Gradually — some say too gradually — financial firms are directing money away from oil companies and others associated with carbon-dioxide emissions blamed for environmental damage.Financial institutions “see the future coming, and they are changing the way they invest,” Mr. Bremmer said. “That is going to require multinational corporations to act differently; it will lead to new corporations that will do better.”While thinking on climate change may be shifting, by some metrics the corporate elite that always makes up a large contingent at Davos still has a lot of work to do. According to a study published in December by the Davos organizers, only a quarter of a group of 7,000 businesses are setting a specific emissions reduction target and only an eighth are actually reducing their emissions each year.If so, they are making a major strategic error, according to Mark Carney, the departing governor of the Bank of England who planned to be in Davos. Companies that work to bring their emissions to zero “will be rewarded handsomely,” Mr. Carney said in a recent speech. “Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.”Some people in the financial industry said that environmental issues were being given greater weight in investment decisions despite setbacks like President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement on climate change. The president, who shunned the gathering in Davos last year, said he would go this time.The number of people who are talking about fossil fuels as a real concern “has increased dramatically over the last 12 to 24 months,” said Jeff McDermott, chief executive of Greentech Capital, an investment bank focused on low-carbon technologies. “They are both looking at the risks of high-carbon companies and industries as well as the returns available from low-carbon alternatives.”Mr. McDermott said that Davos was a good venue for sifting through such ideas. The conference organizers are also pushing an environmental agenda that supports an ecologist’s  notion of persuading the world to plant a trillion trees to soak up carbon dioxide and prodding companies to announce ambitious targets for lowering their emissions.Potentially, enormous sums could be used to influence corporate behavior. For instance, Climate Action 100+ said investors with around $35 trillion in assets had signed on to its program for pushing companies toward greater disclosure and action on emissions.“I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,” wrote Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, which has nearly $7 trillion under management, in a letter vowing to put sustainability at the core of the firm’s investment approach.Many likely targets of investor and environmental initiatives may be available at the gathering at the Swiss resort. Among them are the chiefs of the world’s major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Saudi Aramco, who are expected to attend.In recent months, some of these companies, especially those based in Europe, have been responding to the concerns of investors and other constituents with commitments to reduce their emissions or make investments in other environmentally friendly technology.Repsol, the Spanish oil company, pledged last month to cut its emissions to zero by 2050 through a combination of actions, including more investments in renewable electricity like wind and solar and, possibly, reforestation. And BP, the London-based oil company, said it was forming a business with other companies for recycling a type of plastic known as PET that is used in soft drink bottles and packaging. In the latest of these pledges, Equinor, the Norwegian company, said it would reduce emissions from its oil and gas fields and plants in its home country to near zero by 2050 by using electricity in its operations and other measures.Mr. Yergin, who is also vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research firm, said that “energy transition” would be the “two most spoken words at Davos” about the sector.Marco Alverà, chief executive of Snam, an Italian natural gas company, plans to talk about recent experiments in mixing hydrogen, a fuel that does not produce carbon emissions, with the natural gas that the company delivers to users, potentially lowering their climate impact. Mr. Alverà said he was going to Davos because he thought it would be a “powerful forum” to make his points.“I don’t think we will solve the climate challenge with taxes or a radical change in consumer behavior,” he said. “I think we can only solve it with business ideas that make business sense.”The chemical industry, another sector that is integral to modern economies and a target for environmentalists, also plans to make its case at Davos.A group of about 20 large chemical companies is working on low-carbon technologies, like making chemicals from carbon dioxide and biomass, said Martin Brudermuller, chief executive of the German chemical company BASF.Mr. Brudermuller also said another large coalition in the sector was working on the plastic waste problem, with BASF turning discarded plastic into raw materials for its plants. Mr. Brudermuller cautioned that such problems, which involve not only new technologies but also organizing the collection and sorting of waste, are so complex and globe-spanning that only an effort of similar scope will succeed in solving them.“A collaborative effort of companies, governmental and nongovernmental organizations as well as civil society is necessary to address the global challenge of mismanaged waste,” Mr. Brudermuller wrote in an email.Awareness of these issue may be growing, but with global emissions continuing to rise governments are falling short on tackling them, according to a pre-conference report issued by the World Economic Forum. Many businesses, too, are failing to set effective targets, the report said. In 2006, Nicholas Stern was the chief author of a seminal study for the British government that set out the case for acting on climate change. More than a decade later, as he prepared to attend the 50th gathering in Davos, Lord Stern, chairman of the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, said there were reasons to be encouraged and to worry.He said that the costs of wind and solar technology had fallen much more rapidly than anticipated. Electric vehicles, he said, were also making more rapid progress than expected, with most automakers talking about the end of the era of the internal combustion engine.Such advances, he said, are opening attractive opportunities for investors and creating jobs.He also said the growing activism of young people was crucial in pushing their elders to enact change. “Business people really feel that,” including those who attend Davos, he said, adding that he hoped such pressures would push companies into making commitments on emissions reduction at the meeting.On the other hand, he said that the world had been slow to act and each report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations agency that tracks emissions, was more worrying than the last.“I am really optimistic about what it is possible to do,” he said. “But I worry deeply about whether we will.”
310	3	This past November was the warmest on record, with temperatures well above average – more than 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than normal. Warm, humid northeasterly winds from the subtropics combined with well above average sea surface temperatures surrounding the country, warming the country. The pattern was associated with a developing La Niña climate system, and is responsible for predictions of a warmer than average summer ahead. Overall, the nationwide average temperature in November was 15.4C (1.7C above the 1981 – 2010 average), making it our warmest November since Niwa’s seven station temperature series began in 1909. It surpassed November 2019 as the warmest on record, and three of the four warmest Novembers have now occurred since 2013. READ MORE: * New Zealand's fifth warmest spring on record in 2020, and Wellington's wettest * Drought conditions in upper North Island rival one of country's worst droughts on record - NIWA  * Warm, sunny weekend for most of the North Island but rain, gales for the South Island  The season as a whole was the second-warmest spring on record. Temperatures were above average across nearly all of the North Island and a majority of the South Island, and well above average in the Bay of Plenty. Twenty-six locations experienced the highest or second-highest warmest temperatures for spring on record. Notably, in Hamilton (Ruakura) it was the warmest spring since 1906, a product of high daytime temperatures combining with a warm night. No locations experienced record or near-record low spring temperatures. Niwa forecaster Nava Fedaeff said the “fingerprints of climate change were all over” this report. “We know our climate has warmed, we know that that’s the reason we had our warmest November on record, and we know cool records are really rare.” According to the report, there was less rain than usual (50 to 79 per cent of normal) in parts of Wellington and Wairarapa, eastern Marlborough, and coastal northern and central Canterbury. Akaroa received only 60 per cent of normal spring rainfall, making it the 4th-driest spring since records began in 1977. Above normal rainfall (120-149 per cent of normal) was observed in much of Northland, northern Auckland, Gisborne and northern Hawke’s Bay, northern Tasman and interior Otago. It was the wettest spring on record in Kerikeri with records extending back to 1935. “Extreme rainfall events, like in Gisborne this spring, and in Christchurch and the West Coast in winter, those are in line with climate change expectations.” Gisborne experienced its 2nd wettest spring since 1905. More than half of the seasonal rainfall fell over just a few days at the start of November and led to a State of Emergency declaration.
194	4	"Last week, a group of American youths officially won the right to sue the United States government for failing to curb climate change. The US is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, after China.The 21 plaintiffs, who are between 9 and 20 years old, and come from all over the US, filed the climate change lawsuit together with climate scientist Dr. James Hansen in 2015.In the lawsuit, they accuse the federal government of violating the younger generations' constitutional rights to life and liberty by declining to take action against global warming. They argue that the government is failing to protect essential public trust resources like air and water, which are vital to survival. The  November 11 ruling in Oregon district court upheld their main argument, that ""the government has known for more than 50 years that the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels was destabilizing the climate system in a way that would significantly endanger plaintiffs, with the damage persisting for millennia."" Yet, the court case argues, the government has failed to take action, making it responsible for some of the harm caused by climate change.Young generation most affectedOne of the plaintiffs, 19-year-old student Tia Hatton, told DW that the group is suing the government because ""the government has known about climate change and the effects of carbon dioxide pollution on the stable climate system, but failed to take action.""""We are all very worried about our future, health and safety from the climate change impacts that we're seeing already, and that will worsen as time goes on,"" Hatton said.""We are going to be affected the most by it,"" Hatton believes.All the kids and teenagers in the plaintiff group have been personally impacted by climate change. Some of them live on farms being affected by drought, while others have lost their homes due to floods.Others, like Hatton, are affected by dry conditions caused by forest fires, which have aggravated her asthma.""Our role as plaintiffs is to show them the personal harm climate change is causing. We represent the children - not just of this nation, but of the entire world.""Holding leaders accountableThe lawsuit has been called a landmark, and has been the target of strong opposition from lobbying groups, such as the largest fossil fuel trade association - the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (API) - which spends million of dollars each year on lobbying to promote the interests of oil, gas and coal companies. Further opposition has come from the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, and the US government, which all submitted motions for the case to be thrown out.But their motion was rejected, and the lawsuit was ruled valid by US district Judge Ann Aiken.She wrote in her ruling: ""This lawsuit may be groundbreaking, but the fact does not alter the legal standards governing the motions to dismiss. (...) Federal courts too often have been cautious and overly deferential in the arena of environment law, and the world has suffered for it.""The case will now officially go to trial. And that's exactly what the group of young plaintiffs sought to achieve.""When we are in the courtroom, we're sitting right next to the government and the fossil fuel lawyers. And you just want them to look you in the eye and acknowledge that you have a right to a healthy and stable future,"" Hattan said.European cases set precedentThis is not the first climate action case against a government. In 2015, a Dutch court ordered the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide by 25 percent by the year of 2020 after the organization Urgenda took the government to court on behalf of 900 Dutch citizens.""The state must do more to avert the imminent danger caused by climate change, also in view of its duty of care to protect and improve the living environment,"" the verdict read.It was the first time citizens sued their government over climate change and won. This laid the foundations for similar cases around the world.It inspired Belgian activist Ignace Schops and a group of artists, filmmakers and rock stars to do the same, and sue the Belgian government to increase its climate change game, and make deeper greenhouse gas emission cuts.After all, Dutch and Belgian governments signed the Paris Agreement that emerged from the COP21 climate summit in 2015, aiming to keep global warming below maximum 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).In the case of Belgium, the country would need to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, and around 90 percent by 2050.Schops is seeking to hold the government accountable, calling for a 40 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.In his opinion, a court case is the perfect way to achieve this goal. ""When you look at big changes in the world, like the ban on smoking and asbestos, the big changes happened when a court case came in,"" Schops told DW. ""So we started a court case out of love for the planet.""A hearing is expected within the next few months.How-to for youIf you want to do the same in your country, here's Schops' advice: find a creative group of well-known people who can raise awareness around the cause; set up a petition to gather citizen support; and start a crowd-funding campaign to pay for legal fees.Now you're good to go - which country will bring the next legal challenge?"
686	3	"Bitcoin mining in China is so carbon intensive that it could threaten the country's emissions reduction targets, according to new research. China wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found.  China accounts for more than 75% of bitcoin mining around the world, researchers said.  The study was written by academics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Cornell University and the University of Surrey. It was published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. ""Without appropriate interventions and feasible policies, the intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort taken place in the country,"" it warned. Some rural areas in China are popular among bitcoin miners, mainly due to the cheaper electricity prices and undeveloped land to house the servers. Miners play a dual role, effectively auditing bitcoin transactions in exchange for the opportunity to acquire the digital currency.The process requires enormous computing power, and in turn consumes huge amounts of energy.   Already, bitcoin-related emissions in China exceed the total emissions of the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016.  By 2024, China's bitcoin operations will exceed the total energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia, and would rank 12th among nations.  At its peak, it could account for about 5.41% of China's electricity generation emissions.  The researchers said a carbon tax would be relatively ineffective for bitcoin, and suggested ""site regulation"" policies instead. The researchers said the ""attractive financial incentive of bitcoin mining"" has caused an arms race in dedicated mining hardwareThe price of the cryptocurrency surged during the pandemic, rising from $7,000 last April to pass $60,000 in March before hitting a period of volatility.   Bitcoin's price increase was pushed higher by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment, including electric carmaker Tesla.The Covid-19 pandemic also likely played a part, with more people shopping online and moving further away from physical currencies.Critics have long charged that in addition to its environmental impact, its main use is as a financial speculation tool rather than as a currency.  They also worry that it is prone to market manipulation by a few large players.  "
849	5	"1. Air pollution and climate change.Problem: Overloading of the atmosphere and of ocean waters with carbon. Atmospheric CO2 absorbs and re-emits infrared-wavelength radiation, leading to warmer air, soils, and ocean surface waters - which is good: The planet would be frozen solid without this.Unfortunately, there's now too much carbon in the air. Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation for agriculture, and industrial activities have pushed up atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 280 parts per million (ppm) 200 years ago, to about 400 ppm today. That's an unprecedented rise, in both size and speed. The result: climate disruption.Carbon overloading is only one form of air pollution caused by burning coal, oil, gas and wood. The World Health Organization recently estimated that one in nine deaths in 2012 were attributable to diseases caused by carcinogens and other poisons in polluted air.Solutions: Replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. Reforestation. Reduce emissions from agriculture. Change industrial processes.The good news is that clean energy is abundant - it just needs to be harvested. Many say a 100 percent renewable-energy future is feasible with existing technology now.But the bad news is that even though renewable energy infrastructure - solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage and distribution systems - are already widespread, and getting cheaper and more efficient all the time, experts say we're not applying them quickly enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. Barriers in policy and finance remain to be overcome.Picture gallery: The big smog: Cities plagued by air pollution 2. Deforestation.Problem: Species-rich wild forests are being destroyed, especially in the tropics, often to make way for cattle ranching, soybean or palm oil plantations, or other agricultural monocultures.Today, about 30 percent of the planet's land area is covered by forests - which is about half as much as before agriculture got started around 11,000 years ago. About 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of forest are destroyed each year, mostly in the tropics. Tropical forests used to cover about 15 percent of the planet's land area; they're now down to 6 or 7 percent. Much of this remainder has been degraded by  logging or burning.Not only do natural forests act as biodiversity reserves, they are also carbon sinks, keeping carbon out of the atmosphere and oceans.Solutions: Conserve of what's left of natural forests, and restore degraded areas by replanting with native tree species. This requires strong governance - but many tropical countries are still developing, with increasing populations, uneven rule-of-law, and widespread cronyism and bribery when it comes to allocating land use.Picture gallery: Burning down the Amazon3. Species extinction.Problem: On land, wild animals are being hunted to extinction for bushmeat, ivory, or ""medicinal"" products. At sea, huge industrial fishing boats equipped with bottom-trawling or purse-seine nets clean out entire fish populations. The loss and destruction of habitat are also major factors contributing to a wave of extinction - unprecedented in that it is caused by a single species: humans. The IUCN's Red List of threatened and endangered species continues to grow.Not only do species inherently deserve to exist, they also provide products and ""services"" essential to human survival. Think bees and their pollinating prowess - necessary for growing food.Solutions: Concerted efforts need to be made to prevent further loss of biodiversity. Protecting and restoring habitats is one side of this - protecting against poaching and wildlife trade is another. This should be done in partnership with locals, so that wildlife conservation is in their social and economic interest.Picture gallery: Looming extinction crisis 4. Soil degradation.Problem: Overgrazing, monoculture planting, erosion, soil compaction, overexposure to pollutants, land-use conversion - there's a long list of ways that soils are being damaged. About 12 million hectares of farmland a year get seriously degraded, according to UN estimates.Solutions: A wide range of soil conservation and restoration techniques exist, from no-till agriculture to crop rotation to water-retention through terrace-building. Given that food security depends on keeping soils in good condition, we're likely master this challenge in the long run. Whether this will be done in a way equitable to all people around the globe, remains an open question.Picture gallery: When the earth turns to dust 5. Overpopulation. Problem: Human population continues to grow rapidly worldwide. Humanity entered the 20th century with 1.6 billion people; right now, we're about 7.5 billion. Estimates put us at nearly 10 billion by 2050. Growing global populations, combined with growing affluence, is putting ever greater pressure on essential natural resources, like water. Most of the growth is happening on the African continent, and in southern and eastern Asia.Solutions: Experience has shown that when women are empowered to control their own reproduction, and gain access to education and basic social services, the average number of births per woman drops precipitously.Done right, networked aid systems could bring women out of extreme poverty, even in countries where state-level governance remains abysmal.Picture gallery: Remember when we used just one earth?"
519	4	"Environmental and community groups hand in a 140,000 signature-strong petition, calling for the Government to abandon its fossil fuels agenda in favour of a clean energy future. Photo / fileA truly wonderful, radical question is posed by Conservation Comment in Monday's Chronicle.         Rosemary Penwarden asks this question: How is it, that faced with the threat of         a virus that will cause the death of many of our elderly and some younger people, Governments of every country are taking extreme measures to limit its spread, yet faced with an existential threat to every person on earth, Governmental response has been disproportional and ineffective?        She refers to the contrast between the speedy response to coronavirus and the sclerotic response over the past 50 years to climate change - in the face of increasingly specific scientific data.This is a question that lingering survivors in a largely uninhabitable world will be asking themselves in years hence as they contemplate the ruins of civilisation.It is a question we might all ask of ourselves now, in the context of our collective responses to Covid-19.I hope that everyone who notices this letter, will take the time to find Conservation Comment on page 8, in the Chronicle of Monday, March 16 and read or reread it.Seems to me to be worthy of serious attention.DAVE CAMERONWhanganuiThe coronavirus pandemic looks like it's going to be presenting ever-increasing challenges for us all in our day to day living.I guess one could ask, and perhaps some have, is this the ""hand of God"", challenging us to greater things as a species, as a timely intervention in a clearly dysfunctional world.Whether or not we take such a view, as things unfold into largely uncharted territory and the systems by which we've lived are forced to take what appears to be a nose dive and perhaps will continue to do so, I think that we do need to see this as an opportunity for kindness and love towards our fellow beings.After all, it is those slowing, dollar driven systems that have mostly impeded displays of humanity towards our own kind in this ""God of money"" world, which has prevailed until now.So, far from scrapping over toilet paper in supermarkets, shouldn't we now more than ever, as systems and the components of those systems falter and perhaps threaten to fail, be looking out for one another.Dog eat dog will not work here.Sharing in the spirit of kindness just may see us through.PAUL BABERAramoho"
952	0	For restaurants and the New Yorkers who love them, the outdoor cafes that have sprung up across the city over the past two weeks have been one of the few bright spots in a grim season.Under an emergency program that began on June 22, about 6,800 establishments have been authorized to serve food and drinks at outdoor tables, turning patches of sidewalks and streets into cheerfully ragtag villages of patio umbrellas, beach canopies, outdoor fans and potted palm trees.Another 2.6 miles of roadway, including several blocks along some of the city’s best-known restaurant rows, will be available for eating and drinking from Friday afternoons until Sunday nights starting this weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. Under the plan, an extension of the city’s Open Streets program, portions of 22 commercial strips in every borough will be closed to driving but open for dining.“Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Little Italy — Mulberry Street — think about what is possible if we make them into centerpieces of outdoor dining,” Mr. de Blasio said.Many restaurateurs were quick to build street and sidewalk seating areas as soon as it was allowed. But some of the earliest adapters have almost immediately run afoul of the city Department of Transportation, which is overseeing the temporary outdoor cafes.The department’s first set of guidelines permitted outdoor seating areas on streets with one or two lanes of traffic, to be set off by “stanchions, barricades or planters, spaced at maximum 5 feet apart.” Late last week, though, some new requirements appeared, including one that has caused problems for many owners: All barriers, on any kind of street, have to be at least 18 inches thick.Julie Reiner, who owns two bars on Smith Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, said that on Monday, an inspector from the department told her that the enclosures she had built around the bars, Leyenda and Clover Club, did not meet city standards.This surprised her. She had printed the specifications on the department’s website and handed them to her contractor, who followed them to the letter, she said. He fashioned matching barriers for her bars and two other restaurants on the street out of wooden garden trellises anchored by paint buckets filled with cement.The inspector informed Ms. Reiner that her breezy latticework barriers were too thin; they had to be at least 18 inches thick. She was given 24 hours to change them.“My contractor needed to fix four places on the block in 24 hours,” Ms. Reiner said. The cost to each restaurant of taking apart the original barriers and building new planters was $1,000, or about three-quarters of its average nightly revenue.Losing money because the city changed the guidelines “is really infuriating after all this,” she said.In a statement, the Department of Transportation said: “We’ve worked closely with the industry and city agencies to find processes that put small businesses back to work and kept New Yorkers safe. This program is a brand-new arrangement, enacted at an unprecedented pace, and restaurants have been generous with their patience. Our adjustments to Open Restaurants have been to make sure this program works safely for everyone.”Interpretations of the department’s guidelines have varied. An informal tour of neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan this week turned up a wide array of materials used to set off seating, from heavy plastic Jersey barriers to colored tape.Some owners say they lost revenue, too. On Sunday, inspectors handed out cease-and-desist orders to an undisclosed number of restaurants, forcing them to shut down until they brought their seating areas into compliance with the new standards.In the East Village, the sandwich shop Foxface and the dusty nautical bar that adjoins it, the William Barnacle Tavern, had surrounded their in-street dining zone with metal barricades of the kind used to control crowds. On Sunday, an inspector informed an owner of Foxface, Ori Kushnir, that he would have to close until he came up with new, compliant barricades.Mr. Kushnir lost two days of business, he said, in addition to the more than $3,000 he had to spend on new, 18-inch-deep planters. “Anybody who tried to do the right thing the first time, and is trying to do the right thing now, is spending thousands of dollars on this,” he said.Restaurateurs say they have also heard mixed messages about whether they can seat customers in parking spaces that are cut off from the sidewalk by a bike lane, known as floating parking spaces. The answer is yes, according to the Department of Transportation. Some restaurateurs say they were told otherwise by inspectors.Frank Prisinzano, the chef and owner of three Italian restaurants in the East Village and Lower East Side, said he hopes he misunderstood the inspector who showed up last weekend. “I spent close to $25,000 on all three restaurants,” Mr. Prisinzano said. “I wanted to do it right.”While he waits to hear from the city, he said he would continue to seat customers in the floating parking spaces outside Lil’ Frankie’s on Second Avenue. “It really is helping,” he said.Indoor dining, which had been scheduled to return on July 6, was put off indefinitely this week as other cities that had allowed restaurants to reopen began to see alarming surges in new Covid-19 cases. Noting that the delay would hurt the hospitality business, Mr. de Blasio said Thursday that one goal of handing the streets over to diners was to “give maximum options to restaurants and their employees.”Mr. Prisinzano has little interest in reopening his dining rooms. “I don’t even want the indoors,” he said. “I don’t feel comfortable seating people indoors. As long as we can put people outdoors, we can get through the summer.”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

512	4	Public meeting on the Zero Carbon Bill, Ministry for the Environment Climate Change Director Janine Smith. Photo / Andrew WarnerCOMMENT:Submissions winging their way to Wellington on the Zero Carbon Bill will focus on C02 and methane emissions but fly over the biggest challenge – how to adapt to climate change.The bill sets up a Climate Change Commission to take a long view providing independent, expert advice to successive governments on how to meet the challenges ahead and monitor progress.Calling it a Zero Carbon Bill perversely puts the focus on mitigation or reducing greenhouse gases. Yet, no matter how much we reduce emissions, it will have negligible effect on reducing this country's economic, social and environmental loss from climate change. We're just too small to make a difference to global climate change.That's not a reason to do nothing, New Zealand must play its part, as must other countries. In the UK, which provides the template for our bill, they called it the Climate Change Act. That more accurately captures what this is about rather than being a popular slogan.Sea levels will continue to rise, and extreme weather events will become more frequent whatever we do. We have $20 billion of assets within 1.5m of the mean high tide mark.We will get more rain in the west and drought in the east. New pests and diseases will thrive here. Current farming practices will be less profitable in some parts of the country.Refugees from countries devastated by drought or sea-level rise will look to New Zealand for refuge.How do we plan to adapt to reduce these risks? The consultation paper on the bill, with blindingly short-sighted vision, asked whether adaptation should be part of the Climate Change Commission's remit. To suggest adaptation is a second order issue is to misunderstand the issue entirely. Here are some reasons why.Adaptation often overlaps with mitigation where they can't be separated. Think how it makes more sense to grow vines or to replace dairying and reduce methane emissions in areas that become more arid. Think of building more energy efficient buildings or switching to electric vehicles.Every dollar spent on disaster risk reduction saves at least $5 in recovery costs after an event.Reducing gas emissions will come at a price, so significant complementary savings are needed. The longer we delay the costlier the adjustment later.We must take a long view so there is a clear road-map out to 2050. Infrastructural investment such as in transport, energy and housing will need this. If not, investors will see assets stranded or investments held back until there is certainty. Gas reduction targets have fundamental implications for future adaptation measures.This means the commission's role must assess how well we co-ordinate the two.Public communications and conversations need to align what we are doing to save the planet with what we are doing closer to home to protect ourselves. The commission will be the independent, expert voice on these matters – it cannot be allowed to simply focus on mitigating gas emissions.Being a resilient country isn't just about the economic costs and protecting physical assets. Resilience is the result of cumulative action to strengthen our human, social and natural capital too. All are inter-linked and must respond to the pervasive impact of climate change.Risk reduction or adaptation means building resilience. Carving it out of the Climate Change Commission would be a fundamental mistake. Adaptation must be treated as equally important and resourced equally as a central part of the commission's work.Expertise with adaptation is a strong domain of the insurance industry and where we seek to work with central and local government to better protect New Zealand.We encourage people to have their say on the bill at https://www.mfe.govt.nz/have-your-say-zero-carbon before July 19.• Tim Grafton is chief executive of the Insurance Council of New Zealand.
728	4	"The report, the first of its kind by a US government entity, calls for Congress to swiftly impose a price on carbon and urges financial regulators to ""more urgently and decisively""  work to understand and blunt the looming economic damage from climate change. ""Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy,"" the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's climate subcommittee wrote.The CFTC, which regulates some financial markets, is made up of three Republican and two Democratic commissioners. The climate change advisory committee, launched by Rostin Behnam, a Democratic commissioner, includes representatives from banks, environmental groups, investors and a major oil company. A disclaimer in the report emphasizes that its conclusions do not necessarily reflect the views of the CFTC or the US government.Scientists have already identified climate change as culprit in destructive weather events across the United States, including wildfires, severe floods and massive hurricanes. The report is notable in part because it directly contradicts President Donald Trump's and other Republicans' downplaying of the consequences of climate change. The President has called climate change a ""hoax,"" rolled back environmental regulations and even falsely claimed that wind mills can cause cancer. Behnam, the Democratic CFTC commissioner, is hoping the broad involvement of industry in Wednesday's report will change the tone from the administration.""It's incumbent on policy makers, elected officials and regulators to start building in rules about climate resilience so we don't suffer in the long run from these dramatic weather events,"" Behnam told CNN Business on Wednesday. ""These are real world climate events happening on a more frequent basis and more extreme manner.""Jobs, income and opportunity at stakeThe report warns of potential ""financial system stress"" that could hurt the economy by limiting access to credit.""Over time, if significant action is not taken to check rising global average temperatures,"" the report said, ""climate change impacts could impair the productive capacity of the economy and undermine its ability to generate employment, income, and opportunity.""Environmental groups involved in the report stressed the urgent need for action.""For such a politically and sectorally diverse group to issue such a strong call for regulatory action is testament to just how serious a systemic financial threat climate change poses to US capital markets, and how concerned stakeholders from across the political spectrum are about it,"" Mindy Lubber, CEO of sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert, a Republican, struck a different tone on the report, emphasizing the potential disruption caused by the shift to cleaner energy.""The subcommittee's report acknowledges that 'transition risks' of a green economy could be just as disruptive to our financial system as the possible physical manifestations of climate change, and that moving too fast too soon could be just as disorderly as doing too little too late,"" Tarbert said in a statement.Climate crisis could become a financial oneThe report suggests the climate crisis could eventually turn into a financial crisis.""Climate change could pose systemic risks to the US financial system,"" the report said. That could happen through a ""disorderly repricing of assets"" that has ""cascading effects"" on investment portfolios and balance sheets. And those impacts could be amplified by the fact that Corporate America is sitting on record amounts of debt, which could leave some industries vulnerable to a shock. Another risk is that climate change sparks ""sub-systemic shocks,"" the report said, that impact particular sectors and geographical regions. Other reports, outside of the federal government, have similarly warned of dire economic consequences from climate change.In December, the Principles for Responsible Investment warned that climate change — and the policies designed to fight it — could wipe out $2.3 trillion of value from global stocks.Last year, Stanford University researchers found that climate change makes poor countries poorer and widens global inequality.The CFTC climate subcommittee laid out 53 recommendations for dealing with the climate risk, including requiring companies to disclose details on greenhouse gas emissions, piloting climate stress tests, and forcing banks to address climate change financial risks. The report also urged regulators to incorporate climate risks into their mandates -- including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is charged with identifying emerging threats to financial stability.Markets are unprepared for climate riskBut the CFTC climate subcommittee emphasized that the ""single most important step to manage climate risk"" is for the United States to set a ""fair, economy-wide and effective"" price on carbon. The goal would be to steer capital towards clean energy and ensure that  markets are appropriately pricing the disruption caused by climate change. Lawmakers and industry leaders have debated a price on carbon, such as a carbon tax, for decades. Even some large fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) support a carbon tax in hopes of getting clarity on the uncertain regulatory picture.""Financial markets today are not pricing climate risk. The financial markets cannot do that on their own,"" Bob Litterman, chairman of the CFTC climate subcommittee, said in the report. ""Until this fundamental flaw is fixed, capital will flow in the wrong direction.""The report called on Congress to impose a price on carbon and create other appropriate incentives to fight the climate crisis.""Only then will the awesome power of the financial system be able to address at scale this existential threat,"" Litterman said.

969	5	"A surprise announcement at this year's UN General Assembly has transformed the politics of cutting carbon, says the BBC's chief environment correspondent, Justin Rowlatt. As the meeting of the so-called ""global parliament"" comes to an end, he asks whether it might just signal the beginning of a global rush to decarbonise.You probably missed the most important announcement on tackling climate change in years. It was made at the UN General Assembly.It wasn't the big commitment to protect biodiversity or anything to do with the discussion about how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic - vitally important though these issues are.No, the key moment came on Tuesday last week when the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, announced that China would cut emissions to net zero by 2060.The commitment is a huge deal on its own, but I believe his promise marks something even more significant: China may have fired the starting gun on what will become a global race to eliminate fossil fuels.I'll get to that later. First off, Xi's pledge.It is fair to say environmentalists were stunned by Xi's surprise pledge. Let's be clear what it means:  China, the most polluting nation on earth - responsible for around 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - is saying it is going cut that back to virtually zero within 40 years.""Enormously important"" is how Todd Stern - the man President Obama put in charge of climate negotiations - described it to me.""A massive move"" and ""a happy, happy surprise"" was Li Yan's take: she's the head of Greenpeace in China.The commitment is so significant because China has never promised anything near as bold as this on climate before.And it comes after the European Union committed billions of euros towards a green stimulus package and - only last week - toughened up its own 2030 climate targets.It therefore raises the prospect of a carbon-cutting coalition of Europe and China covering more than a third of world emissions. Climatologists just aren't used to such good news.International negotiations to reduce carbon emissions all too often end in ugly squabbles.With good reason, says Todd Stern, who was instrumental in making the most successful climate agreement to date: the Paris Agreement of 2015. The problem is cutting carbon has always been regarded as an expensive chore.The effort to control climate change impacts virtually every element of a country's economy, says Mr Stern, ""so countries have traditionally been nervous about what they're going to be asked to do.""Indeed, Paris was the first time the world actually agreed that all nations needed to do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.And then, of course, the deal was promptly dumped by US President Donald Trump after he was elected the following year.But even before the US said it wanted out, nobody involved in the negotiations thought the goals laid down in Paris were anywhere near strong enough to meet the objective of keeping the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels.The idea was that every five years countries would be asked to come up with more ambitious targets, ramping up their efforts.The conference at which those new targets were to be discussed was to be held in Glasgow this November.  Thanks to the pandemic it will now be held in November next year.Many observers had expected China to keep its powder dry and produce any ambitious new targets with a flourish at a crucial moment in those negotiations.President Xi definitely had an eye on global politics.His address was a very deliberate contrast to that of President Trump a couple of days earlier.Where Trump blames China for the world's problems, Xi calls for global cooperation and highlights all the good work China has been doing. He called on the world to work together, investing in a green recovery to lift the global economy from the post-Covid doldrums.""We are living in an interconnected global village with a common stake,"" says Xi.""All countries are closely connected and we share a common future. No country can gain from others' difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others' troubles.""""we should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future in which everyone is bound together,"" he continues.Heart-stirring stuff, eh?It is also presumably no coincidence that Xi's announcement came weeks before the US Presidential election, and just as the terrible fires on the west coast and a series of fierce storms in the east made climate an issue in the polls for the first time.And a cynic might think his reassuring words were partly a ploy to reingratiate China with the climate-conscious Europeans, and isolate a climate-sceptic US President. It came straight after a virtual bilateral summit between Beijing and Brussels.But there is a much more important broader context for his announcement: the fact that the collapsing cost of clean energy is completely changing the calculus of decarbonisation.Renewables are already often cheaper than fossil fuel power in many parts of the world and, if China and the EU really ramp up their investments in wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, prices are likely to fall even further.Why?  Because the cost of renewables follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. It's like pushing on an open door - the more you build the cheaper it gets, the cheaper it gets the more you build.The Europeans have been quite open that their strategy is to entice other countries to join them by driving down the cost of renewables globally. Alongside this carrot, they also plan to wield a stick - a tax on the imports of countries that emit too much carbon.Meanwhile, President Xi's 2060 pledge was notably unconditional - China will move ahead whether or not other countries chose to follow.This is a complete turnaround from past negotiations, when everyone's fear was that they might end up incurring the cost of decarbonising their own economy, while others did nothing but still enjoyed the climate change fruits of their labour.How things have changed. Very soon, renewable power is likely to be the cheapest and therefore almost certainly the most profitable choice in large parts of the world.Think what this means:  investors won't need to be bullied by green activists into doing the right thing, they will just follow the money.Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20-30-year life? Why carry carbon risk in their portfolios at all?The change of appetite on financial markets has become ever more obvious over the last decade. This year alone, Tesla's rocketing share price has made it the world's most valuable car company.Meanwhile, the share price of Exxon - once the world's most valuable company of any kind - fell so far that it just got booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major US corporations.And this is where the idea of a race comes in.Countries - and companies - may soon rush to decarbonise as they see opportunities to make profits in what will be an enormous new market.President Xi is well aware of his country's leading position in the market for clean energy - investing in renewables has been a priority for China for many years.It is already the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels and wind, it makes more electric cars and buses than anyone else and has also become the international hub for battery production. ""It is going to keep on driving down the prices, so that everybody can get onto this parade, as it were, and go along,"" says Rachel Kyte, Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, and a former adviser to the UN Secretary General on sustainable energy. So, it looks like Xi has judged that the economics of clean energy mean that decarbonising is now the most sensible choice for the Chinese economy as well as for the world's climate.He is not alone. Look at how oil companies like BP and Shell are saying they want to move away from the black stuff and into clean energy.Sadly we cannot. The idea of a global race to decarbonise is a thrilling new prospect for anyone interested in limiting climate change, but I am sorry to say there are still many hurdles along the way.First off, Mr Xi's did not give any details of how his country would achieve his carbon-neutral target.Remember, China is by far the biggest consumer of coal in the world, hoovering up about half of the global supply. It is also the world's second biggest user of oil - after the US.Across its economy, some 85% of its power comes from fossil fuels with 15% from low carbon sources. Those ratios will need to be turned on their head to have any chance of meeting the net zero pledge. That will take eye-popping investment in wind, solar and nuclear power.But all Xi said at the UN about how it would get to its 2060 goal was that China would peak its emissions of greenhouse gases ""before 2030"" - little change from China's previous promise that the peak would come ""around"" 2030. Li Yan of Greenpeace says the acid test will be whether a raft of new coal plants proposed by provincial authorities are approved.""Existing core industries are still fighting their survival in China,"" she says, ""and that's why we're still seeing coal plants proposed everywhere.""We'll see whether they get the go-head - and how aggressive the investment in clean energy is - in a few months when the details of China's next five-year plan are published.So even as the economics tilts in favour of renewables the task of decarbonisation is still enormous.Meanwhile, the effects of climate change will only accelerate.But there is another reason for optimism.The US is the world's biggest economy and the second biggest producer of greenhouse gases, and is therefore essential to any effort to tackle climate change.Under Donald Trump it has steered clear of carbon-cutting commitments.But his challenger, Joe Biden, has said he will re-join the Paris accord, and has promised a $2 trillion green recovery plan for the US, which would aim to slash emissions and tackle the effects of climate change.That holds out the promise of the world's three largest economies, responsible for nearly half of all emissions, all making a serious effort to cut carbon.Once half the world is on-board with the project it is hard to see how the rest could hold out.So - and this isn't something we often say about climate change - there are powerful new reasons for optimism.Follow Justin on Twitter.I've travelled all over the world for the BBC and seen evidence of environmental damage and climate change everywhere. It's the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. Tackling it means changing how we do virtually everything. We are right to be anxious and afraid at the prospect, but I reckon we should also see this as a thrilling story of exploration, and I'm delighted to have been given the chance of a ringside seat as chief environment correspondent."
917	4	Of 8,000 companies given climate action scores from A to F, just 179 – or two percent – received the top grade in a new survey published on Monday.CDP, a global non-profit driving companies and governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, ranked Alphabet, Citigroup, Microsoft and Walmart among the best corporations in North America for their records on sustainability.With 38 companies in the top tier, Japan beat out the United States – which saw just 35 firms receive a perfect rating.  But with 85, Europe had by far the most A-rated companies. Canada had just one (IGM Financial), while there were two in Latin America (Brazil) and only one in Africa (South Africa).The annual ratings are designed to cultivate a spirit of competitiveness and raise ambition on climate. At the request of their investors, companies disclose climate data to CDP.Good marks show comprehensiveness of reporting, awareness of climate-related risks and market-leading best practices – including the use of science-based emissions targets, renewable energy and carbon pricing.Bruno Sarda, President of CDP North America, said: “While climate change is already upon us, these companies know sustainability presents an exciting race to the top, an opportunity to innovate and rethink business as usual.”“The good news is that companies are not just doing this because government isn’t, but because it makes good business and financial sense,” Sarda told Al Jazeera. “The evidence is in the way companies are disclosing investments they’re making.”Profit-seeking enterprises are not just sharing their environmental numbers to save the planet. Climate action appears to have a direct bearing on financial success.Companies on the A list outperform their peers on the stock market by 5.5 percent every year, according to index provider STOXX.CDP has released the latest findings to coincide with the kick-off of the World Economic Forum annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.One of the top items on the agenda is titled “How to mobilize business to respond to the risks of climate change”.In 2019, more than 500 investors with $96 trillion in assets requested companies to disclose through CDP – a 20 percent increase over the previous year.US companies are well-represented on the list, despite inaction by the federal government. Of A-list corporations in North America, 20 are committed to science-based targets aligned with the 2015 international Paris Agreement on climate change.Alphabet, Google’s parent company, purchased enough renewable energy to power all global operations in 2017 and 2018, becoming the world’s largest cumulative corporate purchaser of renewables.Microsoft, for its part, pledged last week to become “carbon negative” by 2030 and offset all carbon emissions it has ever produced. The software giant also promised to launch a $1bn innovation programme for carbon capture technology.“We’re well positioned to enable and accelerate the low-carbon transition,” said Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft.“In the past year, we’ve accelerated on our path to powering our global operations with 100-percent renewable energy,” Joppa added, saying Microsoft has taken steps to improve water efficiency and nearly double the internal carbon price to $15 per metric tonne.With Adobe’s new Sign service for cloud-based electronic signatures – to replace printing and faxing traditional paperwork – every one million transactions save 27 million gallons (102 million litres) of water, 1.5 million pounds (680,000 kilogrammes) of waste and 23.4 million pounds (10.6 million kg) of CO2 emissions.Citi has set a 10-year, $100bn environmental finance goal to bankroll and facilitate climate solutions.Walmart is working with suppliers to cut emissions through Project Gigaton, which aims to slash one billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from the company’s value chain over the next decade.Apple, American Express, Home Depot, Morgan Stanley and Salesforce are among the other A-list firms.Visa, which just announced reaching the goal of 100-percent renewable energy by 2020, may grow from a B to an A rating next year for its feat in procuring electrons from alternative sources.“We believe everyone is at their own stage of the sustainability journey,” said Doug Sabo, Visa’s head of Global Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability.“For Visa, we are proud to be among a small group who has achieved their 100 percent renewable goal,” he told Al Jazeera.Companies that provide insufficient information or do not disclose at all receive an F grade from CDP.“When CDP was created, our ambition was to create a link between environmental and financial information, accelerate the shifting of capital in the direction of a low-carbon economy,” Sarda said.“The announcement by BlackRock is what that looks like,” he said, referring to the asset manager’s decision to move away from fossil fuels, publicly announced last week.“Climate change,” said Sarda, “is here.”
340	3	"Former Trump 2016 campaign adviser Stephen Moore reacts to presumed President-elect Joe Biden's cabinet picks.The year 2020 is ending as it began in some ways -- with politicians sounding the alarm over the ""existential threat"" of climate change and its allegedly catastrophic impacts.But, as many have noted, predictions of climate devastation have historically included major flops.In previous decades, media reports and scientists issued warnings about glaciers disappearing in Montana, carbon concentrations intensifying, heavy snowfalls becoming sparse, and global temperature spiking by 2020.But according to the right-leaning JunkScience.com, none of those panned out and, in some cases, the polar opposite turned out to be true.Perhaps the most glaring of failed predictions involved vanishing snow and ice in the north. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2009 on a government ecologist's prediction that all of Montana's glaciers would be gone in 2020. The reality? As recently as January, Montana's Glacier National Park was reportedly replacing signs with that very warning.CNN reported: ""In 2017, the park was told by the agency that the complete melting off of the glaciers was no longer expected to take place so quickly due to changes in the forecast model, [park spokeswoman Gina] Kurzmen said. But tight maintenance budgets made it impossible for the park to immediately change the signs.""Other reports relayed predictions that ""Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past"" (The Independent in 2000), ""Snows of Kilimanjaro to Vanish by 2020"" (The Vancouver Sun in 2008), and ""Arctic summers may be ice free by 2020"" (Lancaster Eagle-Gazette in 2013).As JunkScience.com's report notes, the Artctic still had plenty of ice in September, and the famous African volcano had defied former Vice President Al Gore's 2006 prediction that ""within a decade, there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro.""Meanwhile, Florida has maintained a sea level rise of less than 4 inches, despite an earlier prediction it could see an increase of 2 feet by 2020. In 1987, the Star-Phoenix reported on NASA scientist James Hansen's warning that by the end of the 90s, average global temperature increases would reach between one-half and 1 degree Celsius. After quoting Hansen predicting unprecedented warmth in the following decades, the paper said: ""If this proves true, by the year 2020 we will experience an average temperature increase of around three degrees, with even greater extremes."" It also noted that ""more conservative scientists believe a change list this will not happen until the middle of the 21st Century.""While the climate for 2050 is unknown, 2020 has already turned out slightly better than Hansen predicted. Data obtained by JunkScience.com showed the global average temperature was higher by 0.44 degrees Celsius.The increase in global CO2 concentration (about 23% from 1978 to 2020) also fell short of a prediction that it would double by 2020. ""We learn that if present trends continue, with economics the only limit on the exploitation of fossil fuels, the CO2 concentration will have doubled by 2020,"" said a 1978 article in The Vancouver Sun.Predictions like these are often held up as evidence that alarmist predictions about climate change shouldn't be taken seriously. However, these arguments have encountered pushback from critics who argue that some climate models were accurate, and discrepancies can at least partially be attributed to the types of regulations activists are seeking as a response to warming.It's unclear just how effective those regulations have been. In 2019, the United Nations released a global assessment of environmental rules and noted that poor enforcement hindered their success.Heartland Institute Director Steve Milloy, who also runs JunkScience.com, told Fox News that the push for policy interventions has failed.""The world has spent trillions on climate without any obvious benefit — to the environment, climate, public health, or economy,"" he said.A study from Yale University, however, argued that environmental regulations have curbed emissions even as the U.S. saw a ""substantial increase in manufacturing output"" from 1990 to 2008.At end of last year, researchers from NASA, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology released a study on climate models published between 1970 and 2007.""We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers,"" the group said. The study specifically looked at 17 models, finding that 10 closely matched observations. That number jumped to 14 when the researchers accounted for differences between modeled and actual changes in carbon dioxide. The Heartland Institute has received criticism over its funding, which has included money from ExxonMobil. The right-leaning think tank does not publicly identify its donors but defends itself by claiming that while donors can influence their research agenda, they ""do not surrender control over the peer review process.""It also claims that ""[d]uring 2019, The Heartland Institute raised approximately $4.6 million in support from approximately 2,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters. Its 2019 income came from the following sources: Foundations 67%, individuals 27%, corporations 5%. Over the years, no corporate donor has contributed more than 5% of Heartland's total receipts."""
760	5	"James Shaw on Newshub Nation. Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Images - Getty Images/Newshub NationJames Shaw says he has confidence Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern can deliver on climate change - because if she doesn't, she'll literally be breaking the law. The independent Climate Change Commission delivered its advice earlier this week, and Cabinet is obligated to do what it says or find another way to achieve the same emissions reductions, the Climate Change Minister told Newshub Nation on Saturday. ""If they don't accept the recommendations, they've got to come up with something better that produces the same outcome otherwise they are in violation of the law.""The Zero Carbon Act, passed in 2019, established the Climate Change Commission, required the Government to set emissions budgets and set rules for how the Government must respond to the commission's recommendations. If the Government decides to go against the commission's advice, it has to explain why.""The law says we have to stick within that 1.5C pathway, to stick within those emissions budgets,"" said Shaw. ""If they don't accept the series of policy recommendations for how to fit into that, they've got to come up with something that does do that, otherwise the Government itself is in violation of its own law."" Asked if he had confidence Ardern was the right person to deliver on climate change, Shaw said he did. He also has confidence the country's economically vital agriculture sector will meet its methane reduction targets. Methane doesn't hang around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, but while it's there, has a much bigger warming effect.""Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years, and complements necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said earlier this week.The current goal is a 10 percent reduction below 2017 levels by 2030, and between 24 and 47 percent by 2050. ""I actually think they'll sail through that with some of the innovations that are going on,"" said Shaw.""I know that in some of the test farms they've had in different parts of the country have increased profitability and reduced methane output by over 10 percent - I think by about 14 percent - just with on-farm practise changes. No new technology, no kind of magic science, anything like that - just with improvements to how the farm works."" The commission's report didn't mention any need for a stock cull. Shaw said while that would work, it might not be needed in many cases - but farmers who have reduced their stock numbers have benefited. ""Some of the most innovative and profitable farms in the country have gone from a really high-cost, high-input model - a really intensive form of dairying which actually had pretty thin profit margins - and they've gone to things like once-a-day milking, they've gone to less-intensive stocking on the land which means they've got lower input costs. So a couple of things happen - the methane output goes down, the nitrous oxide goes down and their profits go up.""Shaw repeatedly talked about the need for a climate change plan that everyone can agree on.  ""The model is kind of built in a way to maintain a level of social consensus because we are asking a lot of everybody. And there are some sectors that for various reasons are quite resistant to change or will find it very difficult to change - I'm not going to name anyone in particular - but... we've managed to create a level of social consensus  that everyone can look at each other and go, 'Okay, I get that I'm going to have to take action - as long as everybody else does too.'""He refused to answer a question from host Tova O'Brien on what parts of the commission's report he felt didn't go far enough.""I'm not going to give you a response to that question, which I know that you're going to not find terribly satisfying... I'm not a patient person. I want to be moving a lot faster on climate change. But my job here is to make sure that actually New Zealand starts finally reducing emissions over the coming decades, and actually moves much quicker than we have in the past.""He noted the final report was tougher in places than some earlier drafts.""In some cases what they have said is similar to what the industry itself has said, in some cases they've pushed industries to go further. In a couple of cases they low-balled it in the draft advice and the industry themselves came to them and said, 'Hey - we actually think we can go faster than you're describing,' so they've upped the ante.""If New Zealand - and the world - doesn't tackle global warming, Shaw said New Zealand can expect ""more frequent and more severe droughts, more frequent and more severe storms, flooding, fires like the ones you saw on the Port Hills a few years ago or in the Nelson region"".""The impact on that is mostly on our agricultural sector. The really severe drought we saw in 2014 knocked about $1.5 billion off our agricultural exports."""
123	4	Liberal Sydney Councillor Craig Chung has accused Lord Mayor Clover Moore of railroading her colleagues into voting for an ‘extremist and alarmist’ climate change motion.On Monday, the Sydney City Council officially declared a ‘climate emergency,’ claiming that successive federal governments have not adequately dealt with climate change.The motion, which warned that Sydneysiders will be at risk due to climate change, also called for the reintroduction of a price on carbon.Mr Chung ultimately voted in favour of the measure, after failing to move a series of amendments to water down the motion’s ‘crazy’ rhetoric.The Liberal Councillor told Sky News that it’s difficult to have a ‘rational debate’ when the Sydney council is made up of ‘Clover Moore climate change catastrophists.’
303	2	"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has expressed doubt about the reasons for climate change, saying in a CNBC interview in March that he was skeptical of the role carbon dioxide plays.""I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,"" Pruitt said. ""So, no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.""J.P. Freire, the EPA's associate administrator for public affairs, said the agency wants ""to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we're protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.""  Visitors to the website now find most climate change information ""is being updated,"" although the page that addresses climate change in the water sector still reflects a basic assessment that global warming is affecting water and precipitation.""These impacts are likely to affect the programs designed to protect water quality, public health, and safety,"" the web page says.Environmental groups were dismayed by the EPA's removal of climate change information from its website. Speaking at the DC protest on climate change issues Saturday, a Sierra club spokesperson told CNN the move is ""a sad reflection on the priorities of Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. If they haven't gotten the message yet, they're about to get it today. The American people want a government to fight for the health of this planet and for climate action to help protect all families in America."""
880	3	Stephanie Leutert is the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law.In August, rows of corn plants dotted the rural landscape in the Honduran department of Lempira. From afar, nothing looked amiss in these small farms. Yet it hadn’t rained for the previous 40 days, and the corn cobs tucked inside the husks were small and kernel-less. Across Honduras, an unpredictable climate has made this situation increasingly common. Droughts have wrecked crops, and changing weather patterns have created additional challenges for millions of Honduran farmers. To survive amid the bad harvests, rural families are looking elsewhere to supplement their incomes: to different sectors, nearby cities and north to the United States.A caravan with thousands of migrants has been making its way through Mexico after setting out three weeks ago from Honduras, which holds the distinction of being one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change. Over the past four decades, the country’s average temperature has risen, and it has borne the brunt of ever more frequent severe weather events. These climatic changes are on a collision path with the country’s weather-dependent workforce and economy. Today, 1 in 4 Hondurans continues to work directly in agriculture, and bananas and coffee continue to be two of the top economic drivers.Droughts are among the country’s most common risks. Central and western Honduras — including the department of Lempira — form part of Central America’s “dry corridor.” It stretches from Nicaragua through Guatemala and is prone to reoccurring droughts that leave parched crops, bone-thin cattle and hungry families in their wake. In 2016, the United Nations’ World Food Program estimated that a recent drought left 1.3 million Hondurans in need of humanitarian assistance. This hunger translates directly into migration, with the Food and Agriculture Organization reporting that from 2014 to 2016, people migrating out of the dry corridor’s drought-stricken areas most frequently cited “no food” as the driving factor.Yet while droughts may be destructive, it can also be devastating when the rain finally arrives. Torrential downpours and flash floods are common across Honduras, washing away fields of crops, bridges and houses. Hurricanes also batter the country. The most infamous example was Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which left 15,000 Hondurans dead in the aftermath and 1 million homeless. While this disaster spurred some Honduran migration to the United States, far more residents rebuilt their homes and remained vulnerable to future flooding and landslides.The effects of a changing climate go well beyond droughts and floods to include the dreaded coffee leaf rust. Honduras’s coffee sector is one of the largest rural employers, with more than 96,000 small coffee producers and a million workers. A warming climate has allowed the coffee rust to spread to plants in higher elevations, and farmers have to invest in medicines to keep their plants healthy. However, these extra costs contribute to making Honduran coffee more expensive to grow than farmers can sell it for on the global market. And in response, the sector has seen layoffs, bottomed-out wages and an exodus of rural workers.Three weeks ago, I spoke with Álex Orlando Lora, 20, and Audiel Guillermo Mejia, 25 — both from the western region of Honduras — in a migrant shelter in southern Mexico. Both men had left behind subsistence agriculture and coffee farm jobs, since they no longer could afford to eat three meals a day. According to U.S. Border Patrol data provided through a Freedom of Information Act Request, their case is increasingly common. In the past year alone, the number of migrant families coming from Honduras’s heavily agricultural and coffee-producing western area has doubled. The region now constitutes the sending region for around 20 percent of Honduran migrant families.However, it can be tricky to tease out climate change’s exact role in migration. Climate factors often get wrapped up in broad explanations such as “poverty,” “low economic development” or “low wages,” and it can be hard to tell if changing weather patterns are the driving factor for a migration decision or simply one factor of many. Further complicating this chain of causation is that many Hondurans do not simply grab their backpacks and hit the migrant trail when facing unpredictable weather but rather relocate to cities in search of work. This makes it difficult at times to understand not just what finally pushed Hondurans out of their country but also what initially forced them to leave home.Today, a changing climate is transforming rural Honduras, and the effects are just beginning. Over the next decade, climate models predict that Honduras’s temperatures will continue to rise, water will become scarcer in certain regions and weather patterns will become even more unpredictable. Without monumental shifts in small farmers’ resiliency to extreme weather, today’s patterns of disaster, ruined crops and hunger are bound to continue. In the face of these challenges, Honduran farmers and ranchers will continue to do as they have done in the past, moving both within their own country and also migrating even farther to the United States.Ready more:Enrique Acevedo: Expect more migrant caravans while Trump insists on the same failed policiesMegan McCardel: The immigration conversation we need to have — and soonThe Post’s View: Trump’s response to the migrant caravan will only make things worseJennifer Rubin: Trump plays the xenophobia card, againErik Wemple: ‘What, are you going to shoot them, Sean?’: Hannity issues dire warnings on migrant caravan
741	5	It is easy to poke fun at United States Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. He provides an endless supply of material for criticism and ridicule.But there is a real issue here: The electorate is furious in both sides of the Atlantic. In a democracy this matters.The European Union faces a one-two punch: in June UK voters decide whether the United Kingdom remains in the EU, while Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel suffered a setback as voters-backed right-wing populists due to her contentious refugee policies.It is mass migration that fuels the electorate’s fear and anger on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump fuels discontent about immigrants: he wants to return Mexicans to Mexico, and not to allow Muslims into the US.This is new in Western democracy but will be with us for some time. And in fact, it is the reality of climate change.Climate change intensifies conflicts and creates mass migrations. Tens of millions of people are displaced owing to climate change, according to the United Nations. Severe droughts and heatwaves in Syria and the Middle East at large preceded the war, leaving people without jobs, food or hope – and migrating for their lives.This unprecedented wave of refugees into the EU is unravelling Merkel’s successful government. Germany was until now the EU’s economic backbone.New global financial institutions are needed to get things right. We need to limit the exploitation of the planet's atmosphere, its bodies of water and its biodiversity. These are basic needs for human survival The massive migration waves caused by climate change fuel ethnocentrism, fear and political xenophobia which underlie Trump’s appeal.Massive migration waves can lead to geopolitical unravelling of Western democracy. These migration waves are new but they are connected to climate change, and they are here to stay.Climate change is a result of the Bretton Woods institutions and their deliberate policy to globalise the world economy based on extensive exports of natural resources from poor nations. This means petroleum, coal and gas, minerals, metals, forest products and meat.Since their creation in 1945, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization have been based on hyper-exploitation of natural resources that they encouraged and even coerced from poor nations.Low prices of natural resources have contributed a several fold increase in the wealth gap between the poor and the rich nations since World War II. This was the most successful period of industrialisation the world ever saw. It was based on extensive overconsumption of natural resources, and the direct result is climate change.The world’s poor suffer the worst consequences. Over-mining in Bolivia – which has one of the largest natural gas deposits in South America – and dried water resources of the Uru-Murato, an ethnic group that is one of the oldest cultures in the Andes.They survived as fishermen on the shores of the salty Lake Poopo, one of Bolivia’s largest water bodies. They outlasted the Inca empire and the Spanish conquest but they are about to go extinct because of the resource-based globalisation created by the successful Bretton Woods institutions.OPINION: Climate change and the right to food“Now there is no food to eat: the water is gone, so the fish and birds are gone. That is why … we are facing extinction,” remarked Felix Condori, the mayor of the Uru-Murato village of Llapa Llapani.Bolivian President Evo Morales recently announced he would open up 22 protected areas for hydrocarbon exploitation. “Whatever it says, the government has based its political economy in extractive activities … so this was bound to happen.”Almost a decade ago, the UN warned that “indigenous people are among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owning their dependence upon, and close relationship with the environment and its resources” (PDF). In Bolivia, largely an indigenous country, this is already happening but it is a microcosm of a global trend.Water is now one of the scarcest resources globally, according to the UN. The story is the same around the entire developing world.We need to replace the Bretton Woods system. They were the first global financial institutions the world ever saw. They fulfilled their mission and now they are dragging the world into an environmental disaster.New global financial institutions are needed to get things right. We need to limit the exploitation of the planet’s atmosphere, its bodies of water and its biodiversity. These are basic needs for human survival: we need clean water, clean air and food without which we cannot survive. All this is possible and must be done.The limits on resource use can be flexible over time with the creation of equitable and efficient global markets for the global commons.OPINION: A policy agenda for Sustainable Development GoalsLimits on the use of water, air and biodiversity is what humanity needs to survive. This parallels the limits on emission of CO2 nation by nation, which was achieved by the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and its carbon market that became international law in 2005.The carbon market traded $176bn in 2011 and transferred more than $100bn to poor nations for clean technologies. The Kyoto nations decreased their emissions drastically (PDF).The recent Paris Agreement – which has no emission limits and no teeth – must be improved. The establishment of a new system that respects our planets’ vital resources for life will change the global capitalistic system – as they value the global commons, clean air, clean water and biodiversity. These have no economic value today, but it can be and should be done.We need to decouple economic progress from fossil fuels if we are to survive as a species. The International Energy Agency recently reported that this is already starting. A detailed footprint and the attendant economic policies must redress economic growth to be harmonious with the world’s resources and with the survival of humankind.Graciela Chichilnisky is a professor of economics and of statistics at Columbia University and the Director of the Columbia Consortium for Risk Management.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.
644	1	Australians should ignore Labor when it pretends it is “not tied at the hip to the extreme agenda” of the Greens, after Greens leader Adam Bandt suggested the Eden-Monaro result sends a clear message on climate change, says Sky News host Paul Murray.Mr Bandt told Sky News the by-election result sent a “clear message to the government about acting on the climate crisis”.“There is no such message that came out of the Eden-Monaro by-election,” Mr Murray said.Mr Murray pointed to the fact the Greens and Labor vote went down collectively by six per cent, whereas the two parties which experienced a primary vote bump are not “all in on the same climate change hysteria”.“The Greens get way too good a run in the Australian media, way too free a run by the Canberra gallery, and are overrepresented when it comes to the extreme opinion that they’re able to serve up with no one challenging them,” he said.“The delusional arrogance of this bloke”.Image:
190	4	Many would-be parents in the millennial generation worry that bringing a child into this world might, in its effects, serve as a choice for more consumption, waste and damage to the planet. Others wonder whether the children conceived now might face a fate somehow worse than nonexistence in future years — a fate involving planetary apocalypse or catastrophe — and they don’t want to bring children into that future.These fears have developed into an argument that suggests it is morally irresponsible to have kids (or at least to have too many). Indeed, at the Democratic presidential candidates’ climate change town hall, Bernie Sanders was asked about “the need to curb population growth,” suggesting that dissuading mothers around the world from having more children is a necessity for dealing with climate change.I understand that, since the humans we bring into this world will also consume resources, there can be some fear among millennials that having children will make the problem of climate change worse. Still, I have made the choice to procreate — I have two daughters — even though I am concerned about climate change. And it’s important to argue for children and their parents and for the essential role they can both play in this urgent work of planetwide stewardship going forward. The act of creation is opposed to the act of consumption: The latter suggests that everything exists to serve our needs and appetites, but the other reminds us of the value and goodness inherent in things themselves, and how creation encourages stewardship and responsibility.As the writer Matthew Lee Anderson recently wrote, “Parents have an unconditional responsibility to cherish their children — and while that does not generate a reason to procreate, it does mean that being human is interwoven with a sense of obligation to one another.”Our culture’s individualism can often cultivate a very solipsistic posture toward life on our planet — and having children has showed me how often I automatically act out of a desire to serve myself. But parenting slowly turns that impulse on its head, and over time, responding to the needs of my children, I am learning to embrace patience and delayed gratification in the interest of a greater good and fostering the health and happiness of my daughters.Similarly, I’ve begun to re-evaluate my patterns of consumption. Sure, as Elizabeth Warren pointed out at the same town hall, “70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that we’re throwing into the air, comes from three industries” — building and construction, electric power, and oil. Our consumption is just a small piece in a much larger puzzle.But reforming our patterns of consumption is still deeply important, if for no other reason than that they help show us, and our children, the big changes we need to make. Children who are raised to love the world around them, to use their talents and imaginations for its good, could be an essential part of that work.In his essay “The Body and the Earth,” Wendell Berry writes: “When all the parts of the body are working together, are under each other’s influence, we say that it is whole; it is healthy. The same is true of the world, of which our bodies are parts. The parts are healthy insofar as they are joined harmoniously to the whole.” He adds, “These things that appear to be distinct are nevertheless caught in a network of mutual dependence and influence that is the substantiation of their unity.”This speaks to the dangers of our specialist society, in which we’ve severed ourselves from the entire system that supplies us with our food, clothing, cars and other “stuff.” But it also speaks to the danger of deciding that we can take human life out of the equation, thus severing the potential hope and life of the unborn from our hopes for worldwide healing.If a member of the millennial generation asked me why I brought two more human beings into the world, this would form at least part of my answer. The work of stewardship is of course not limited to procreation: Parents who seek to adopt or foster children, care for animals or start a farm, for instance, are also part of this creative work. But as the Washington Post columnist Elizabeth Bruenig writes: “Children are a clear statement of hope, a demand that we claim accountability for the future. They are a rejection of cavalier disregard for the planet we share.”My daughters and I are part of this world and ought to be seeking the health of the whole, even as we seek to cultivate health and wholeness in ourselves. Christianity makes this literal, as God in Genesis ties humanity and soil inextricably to one another: “For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” I want my daughters to grow up with this vision: one which sees the world not as something to use or abuse, but as a precious creation of which we are a part.When we are creators and stewards, we become aware of the infinite series of threads connecting us to the world around us — aware of the fragility and beauty of life, the preciousness of it. That is not an instinct, in my mind, which makes us less likely to fight climate change — but rather, more eager to seek to regenerate and heal our planet, and more likely to teach our children to do the same.Gracy Olmstead is a writer who contributes to The American Conservative, The Week, The Washington Post and other publications.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

657	5	"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Monday committed $10 billion of his fortune to set up a fund aimed at tackling the climate crisis, weeks after hundreds of his employees signed a blog demanding the online retail giant take drastic steps to reduce its carbon footprint.The fund, named Bezos Earth Fund, will begin issuing grants to scientists and activists this summer, the world's richest man announced in an Instagram post. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,"" said Bezos, whose net worth is estimated to be $130 billion.""This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" he said.Read more: Amazon wins court order to suspend $10 billion US military contract with MicrosoftBezos' personal donation follows Amazon's ""Climate Pledge"" last year which aims to make the company carbon neutral by 2040. As part of the pledge, he had said Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris Agreement by the same year, 10 years ahead of schedule — also promising to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans.The task of reducing its carbon footprint will be a challenging one for the world's largest e-commerce company which delivers 10 billion items annually.

569	4	"The climate crisis of the 21st century has been caused largely by just 90 companies, which between them produced nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions generated since the dawning of the industrial age, new research suggests.The companies range from investor-owned firms – household names such as Chevron, Exxon and BP – to state-owned and government-run firms.The analysis, which was welcomed by the former vice-president Al Gore as a ""crucial step forward"" found that the vast majority of the firms were in the business of producing oil, gas or coal, found the analysis, which has been published in the journal Climatic Change.""There are thousands of oil, gas and coal producers in the world,"" climate researcher and author Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute in Colorado said. ""But the decision makers, the CEOs, or the ministers of coal and oil if you narrow it down to just one person, they could all fit on a Greyhound bus or two.""Half of the estimated emissions were produced just in the past 25 years – well past the date when governments and corporations became aware that rising greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of coal and oil were causing dangerous climate change.Many of the same companies are also sitting on substantial reserves of fossil fuel which – if they are burned – puts the world at even greater risk of dangerous climate change.Climate change experts said the data set was the most ambitious effort so far to hold individual carbon producers, rather than governments, to account.The United Nations climate change panel, the IPCC, warned in September that at current rates the world stood within 30 years of exhausting its ""carbon budget"" – the amount of carbon dioxide it could emit without going into the danger zone above 2C warming. The former US vice-president and environmental champion, Al Gore, said the new carbon accounting could re-set the debate about allocating blame for the climate crisis.Leaders meeting in Warsaw for the UN climate talks this week clashed repeatedly over which countries bore the burden for solving the climate crisis – historic emitters such as America or Europe or the rising economies of India and China.Gore in his comments said the analysis underlined that it should not fall to governments alone to act on climate change.""This study is a crucial step forward in our understanding of the evolution of the climate crisis. The public and private sectors alike must do what is necessary to stop global warming,"" Gore told the Guardian. ""Those who are historically responsible for polluting our atmosphere have a clear obligation to be part of the solution.""Between them, the 90 companies on the list of top emitters produced 63% of the cumulative global emissions of industrial carbon dioxide and methane between 1751 to 2010, amounting to about 914 gigatonne CO2 emissions, according to the research. All but seven of the 90 were energy companies producing oil, gas and coal. The remaining seven were cement manufacturers.The list of 90 companies included 50 investor-owned firms – mainly oil companies with widely recognised names such as Chevron, Exxon, BP , and Royal Dutch Shell and coal producers such as British Coal Corp, Peabody Energy and BHP Billiton.Some 31 of the companies that made the list were state-owned companies such as Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco, Russia's Gazprom and Norway's Statoil.Nine were government run industries, producing mainly coal in countries such as China, the former Soviet Union, North Korea and Poland, the host of this week's talks.Experts familiar with Heede's research and the politics of climate change said they hoped the analysis could help break the deadlock in international climate talks.""It seemed like maybe this could break the logjam,"" said Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard. ""There are all kinds of countries that have produced a tremendous amount of historical emissions that we do not normally talk about. We do not normally talk about Mexico or Poland or Venezuela. So then it's not just rich v poor, it is also producers v consumers, and resource rich v resource poor.""Michael Mann, the climate scientist, said he hoped the list would bring greater scrutiny to oil and coal companies' deployment of their remaining reserves. ""What I think could be a game changer here is the potential for clearly fingerprinting the sources of those future emissions,"" he said. ""It increases the accountability for fossil fuel burning. You can't burn fossil fuels without the rest of the world knowing about it.""Others were less optimistic that a more comprehensive accounting of the sources of greenhouse gas emissions would make it easier to achieve the emissions reductions needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.John Ashton, who served as UK's chief climate change negotiator for six years, suggested that the findings reaffirmed the central role of fossil fuel producing entities in the economy.""The challenge we face is to move in the space of not much more than a generation from a carbon-intensive energy system to a carbonneutral energy system. If we don't do that we stand no chance of keeping climate change within the 2C threshold,"" Ashton said.""By highlighting the way in which a relatively small number of large companies are at the heart of the current carbon-intensive growth model, this report highlights that fundamental challenge.""Meanwhile, Oreskes, who has written extensively about corporate-funded climate denial, noted that several of the top companies on the list had funded the climate denial movement.""For me one of the most interesting things to think about was the overlap of large scale producers and the funding of disinformation campaigns, and how that has delayed action,"" she said.The data represents eight years of exhaustive research into carbon emissions over time, as well as the ownership history of the major emitters.The companies' operations spanned the globe, with company headquarters in 43 different countries. ""These entities extract resources from every oil, natural gas and coal province in the world, and process the fuels into marketable products that are sold to consumers on every nation on Earth,"" Heede writes in the paper.The largest of the investor-owned companies were responsible for an outsized share of emissions. Nearly 30% of emissions were produced just by the top 20 companies, the research found.By Heede's calculation, government-run oil and coal companies in the former Soviet Union produced more greenhouse gas emissions than any other entity – just under 8.9% of the total produced over time. China came a close second with its government-run entities accounting for 8.6% of total global emissions.ChevronTexaco was the leading emitter among investor-owned companies, causing 3.5% of greenhouse gas emissions to date, with Exxon not far behind at 3.2%. In third place, BP caused 2.5% of global emissions to date.The historic emissions record was constructed using public records and data from the US department of energy's Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Centre, and took account of emissions all along the supply chain.The centre put global industrial emissions since 1751 at 1,450 gigatonnes."
857	5	THE mountain bark beetle is a familiar pest in the forests of British Columbia. Its population rises and falls unpredictably, destroying clumps of pinewood as it peaks which then regenerate as the bug recedes. But Scott Green, who studies forest ecology at the University of Northern British Columbia, says the current outbreak is “unprecedented in recorded history: a natural background-noise disturbance has become a major outbreak. We're looking at the loss of 80% of our pine forest cover.”* Other parts of North America have also been affected, but the damage in British Columbia is particularly severe, and particularly troubling in a province whose economy is dominated by timber.Three main explanations for this disastrous outbreak suggest themselves. It could be chance. Populations do fluctuate dramatically and unexpectedly. It could be the result of management practices. British Columbia's woodland is less varied than it used to be, which helps a beetle that prefers pine. Or it could be caused by the higher temperatures that now prevail in northern areas, allowing beetles to breed more often in summer and survive in greater numbers through the winter.The Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the United Nations adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is now 17 years old. Its aim was “to achieve stabilisation of greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. The Kyoto protocol, which set about realising those aims, was signed in 1997 and came into force in 2005. Its first commitment period runs out in 2012, and implementing a new one is expected to take at least three years, which is why the 15th conference of the parties to the UNFCCC that starts in Copenhagen on December 7th is such a big deal. Without a new global agreement, there is not much chance of averting serious climate change.Since the UNFCCC was signed, much has changed, though more in the biosphere than the human sphere. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body set up to establish a scientific consensus on what is happening, heat waves, droughts, floods and serious hurricanes have increased in frequency over the past few decades; it reckons those trends are all likely or very likely to have been caused by human activity and will probably continue. Temperatures by the end of the century might be up by anything from 1.1ºC to 6.4ºC. In most of the world the climate changes to date are barely perceptible or hard to pin on warming. In British Columbia and farther north the effects of climate change are clearer. Air temperatures in the Arctic are rising about twice as fast as in the rest of the world. The summer sea ice is thinning and shrinking. The past three years have seen the biggest losses since proper record-keeping started in 1979. Ten years ago scientists reckoned that summer sea-ice would be gone by the end of this century. Now they expect it to disappear within a decade or so.Since sea-ice is already in the water, its melting has little effect on sea levels. Those are determined by temperature (warmer water takes up more room) and the size of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps. The glaciers in south-eastern Greenland have picked up speed. Jakobshavn Isbrae, the largest of them, which drains 6% of Greenland's ice, is now moving at 12km a year—twice as fast as it was when the UNFCCC was signed—and its “calving front”, where it breaks down into icebergs, has retreated by 20km in six years. That is part of the reason why the sea level is now rising at 3-3.5mm a year, twice the average annual rate in the 20th century.As with the mountain bark beetle, it is not entirely clear why this is happening. The glaciers could be retreating because of one of the countless natural oscillations in the climate that scientists do not properly understand. If so, the glacial retreat could well stop, as it did in the middle of the 20th century after a 100-year retreat. But the usual causes of natural variability do not seem to explain the current trend, so scientists incline to the view that it is man-made. It is therefore likely to persist unless mankind starts to behave differently—and there is not much sign of that happening. Carbon-dioxide emissions are now 30% higher than they were when the UNFCCC was signed 17 years ago. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 equivalent (carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases) reached 430 parts per million last year, compared with 280ppm before the industrial revolution. At the current rate of increase they could more than treble by the end of the century, which would mean a 50% risk of a global temperature increase of 5ºC. To put that in context, the current average global temperature is only 5ºC warmer than the last ice age. Such a rise would probably lead to fast-melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, drought, disease and collapsing agriculture in poor countries, and mass migration. But nobody really knows, and nobody wants to know. Some scientists think that the planet is already on an irreversible journey to dangerous warming. A few climate-change sceptics think the problem will right itself. Either may be correct. Predictions about a mechanism as complex as the climate cannot be made with any certainty. But the broad scientific consensus is that serious climate change is a danger, and this newspaper believes that, as an insurance policy against a catastrophe that may never happen, the world needs to adjust its behaviour to try to avert that threat. The problem is not a technological one. The human race has almost all the tools it needs to continue leading much the sort of life it has been enjoying without causing a net increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Industrial and agricultural processes can be changed. Electricity can be produced by wind, sunlight, biomass or nuclear reactors, and cars can be powered by biofuels and electricity. Biofuel engines for aircraft still need some work before they are suitable for long-haul flights, but should be available soon. Nor is it a question of economics. Economists argue over the sums (see article), but broadly agree that greenhouse-gas emissions can be curbed without flattening the world economy. A hard sellIt is all about politics. Climate change is the hardest political problem the world has ever had to deal with. It is a prisoner's dilemma, a free-rider problem and the tragedy of the commons all rolled into one. At issue is the difficulty of allocating the cost of collective action and trusting other parties to bear their share of the burden. At a city, state and national level, institutions that can resolve such problems have been built up over the centuries. But climate change has been a worldwide worry for only a couple of decades. Mankind has no framework for it. The UN is a useful talking shop, but it does not get much done. The closest parallel is the world trading system. This has many achievements to its name, but it is not an encouraging model. Not only is the latest round of negotiations mired in difficulty, but the World Trade Organisation's task is child's play compared with climate change. The benefits of concluding trade deals are certain and accrue in the short term. The benefits of mitigating climate change are uncertain, since scientists are unsure of the scale and consequences of global warming, and will mostly accrue many years hence. The need for action, by contrast, is urgent.The problem will be solved only if the world economy moves from carbon-intensive to low-carbon—and, in the long term, to zero-carbon—products and processes. That requires businesses to change their investment patterns. And they will do so only if governments give them clear, consistent signals. This special report will argue that so far this has not happened. The policies adopted to avoid dangerous climate change have been partly misconceived and largely inadequate. They have sent too many wrong signals and not enough of the right ones.That is partly because of the way the Kyoto protocol was designed. By trying to include all the greenhouse gases in a single agreement, it has been less successful than the less ambitious Montreal protocol, which cut ozone-depleting gases fast and cheaply. By including too many countries in detailed negotiations, it has reduced the chances of agreement. And by dividing the world into developed and developing countries, it has deepened a rift that is proving hard to close. Ultimately, though, the international agreement has fallen victim to domestic politics. Voters do not want to bear the cost of their elected leaders' aspirations, and those leaders have not been brave enough to push them.Copenhagen represents a second chance to make a difference. The aspirations are high, but so are the hurdles. The gap between the parties on the two crucial questions—emissions levels and money—remains large. America's failure so far to pass climate-change legislation means that a legally binding agreement will not be reached at the conference. The talk is of one in Bonn, in six months' time, or in Mexico City in a year. To suggest that much has gone wrong is not to denigrate the efforts of the many people who have dedicated two decades to this problem. For mankind to get even to the threshold of a global agreement is a marvel. But any global climate deal will work only if the domestic policies through which it is implemented are both efficient and effective. If they are ineffective, nothing will change. If they are inefficient, they will waste money. And if taxpayers decide that green policies are packed with pork, they will turn against them. * This quotation was corrected online on December 4th 2009.
426	5	"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting in Sweden to thresh out a critical report on global warming.Scientists will underline, with greater certainty than ever, the role of human activities in rising temperatures.But many governments are demanding a clearer explanation of the slowdown in temperature increases since 1998.One participant told BBC News that this pause will be a ""central piece"" of the summary.Researchers from all over the world work with the IPCC to pore over thousands of peer-reviewed studies and produce a summary representing the current state of climate science. Its previous report in 2007 was instrumental in helping the panel share the Nobel Peace Prize that year.A new Summary for Policymakers on the physical sciences, the first of three parts that make up a report to be released over the next 12 months, will be published in Stockholm on Friday.It will focus on the science underlying changes in temperature in the atmosphere, the oceans and at the poles.  New estimates will be given for the scale of global warming and its impact on sea levels, glaciers and ice sheets.  In its last report in 2007, the IPCC stated that ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal"" and that ""most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th Century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations"" - in other words, humans burning fossil fuels. In the latest draft summary, seen by the BBC, the level of scientific certainty has increased. The panel states that it is 95% certain that the ""human influence on climate caused more than half the observed increase in global average surface temperatures from 1951-2010.""But since 2007, there has been a growing focus on the fact that global average temperatures haven't gone above the level recorded in 1998. This slowdown, or hiatus as the IPCC refers to it, has been leapt upon by climate sceptics to argue that the scientific belief that emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere increases the temperature of the planet, is wrong. Scientists have attempted to explain the pause in a number of ways, with many arguing that the Earth has continued to warm but that the heat has gone into oceans.  The most recent report suggested that a periodic cooling of the Pacific ocean was counteracting the impact of the extra carbon in the atmosphere. But there is no certainty and little agreement among scientists on the mechanisms involved. And this week, when the scientists will go through their summary line by line with officials from 195 governments, the pause is likely to be the focus of heated debate. Prof Arthur Petersen is the chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and part of the Dutch delegation that will review the IPCC report. ""Governments are demanding a clear explanation of what are the possible causes of this factor,"" he told BBC News.""I expect that this will be a central piece of the summary.""There are likely to be tough negotiations between the parties throughout the week, with governments having already submitted around 1,800 comments on the draft.  Any changes to the text will need to be approved by the scientists, who will want to make sure that they are consistent with the underlying reports. This could lead to some tense moments. ""I wouldn't say there is a reluctance of the authors to take up such an issue as the pause, but they want to do it in a proper way,"" said Prof Petersen.""There will remain a tension between how much you can deliver based on the peer-reviewed science and what the governments would like to have."" In the draft report, the panel agrees that ""the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998-2012) is smaller than the trend since 1951"". The effect of this slowdown means that the future temperature range predicted by the IPCC will be wider than in 2007, and with a lower starting point. Many sceptical voices believe this is a recognition that the IPCC modelling process has been too sensitive to carbon dioxide, a claim given some credence by the text of the draft which states that some models have ""too strong a response to increasing greenhouse gas forcing"".But Prof Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is a vice-chair of the IPCC, rejects this idea. ""To take that out of context, if that change is confirmed this week, and to present it as a big change in the opinion the IPCC has on climate sensitivity, is ridiculous,"" he said.""Most climate scientists wouldn't say that the 15-year period is a good reason to question the overall quality of models.""There is a feeling among many scientists involved with the process that this report will be more complicated and cautious than in 2007. In the wake of that year's report, a small number of embarrassing errors were detected in the underlying material. The organisation's reputation was also questioned in the Climategate rumpus.""Overall, the message is, in that sense more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones,"" said Prof Petersen.""The language has become more complicated to understand, but it is more precise. ""It is a major feat that we have been able to produce such a document which is such an adequate assessment of the science. That being said, it is virtually unreadable!"""
961	3	"The population of wild reindeer, or caribou, in the Arctic has crashed by more than half in the last two decades. A new report on the impact of climate change in the Arctic revealed that numbers fell from almost 5 million to around 2.1 million animals. The report was released at the American Geophysical Research Union meeting.  It revealed how weather patterns and vegetation changes are making the Arctic tundra a much less hospitable place for reindeer.Reindeer and caribou are the same species, but the vast, wild herds in northern Canada and Alaska are referred to as caribou. It is these herds that are faring the worst, according to scientists monitoring their numbers. Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - ""such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight"", this Arctic Report Card stated.  There are multiple reasons. Prof Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating.""We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation.""The lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. ""Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,"" he told BBC News. Another very big issue is the number of insects. ""Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,"" said Prof Epstein. ""It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou. ""If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects.""Rain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food. At the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase. But scientists say we have opened the door on the ""world's freezer"" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate. The report, compiled by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in ""uncharted territory"". ""In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,"" she said. ""And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world.""    Some other key points from the report included: Also here at AGU, scientists have revealed that East Antarctica's glaciers have begun to ""wake up"" and show a response to warming. This is evidence of unprecedented climate-driven change at the top and bottom of the planet."
296	3	"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg returns to the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the 2020 World Economic Forum with a strong and clear message: put an end to the fossil fuel ""madness.""Thunberg's missive is aimed at, among others, US President Donald Trump, who in the past has mocked the Swedish environmental campaigner, saying she has an ""anger management problem."" Trump, who is among the most prominent climate change skeptics, is returning to Davos after giving it a miss in 2019 due to a government shutdown.It's the first time Trump and Thunberg would be present at the same event since last year's United Nations climate change summit in New York, where the teenager could be seen staring down the US president as the two briefly crossed paths.Later, Thunberg — named Time magazine's Person of the Year 2019 — told the BBC that she ""wouldn't have wasted [her] time"" talking to Trump about the climate crisis at the UN event.""Honestly, I don't think I would have said anything because obviously he's not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me,"" she said.'State of emergency'Thunberg, who famously told Davos participants last year that ""our house is on fire,"" has, however, found support among the organizers of the World Economic Forum, including its 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab, who said the world is facing ""a state of emergency.""""We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility on climate change,"" Schwab told reporters on Tuesday. ""We do not want the next generations to inherit a world, which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable — just think of the wildfires in Australia,"" he said.An annual risks survey published by the WEF on Wednesday put climate and other environmental threats ahead of risks posed by geopolitical tensions and cyberattacks. It's the first time that the survey found the top five long-term risks were all environmental, from extreme weather events to businesses and governments failing to mitigate and adapt to climate change.Stakeholder capitalismSustainability is the main theme at this year's Davos meeting, taking place at a time the world is grappling with global warming becoming worse because of growing divisions among nations and businesses on how to tackle it.The meeting, which will see over 50 heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, descend on the Alpine resort, seeks to give concrete meaning to ""stakeholder capitalism"" — a concept that businesses should serve the interests of all society rather than simply their shareholders.""Business has now to fully embrace stakeholder capitalism, which means not only maximizing profits, but use their capabilities and resources in cooperation with governments and civil society to address the key issues of this decade,"" Schwab said. ""They have to actively contribute to a more cohesive and sustainable world.""Davos 2020 by the numbersGreener DavosThe annual jamboree — which is marking its golden jubilee this year — has often been criticized for its own carbon footprint, mainly left behind by leaders flying in their private jets.The WEF, on its part, is touting that this year's meet would be among the most sustainable international summits ever held. It promises to buy carbon credits to offset flights, line up more electric vehicles and offer locally-sourced food.""It is something we take very seriously,'' Adrian Monck, the WEF's managing director, told reporters. ""There is nothing worse than an organization identifying a risk and doing nothing about it.""The WEF plans to launch a scheme using public and private funds to plant 1 trillion trees by the end of this decade.Geopolitical tensionsThe summit that runs from Tuesday to Friday this week would also focus on issues such as global trade wars, inequality, record debt levels and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.While key leaders from Iraq, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan and Afghanistan are expected to attend the event, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamad Javad Zarif will not be present as Tehran deals with protests following the downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet.Zarif's cancelation also comes against the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East since US air strikes killed Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, earlier in the month."
470	5	A COUNTRY with a presidential system tends to get identified with its leader. So, for the rest of the world, America is George Bush's America right now. It is the country that has mismanaged the Iraq war; holds prisoners without trial at Guantánamo Bay; restricts funding for stem-cell research because of fundamentalist religious beliefs; and destroyed the chance of a global climate-change deal based on the Kyoto protocol.But to simplify thus is to misunderstand—especially in the case of huge, federal America. One of its great strengths is the diversity of its political, economic and cultural life. While the White House dug its heels in on global warming, much of the rest of the country was moving (see article). That's what forced the president's concession to greens in the state-of-the-union address on January 23rd. His poll ratings sinking under the weight of Iraq, Mr Bush is grasping for popular issues to keep him afloat; and global warming has evidently become such an issue. Albeit in the context of energy security, a now familiar concern of his, Mr Bush spoke for the first time to Congress of “the serious challenge of global climate change” and proposed measures designed, in part, to combat it.It's the weather, appropriately, that has turned public opinion—starting with Hurricane Katrina. Scientists had been warning Americans for years that the risk of “extreme weather events” would probably increase as a result of climate change. But scientific papers do not drive messages home as convincingly as the destruction of a city. And the heatwave that torched America's west coast last year, accompanied by a constant drip of new research on melting glaciers and dying polar bears, has only strengthened the belief that something must be done.Business is changing its mind too. Five years ago corporate America was solidly against carbon controls. But the threat of a patchwork of state regulations, combined with the opportunity to profit from new technologies, began to shift business attitudes. And that movement has gained momentum, because companies that saw their competitors espouse carbon controls began to fear that, once the government got down to designing regulations, they would be left out of the discussion if they did not jump on the bandwagon. So now the loudest voices are not resisting change but arguing for it.Support for carbon controls has also grown among some unlikely groups: security hawks (who want to reduce America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil); farmers (who like subsidies for growing the raw material for ethanol); and evangelicals (who worry that man should be looking after the Earth God gave him a little better). This alliance has helped persuade politicians to move. Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's Republican governor, has led the advance, with muscular measures legislating Kyoto-style curbs in his state. His popularity has rebounded as a result. And now there is movement too at the federal level, which is where it really matters. Since the Democrats took control of Congress after the November mid-term elections, bills to tackle climate change have proliferated. And three of the serious candidates for the presidency in 2008—John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama—are all pushing for federal measures.Unfortunately, Mr Bush's new-found interest in climate change is coupled with, and distorted by, his focus on energy security. Reducing America's petrol consumption by 20% by 2017, a target he announced in the state-of-the-union address, would certainly diminish the country's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, but the way he plans to go about it may not be either efficient or clean. Increasing fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks will go part of the way, but for most of the switch America will have to rely on a greater use of alternative fuels. That means ethanol (inefficient because of heavy subsidies and high tariffs on imports of foreign ethanol) or liquefied coal (filthy because of high carbon emissions).The measure of Mr Bush's failure to tackle this issue seriously is his continued rejection of the only two clean and efficient solutions to climate change. One is a carbon tax, which this paper has long advocated. The second is a cap-and-trade system of the sort Europe introduced to meet the Kyoto targets. It would limit companies' emissions while allowing them to buy and sell permits to pollute. Either system should, by setting a price on carbon, discourage its emission; and, in doing so, encourage the development and use of cleaner-energy technologies. Just as America's adoption of catalytic converters led eventually to the world's conversion to lead-free petrol, so its drive to clean-energy technologies will ensure that these too spread.A tax is unlikely because of America's aversion to that three-letter word. Given that, it should go for a tough cap-and-trade system. In doing so, it can usefully learn from Europe's experience. First, get good data. Europe failed to do so: companies were given too many permits, and emissions have therefore not fallen. Second, auction permits (which are, in effect, money) rather than giving them away free. Europe gave them away, which allowed polluters to make windfall profits. This will be a huge fight; for, if the federal government did what the Europeans did, it would hand out $40 billion-50 billion in permits. Third, set a long time-horizon. Europeans do not know whether carbon emissions will still be constrained after 2012, when Kyoto runs out. Since most clean-energy projects have a payback period of more than five years, the system thus fails to encourage green investment.One of America's most admirable characteristics is its belief that it has a duty of moral leadership. At present, however, it's not doing too well on that score. Global warming could change that. By tackling the issue now it could regain the high moral ground (at the same time as forging ahead in the clean-energy business, which Europe might otherwise dominate). And it looks as though it will; for even if the Toxic Texan continues to evade the issue, his successor will grasp it.
990	3	Cal Thomas on whether news outlets are reporting the facts on global warmingThe inconvenient truth President Obama denies about climate change is that China’s refusal to cooperate in international efforts to address the problem makes U.S. efforts to slow its pace futile. Moreover, his policies severely handicap America’s ability to mitigate its consequences.The global climate has gone through profound cycles of cooling and warming since long before humans walked the Earth. While public figures and some scientists may disagree, the majority of researchers have concluded that human activities – in particular, greenhouse gas emissions – are now a significant cause of global warming, and they are urging concerted international action.Carbon dioxide composes 80 percent of harmful emissions. Having failed to win congressional approval for a system of permits to reduce emissions, the president has unilaterally targeted coal-fired electric utilities and fuel used in transportation to reduce U.S. emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels.Those actions are unnecessary and harmful.[pullquote]In recent years, more abundant and cheaper natural gas has motivated electric utilities to switch from coal, and energy intensive manufacturers in metals, chemicals and the like have made remarkable, cost-saving progress to reduce energy use.Responding to consumer preferences, automakers were making more fuel-efficient vehicles before the president imposed more stringent mileage standards. The high cost and stress of commuting are encouraging many young people to live closer to their jobs. Competition from rail is pressuring trucking companies to purchase more fuel-efficient rigs.Together, those free-market decisions have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 9 percent from 2005 levels.Now the EPA and other federal agencies want to micro-manage those choices by imposing inflexible standards on electric utilities and other manufacturers. Progressives would happily force as many Americans as they can onto mass transit, imposing a terrible drain on state transportation and local government operating budgets.Those initiatives would not do much to arrest global warming, but by increasing taxes and production costs, they would send more jobs to China.With an economy about half the size, China already emits almost twice as much CO2 as either the United States or Europe. Every 18 months, its emissions grow enough to replace the emissions savings the United States will accomplish by hitting the president’s 15-year target.Other developing countries, like India, are similarly adding to the problem; however, China accounts for about 85 percent of the annual increase in global CO2 emissions.When jobs are outsourced to China, global emissions go up, because China uses energy less efficiently and relies more heavily on coal than the United States, and the growth of manufacturing encourages migration to cities where folks use more electricity and automotive fuel.Simply, without China’s cooperation, U.S. efforts are futile.Progressives propose to bring China and other nations along through diplomacy, but despite considerable effort, the president has not been able to obtain Beijing’s cooperation on climate change, its undervalued currency, or just about anything else that would constrain the Middle Kingdom’s growth.Put bluntly, if man-made emissions are the culprit, then by China’s actions alone global warming is going to happen with the force and fury many fear. The United States can do little to stop it, and efforts to do so will only reduce U.S. resources available to mitigate its consequences.U.S. economic growth has fallen from 3.4 percent during the Reagan-Clinton years to 1.7 percent since the beginning of this century. This slowdown was caused by U.S currency and trade policies toward China that disadvantage U.S. manufacturers, restrictions on offshore oil and gas development that keep America dependent on imports, and costly and ineffective regulations on banking, health care and other industries.Millions of Americans are without decent jobs, and governments at all levels are severely challenged. Those will get worse if the nation continues on its current path.Rising temperatures will confront federal and state agencies with unparalleled challenges, as droughts dislocate cattle ranchers in the Southwest, insects threaten forests, arable regions shift north, rising seas flood coastal cities and new diseases attack humans, plants and animals.Moving populations and economic activities will cost trillions of dollars, and an economy impoverished by mindless micro-management from Washington simply won’t be able to generate the tax dollars to foot the bill.Americans will be forced to abandon farms and cities – simply, fend for themselves – as Washington will not be able to sustain the essential elements of civilization.
224	5	Climate change has plunged the Western U.S. into its worst drought in two decades. And a record-breaking heat wave only made things worse.In Arizona and Nevada, it’s been so hot that doctors warned people they could get third-degree burns from the asphalt. Wildfires raged in Montana and Utah. Power grids in Texas strained as officials asked residents to limit appliance use to avoid blackouts.The levels in Lake Mead, which supplies water for millions of people, are at their lowest since the 1930s. In one California lake, the water was so shallow that officials spotted plane wreckage from a 1986 crash.And that’s just in the U.S. Experts say global temperatures will keep rising as countries — and companies — fail to limit their planet-warming emissions. Smaller countries often pay the price for wealthier nations’ pollution through extreme weather. “Most of these gases have come from the United States, China, the European Union, Russia and other developed countries,” Bernard Ferguson writes. Yet islands like the Bahamas, where Ferguson is from, “are on the front lines of the climate crisis.”The problems in the West and around the globe are more evidence that climate change is already affecting us. But there are also reasons for hope.For The Times Magazine’s climate issue, Ezra Klein spoke with experts to compare political progress in the U.S. with the scale of the crisis. “Our politics co-evolved with a century of fossil fuels, and so a huge portion of our regulations still favor the incumbent, which is fossil fuels,” Saul Griffith, a scientist and founder of a nonprofit, said.In Australia, Griffith said, a kilowatt-hour of energy generated by rooftop solar panels costs about a third of what it would from a U.S. power grid. “We can make everyone’s energy future cheaper, but politics has to work with technology, which has to work with finance,” he said.Cities have been adapting in other ways: Tucson, Ariz., is a national leader in recycling wastewater for irrigation and firefighting. Districts in California are investing billions into infrastructure to store water for future droughts.More globally, another story in the magazine, by Aurora Almendral, focuses on decreasing the shipping trade’s carbon footprint. Cargo vessels are among the largest machines on the planet, and shipping generates 2.9 percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions — nearly as much as the entirety of South America. Some experts believe using wind through modern sails could considerably reduce that number. Other companies are developing more environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques that would repurpose carbon dioxide into building materials, fuels, plastics and even fish food.“You might wake in the morning on a mattress made from recycled CO2,” Jon Gertner writes. “You might drive your car — with parts made from smokestack CO2 — over roads made from CO2-cured concrete. And at day’s end, you might sip carbontech vodka while making dinner with food grown in a greenhouse enriched by recycled CO2.”For more: When wildfires blaze across the West, the focus is often on the immediate devastation.

693	5	"On Thursday afternoon, the eve of the final day of COP26, huge gaps remain between what different countries want on key issues, including how ambitious the world should be in slashing greenhouse gas emissions, all part of what climate folks call ""mitigation.""In what has been the fiercest opposition to the summit's draft agreement published Wednesday, Bolivia's chief negotiator Diego Pacheco said his country and 21 other allied nations -- including major emitters like China, India and Saudi Arabia -- would oppose the entire section on climate change mitigation. China, India and Saudi Arabia are all part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group Pacheco was speaking for. None have replied to CNN's request for comment on their stance. That section contains all of the agreement's language around reducing emissions, including the recognition that the world should aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is what scientists say is necessary to avert the worst climate impacts. The countries' biggest point of contention, Pacheco said, was urging everyone to ratchet up their ambitions on emissions by the end of 2022, for COP27. He argued developing nations should not have the same targets as rich ones who have had a greater historical role in the climate crisis. And he accused rich nations of trying to ""transfer responsibility"" to the Global South.""History matters and history is very important to understand and to put in the context in the discussion on ambition,"" he said. He added that it would be impossible for many countries in the group to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The issue at the heart of this sentiment is money. He made clear that making such a transition would be impossible if rich nations didn't start paying their fair share -- including for developing countries to adapt to the impacts of the crisis. Developing nations have repeatedly complained about so-called climate finance this week, and it and has emerged as the biggest sticking point stalling the talks.Catherine Abreu, founder of the non-profit Destination Zero, which works on climate justice issues, said that Bolivia's announcement was essentially a negotiation tactic and the underlying issue was more to do with demands for more funds. ""The draft of the text was so mitigation focused, so I think that announcement was a play,"" Abreau told CNN, saying that the countries' message meant other parts of the agreement would ""get held hostage.""The suggestion to delete the mitigation section ""is clearly a punch in the face of people suffering from the climate crisis,"" said Teresa Anderson, a spokesperson for Climate Action Network.Frans Timmermans, the EU Commission's vice president, ridiculed the call as illogical, saying there's ""no amount of money on the planet"" that could develop adaptation to withstand the extreme temperature rise that would come if mitigation were scrapped.Rich world still short in funding promiseIn a conference that is trying desperately to close gaps, the most important gap is really the one between what humans are willing to do and what's actually required to avert catastrophic climate change. A report published this week by Climate Action Tracker found that even with all the pledges made at COP26, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees of warming. Closing that gap will require deep and sustained cuts to greenhouse gas emissions over this decade, the latest UN climate science report showed.  But that costs money, and there is good reason for developing nations to be dissatisfied.More developing countries are on the frontlines of climate change than wealthy ones, and they collectively have had a much smaller role in creating this crisis.  And the money already promised hasn't even flowed in full. Rich countries agreed more than 10 years ago to transfer $100 billion a year to developing nations to help their transformation to low-carbon economies and to adapt to the climate crisis. Adaptation can involve anything from building sea walls to prevent flooding, to moving communities back from the coast and retrofitting homes to netter withstand extreme weather events. Not only has the rich world failed to deliver the $100 billion by the 2020 deadline, developing nations say it's nowhere near enough in the first place. They also want a 50-50 split between mitigation -- measures to reduce emissions -- and adaptation. Far more money has flowed to measures focused on cutting emissions.Anger against the US brewsOn top of the money for adaptation, developing countries want new systems to pay for ""loss and damage,"" which essentially involves wealthy countries being held financially liable for the impacts of the climate crisis. It's the idea behind the concept of climate reparations.A senior US official said one idea being considered is funding the Santiago Network, a UN body set up to give technical assistance to countries trying to rebuild from the impacts of the climate crisis. But the US is otherwise closed to the idea of a new loss-and-damage fund, which is what many developing nations want. The European Union has said the same thing. There is growing anger, too, towards the United States. A representative of the Climate Vulnerable Forum -- a group of around 50 nations -- said Thursday that the Biden administration was under-delivering on finance. He praised Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland, the only country that has committed any money to a loss and damage fund, with £2 million Scottish pounds ($2.7 million). It's a small but symbolic figure that shows such a fund may be possible.""The true leader that has emerged here at COP26 is not a party to the convention. She is our host, she is the First Minister of Scotland,"" Saleemul Huq, the forum's expert advisory chair told journalists. ""Just before the COP started she put a million pounds of Scottish money on the table for a new fund on loss and damage and challenged all the other leaders to match it. Yesterday, she doubled the amount. So she is the true leader who is putting money on the table for loss and damage. The US is giving us zero dollars. Europe is giving us zero euros. But Scotland has given us two million.""Behind him was sign picturing Biden with the message ""Has the US kept it's $100 billion promise? NOPE!""'You can't say no to everything'European lawmaker Bas Eickhout from the Netherlands said that US was not showing flexibility on several matters, and that its fair share on funding for the developing world would be closer to $40 billion than the $11.4 billion pledged.""The developing countries are coming here with a couple of demands, and climate finance and loss and damage are the most important,"" he told CNN. ""If the US is going to say no to everything, that will be a problem. And this will feed into what China wants. The more there is a battle between developing countries and the developed countries, the more China can sit back and relax.""Eickhout added: ""You can't say no to everything. And if you want a review mechanism on accelerating mitigation, then of course, the question will be 'OK, but is finance developing?' And if you then don't deliver on loss and damage, and you haven't delivered your $100 billion, well what are we getting in return?""Underpinning all of this is humans continued use of fossil fuels. Two sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN that Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and Australia were opposed to an article in the draft agreement calling for the phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies.Any reference to fossil fuels in the agreement would be a first and a breakthrough for the COP climate process.Saudi Arabia is one of the world's biggest oil producers, Australia is a major coal producer, and Russia is a big producer of coal, oil and gas. China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal.None of those countries have responded to CNN's request for comment. China is also unlikely to support the language on fossil fuels, the sources told CNN. Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua was asked by reporters on Wednesday whether it would support the section, but he did not answer directly and simply listed all of China's plans for coal and finance.Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud said on Wednesday that the world should recognize ""the diversity of climate solutions ... without any bias towards or against any particular source of energy.""

The grapes are ripening too fast under the blistering sun. Too much bronzing on the vine and they will wither into raisins, turning the wine into a syrupy, unpleasant blend. Getting the harvest date right is crucial for this reason, Mrs Lapini says. But climate change is making it increasingly hard.An analysis of harvest dates going back to 1354 from Burgundy in France found that air temperatures have increased so much that grapes are now harvested two weeks earlier than in medieval times. Higher peak temperatures have become the norm, with the biggest jump over the past 30 years. Elizabeth Wolkovich, a biologist at the University of British Columbia researching the impact of climate change on vineyards, says rising temperatures are also changing the taste of wine itself.For some cooler regions, warming conditions have allowed winemakers to grow more flavourful berries and enjoy longer growing seasons. Germany, best known for its Riesling white wines, has become more favourable to the heat-loving grapes used to make reds like pinot noir. Parts of rain-sodden Britain now have the perfect climate to make sparkling wines, giving British bubbly from Kent and Sussex a fair fight against French champagne. But warmer places like France, Italy and Spain have had a rotten deal. Ripening grapes at a higher temperature means more sugar and less acid in the berry, making high-alcohol, honey-like wines.Climate change is threatening the world’s wine supply, not just the wines’ flavour. In April producers in Italy and France found themselves lighting thousands of bucket-sized candles to warm the air and ward off a killer frost that threatened to destroy buds emerging with the first warm spells of spring. It wasn’t enough. In some regions the frost wiped out 90% of the crop, resulting in an estimated €2bn loss. French officials described it as “probably the greatest agricultural catastrophe of the beginning of the 21st century”.Scientists concluded that the plants were coaxed to bud early by record-breaking temperatures in March. This made the chilly nights of early April particularly damaging. Climate change may make such events more common.Some regions are better dressed for the weather; 51% of Europe’s shrublands are vulnerable, compared with just 7% in North America. Part of the problem is that European species are not well-adjusted to a warming world. They bud early, quickly reacting to warming air temperatures only to die once they suddenly drop. North America, by contrast, harbours cautious species with adaptive strategies. They do not bud until they have experienced a sufficiently long winter, regardless of short warm spells in spring.Geographical differences help explain why. With no east-west mountain ranges in North America, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold air from Arctic regions move freely across the continent, creating large fluctuations in temperature over short time periods. Constantin Zohner, a biologist at ETH Zürich, jokes that plants don’t want to take any risks in such an unpredictable climate. European winemakers, he reckons, need to take note and plant more resilient and diverse varieties of vine. There is no time to lose. ■
353	0	OPINION: The lack of a national database or any requirement to report trust numbers means we cannot know exactly how many family trusts there are in New Zealand. My guess is there are around 350,000, and possibly up to half a million. If you’re reading this, chances are you have one. It may hold your family home, and possibly some other assets; you are likely a trustee of the trust; and your children and perhaps other family members will be named as beneficiaries in the trust deed. Did you know that the trust landscape in New Zealand is shifting under our feet, and that new trust law – coming into effect in January next year – means that trustees have new, more onerous obligations in their roles? The changes matter to anyone who is involved in or affected by a family trust, whether a settlor (creator of a trust), trustee or beneficiary. READ MORE: * Top NZ lawyer closed his family trust and others should follow suit * Trusts Act will leave trustees with no excuse for ignoring their duties * Aussies buy New Zealand's largest trustee company  Here I have listed the key questions to ask yourself if you are connected to a trust: 1. What is the status of your trust? Let’s say a common scenario applies to you; you bought a house years ago and simultaneously set up a trust to hold the property. Have you been actively administering the trust, or has it been sitting in the bottom drawer? You might have forgotten about it altogether, or maybe you’re not sure exactly what was established in the flurry of paperwork and signatures at the time. Did you just talk about establishing a trust, or did you actually do it? Did you transfer your house to the trust or is it still in your own name? Review your documents or contact your professional services provider to ascertain what documents you have; with only months until the new law takes effect, this is the perfect time to work out what you did then and what you should be doing now. 2. What was the reason for establishing the trust? This is a crucial question to consider. The reason could be anything from asset protection in the event of a relationship split; to looking out for the financial welfare of children, grandchildren or other beneficiaries; or potentially to avoid death duties, which do not currently apply in New Zealand but could be reintroduced by any government at any time. Remember that whatever your reason/s, trust law is changing and new case law is constantly being made, so that original reason may no longer apply. It is likely that policymakers and the courts will continue to focus on the issue of trusts being used by some people to prevent assets being touched where a person would have a rightful claim against them. We are also seeing the courts change their approach to reflect what society’s views are, as judges are prepared to make decisions that are aligned with changes in society’s views. For example, many years ago property ownership completely favoured men, and often relationship property separation was the same. This is no longer the case and the courts will no longer accept one partner from a relationship of long duration being left with very little while the other retains the majority of the assets. Times are changing and the law along with it. Your reason for needing a trust now may be completely different from what it was when you set your trust up. 3. Does that reason still exist? It may not be legislation or case law that has changed but your own circumstances. If you have had a trust in place for two or three decades, is it still serving a purpose in your life? As tempting as it may be to be guided by family, friends, neighbours or colleagues who have trusts and are offering advice, the important thing to note is that from a legal point of view, two situations are rarely identical. The same goes for trusts, which are only concerned about what is right for you – and this will depend on your circumstances and those of the beneficiaries of the trust. To make an informed decision about what is right for you and for the trust, this needs to be worked through with a professional who can advise you regarding the changes in the law, how they will affect you and the trust, and the options which best suit your situation. 4. What is in the trust? This goes to a cost-benefit analysis of running a trust, which under the Trustee Act 1956, is different from what it will be from January next year, under the new Trusts Act 2019. The work – and therefore the cost of maintaining a trust will increase, and if you have the family home in the trust and nothing else, the cost could outweigh the benefits of having the trust. 5. Are you happy to have trust information shared with beneficiaries? From January, the trustees of a trust are required by law to share information about the trust with beneficiaries. Interestingly, over the years trusts have been formed with a big variation in the approach to beneficiaries: at times, the popular advice has been to make the group as small and confined as possible, and at other times settlors have been encouraged to include as many people as possible as beneficiaries. This means some trustees may be sharing information with a wide group of people. Are you comfortable with the beneficiaries of the trust having all that information, and with the effect releasing it might have on the family? A lot of people have a vague idea of how much their parents are worth, and under the new law those with family trusts will go from a vague idea to a spot-on idea – with the risk, in some cases, of family conflict over money and issues of fairness, pressure, obligation and possibly resentment arising. Some people are also concerned that if children have a full idea of a projected inheritance, they may not work hard to get themselves established, and will instead wait to come into “family money”. You should make sure the group of beneficiaries comprise only those who it is intended will actually benefit from the trust. If the list of beneficiaries is wider than that, you may be able to amend the group to make it smaller if the power to do that exists in the trust deed. If you want to know how you can place some control around confidentiality around trust-held assets, seek advice from a professional services provider with expertise in family trusts and deep understanding of the Trusts Act 2019. 6. If you’re a trustee, do you know what is expected of you? The Trusts Act 2019 also changes matters for trustees. You need to become fully aware of your obligations and duties under the law. While that in itself is not a new requirement, duties and obligations are now set out plainly in the Trusts Act 2019 for all to see. Trustees have no excuse for not knowing what their obligations are. Once you are fully aware, are you still comfortable with your role? Only you can decide whether you are comfortable remaining a trustee, but you need to have a good think about it, your capacity to fill the role and your comfort level with your legal duties. 7. What are your options for the future of your trust? Once you have worked through questions one to six, this is the most interesting of all. Option one: Having looked at the family trust and the reasons for setting it up and determined that it is still relevant and everything is fine, the first option is simply to make sure that everything is compliant. You may wish to seek expert advice to ensure you are doing everything by the book under the new law, but this is the easiest case. Option two: If, having looked at the trust and the reason for setting it up, you have determined that the reason doesn’t apply any more and there is no alternative reason and/or the cost of keeping it outweighs the benefits, then winding up the trust may be the best decision. Again, this can be a straightforward process but will require expert input to ensure assets are distributed from the trust and the trust is closed following a full and proper process without imposing unnecessary risk or costs. Option three: If, having reviewed the trust, you determine that retaining it is desirable but the trust deed includes nearly everyone under the sun as a beneficiary, and you want to provide information to a much smaller pool of people who will actually be receiving (or are intended to in the future) benefit from the trust, as long as the trust deed gives powers to do so, it is possible to do a variation which changes the list of beneficiaries. Alternatively, if the correct powers exist in the current trust, resettlement may be an option. To do this, a new trust is set up to transfer the assets of the current trust to, change trustees if desired, and so on. Where an existing trust does not contain the required powers to vary or resettle it may be an option to wind up the trust, transfer out the assets and then transfer them again into a new trust. This can be more complicated because of the requirement to re-gift assets, and other consequences can arise from this method which would need to be worked through – but it is all part of a framework of possibility. 8. I don’t know what to do! Who can I talk to? Coming to terms with the changes, and ascertaining the options and what is best for you, the beneficiaries and the trust can be confusing and complex, to say the least. The best idea is to seek expert professional advice. If you have a trust, depending on your circumstances and objectives you may have multiple options or there may be one obvious option to set you up well for the world beyond 30 January 2021.

238	3	"Europe's summer got off to a torrential start this year as severe flooding struck much of the continent. At least 18 people were killed in May 2016 in the heavy downpours and ensuing floods that hit France, Germany, Belgium and Romania.The River Seine in France burst its banks as waters reached their highest levels in more than 30 years, while in the German state of Bavaria, surging floodwaters crushed houses and cars, forcing some residents to climb to safety on their rooftops.Holidaymakers planning trips to Europe may well have second thoughts, while locals are asking whether climate change is playing a role. According to researchers, the answer - at least in France - was: probably.Scientists with the research program World Weather Attribution (WWA) analyzed the heavy rain and flooding in France and Germany in May to investigate the likelihood of whether climate change contributed to it.Robert Vautard, a senior scientist with France's Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace, who was involved in the research, said: ""We know that global warming leads to more downpours in general. But with this attribution analysis, we found we could tie global warming directly to the recent rainstorms in France that triggered so much flooding and destruction.""Although the results were inconclusive about climate change's link to the floods in Germany, Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: ""These latest lethal floods in Europe illustrate the rising impact of extreme weather events, including on developed and well-prepared countries like Germany and France.""Shifts in understanding The study is one of the latest in a growing number associating climate change more directly with extreme weather, suggesting that a previous hesitation over linking the two is waning.Van Aalst told DW that this shift gradually emerged in the scientific community over the last 10 years, essentially by researchers changing the question they were asking.""The question 10 years ago was, 'Is this heat wave a climate change event,'"" said van Aalst. Scientists are thinking more in terms of how likely it is that a weather phenomenon was caused by climate change.More research has since been focused on looking at weather extremes through the growing scientific field of climate change ""attribution.""Attribution studies aim to determine the causes of single, unusual climate-related events - and to understand how humans are influencing the climate by looking at whether climate change has made particular extreme weather events stronger or more likely.Drawing a lineFor Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the switch to looking at the probability of climate change affecting a particular weather event is a correct one.""We cannot and should not say that a particular heat wave was caused by global warming,"" he told DW. But we can say that the probability of such an event is different today than in the pre-industrial era, he added.But not all extreme weather events are associated with human-related climate change, and unusual extremes have always been a part of a variable climate. The challenge for scientists is to disentangle natural factors from human-caused factors.As Emanuel warned, ""there is a temptation to attribute every extreme event to global warming, just as in the 1980s every extreme event was blamed on El Niño.""In the latter case, a few of those attributions were correct, he said. ""This temptation must be avoided.""Lovers of hot summers rejoiceFor people craving sun during their summer getaways in Europe, these climate change-linked extremes may spell a higher chance of intense downpours but also heat waves in some parts of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean.It was ""virtually certain"" that climate change increased the likelihood of the heat wave that swept countries across Europe in the summer of 2015, according to a team of international scientists that included the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' specialist reference center on climate change.Jeff Knight, a research scientist at the Met Office - the United Kingdom's national weather service - told DW that the summer climate has warmed across Europe by more than 1 degree Celsius since 1900, with most of this warming attributable to human-caused changes, mainly emission of greenhouse gases.""This change has already dramatically increased the frequency of heat waves,"" he told DW. ""The European summer climate is expected to warm further in future.""How prepared is Europe for extreme summer weather?Sun-seekers may welcome the high bursts of heat - but for others, very high temperatures in a continent poorly adapted to cope with them could be deadly.Van Aalst told DW that in Europe, hospitals and old people's homes generally aren't air-conditioned, and that people don't drink enough water because they aren't accustomed to such hot weather. This puts the elderly and chronically ill in particular at risk.Although Europe may not be perfectly equipped to handle extreme weather events, it is relatively well prepared compared to countries with fewer resources, namely in the developing world.""In the Paris floods, the Louvre moved its artworks out, so that shows how organized it was,"" he told DW. ""But in other countries, not even people [much less artworks] are protected so well."""
566	5	"Auckland, environment and Māori affairs reporter, NZ HeraldThe Climate Change Commission is warning the Government not to ""lock"" New Zealand into a high-emissions future and ""compound"" the crisis with its Covid-19 economic recovery.The Government has put the call out for ""shovel ready"" projects to create jobs once the country is out of lockdown.In a letter to Climate Change Minister James Shaw, the Commission - established last year to guide the state in reaching carbon neutrality - urged a ""climate change lens"" be applied to choosing such projects.""An economic stimulus package can either speed up or stall our progress on climate change,"" said the letter, signed by Committee chair Rod Carr.Investing in low-emissions practices, technologies and infrastructure could create jobs and ensure people were better off both now and in the future, while limiting the physical impacts of climate change.""Conversely, investments that lock New Zealand into a high emissions and exposed development pathway will only compound today's crisis with a future one.""READ MORE:• Covid 19 coronavirus: Environmental benefits of coronavirus pandemic across the world• Covid 19 coronavirus: How the climate is benefiting from pandemic• Covid 19 coronavirus: Shovel-ready projects must reduce carbon impact, says Go Eco• Covid 19 coronavirus: Wastewater samples taken from Covid-19 cluster hotspotsThe letter, also sent to Finance Minister Grant Robertson and several other ministers, encouraged the Government to maintain its commitment to a ""productive, inclusive, sustainable, and climate-resilient economy"", and base its decisions around certain principles.These included ensuring any long-term investments would not lock New Zealand into a high-emissions development pathway, bringing forward any climate-friendly projects planned, preparing the workforce for a low-emissions and climate resilient economy and society, and ensuring Māori were involved in decision-making.The Commission also urged the Government to maintain current emissions reduction incentives, and not to abandon its planned reforms to the Emissions Trading Scheme.Late last year it unveiled a range of proposals, including doubling the emissions price cap in the ETS to $50 per tonne of emissions, up from $25 in a bid to help curb New Zealand's overall carbon output.The Government wants New Zealand's carbon emissions to peak in 2020 and slowly come down towards 2030.But at the current rate, New Zealand is predicted to fall woefully short of its obligations under the Paris Agreement.This month non-governmental organisations Forest & Bird, Greenpeace, WWF-New Zealand, Generation Zero, EDS and Ecologic wrote to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urging a ""transformative"" economic recovery to tackle climate change, save native species, improve freshwater quality, and restore oceans.The group recommended a range of climate-friendly economic projects, including electrifying and expanding the rail network, making homes warmer and more energy-efficient, investing in renewable energy, and expanding cycleways and active transport.In Auckland, environmentally-focused councillors have been lobbying officials to broaden the criteria for projects to be ""climate positive"" and align with council's targets of halving Auckland's emissions by 2030.On Sunday the Government announced it would help councils with up to 90 per cent funding to expand footpaths and roll out temporary cycleways to help people keep two metres apart after the level 4 lockdown was lifted.Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said the plan would ""help to future-proof our active transport network of cycleways, shared paths and footpaths, meaning that as the restrictions eventually lift, more people will have an alternative, healthy means to get around the city without adding to traffic congestion and carbon emissions""."
991	4	"Six countries—America, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Ghana and Bangladesh—have agreed to a five-year programme to cut their emissions of ""short-term climate forcings"", a suite of pollutants that linger less long in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, but which nonetheless have a profound affect on the amount of solar energy it absorbs. These pollutants (soot, methane and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) are believed to contribute about a third of the human-caused rise in global temperatures. The countries concerned hope to persuade others to join their scheme, which is called the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants.This is an excellent idea. Methane, which comes from decaying organic matter, stays in the air for only 12 years but absorbs some 20 times as much energy as carbon dioxide. Soot hangs around for just a few days; but also absorbs heat and, when it falls to the ground on snow-covered mountain ranges, increases the amount sunlight abosrbed, which makes snow and ice melt faster. HFCs, emitted by refrigerants and solvents, have a warming effect 1,440 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.Reducing emissions of these forcings would slow the current rate of warming: America's State Department estimates its proposed measures could slow warming by 0.5°C by 2050. Nor do they look especially costly. The initial budget is $15m, with most of that coming from America. There is already a template for dealing with similar problems. The Montreal Protocol of 1987 successfully eliminated ozone-damaging chloroflourocarbons from the atmosphere. And they promise other benefits, unrelated to the climate. For example, these pollutants cause millions of premature deaths every year. They also lower crop yields.But excellent as this is, the world's soaring carbon dioxide emissions remain the elephant in the atmosphere. They are the single biggest contributor to rising temperatures, will remain in the atmosphere for 100 years, and unless drastic action is taken to mitigate them, costly and dangerous climate change will not be averted."
448	4	"New data from EU satellites shows that 2020 is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the world's warmest year. The Copernicus Climate Change Service says that last year was around 1.25C above the long-term average. The scientists say that unprecedented levels of heat in the Arctic and Siberia were key factors in driving up the overall temperature. The past 12 months also saw a new record for Europe, around 0.4C warmer than 2019.Last December, the World Meteorological Organization predicted that 2020 would be one of the three warmest years on record. This new, more complete report from Copernicus says that last year is right at the top of the list. The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level. Temperature data from the system shows that 2020 was 1.25C warmer than the average from 1850-1900, a time often described as the ""pre-industrial"" period.One key factor driving up the temperatures was the heating experienced in the Arctic and Siberia. In some locations there, temperatures for the year as a whole were 6C above the long-term average.This exceptional warming led to a very active wildfire season. Fires in the Arctic Circle released a record amount of CO2, according to the study, up over a third from 2019. The Copernicus service concludes that while 2020 was very marginally cooler than 2016, the two years are statistically on a par as the differences between the figures for the two years are smaller than the typical differences found in other temperature databases for the same period.More data on 2020's temperature will be released in the next week or so from other agencies, including Nasa and the UK Met Office. The scientists say that the closeness between the years is all the more remarkable considering the impacts of the El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a weather cycle. Twenty-sixteen was made warmer by a strong El NiÃ±o event while 2020 was made slightly cooler by an emerging La NiÃ±a in the second half of the year.Europe also saw a new record level of warming for the year, 0.4C warmer than 2019. A major heat wave in July and August was an important factor driving up the mercury across the continent. Globally, the 10-year period from 2011-2020 is the warmest decade, with the last six years being the six hottest on record. ""Twenty-twenty stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic,"" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.""It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future.""While a strong La NiÃ±a may cool temperatures a little in 2021, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are likely to remain high, contributing to ongoing warming. New data from the UK's Met Office suggests that average concentrations of CO2 will reach levels that are 50% higher than they were before the industrial revolution. Researchers predict that annual average CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii will be around 2.29 parts per million (ppm) higher in 2021 than in 2020. Despite the global slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientists say this rise is being driven by emissions from the use of fossil fuels and from deforestation.While weather patterns linked to the La NiÃ±a event may boost growth in tropical forests and increase the amount of the gas that's absorbed, it won't be enough to slow the overall rise. The Met Office says that CO2 will exceed 417ppm in the atmosphere for several weeks from April to June. This is 50% higher than the level of 278ppm that pertained in the late 18th Century as widespread industrial activity was just beginning. ""The human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,"" said Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office.""It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase.""""Reversing this trend and slowing the atmospheric CO2 rise will need global emissions to reduce, and bringing them to a halt will need global emissions to be brought down to net zero. This needs to happen within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C."""
995	5	Opinion: Yes there is a climate emergency. Yes, human activities have caused global warming. Yes, actions are urgently needed. Last year, Sir David Attenborough completed A Life on Our Planet both as a book and an accompanying film. You may have seen the film but the book is much better. It’s title is A Life on Our Planet – My Witness Statement and a Vision for the Future. I recommend it to all politicians and CEOs. David Attenborough provides irrefutable evidence for “the true tragedy of our time: the spiralling decline of our planet’s biodiversity”. Humans have exploited nature and the environment to the extent that there are now four ‘boundaries’ committing the Earth to failure. Humans are polluting the Earth with fertilisers. We are converting natural habitats at too great a rate. We are warming the Earth far too quickly. Most importantly, humans are the cause of the ‘Great Decline’, the spiralling loss of biodiversity. READ MORE: * Nature being destroyed 'at a rate unprecedented in history', new report warns * Iconic environmentalist and filmmaker Sir David Attenborough turns 93 * A million species are threatened with extinction, and the rates are accelerating  The Great Decline has been taking place for centuries but the rate of loss and extent of damage has gradually increased. Some changes may occur slowly over several years before being detected. But over a lifetime, as David Attenborough explains, the changes in nature become very clear. It’s not just species that are declining and becoming extinct. Humans have stirred and mixed species from all over the Earth. The monetary cost alone of trying to manage introduced pests costs millions of dollars every year. Interfering with the biogeography of life has caused the extinction of many species and destroyed the intricate relationships within natural communities. Life supporting ecological systems (both terrestrial and aquatic) are being destroyed faster than ever before. What’s so troubling is that this unsustainable and inequitable exploitation of nature and nature’s services is not new. For decades there have been reports, conferences, conventions, charters, and legislation addressing these issues. But still over decades the destruction and loss of biodiversity continues – with implications for human welfare. What needs to be done? It’s obvious that the number and extent of projects restoring biodiversity must be increased as a matter of urgency. At the same time we need to have a discussion about the relationships between humans and nature. Many people fail to accept or understand that we humans are part of nature and not superior to nature. If more people accepted that we are just part of nature then perhaps biodiversity would be given the respect that it deserves. Think of trees as companions, soil as a living organism, rivers as life supporting systems and oceans as ecological mysteries. Very topical to sustainability and the environment is the recent report by Simon Upton (Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment). In addition to four recommendations, the report (Not 100% – but four steps closer to sustainable tourism) discusses how limits to the number of international tourists can be better implemented. Limits to numbers should apply not only to international tourists but also to all New Zealand citizens. In my opinion it is a privilege for anyone to have access to nature reserves, national parks, the coasts, rivers and the oceans – but that must not be seen as a right. It is a privilege! There is too much emphasis on climate change at the expense of not acknowledging and not grappling with the destruction of biological diversity in all its diverse forms. New Zealand must acknowledge that the biodiversity crisis is just as important as the climate emergency. To that end, there is an urgent need for a ‘Biodiversity Crisis Commission Report’.

(Reuters)A Canadian government website claims that global warming is forcing Santa Claus to relocate his toy-making village to the South Pole.The Policy Horizons Canada website said last week that Santa signed an agreement with the “international community” to move his operation to the South Pole because of melting Arctic ice.“Santa’s relocation agreement marks the first time that the international community agrees on a common legal definition of climate change that includes refugees as corporations, as well as individuals,” the website said. ""This deal is expected to lead to the deployment of a global climate change refugee visa system that in the near future could help to more easily relocate individuals and corporations facing the impacts of climate change.”The statement comes as part of a series of Christmas-themed blog posts about Canadian policy concerns, including global warming, the Daily Caller reported.Scientists recently warned that global warming could increase the amount of poverty and hardship in the world. Europe would also see a surge in “climate refugees,” according to a study.Experts have long warned that rising temperatures and extreme weather could increase the number of people in poor countries seeking refuge in richer, more temperate nations, but the phenomenon has previously been studied only at a small scale.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
540	4	"Both The New York Times and Politico published stories this week based off a climate change report, but somehow came to very different conclusions about what the report means.This article is from the archive of our partner .Both The New York Times and Politico published stories this week based off a climate change report from the National Academy of Sciences titled ""Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises,"" but somehow came to very different conclusions about what the report means.Politico opens by warning readers that, according to the report's findings, global warming is happening, and we'll start to really, really notice it soon: Climate change isn’t just a problem facing future generations, a new scientific report warns, saying the planet could suffer serious and abrupt climate threats in the next few years or decades — leaving nations with a narrow window to adapt.Times contributor Andrew C. Revkin concluded, on the other hand, that climate change effects are not imminent: The findings... reinforce the reality that the biggest impacts of greenhouse-driven global warming still lie several generations in the future.Huh.The devil, as always, is in the details. The report authors write in the study's abstract that our climate is changing now much faster than it has over millions of years of the earth's development — which isn't really news. They go on to advise world leaders to take action to prevent future, deadly damage to the environment which is, again, standard scientific consensus. Politico appears to be responding to an accelerated time frame mentioned by the authors:The primary timescale of concern is years to decades. A key characteristic of these changes is that they can come faster than expected, planned, or budgeted for, forcing more reactive, rather than proactive, modes of behavior.What Politico presumed, apparently, was that the ""years to decades"" in question are expected to occur within our lifetimes. However, Revkin asked report author Richard Alley (who also worked on a 2002 installment of the report called ""Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises,"") to elaborate on this year's findings, and he explained that drastic change is unlikely before the year 2100: Enough of the hard work of measuring and modeling has been done to provide high scientific confidence that while we are and will affect the north Atlantic with climate change, and this will have consequences, it is very unlikely that there will be a huge and abrupt change in the coming decades.Revkin writes that according to the report, there is a moderate risk of certain abrupt shifts — like more intense heat waves and other natural disasters; lower levels of ocean oxygen; and changes in species and ecosystems — occurring in this century. Changes like rising sea levels and climate variability alterations are improbable before, but more likely after, 2100.Of course, a less severe abruption could still pose a huge threat to human life, and perhaps Politico is focusing on practical ramifications of less-severe effects. Alley says, ""Katrina’s high waters just made it over the levee, and the difference between 'just over' and 'not quite over' proved to be a lot of billions of dollars and human disruption."" So the distinction between less- and more-severe is not actually all that comforting.Both articles stress that the report outlined a number of measures that governments must take to rein in the effects of climate change... something that the 20-30 whales currently trapped in the Everglades probably agree is definitely a real thing. This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.We want to hear what you think about this article.

981	2	During the 1970s, Nashville averaged just under a foot of snowfall each winter. Nowadays, Music City is lucky to see half that in a season.The same is true in Knoxville, El Paso and Albuquerque; all have seen their typical wintertime snowfalls slashed by half in the past 50 years. And they’re not alone. A broad swath of the United States is seeing changing snowfall patterns, many of which are commensurate with those expected as a result of climate change.In much of the South, the Plains and the interior Mid-Atlantic, seasonal snow totals are dwindling. That’s according to Climate Central, a nonprofit group specializing in climate change research and communication. A report released Wednesday reveals where snow hopes are beginning to melt away, while a select few locations may actually be seeing more snow thanks to climate change.Snowfall was seen to be decreasing especially rapidly in the South. These are largely areas that pick up their snow in marginal environments anyway, so any subtle warming can tip the scales and favor temperatures above freezing. That can cut back on snowfall.This was also prevalent in parts of the Rockies and interior Appalachians, as well as the central and southern Plains in between. Springfield, Mo.; Evansville, Ind.; and Lubbock, Tex., all saw a greater than 40 percent decline in annual snowfall between in the 2010s compared with the 1970s. Even State College, Pa., saw about 20 inches per year less during the 2010s.Perhaps the most telling aspect of the report wasn’t necessarily where snowfall is decreasing, but rather when. “In the shoulder seasons, when we look at the nationwide average, in the fall and the spring, we’re starting to see a tendency for the amount of snow to decrease,” Climate Central meteorologist Sean Sublette said.That’s because the “shoulder seasons” on either side of winter — spring and fall — are warmer than winter. By nature of being transitional seasons, their snowfall events typically occur at warmer temperatures closer to the freezing mark. Any climate warming would nudge spring and fall snow events above freezing first, before affecting any trends in the wintertime.In the South, 13 out of 14 cities saw a decrease in fall snowfall, while 71 percent experienced a drop in spring snowfall. Each of the five stations in the Southwest recorded a drop in fall and spring snowfall. And in central regions, three-quarters of stations witnessed a decline in fall and spring snowfall.And in the Northeast, 71 percent saw a decline in the fall, but less than half did in springtime.In the dead of winter, Sublette says the trends “are much more piecemeal.”In a few spots, snowfall is actually increasing — particularly in the wintertime. According to the report, this occurred in some Northeast cities as well as several communities in the Upper Midwest. Why?For every degree Fahrenheit the air temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water. That means that, as long as temperatures stay below freezing, an increase in temperature could lead to a juicier storm and actually produce more snow. For areas that are already plenty cold, such as the Upper Midwest and Interior Northeast, that could be a trend going forward — until, down the road, rising temperatures push some storms over the freezing line.With a greater atmospheric moisture content, Sublette said, we would expect to see “more snow when the temperature is sufficiently low.”The report also mentioned that lake-effect snow off the Great Lakes will probably increase because of climate change. With warming temperatures, ice cover is dropping. That leaves comparatively warmer waters exposed, which are source for lake-effect snow bands.“With open lakes, you get much more heat and moisture flux off the lake, and again if it stays below freezing, you have more snow in that time frame” Sublette said.In recent years, there has been a demonstrable trend in many East Coast cities, during which some winters will feature booming blockbuster storms while others pass with hardly a flake. The “feast or famine” nature of the snowfall may have a climate explanation behind it.“It gets back to the fundamentals of the physics of these systems,” said Dave Robinson, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Rutgers, who runs the university’s Global Snow Lab. “You can develop stronger storms over warmer seas. And with more moisture in the air and a greater temperature contrast.”As long as you can still be “dynamically cold enough to snow … they’re powerful systems. We’re seeing some suggestion of more large storms, more impactful storms, up in the north,” Robinson said.The team reviewed snowfall data from 244 locations between 1970 and 2019. After whittling down the count based on which met their stringent continuity requirements, 145 data sets remained. They then performed “endpoint analysis,” comparing average snowfall for each location during the 1970s vs. the 2010s. The results reported focused primarily on contrasting those two decade-long blocks in each city.Thereafter, the scientists sorted their results geographically into nine regions nationwide. The West did not offer enough observation stations to discern a meaningful trend. In the Southwest, it was marginal.Endpoint analysis is at times useful. By virtue of design, however, it “skips over” anything that is happening in between endpoints. Given how much snowfall amounts change year to year and even decade by decade, a more rigorous analysis would be needed to see how those “endpoints” fit into context.“The point is that snowfall is so variable year to year and even decade to decade,” Robinson said.He pointed out that, if the report’s analysis had started in the 1960s, snowfall reductions in the East would have appeared even more impressive. “Here in the Mid-Atlantic, the ’60s were the most snowy [decade] on record.”Overall, though, Robinson found it to be a “very respectable study,” stating that the results fall in line with what should be expected thanks to climate change. He noted that the report’s authors were wise to only review stations with more than 5 inches of snow annually, appreciating the regional breakdown as well.Across the board, atmospheric scientists wish that more data was available, particularly for a longer time series. “I’m one who is very data driven,” said Robinson.Sublette agrees. “You always want to have more data.” But a variety of factors “make it very difficult to get strong data.”While the report’s analysis aims to explore several topics in greater detail, the trends indicated by its results are in clear agreement with what the science predicts should be associated with climate change.“The take home is that what we have seen with the limited data is consistent with a warming climate,” said Sublette.As the seasons continue to compress, with more mild/less snowy autumns and springs, there’s the chance that winter’s duration in many areas will continue to narrow. But that doesn’t mean a decline in snowfall everywhere, as results showed.“They’re very complex issues,” Robinson said.
743	5	Twelve years. According to climate scientists, that’s how long until we hit the 1.5C tipping point if we carry on as we are.Such a shift in our planetary temperature will imperil not only low-lying areas because of the increased risk of floods, but will have consequences for all of us – not least due to the necessary migration of millions of people away from areas that become uninhabitable.Coral reefs will vanish; many ancient trees will not survive; extreme weather events will become ever more common. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change paints a bleak picture.Yet the scientists are also clear that we can still hold the line on further damaging change – if we’re prepared to act fast and invest a great deal of money. By reducing CO2 emissions by nearly half from their 2010 levels, we could give ourselves a fighting chance; by planting millions of trees and using technology to further capture carbon dioxide too, we might just do it.But in all honesty it is hard to feel optimistic about the world’s ability to make that happen. The World Wildlife Fund’s lead climate change scientist, Chris Weber, says “the difference between possibility and impossibility is political will”, which in present circumstances is unnerving, to say the least.For one thing, the world’s most powerful politician is arguably its most famous climate change sceptic. According to Donald Trump, “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. Sure enough, he backed up such Twitter trash-talk by pulling America out of the Paris climate agreement soon after taking up residence in the White House.Meanwhile, in China – the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter by a distance – the amount of carbon being thrown into the atmosphere is increasing: emissions rose by 4 per cent in the first three months of 2018. As it goes, the Chinese have invested significantly in renewables, yet the growing prosperity of its vast population continues to increase demand for energy to such an extent that curbing carbon output is challenging, to say the least. India’s CO2 emissions are also soaring – albeit from a much lower base, which means there is a glimmer of hope on the subcontinent for a greener future.Read our full mailing list consent terms hereRead our full mailing list consent terms hereEven at the individual level, though – and even among those who accept that climate change is a real and present danger – is there really the will to change our ways for good? We might be more likely to consider a car’s carbon emissions when we choose a new motor; but are we really much less inclined to drive the short distance to the shops when there’s a bit of rain in the air?Likewise, we might be shocked when we see a show on TV like last week’s Drowning in Plastic – which revealed the amount of plastic being swallowed by seabirds, among other horrors – but can we maintain the hastily made resolution never again to buy plastic tat for the kids when they’re whining their way round the supermarket?Those who deny climate change remain peculiarly certain that all will be well. And in light of Trump’s attitude, China’s demographic reality, as well as our own human weakness, there is a temptation to throw up our hands and give it all up to fate.But of course we mustn’t. After all, even if there was a modest chance that the vast majority of climate scientists and policymakers were right in their conclusions about the way we are changing our planet – and about the likely consequences – then it would seem sensible to act in a way that might reduce the level of harm we are doing to the planet (frankly, it would seem bonkers to do otherwise). That means making myriad small changes to our lives; and it means pressuring politicians to pursue green policies.We may not be able to hold back the tide – and at present the outlook looks pretty bleak: but for goodness sake let’s at least try.
432	5	"Concentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017. In their annual greenhouse gas bulletin, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend.Carbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years.Researchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11.Concentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees. Since 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%.2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade. The scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time.""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.That's because of the impact of El NiÃ±o, the naturally occurring weather phenomenon which peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.Not so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction.""I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia.""CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!""There have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation.  Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming. Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production. Instead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches. Earlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agency traced CFC-11 production to a number of factories across China. Scientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come. ""It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol. ""If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades."" The news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction. Levels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade. Nitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels. Essentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success. The report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted. ""CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,"" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.""There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere. ""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.""The scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050. The WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases. ""The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,"" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee.""The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are."" "
221	3	A dead bird of prey lying in the grass near a windfarm is the stark image on the home page of a new German website. “Climate change – we have got a couple of questions” is the headline that greets visitors, but the questioners already seem to know the answers to their 16 questions. “Due to an alleged climate emergency, new laws are to be passed prescribing a new way of life for us, one that will have adverse environmental effects and could lead to the deindustrialisation of Germany.”Klimafragen.org is the latest attempt to question the scientific and social consensus around the climate crisis in Germany. The authors, all from well-known climate-denier institutions and conservative political circles, list areas where they say Germany’s climate policy still has blindspots, notably over climate models, sea levels, energy conversion and counter-opinions. Parliamentary groups in the Bundestag, they argue, should provide answers to their questions, although some are based on outdated findings. According to the organisers, about 33,500 people have signed up, seeking answers.A similar petition fizzled out in September 2019: then, Fritz Vahrenholt, a former Social Democratic party (SPD) environment minister in Hamburg, ex-chief executive of a subsidiary of the energy giant RWE and well-known climate change denier, wrote to members of the Bundestag. His letter outlined his own “model calculation”, according to which plants can absorb very much more CO2 than science suggests. The author of a study he cited later contradicted this interpretation.Deniers of manmade climate change don’t have an easy time in Germany. For years, a stable 80% of the population has been convinced of climate change, supports a switch to greener energy and backs tougher climate goals. Environmental campaigners regularly receive increased donations and report growing membership. In contrast to the US, UK or Australia, there is barely a single major German company that openly opposes climate science. And the media rarely give a platform to anyone sceptical about the scale of the climate crisis.But what the deniers now have instead is a platform in the German parliament. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) challenges the scientific consensus on climate, describes climate policy as “hysteria” and mocks Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future school strikes movement, and has seats in the Bundestag and in all the German regional parliaments. The AfD has abandoned the previous cross-party consensus on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Paris climate agreement. It sees itself as the defender of disputed diesel technology, rails against the supposed “eco-madness” and rewards climate change deniers – even those who challenge all the serious scientific findings – with invitations to address parliamentary committees. Strategically, the AfD is using climate politics as a key way to distinguish itself from the established parties. Its leader, Alexander Gauland, sees climate as the “third big issue for the AfD” after the euro and the refugee crisis.The party receives public funding, yet is now the main destination for climate crisis denial. And increasingly the view that all this stuff about climate catastrophe can’t possibly be true is openly heard in the mainstream. After the IPCC’s special report on agriculture, for example, Gero Hocker, a Free Democratic party (FDP) MP, accused the experts of not looking hard enough at the details – but without backing up his accusation. His party colleague Nicola Beer describes the “supposed appearance of more extreme weather events” as “fake news”. A magazine published by the German Rotary Club published a piece that described the climate crisis as an instrument in the struggle against capitalism. “Climate change is a highly ideological, subversive concept that has made a utopia of ‘climate salvation’ [and] a goal of political action and a moral commandment,” it said.The pushback on climate is partly down to the fact that the government has for so long shirked its responsibilities, according to Martin Kaiser of Greenpeace Germany. Rather than seeing the switch to a low-carbon economy as an opportunity and communicating accordingly, even members of Angela Merkel’s cabinet have talked about how expensive, difficult and disputed energy conversion is. “If the government is always in the business of playing off the social cost against ecology, rather than bringing the two together, we shouldn’t be surprised if populists take them at their word,” Kaiser says.Deniers remain on the defensive. The Fridays for Future protests have been defining the debate, and while Germany’s coal phase-out isn’t due until 2038, the switch is now inevitable and has about €40bn of finance behind it. A climate protection law will steer Germany to net-zero emissions by 2050. Business lobbies are pressing for greater clarity on climate goals and renewables. And the Greens, who have for decades led the demand for greater ambition in terms of climate protection, enjoy 20% support in the polls – a new government in 2021 looks unlikely without them.Carel Mohn, editor-in-chief of the factcheck website klimafakten.de, which is financed by the Mercator Foundation and the European Climate Foundation, doesn’t foresee a huge challenge from denialists. More worrying in his view are the “yes, but” sceptics who supposedly advocate environmental protection but then get in the way of real progress. The debate is also concerning because it shows just “how weak, badly organised and ill-prepared for their job” those politicians meant to be well informed on climate really are. He can barely think of a single official authority that issues rebuttals when politicians come out with demonstrably false statements on meat consumption, forestry protection or air transport.Sometimes, though, you can rely on the climate deniers to trip themselves up, as the AfD group in the Bundestag often does. In a recent parliamentary question it asked for verification that 97% of scientists agree on the causes of global warming. The environment minister returned to the house to confirm that the figures were inaccurate: it’s 99.94%.• Bernhard Pötter writes for the German newspaper Tageszeitung
702	5	"Global temperatures could rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius (5.4-9.0 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next eight decades if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase at the current rate, the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Thursday.In the WMO's annual statement on the state of the climate, Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said that the rise would be ""considerably higher"" than that if all known fossil fuel resources were exploited.The report also said that 2018 was ""on course to be the 4th warmest year on record,"" the other three being 2015, 2016 and 2017. All the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, the WMO said.The predicted 3-5 degree rise far exceeds the target of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels that was set by the world's countries at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Even that goal would require a drastic reduction in the use of the fossil fuels that create many of the greenhouse gases behind global warming.According to scientists, the 2-degree limit is essential if humankind is to avert even partially the ill effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes and droughts.Read more:Far-right populists and climate policy: an attempt to move the goalposts Major conferenceThe WMO's warning comes ahead of the most important UN climate conference since that in Paris, which will open in Katowice, Poland, on Sunday.The meeting aims to produce a ""rule book"" for implementing the measures agreed on in Paris.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)President Obama will announce Tuesday he is planning to sidestep Congress to implement a national plan to combat climate change that will include the first-ever federal regulations on carbon dioxide emitted by existing power plants, despite adamant opposition from Republicans and some energy producers.In a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday, Obama will announce he's issuing a presidential memorandum to implement the regulations, meaning none of the steps involved in the plan will require congressional approval.In addition, Obama will say he is directing his administration to allow enough renewables on public lands to power 6 million homes by 2020, effectively doubling the capacity from solar, wind and geothermal projects on federal property.Obama also was to announce $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur investment in technologies that can keep carbon dioxide produced by power plants from being released into the atmosphere.In taking action on his own, Obama is also signaling he will no longer wait for lawmakers to act on climate change, and instead will seek ways to work around them.The linchpin of Obama's plan, and the step activists say will have the most dramatic impact, involves limits on carbon emissions for new and existing power plants. The Obama administration has already proposed controls on new plants, but those controls have been delayed and not yet finalized.Tuesday's announcement will be the first public confirmation that Obama plans to extend carbon controls to coal-fired power plants that are currently pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.""This is the holy grail,"" said Melinda Pierce of Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. ""That is the single biggest step he can take to help tackle carbon pollution.""However, critics say that Obama's changes will create more problems for America's coal industry.""This proposal will buttress an EPA proposed rule issued last year for new power plants that will essentially ban coal’s use in the future,"" Tom Borelli, a senior fellow at FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com.Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and one-third of greenhouse gases overall, come from electric power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency.Obama is expected to lay out a broad vision Tuesday, without detailed emission targets or specifics about how they will be put in place. Instead, the president will launch a process in which the Environmental Protection Agency will work with states to develop specific plans to rein in carbon emissions, with flexibility for each state's circumstances.Under one scenario envisioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, states could draw on measures such as clean energy sources, carbon-trapping technology and energy efficiency to reduce the total emissions released into the air.Heather Zichal, Obama's senior energy and climate adviser, told environmental groups Monday that Obama is working with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on a target for renewable energy to be produced at federally assisted housing projects.She framed the Obama's efforts in the U.S. as part of a broader, global movement to combat climate change, trumpeting the role the U.S. can play in leading other nations to stem the warming of the planet.Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues in the Clinton White House, said Zichal renewed a pledge Obama made in in his first year in office, during global climate talks in Copenhagen, to cut U.S. carbon emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels.""This is a policy fulfillment of what the president has been talking about and trying to accomplish for five years or more,"" said Bledsoe, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.One key issue Obama is not expected to address Tuesday is Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. A concerted campaign by environmental activists to persuade Obama to nix the pipeline as a ""carbon bomb"" appears to have gained little traction. The oil industry has been urging the president to approve the pipeline, citing jobs and economic benefits.Obama raised climate change as a key second-term issue in his inaugural address in January, but has offered few details since. In his February State of the Union, he issued an ultimatum to lawmakers: ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.""The poor prospects for getting any major climate legislation through a Republican-controlled House were on display last week when Speaker John Boehner responded to the prospect that Obama would put forth controls on existing power plants by deeming the idea ""absolutely crazy.""""Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs?"" said Boehner, R-Ohio, echoing the warnings of some industry groups.Sidestepping Congress by using executive action doesn't guarantee Obama smooth sailing. Lawmakers could introduce legislation to thwart Obama's efforts. And the rules for existing power plants will almost certainly face legal challenges in court. The Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but how the EPA goes about that effort remains largely uncharted waters.Even if legal and political obstacles are overcome, it will take years for the new measures to be put in place, likely running up against the end of Obama's presidency or even beyond it. White House aides say that's one reason Obama is ensuring the process starts now, while there are still more than three years left in his final term.Under the process outlined in the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot act unilaterally, but must work with states to develop the standards, said Jonas Monast, an attorney who directs the climate and energy program at Duke University. An initial proposal will be followed by a months-long public comment period before the EPA can issue final guidance to states. Then the states must create actual plans for plants within their borders, a process likely to take the better part of a year.Then the EPA has another four months to decide whether to approve each state's plan before the implementation period can start.The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
902	4	The world’s largest financier of fossil fuels has warned clients that the climate crisis threatens the survival of humanity and that the planet is on an unsustainable trajectory, according to a leaked document.The JP Morgan report on the economic risks of human-caused global heating said climate policy had to change or else the world faced irreversible consequences.The study implicitly condemns the US bank’s own investment strategy and highlights growing concerns among major Wall Street institutions about the financial and reputational risks of continued funding of carbon-intensive industries, such as oil and gas.JP Morgan has provided $75bn (£61bn) in financial services to the companies most aggressively expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration since the Paris agreement, according to analysis compiled for the Guardian last year.Its report was obtained by Rupert Read, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson and philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia, and has been seen by the Guardian.The research by JP Morgan economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray says the climate crisis will impact the world economy, human health, water stress, migration and the survival of other species on Earth.“We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened,” notes the paper, which is dated 14 January.Drawing on extensive academic literature and forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the paper notes that global heating is on course to hit 3.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. It says most estimates of the likely economic and health costs are far too small because they fail to account for the loss of wealth, the discount rate and the possibility of increased natural disasters.The authors say policymakers need to change direction because a business-as-usual climate policy “would likely push the earth to a place that we haven’t seen for many millions of years”, with outcomes that might be impossible to reverse.“Although precise predictions are not possible, it is clear that the Earth is on an unsustainable trajectory. Something will have to change at some point if the human race is going to survive.”The investment bank says climate change “reflects a global market failure in the sense that producers and consumers of CO2 emissions do not pay for the climate damage that results.” To reverse this, it highlights the need for a global carbon tax but cautions that it is “not going to happen anytime soon” because of concerns about jobs and competitiveness.The authors say it is “likely the [climate] situation will continue to deteriorate, possibly more so than in any of the IPCC’s scenarios”.Without naming any organisation, the authors say changes are occurring at the micro level, involving shifts in behaviour by individuals, companies and investors, but this is unlikely to be enough without the involvement of the fiscal and financial authorities.Last year, analysis compiled for the Guardian by Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental organisation, found JP Morgan was one of 33 powerful financial institutions to have provided an estimated total of $1.9tn (£1.47tn) to the fossil fuel sector between 2016 and 2018.A JP Morgan spokesperson told the BBC the research team was “wholly independent from the company as a whole, and not a commentary on it”, but declined to comment further. The metadata on the pdf of the report obtained by Read said the document was created on 13 January and that the author of the file was Gabriel de Kock, an executive director at JP Morgan. The Guardian has approached the investment bank for comment.Pressure from student strikers, activist shareholders and divestment campaigners has prompted several major institutions to claim they will make the climate more of a priority. The business model of fossil fuel companies is also weakening as wind and solar become more competitive. Earlier this month, the influential merchant bank Goldman Sachs downgraded ExxonMobil from a “neutral” to a “sell” position. In January, BlackRock – the world’s biggest asset manager – said it would lower its exposure to fossil fuels ahead of a “significant reallocation of capital”.Environmental groups remain wary because huge sums are invested in petrochemical firms, but some veteran financial analysts say the tide is changing. The CNBC money pundit Jim Cramer shocked many in his field when he declared: “I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done. They’re just done.” Describing how a new generation of pension fund managers was withdrawing support, he claimed oil and gas firms were in the death knell phase. “The world has turned on them. It’s actually happening kind of quickly. You’re seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds. It’s going to be a parade that says, ‘Look, these are tobacco. And we’re not going to own them,’” he said. “We’re in a new world.”
9	3	WASHINGTON  As millions of people along the East Coast hole up in their snowbound homes, the two sides in the climate-change debate are seizing on the mounting drifts to bolster their arguments. Skeptics of global warming are using the record-setting snows to mock those who warn of dangerous human-driven climate change  this looks more like global cooling, they taunt. Most climate scientists respond that the ferocious storms are consistent with forecasts that a heating planet will produce more frequent and more intense weather events.But some independent climate experts say the blizzards in the Northeast no more prove that the planet is cooling than the lack of snow in Vancouver or the downpours in Southern California prove that it is warming.As an illustration of their point of view, the family of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, a leading climate skeptic in Congress, built a six-foot-tall igloo on Capitol Hill and put a cardboard sign on top that read “Al Gore’s New Home.”The extreme weather, Mr. Inhofe said by e-mail, reinforced doubts about scientists’ conclusion that global warming was “unequivocal” and most likely caused by human activity.Nonsense, responded Joseph Romm, a climate-change expert and former Energy Department official who writes about climate issues at the liberal Center for American Progress. “Ideologues in the Senate keep pushing the anti-scientific disinformation that big snowstorms are evidence against human-caused global warming,” Mr. Romm wrote on Wednesday. It is perhaps not coincidental that the snowstorm scuffle is playing out against a background of recent climate controversies: In recent months, global-warming critics have assailed a 2007 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and have claimed that e-mail messages and documents plucked from a server at a climate research center in Britain raise doubts about the academic integrity of some climate scientists. Earlier this week, Rush Limbaugh and other conservative commentators made light of the fact that the announcement of the creation of a new federal climate service on Monday had to be conducted by conference call, rather than news conference, because the federal government was shuttered by the storm.Matt Drudge, who delights in tweaking climate-change enthusiasts, noted on his Web sitethat a Senate hearing on global warming this week was canceled because of the weather. As the first blizzard howled last weekend, the Virginia Republican Party put up an advertisement on the Web  titled “12 Inches of Global Warming”  criticizing two Virginia Democrats, Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello, who voted for the federal cap-and-trade legislation last year. The advertisement urges voters to call Mr. Boucher and Mr. Perriello to ask if they will help with the shoveling.Speculating on the meaning of severe weather events is not new. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and a deadly heat wave in Europe in the summer of 2003 incited similar arguments about what such extremes might  or might not  say about the planet’s climate. Climate scientists say that no individual episode of severe weather can be attributed to global climate trends, though there is evidence that such events will probably become more frequent as global temperatures rise.Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who writes on the Weather Underground blog, said that the recent snows do not, by themselves, demonstrate anything about the long-term trajectory of the planet. Climate is, by definition, a measure of decades and centuries, not months or years.But Dr. Masters also said that government and academic studies had consistently predicted an increasing frequency of just these kinds of record-setting storms, because warmer air carries more moisture.“Of course,” he wrote on his blog Wednesday as new snows produced white-out conditions in much of the Eastern half of the country, “both climate-change contrarians and climate-change scientists agree that no single weather event can be blamed on climate change.“However,” he continued, “one can ‘load the dice’ in favor of events that used to be rare  or unheard of  if the climate is changing to a new state.” A federal government report issued last year, intended to be the authoritative statement of known climate trends in the United States, pointed to the likelihood of more frequent snowstorms in the Northeast and less frequent snow in the South and Southeast as a result of long-term temperature and precipitation patterns. The Climate Impacts report, from the multiagency United States Global Change Research Program, also projected more intense drought in the Southwest and more powerful Gulf Coast hurricanes because of warming. In other words, if the government scientists are correct, look for more snow.
554	3	During the rise of mammals, Earth's temperatures spiked in a scary way that the planet may experience again soon.They were strange days at the beginning of the age of mammals. The planet was still hungover from the astonishing disappearance of its marquee superstars, the dinosaurs. Earth’s newest crater was still a smoldering system of hydrothermal vents, roiling under the Gulf of Mexico. In the wake of Armageddon our shell-shocked ancestors meekly negotiated new roles on a planet they inherited quite by accident. Before long, life settled into new rhythms: Earth hosted 50-foot-long boas sliding through steam-bath jungles, birds grew gigantic in imitation of their dearly departed cousins, and mildly modern mammals we might squint to recognize appeared. Within a few million years, loosed from under the iron heel of the vanished giants, they began to experiment. Early whales pranced across a Pakistani archipelago on all fours, testing out life in the water. The first lemur-like primates leapt from the treetops, and hoofed things of all varieties dashed through the forest.But the most striking feature of this early age of mammals is that it was almost unbelievably hot, so hot that around 50 million years ago there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks in the Arctic Circle. On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort.This is what you get in an ancient atmosphere with around 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide. If this number sounds familiar, 1,000 ppm of CO2 is around what humanity is on pace to reach by the end of this century. That should be mildly concerning.“You put more CO2 in the atmosphere and you get more warming, that’s just super-simple physics that we figured out in the 19th century,” says David Naafs, an organic geochemist at the University of Bristol. “But exactly how much it will warm by the end of the century, we don’t know. Based on our research of these ancient climates, though, it’s probably more than we thought.”Last week, Naafs and colleagues released a study in Nature Geoscience that reconstructs temperatures on land during this ancient high-CO2 hothouse of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs—the sweltering launch to the age of mammals. And the temperatures they unearthed are unsurprisingly scorching.To study Earth’s past, scientists need good rocks to study, and fortunately for geologists and fossil-fuel companies alike, the jungles and swamps of this early age of mammals left behind lots of coal. The Powder River Basin in the United States, for instance, is filled with fossil Paleocene swamplands that, when burned today, contribute about 10 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. Naafs’ team studied examples of lower-quality coals called lignites, or fossilized peat. They had been collected around the world (everywhere from open-pit coal mines in Germany to outcrops in New Zealand), and spanned the late-Paleocene and early-Eocene epochs, from around 56 to 48 million years ago. They were able to reverse engineer the ancient climate by analyzing temperature-sensitive structures of lipids produced by fossil bacteria and archaea living in these bygone wetlands, and preserved for all time in the coal. The team found that, under this past regime of high CO2, in the ancient U.K., Germany, and New Zealand, life endured mean annual temperatures of 23–29 degrees Celsius (73–84 degrees Fahrenheit) or 10–15 degrees Celsius (18–27 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than modern times.“These wetlands looked exactly how only tropical wetlands look at present, like the Everglades or the Amazon,” Naafs says. “So Europe would look like the Everglades and a heat wave like we’re currently experiencing in Europe would be completely normal. That is, it would be the everyday climate.”That modern European heat wave has, in recent weeks, sent sunbathing Scandinavians and reindeer to the beach in temperatures topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the Arctic Circle. It has also ignited devastating wildfires across Greece and triggered an excruciating weekend for Spain and Portugal. But over 50 million years ago this would have been the baseline from about 45 to 60 degrees latitude. Under this broiling regime, with unprecedented heat as the norm, actual heat waves might have begun to take on an unearthly quality.“Perhaps a heat wave in Europe would be something like 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for three weeks. We don’t know.” So that was life in the late Paleocene and early Eocene in the high mid-latitudes. But closer to the equator in this global sweat lodge, the heat might have been even more outrageous, shattering the limits of complex life. To see exactly how hot, Naafs’ team also analyzed ancient lignite samples from India, which would have been in the tropics at the time—that subcontinent still drifting across the Indian Ocean toward its eventual mountain-raising rendezvous with Asia. But unfortunately, the temperatures from these samples were maxed out. That is, they were too hot for his team to measure by the new methods they had developed. So it remains an open question just how infernal the tropics became in these early days of our ancestors, but some computers tasked with recreating this planet spit out the stuff of science fiction.“Some climate models suggest that the tropics just became a dead zone with temperatures over 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) like in Africa and South America,” says Naafs. “But we have no data so we don’t know.”Naafs’ work fits into a larger developing picture of Earth as an almost unrecognizable greenhouse planet of the distant past. University of Colorado paleontologist Jaelyn Eberle recently returned to her office in Boulder from Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian High Arctic, where she’s been doing research since the 1990s. Ellesmere is as far north as you can get before you fall off North America and run into Père Noël drifting over pack ice. Here, featureless highlands overlook ice-choked fjords and a lone Peary’s caribou might mingle with a dozen musk oxen under a vast Nunavut sky. There are also polar bears, but Eberle luckily hasn’t had any run-ins so far—though perspective can play tricks on you at the top of the world, and a snow-white artic hare on its hind legs at the appropriate distance can appear threatening enough.“You pick up your gun and get all nervous and worried and then look through your binoculars ... It’s just a rabbit,” says Eberle.But Eberle isn’t venturing this far north just for the occasional hair-raising encounter with polar wildlife. Her target is warmer-weather fauna. Though there are no trees here at the top of the world, there are tree stumps. And they are around 50 million years old.“The fossil forests on Ellesmere are spectacular,” Eberle says about the ecosystem entombed in the arctic soils. “You start really looking into them and you go, ‘Wow. We are dealing with a rainforest.’”Eberle is a vertebrate paleontologist and though there’s the aforementioned odd musk ox passing by her camp to consider, in the rocks below she has her pick of animals to study.“You’ve got alligators, giant tortoises, primates, things like that. We have these big hippo-like animals called Coryphodon. You have tapirs—so you’ve got tapirs living pretty close to the North Pole in the early Eocene, which today—clearly tapirs are not at the North Pole,” she says, laughing.The presence of these animals suggests a very warm world indeed. And yet, there is a seeming disconnect, between traditional projections for future warming—like those made by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts around 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (still frightening) and sea-level rise measured in mere inches (still frightening)—and the scarcely recognizable Earths buried in the rocks and created under similar CO2 regimes, like those that Eberle unearths.One obvious way to reconcile this disparity is by noticing that the changes to the ancient earth took place over hundreds-of-thousands to millions of years and (IPCC graphs notwithstanding) that time won’t stop at the end of the 21st century. The changes that we’ve already set in motion, unless we act rapidly to countervail them, will similarly take millennia to fully unfold. The last time CO2 was at 400 ppm (as it is today) was 3 million years ago during the Pliocene epoch, when sea levels were perhaps 80 feet higher than today. Clearly the climate is not yet at equilibrium for a 400-ppm world.And it won’t be for quite some time. And anyway, we’re clearly not content to stop at just 400 ppm. If we do, in fact, push CO2 up to around 1,000 ppm by the end of the century, the warming will persist and the earth will continue to change for what, to humans, is a practical eternity. And when the earth system finally does arrive at its equilibrium, it will most likely be in a climate state with no analog in the short evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. Most worryingly, the climate models that we depend on as a species to predict our future have largely failed to predict our sultry ancient past. And though the gulf is narrowing, and models are catching up, even those that come close to reproducing the hothouse of the early Eocene require injecting 16 times the modern level of CO2 into the air to achieve it—far beyond the rather meager doubling or tripling of CO2 indicated by the rock record.Clearly we are missing something, and Naafs thinks that one of the missing ingredients in the models is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas which might help close the divide between model worlds and fossil worlds.“We know nothing about the methane cycle during these greenhouse periods,” he says. “We know the hotter it gets the more methane comes out of these wetlands, but we know nothing about the methane cycle beyond the reach of ice cores which only goes back 800,000 years ... We know tropical wetlands pump much more methane into the atmosphere compared to [cooler] wetlands. And we know methane can actually amplify high-latitude warming, so maybe that’s some of the missing feedback.”In many ways these ancient worlds are not analogs to our own. We have to be careful when making comparisons between the two. The early age of mammals was a different world. The continents were in slightly different positions, leading to a vastly different ocean circulation and boundary conditions quite unlike our own world, 50 million years on—with all the tectonic, oceanographic, and biological changes that come with such a yawning expanse of time. But artificially jam enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and Naafs thinks that many of the wildest features of the early age of mammals could be recreated.“If we were to burn all the fossil fuels and wait a few centuries we might return to this,” he says. “Basically every type of paleoclimate research that’s being done shows that high CO2 means that it’s very warm. And when it gets very warm, it can be really, really, really warm.”
665	3	When the Arctic researchers Jacqueline Grebmeier and Lee Cooper made their annual scientific pilgrimage to frigid seas off Alaska last month, what they found was startling.Areas that were previously accessible at that time of the year only with an ice-breaking ship had become open, wavy water. “We packed our long underwear, and we never put it on,” Cooper said.In years past, the pair could convince wary volunteers to accompany them by promising walrus sightings. But with no sea ice to perch on and fewer clams to eat, the tusked butterballs have moved to more comfortable accommodations on the beaches.Instead, the research team saw huge fishing boats searching farther north for Pacific cod, and a container ship traveling a newly melted route from Quebec to Korea. It snowed only once during their three weeks on the water.While the world on average has warmed more than 1C because of human-caused climate change, the Arctic is heating much faster. The researchers found the shallow waters were up to 3C hotter than is typical throughout the water column. This year marked the second-biggest sea ice retreat toward the North Pole ever, after 2012.Many Arctic science trips were canceled due to the pandemic. Grebmeier and Cooper agreed to strict rules to make their annual trek. They quarantined at home in Maryland and then again in Anchorage before flying by charter plane to Nome and boarding the 115ft research vessel.The crew of the Norseman II had been at sea for eight months, due to tight restrictions on where they could dock. They extended their time out to accommodate the researchers. The couple also obtained samples and collected data for other researchers who could not make their usual journeys.“It’s surprising that in my lifetime, particularly in the last five to eight years, how quickly things have changed,” Grebmeier said. “You can’t project like you used to.”Grebmeier explained that the lack of sea ice was leading to higher levels of algal production – including the kind that can be deadly. Clams eat the toxic algae, and walruses, diving ducks and humans eat the clams. That’s also worrying because indigenous populations along the Alaska coast depend on clams for food.One study published this year found that marine communities in the Pacific Arctic will see profound changes in response to warming and reductions in sea ice. Larger species that live longer are likely to move toward the pole by the end of the century, disrupting the food web.Cooper said the changes were particularly sad for indigenous communities that have been in Alaska for thousands of years and are now coping with unstable sea ice and trying to hunt animals that are moving.“Not in our lifetimes is it going back to the way it was when we first started out working in Alaska in the late 1980s,” Cooper said.
26	3	"Photo / FileMore than half of the world's population faces a looming threat to the quality and availability of their drinking water because climate change and urbanisation are expected to cause an increase in groundwater organic carbon, a new University of New South Wales (UNSW) study has found.The research, published in Nature Communicationst, examined the largest global dataset of 9404 published and unpublished groundwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations from aquifers in 32 countries across six continents.DOC is a naturally occurring component of groundwater, but the higher its concentration, the more difficult and expensive it is to make groundwater drinkable. In Australia, groundwater is widely used as the main source of drinking water for many cities and towns.Lead author Dr Liza McDonough, of the Connected Waters Initiative Research Centre at UNSW, said the study forecasted elevated DOC concentrations because of projected changes in temperature and rainfall due to climate change, as well as increased urbanisation.""We identified groundwater DOC concentration increases of up to 45 per cent, largely because of increased temperatures in the wettest quarter of the year – for example, in a number of south-eastern states in the United States. We predict increases in DOC in these locations could increase water costs for a family of four by US$134 per year,"" McDonough said.""Other areas such as eastern China, India and parts of Africa already experience severe groundwater contamination issues. These may be further compounded, particularly in south-eastern China, by groundwater DOC increases associated with large predicted increases in temperature in the wettest quarter of the year by 2050.""Generally, we expect urbanisation to increase groundwater DOC concentrations by up to 19 per cent, compared to agricultural or natural land use, likely as the result of contamination – for example, through leaking septic and sewer systems.""The research, a collaboration between UNSW, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Southern Cross University, British Geological Survey, and the University of Bradford, found four major contributing factors to groundwater DOC levels: climate, land use, inorganic chemistry and aquifer age.Health threatMcDonough said increased groundwater DOC, whether naturally occurring or due to contamination, also posed a threat to human health.""Groundwater is Earth's largest source of freshwater and provides essential drinking water for more than 50 per cent of the world's population,"" she said.""But, because most health impacts caused by DOC are related to the formation of by-products of water treatment chlorination and depend on concentrations of other water chemical parameters, the World Health Organization and many countries – including Australia – do not regulate DOC concentrations in drinking water directly.""McDonough said that while DOC is a naturally occurring, key element of groundwater it could combine with, and transport, potentially dangerous heavy metals otherwise bound to rocks and sediment where groundwater occurs.""This is a concern when, for example, more than 100,000 lifetime cancer cases in the United States alone can be attributed to drinking water contaminants,"" she said.Water treatment costs to riseMcDonough said it was important to understand what caused high DOC concentrations in groundwater.""An increase in groundwater DOC concentration impacts the ability and therefore cost to make groundwater drinkable,"" she said.""For example, we projected a 16 per cent increase in annual household water costs in some parts of the United States because of rising water treatment costs – due to the need to implement additional water treatment measures to remove increased DOC concentrations.""The decrease in groundwater quality and substantial increase in water treatment costs will also compound existing constraints on groundwater resources, including availability.""Wet vs arid climatesMcDonough said the impacts on groundwater DOC levels from climate change and urbanisation, while likely to occur globally, differed by geography and climate.""Our research found that in arid climates, groundwater DOC concentrations increased with higher rainfall because microbes can better break down organic matter, such as leaves, under warm and increasingly wet conditions,"" she said.""Increased temperatures in arid environments, however, reduced groundwater DOC concentrations because when conditions are too hot and dry, vegetation and organic matter sources are limited.""By contrast, increased rain in warm and wet environments decreased groundwater DOC concentrations because heavy rainfall dilutes the DOC in groundwater.""Water treatment solutionsMcDonough said she looked forward to conducting further research to determine the best water treatment options for areas where groundwater DOC concentrations are anticipated to increase.""Our next step is to investigate how the character of DOC changes when you have different aquifer minerals, because some types of organic matter can stick to certain mineral surfaces and ultimately reduce this type of organic matter remaining in the water,"" she said.""This will help provide guidance on the most suitable water treatment options in areas where DOC concentrations are expected to increase.""Read the full research paper in Nature Communications."

325	5	BUCASIA BEACH, Australia — Mayor Greg Williamson crunched through the dead branches and kicked the sand. His government had planted trees near the shore to protect this northern Australian beach community from the effects of climate change, but someone had cut them down, apparently for a better view. “It looks to me like they started at the beach and worked their way back,” he said, pointing to the 18 felled trees. “Bloody fools — look, you can still see the saw marks.”“What they don’t realize,” he added, “is that if these dunes aren’t here, they’re not going to have a house or a view.”When international leaders met last month at the United Nations to discuss climate change, and when millions of young protesters took to the streets, the focus was on sweeping global action. But for much of the world, the response to climate change looks more like the parochial struggles of Mayor Williamson: small-town leaders laboring to persuade a skeptical public about complex science and expensive decisions. In few places is the challenge of adapting to climate change more immediate than in Australia, where 80 percent of the population lives within a few dozen miles of a coastline susceptible to rising seas and more punishing storms, and where the arid interior bakes under record temperatures. A decade ago, the country was at the forefront of adaptation expertise, creating a national research center to collect and share knowledge among academics and officials. But over time, the federal government lost interest, and in 2018 the facility’s funding fell to zero. The conservative government has mostly dismissed calls for action on climate change, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently arguing that young activists like Greta Thunberg are causing “needless anxiety.” It’s a reversal that resembles what is happening in the United States, where the Trump White House has rejected established climate science, and cities like Miami have paid for their own coastal protection. But the absence of national leadership does not change reality. It just puts more pressure on mayors and councils, including those in less populated areas, forcing them to become the climate infantry — the grunts who push through solutions on their own. In Australia, they are the ones grappling with roads falling into the sea, with disputes over home insurance as costs rise, and with who will pay for preventive measures like taller barriers at marinas. They are also managing little-noticed budget ramifications, like the hiring of flooding consultants and the quicker depreciation in value of fleets of cars battered by increased salt and sand. And that is just along the coast. Farther inland, local governments are trying to become experts in drought-monitoring technology, while areas that had never thought much about fire — even in rain forests — are suddenly examining worst-case scenarios.Among mayors, there is anger about the burden, said Dorean Erhart, who runs a state-level adaptation program. The group is helping Mackay, the sprawling area of 180,000 people and 32 beaches that Mayor Williamson leads, and other regional councils in the state of Queensland. “They understand this is something they are going to have to deal with,” Ms. Erhart said. “It’s not going away, and it involves a thousand small decisions.” For the regional council in Mackay, the challenge is especially palpable because the causes and effects of a warming planet stand side by side. Coral SeaNORTHERNTERRITORYGreat  Barrier    ReefMackayAUSTRALIAQUEENSLANDSOUTHaustraliaNEW SOUTHWALESSydneyVICTORIA400 milesBy The New York TimesDuring a tour of the area, Mr. Williamson, whom everyone simply calls Greg, stopped at a hilltop lookout where a dozen coal ships bobbed at sea between the Great Barrier Reef — which warming waters are slowly destroying — and Lamberts Beach, where Mackay’s council recently dumped extra sand and put in trees after a major cyclone.Deeper inland, over dark green hills in the distance, a major bush fire last year burned through rain forest, in what scientists described as an unprecedented occurrence.The experience of disaster has not led the community to reject coal — mining is the area’s economic driver — but it has added new demands for scientific knowledge. Mr. Williamson, a no-nonsense political independent, has become a connoisseur of sediment flows and native fauna. Standing on beaches, he rattled off erosion rates and the cost of adaptation efforts like the addition of sand, rock and mesh fences.“I’m just regurgitating what experts tell me,” he said. All over Queensland, a state nearly as large as Mexico, the cost of simple survival is already increasing. In the past two years, there were 11 weather events in the state that the authorities classified as major, according to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, and 61 councils are dealing with infrastructure recovery projects.“We’re finding the intensity and frequency of these events is increasing, and it is really creating a challenge not only in how we respond but also how we recover,” said Brendan Moon, the authority’s chief executive.Yet mayors are struggling with constituents who doubt the truth of facts and experts.“There are a lot of challenges with people saying this is all crap or we don’t know if you’re right or not,” said Mayor Ramon Jayo of the Hinchinbrook Shire Council, which sits about 300 miles up the coast from Mackay. “What I hear a lot is ‘Yeah mate, we’ll be ’right, see you later.’”In Mackay, trees and dunes have become magnets for conflict.Before Mr. Williamson’s election in 2016, the council mostly acted on its own. The parks and gardens department cleared invasive plants on the shoreline, thickened vegetation and put in fences and paths to control foot traffic, all to protect against the effects of climate change. The backlash was severe. With saplings blocking the view of many homeowners, mysterious tree slashings hit night after night. In 2017, officials tallied more than 30 separate acts of tree clearing.Over the past year, Mr. Williamson, a fifth-generation Mackay local, has tried more outreach and education, meeting frequently with residents to discuss why the trees are needed, and whether a lighter mix of vegetation might be allowed for partial ocean views.But he has not backed down. “No one has all the answers,” he said, “but what we do know is that you can’t leave beaches to themselves and expect them to stay as they are.” The latest vandalism in Bucasia Beach is especially galling, he said, because he thought progress was being made. And in interviews with a dozen residents, there was more support for the council’s efforts than the tree stumps suggest. Gary Hardiman, 46, a miner living in a bungalow near the clearing, said he wished he knew who was responsible so he could tell the vandal: “We need the trees there. If you knock them down, we’ll lose the beach.”With the culprits still unknown, Mr. Williamson said the council had no choice but to follow a harsh policy, renewed this year, that denies benefits to tree-slashing adaptation opponents and combines education with shame and a call for solidarity.In the area now providing clear views of the soft blue sea, the council will plant twice as many trees as those that were cut down and put up a large billboard.“Native vegetation provides long-term protection to our coasts and communities,” the sign will say, matching those blocking the view in other areas that were vandalized. “Help us.”
923	4	"She loves the vista. She loves docking a boat just strides from her vegetable plot. She loves spotting eagles and beavers. But there is a reticence to her joy.""The mixed feeling is that it was my neighbor's land,"" van Lelieveld says. ""I'm sad because I know how sad my neighbor is. Because he was giving up his land.""What used to be her neighbor's farm, walled off from the nearby river that posed a constant threat, is now pockmarked with water. It is flooded, purposefully, to soak up water when the river swells. It's not suitable for farming, but Van Lelieveld is able to live here. A simple small dike keeps her home and some others on the street dry, even if their backyards are not.This is all part of an ambitious climate project aptly called Room for the Rivers.The Dutch have battled for centuries to keep water off the land in their low-lying country, more than a quarter of which lies below sea level.While ""adaptation"" sounds like a dull word in climate talk, the Dutch have been adapting to the whims of water for a long time. Pumps, dikes and giant moveable seawalls protect the country, at least half of which is threatened by floods.Nothing about the Dutch example is perfectly replicable: Its landscape, tradition of political powersharing, and water-aware culture are unique. But there's a lot to be learned.The climate crisis is only intensifying that vulnerability. Erratic weather is no longer a problem for the future -- it's clearly here, in most parts of the world --  nor is it a problem just of extremes, like blazing forest fires and flash floods. It's also a matter of getting organized, as governments and people make life-or-death decisions now for potentially worse threats arriving in an even warmer world.Dutch expertise has come in handy for people running into trouble with water around the world. In the 17th Century, King Charles I asked a Dutchman, Cornelius Vermuyden, to help drain the marshes in England's Cambridgeshire. When New York City was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the US Government turned to the Dutch for help. When the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, a Dutch company was contracted to get it out.But climate change means that these brute-force methods that have worked for centuries won't always cut it. A dike can only be so large before it collapses under its own weight, and heightening it only increases the risk when it fails.In the 1990s, the Dutch government started to change tack, better understanding that the natural state of bodies of water exist for good reasons. One example is low-lying, uninhabited land next to rivers that could flood and help absorb water when it rains heavily upstream. That meant doing something unusual for the Dutch: knocking down some of the walls that once held back water, and moving people off the land.'This is the result' of climate changeTo understand why the project is so vital, right now, the headwaters of the rivers that empty into the Netherlands offer an insight.Some 300 kilometers (186 miles) up the Rhine River from Van Lelieveld's humble house lies the Ahr, a tributary that snakes through picturesque hills of west German wine country.It was here in July that floodwaters rose higher than they ever had in the collective memory of Dernau, a small town nestled between steep slopes of vineyards.""It's not easy to finds words for it,"" says Lea Kreuzberg, 23, who on July 14 was sitting in her apartment above the winery she runs with her father.In the space of just a few hours, floodwaters spilled into the courtyard, submerged the ground floor, and rose into her apartment. Kreuzberg, her boyfriend, and two winery employees retreated to the building's top floor.""They spent a terrifying night together, preserving phone battery to communicate with Kreuzberg's father, who was on vacation in Austria. The water finally peaked, then slowly subsided. Finally, at 5pm the next day, they were rescued.""In the first days, the rain made me feel very uncomfortable,"" Kreuzberg said, referring to the time immediately after the floods. ""When it started raining a bit more, the emotions came up again and I start crying,"" she added.""When we will go back here, it will not be easy to live here without being afraid.""The human impact of July's flooding was devastating. In the state of Rhineland Palatinate alone, it killed 133 people. In total, 180 were killed in Germany and 39 in Belgium. One victim was never found.Nearly 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain fell in a single 24-hour period from July 14 to 15, according to The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, causing widespread damage not only in Germany and Belgium, but also in France, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Dutch province of Limburg.The region is no stranger to floods. But EUMESTAT said that July's rainfall was ""particularly devastating"" and that those kinds of intense storms ""are becoming more likely with changing climate.""To Franziska Schnitzler, standing in the ruins of her family hotel and restaurant, that connection is clear. The 350-year-old, timber-frame building it once occupied was deemed unsafe and torn down.""We do live with the climate change,"" Schnitzler says. ""And this is the result.""And for young and old alike, climate change is intersecting with a crisis of mental health. In the days after the floods, three people in Dernau took their own lives.""It was the grandma of one of my best friends,"" Schnitzler says. ""One night she woke me up and she said, 'My grandma, my grandma, my grandma.'""""That was so hard, to lose someone after the flood.""A wake-up call for the NetherlandsThe people who have given up their homes and land in the Netherlands did it not primarily for themselves, but for others. They were asked to sacrifice to protect people in cities up- and down-river, for whom floods pose a much more acute threat.It was major flooding from rivers in 1993 and 1995 that served as ""a wake-up call,"" says Hans Brouwer, who for years has managed projects for the Dutch government's Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.""We focused for decades on the sea, and defending us from storm surges,"" he recalls. ""And then we were surprised by our rivers. And in '95 the decision was made to evacuate a quarter of a million people. So that really made an impression.""Those floods coincided with some of the first reports from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ringing the climate alarm bells.""We realized that we can expect even more water from the rivers, and at the same time it would be difficult to get rid of that water because of sea-level rise,"" Brouwer said.Some 15 years ago, Brouwer's colleagues came to Nol Hooijmaijers, a dairy farmer, and told him that that eye-shaped spit of land that he and 17 other families called home would soon need to be turned into a floodplain.""We had been through '93 and '95. So we did think that something would have to be done at some point. What that was, we didn't know,"" Hooijmaijers, now 72, said. ""Then when the government came and said that this area might be used as a floodplain, yeah, that was of course a huge shock.""""We had been convinced that we could stay here and farm for generations.""He and his fellow farmers got together and decided that would ""try to turn a threat into an opportunity.""While some left rather than deal with the heartache, Hooijmaijers, his wife, and seven other families decided to stay. They convinced the government to build enormous, six-meter-high artificial dwelling mounds, or ""terps,"" on which to relocate their farms and houses. The northern dike that had protected their land was in turn lowered, allowing floodwater to spill over the land.Change, 'even when it breaks your heart'The Room for the Rivers project was a monument to planning, foresight, and what can be achieved when government and citizen engage in collective action. Thirty-four projects -- coming in at a total cost of $2.66 billion -- mean that Dutch rivers can now absorb about 25% more water than they could in 1995.During July's enormous rainfall, van Lelieveld watched as the river swelled, picked up speed, and turned brown from silt and debris.""It's then that you can see the function of the region, because we didn't have any issues with high water here,"" she said. ""I hope that people understand that, what I have sacrificed to do that.""Brouwer described a ""paradigm shift"" in which engineers realized ""we don't even always understand how nature acts, but we take nature seriously.""The design for the area in which van Lelieveld lives, he explained, was based on a century-old map -- ""not knowing exactly why it functioned in that time, but having confidence that nature took the right choices.""The project created the wetlands that flooded her former neighbor's farm and are now home to vast flocks of birds. When she goes out in her boat, she thinks of the struggle that the farmer waged to get decent compensation for his land. ""On the one hand, I don't dare to enjoy it, because I also experienced that sadness, and saw what it did to people,"" she said.""But on the other hand, I'm very proud of what we achieved in this region. And that we can also be an example, that it's possible."""
104	5	"Air New Zealand chief pilot David Morgan on the delivery of a new Airbus A320. Video / Air New Zealand Deputy Editor - Business         Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran says passengers face having to ""put their hands in their pockets"" to help airlines tackle climate change, as moves speed up to make alternative fuel for planes mandatory         in this country.        Speaking at a recent CAPA Centre for Aviation virtual event, he said the development of sustainable aviation fuel (Saf) to power-long haul aircraft would need input from airlines, government and consumers. Passengers would have to bear some of the higher cost of new fuels.The Government announced on Tuesday that a biofuel mandate for Saf would be developed next year, taking in work already underway.While mandates for land transport are planned from 2023, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment officials recommended to Cabinet that aviation be given more time, with a regime by 2025.Establishing production of a sustainable avaiation fuel in New Zealand, or even securing reliable imported supply, requires extensive infrastructure investment at an average cost of about $1 billion, the policy paper for Cabinet says.It quotes a study by the Wood Fibre Futures project run by the Ministry of Primary Industries, which investigated making biofuel from wood fibre and says scale will be critical for making Saf commercially viable.""However, [the study] recommended waiting for 3–5 years to allow other first movers to prove that the technology pathway is commercially viable, technical problems are ironed out and the cost of the plant is lower,"" the Cabinet paper says.Air New Zealand has signed a memorandum of understanding to partner with MBIE on a feasibility study for domestic production of Saf and what government support might be needed to make that commercially feasible.Qantas this week announced it will buy blended Saf from next month, helping to reduce its carbon emissions by around 10 per cent on its flights from London.The airline says it has signed an agreement with a strategic partner to buy 10 million litres of Saf in 2022, with an option to purchase up to another 10 million litres in 2023 and 2024 for flights from Heathrow Airport. This would represent up to 15 per cent of Qantas' annual fuel use out of London.The fuel will be produced with certified bio feedstock from used cooking oil and/or other waste products. This is then blended with normal jet fuel.While Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar have flown several demonstration flights using Saf – including a 2018 flight across the Pacific powered by biofuel derived from mustard seeds – this is the first time an Australian airline will purchase Saf on an ongoing basis.In spite of a surge in development and production, Safs are up to five times as expensive as standard aviation fuel.Foran said this left a ""wicked problem"" for airlines, passengers, other industries and governments.""And it's not a problem that can be solved just by airlines. Everyone's going to have to contribute to it and probably the customer as well.""Airlines on their own couldn't absorb the extra costs, particularly those such as Air New Zealand, where fuel costs are a high percentage of expenses on long-haul routes.""But if everyone puts their hand in their pockets and we rethink some other things we do, this is solvable. In our view in Air New Zealand, it is the serious issue that we are leaning into right now. I think Covid pales into insignificance compared to what I see occurring with climate change.""Exhaust from planes is responsible for between 2 and 3 per cent of global emissions but this had been growing quickly in the decade leading up to the pandemic.  Airlines have committed to carbon neutral growth from last year and a reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions of 50 per cent by 2050, relative to 2005 levels.Foran said he hoped some Saf would be used in Air New Zealand planes next year and the airline was working with Airbus on hybrid hydrogen-powered planes for regional routes. As well, he hoped battery-powered planes could be flying by the end of the decade.He told CAPA chairman emeritus Peter Harbison that Air New Zealand didn't want to be a laggard on electrifying its fleet.""We're prepared to get out there a bit earlier. It's something that we believe in as a business and it plays well with New Zealand Inc. I can tell you it's a big deal for our customers — we'd rather be out leading on this.""Running newer, more efficient planes fully loaded with passengers and cargo also helped, he said.""None of this is easy. We can put it off but we're putting off a problem that we're going to leave for our children and our grandchildren and I think there's more than enough evidence to suggest that we need to do something.""Foran has been in the top job at Air New Zealand for nearly two years, starting just as the pandemic hit.At the CAPA event he joked that he had ""timed the move perfectly. It wasn't in the job description but there you go and these things happen.""He came from big roles in global retail businesses, heading Walmart's US operation before starting at the airline.As the impact of the coronavirus spread in concentric circles from its epicentre in Wuhan, airlines were hit first and hardest.There was uncertainty about what the impact of the virus would be.Foran said those running the airline had to breathe deeply, gather information and ''panic slowly'' as the crisis hit.Since the CAPA event, the Government has announced $500 million more support for the airline on top of a $1.5 billion loan to give it funding flexibility should an equity raise be delayed again. The proceeds of the raise will be used to repay the Government.Foran said the pandemic had given the airline time to re-assess and it was focused more intensely on digitising the business.""I would much rather Air New Zealand work out how to disrupt ourselves before someone comes along and does it to us,"" he said.""Whether you're working at airports or whether you're designing our routes,  loading and planes, serving customers - [there] is generally a much better way of doing it by infusing digital.""Asked about the recovery of high yielding corporate travel, Foran said he had been surprised by how strongly it came back last year on domestic routes, but international demand may be slower to recover.The airline didn't share other carriers' reliance on business travellers filling seats at the front of the plane, and was moving towards an all-Boeing 787 long-haul fleet, with fewer seats than Boeing 777s.""I'm pleased that  Air New Zealand is as much a premium leisure airline as anything else and so I'm comfortable with the way we're structuring our fleet and moving from the 777s  to the 787s. The way we're thinking about configuring our aircraft puts us in a reasonable position.""Air New Zealand faced cost pressure from rising fuel prices and steeply rising  inflation across the business.""I think we're in for a really interesting few years navigating these changing inputs but I feel that Air New Zealand is reasonably well positioned. We'll certainly feel some impacts for sure and we'll navigate our way through those sensibly."""
605	5	More than half of teachers in England are in favour of teaching children to take direct action against climate change, according to a survey.The research, led by the University of Bristol, involved asking 626 primary and secondary school teachers across England for their views on climate change education.Teachers believed almost unanimously in an action-focused climate change curriculum incorporated across subject, beginning with conservation projects in early primary school.Results also showed 54 per cent of those surveyed believed this should extend to participation in civil disobedience at secondary school.Professor Paul Howard-Jones, the study's lead author, said children have been 'inspired' by Swedish teenage climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg.    Thunberg, 18, whose activism has inspired a global movement, shot to fame after launching a solo 'school strike' outside the Swedish parliament aged just 15.More than half of teachers in England are in favour of teaching children to take direct action against climate change, according to a survey. Pictured: Environmental campaigners block London's Oxford Circus during a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group on April 15, 2019The study, published in the journal Environmental Education Research, found that 72 per cent of respondents were already teaching or talking about climate change with their students.Children had been 'inspired' by teenage climate activist Greta Thunburg, lead author Professor Paul Howard-Jones said.  Professor Paul Howard-Jones, lead author of the work, said: 'Teachers want their students to be informed in how they think and what they do about the climate emergency.'They are ready and willing to move forward with radical, action-oriented programmes of education that can help students drive our response to climate change.'Police officers remove an Extinction Rebellion protester from Victoria Street, London, on Thursday September 3A recent Ipsos survey found only 42 per cent of teachers in the US were teaching or talking about climate change with their students.In total, 97 per cent of teachers surveyed in England believed climate change was caused by humans, compared with 39 per cent of respondents in the US.In England, 19 per cent of teachers thought climate change was more important for further funding than science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects.However, only 5 per cent of teachers in the US would prioritise climate change.Greta Thunberg and other climate protesters gather for a protest against climate change outside the Swedish parliament building in Stockholm, SwedenProfessor Howard-Jones, of Bristol University's School of Education and Cabot Institute for the Environment, added: 'Despite being under-represented in the National Curriculum, climate change is something many young people feel passionate about.'School children have been inspired by Greta Thunberg, who has demonstrated the importance of peaceful protest to raise awareness of the climate crisis and spur individual as well as large-scale change.'They have also seen the tactics of groups like Extinction Rebellion and many have become activists already.'Our research indicates that teachers are prepared to support their activism through an action-oriented approach to Climate Change Education.'With COP26 being hosted in the UK in November, there has never been a better time to reflect on how we're preparing young people for the defining issue of today.The study, 'The views of teachers in England on an action-oriented climate change curriculum', is published in Environmental Education Research.
234	5	"Scientists will this week issue their starkest warning yet about the mounting dangers of global warming. In a report to be handed to political leaders in Stockholm on Monday, they will say that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have now led to a warming of the entire globe, including land surfaces, oceans and the atmosphere.Extreme weather events, including heatwaves and storms, have increased in many regions while ice sheets are dwindling at an alarming rate. In addition, sea levels are rising while the oceans are being acidified – a development that could see the planet's coral reefs disappearing before the end of the century.Writing in the Observer ahead of the report's release, the economist and climate change expert Lord Stern calls on governments to end their dithering about fossil fuels and start working to create a global low-carbon economy to curtail global warming. Governments, he states, must decide what ""kind of world we want to present to our children and grandchildren"".The fifth assessment report on the physical science of climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that humanity is on course over the next few decades to raise global temperatures by more than 2C compared with pre-industrial levels. Such a rise could trigger the release of plumes of the greenhouse gas methane from the thawing Arctic tundra, while the polar ice caps, which reflect solar radiation back into space, could disappear.Although the report does not say so, Earth would probably then be facing a runaway greenhouse effect.The scientists' warning – the most comprehensive and convincing yet produced by climate scientists – comes at a time when growing numbers of people are doubting the reality of global warming. Last week, the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) published a survey showing that the proportion of British people who do not think the world's climate is changing has almost quadrupled since 2005.Asked if they thought Earth's climate was changing, 5% of respondents said ""no"" in 2005, a figure that rose to 11% last year and reached 19% this year.But as the IPCC report underlines, scientists are becoming more and more certain that climate change poses a real danger to the planet.Many believe the disconnection between popular belief and scientific analysis has been engineered by ""deniers"" explicitly opposed to the lifestyle changes – including restrictions on fossil fuel burning – that might be introduced in the near future.""There are attempts by some politicians and lobbyists to confuse and mislead the public about the scientific evidence that human activities are driving climate change and creating huge risks,"" said Stern.""But the public should be wary of those who claim they know for certain that unmanaged climate change would not be dangerous. For they are not only denying 200 years of strong scientific evidence – the overwhelming view of the world's scientific academies and over 95% of scientific papers on the subject – but they are often harbouring vested interests or rigid ideologies as well.""The report will be discussed this week by political leaders meeting in Stockholm. The study – the work of more than 200 scientists – outlines the physical changes that are likely to affect Earth's climate this century.Future reports will cover the social impact of these changes and the efforts required to offset the damage caused by global warming. A United Nations meeting in Paris in 2015 will then debate what actions are needed to mitigate climate change.According to the new report, humanity has emitted about half a trillion tonnes of carbon by burning fossil fuels over the past 250 years, a process that has caused atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise by 40%. The world is now on target to release another half trillion tonnes in the next few decades which could trigger a major jump in global temperatures.Most measures that have been proposed for tackling global warming rely on curtailing the burning of fossil fuels and these will form the focus of the 2015 UN meeting in Paris. Given the poor record of previous summits, many are pessimistic an agreement can be reached.However, other measures have been suggested to curb global warming. In particular, many scientists have backed geo-engineering projects that would involve either spraying particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation back into space or extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to bury it in mines or depleted oil fields.Both suggestions get short shrift in the new report: atmospheric aerosols could have widespread side-effects that could produce major disruptions to weather patterns, while not enough is known about the effectiveness of carbon dioxide extraction or burial. ""We have to face up to the prospect of weaning ourselves off our addiction to oil and coal,"" said one report author. ""It is as simple as that."""
996	5	Some of the climate impacts of a grocery store trip are obvious, like the fuel it takes to get there and the electricity that keeps its lights glowing, conveyor belts moving and scanners beeping. But then there are the invisible gases seeping out into the atmosphere when you reach for your ice cream of choice.In nearly every supermarket in America, a network of pipes transports compressed refrigerants that keep perishable goods cold. Most of these chemicals are hydrofluorocarbons — greenhouse gases thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide — which often escape through cracks or systems that were not properly installed. Once they leak, they are destined to pollute the atmosphere.The Biden administration now sees eliminating these chemicals from the nation’s refrigerators as low-hanging fruit in its broader effort to rein in climate pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a public call last week for companies to report production and import data on HFCs.Under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which passed in December, the EPA must phase down the production and import of these potent greenhouse gases 85 percent over the next 15 years.“The environmental benefits here are very large, they’re very important,” said Cindy Newberg, who directs the stratospheric protection division in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. The new law, she added, “provides explicit authority for us to do this work, and that’s incredibly important to the agency, and for all of us.”A new undercover investigation by an advocacy group suggests that some supermarkets are leaking climate-damaging refrigerants at an even higher rate than regulators have assumed. The industry estimates that every year supermarkets lose an average of 25 percent of their refrigerant charge — chemicals introduced in the 1990s to replace ones depleting the Earth’s ozone layer.Armed with high-tech sensors, undercover investigators for the Environmental Investigation Agency have documented widespread leakage of HFCs at grocery stores in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. While Walmart and other supermarket companies have pledged to curb their use of these chemicals, more than half of all the stores the EIA surveyed were emitting these climate-warming refrigerants.Out of 45 supermarkets surveyed — including 20 Walmarts as well as stores operated by ALDI, Costco, Giant, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite, PriceRite, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods — investigators found leaks in 55 percent of them. (Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) The investigation did not determine the exact amount of HFCs released.“This is a systemwide, industry-wide problem,” said Avipsa Mahapatra, climate lead for the EIA, the advocacy group. “In reality, they could easily check for this.”None of the companies contacted for this story provided a comment on the survey itself, but a few noted their commitment to curbing these pollutants.Whole Foods said it is “proud to be a leader among U.S. supermarkets in our efforts to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons.” A little more than 30  of its stores have switched to carbon-dioxide refrigerants, and it touts one market in Brooklyn that has become 100 percent HFC-free.Walmart noted it has pledged to reach zero emissions across its operations within two decades, a goal that includes “transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in our stores, clubs and data and distribution centers by 2040.”Giant said it is also transitioning its stores to less climate-damaging refrigerants as part of a plan to halve its overall carbon emissions by 2030 and is also working with suppliers to make further cuts in its supply chain. “We have committed to working with our suppliers to reduce emissions from farm to fork,” said Felis Andrade, a spokeswoman for Giant’s parent company, Ahold Delhaize USA.Commercial refrigeration, which includes grocery stores as well as restaurants and food processing, accounts for about 28 percent of all U.S. emissions of HFCs. Air conditioning for commercial buildings and homes represents between 40 and 60 percent of emissions, according to federal data.The EIA survey was based on a limited sample in one region of the United States. The investigators were also not able to measure the overall quantity and rate of leakage. But it suggests that large supermarket chains may be unaware of the extent of the problem, and do not have regular monitoring in place. In some cases, the leaks persisted months after they were first detected.The investigators, who began their survey in 2019, used leak detectors that they could insert in refrigerators and freezers as well as an infrared camera that could film fugitive greenhouse gases.The food retail sector represents one part of the puzzle of how to drastically cut back on emissions in the coming years. HFCs trap thousands of times more heat than carbon dioxide, and with increasing sales they are projected to represent nearly a fifth of all climate-warming emissions by mid-century. It’s a growing problem: The hotter the Earth gets, the more people need cooling infrastructure.According to new data released Friday, HFC emissions in the United States rose by 4 million metric tons between 2018 and 2019. The 38,000 supermarkets in the United States use thousands of pounds of HFCs each year, according to the EPA, with each store having the equivalent climate impact of 300 cars on the road. Taken together, it is equal to 49 billion pounds of coal being burned each year.While monitoring for leaks and upgrading refrigeration systems translate into long-term savings by reducing energy use, stores operating on tight margins cannot always afford it.Ratio Institute co-founder Jonathan Tan, whose organization works with the food retail industry, policymakers and conservationists on the issue, estimated that while it can cost a store between $50,000 to $100,000 to make repairs to a system, transitioning from current refrigerant to a less-potent greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide can cost between $1 million and $2.5 million.Walmart, for example, said private companies would need government help in making the transition. “We also believe that private and public sector action is needed to foster innovation and enable an economically viable phasedown of HFCs globally,” it said in a statement.Europe is making a swifter transition than the United States. Over 26,000 supermarkets in European countries are using lower-impact refrigerants, compared with 600 stores in the United States.The EPA has regulated earlier generations of refrigerants for decades under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the landmark global treaty aimed at repairing the ozone layer. Those compounds — chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons — damaged the ozone layer that shields the Earth from damaging ultraviolet rays from the sun. HFCs made an appealing substitute because they didn’t deplete ozone, but they warmed the planet instead.In 2016, the Obama administration helped broker the Kigali Amendment, where countries pledged to phase down HFCs under the treaty. But the agency’s effort to regulate the refrigerants ran aground during the Trump administration.One rule identifying “unacceptable” uses of HFCs was partly overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2017. The administration rewrote the rule, but the same court ruled it failed to follow proper procedures and did not need to abolish the Obama-era requirements altogether. Last year, Trump officials withdrew another Obama-era rule, which required companies to detect and repair any leaks from any appliance or piece of equipment using more than 50 pounds of HFCs.President Donald Trump declined to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for ratification: President Biden signed an executive order last month instructing his secretary of state to take that step.The federal government has pursued cases against grocery chains, and won, when it comes to leaks of older refrigerants that damage the ozone layer. In 2019, for example, Southeastern Grocers agreed to spend $4.2 million to reduce coolant leaks and pay a $300,000 civil penalty. But HFCs are in a different category.“EPA’s recognized that it is a significant contributor to climate change and has tried to take action,” said Tom Land, a longtime agency staffer who retired in 2019 after working on both international climate negotiations and the agency’s voluntary refrigerants program, GreenChill. “It basically had to stop, it didn’t have authority.”Food retailers that participate in the GreenChill program have a leak rate of 14.3 percent, nearly half the industry average. Kristen Taddonio, senior climate and energy adviser at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, said in an interview that reinstating regulations mandating leak detection could help grocers make even greater reductions.“It’s like that old adage, you can’t manage what you can’t measure,” said Taddonio, who worked on energy efficiency at the EPA and the Energy Department between 2004 and 2015.Anu Narayanswamy contributed to this report.
738	3	Climate change has largely been defined as an environmental issue, with the worst effects decades or centuries away. But a sobering new report from a commission convened by the medical journal The Lancet, released Monday evening, could change that assessment.The new report says that climate change is already harming human health on a vast scale. “Climate change is happening, and it’s a health issue today for millions worldwide,” said Anthony Costello, a co-chairman of the commission that produced the report, called The Lancet Countdown.The Lancet is one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals. It isn’t an environmental advocacy group, which is why this document could galvanize the public health community in ways that other reports on the consequences of the warming planet have not.The journal has played an important role in bringing public attention to other medical issues, especially on the link between smoking and lung cancer. We take it for granted today that smoking causes that disease. But that was not always the case. The Lancet helped validate those connections for the medical community and, eventually, for the public.When The Lancet decided several years ago to establish a commission to track what scientists have predicted for years — that climate change would begin to have a significant impact on human health — doctors and health organizations took note.Now, we have that commission’s first report on observed links between climate and health, the foundation of what will be the monitoring of 40 indicators, including the health impacts of heat waves, weather-related disasters, climate-sensitive diseases, exposure to air pollution and malnutrition. The report is based on the work of experts from 24 universities and intergovernmental organizations.And what the commission has found is that climate change is already affecting human health in serious ways, with harms “far worse than previously understood.” The report argues that the health professions have a responsibility “to communicate the threats and opportunities” of a phenomenon that is “central to human well-being.”It should be noted that climate change is not the only environmental problem causing widespread health problems. In another recent report, a Lancet commission on pollution and health reported that pollution of the air, water and soil is “the largest environmental cause of disease and death in the world today, responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths.”In its report on climate change, the commission says that human-caused global warming “threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in public health.” But the report also said that a comprehensive approach to slow the planet’s warming could be “the great health opportunity of the 21st century.”The first wave of problems linked to climate change are so troubling they should change the way health professionals view and talk about the issue.For instance, the commission found that outdoor labor capacity in rural areas fell, on average, by 5.3 percent over the past 16 years because of heat stress and other conditions making work more difficult. That is a stunning loss of productivity, and directly attributable to global warming during a period when nine of the 10 of the hottest years on record were recorded. Productivity fell 2 percent from 2015 to 2016 alone.In 2015, the Lancet report says, an additional 175 million people over the age of 65 were exposed to heat waves, when compared with broad trends of the past 20 years. Temperatures much higher than the rising global average are occurring in large urban areas, afflicting, in particular, the elderly, children under 12 months and people with chronic cardiovascular and renal disease.In a finding that is sure to deepen the rift between developed and developing nations over which countries should shoulder the financial burden for climate effects, the Lancet report shows that lower-income countries experience far greater economic loss as a proportion of their gross domestic product because of climate-related disasters when compared to higher-income countries.Even more striking is the difference in the proportion of economic losses that are uninsured. In high-income countries, roughly half of the economic losses are insured. This drops rapidly to under 10 percent in upper-middle-income countries, and to well under 1 percent in low-income countries. From 1990 to 2016, uninsured losses in low-income countries were equivalent to over 1.5 percent of their G.D.P.And in a finding that is likely to cause alarm in the public health communities tracking the spread of deadly infectious diseases, the report says that recent gains in combating the spread of these diseases is now being threatened by climate change.The report shows that transmission of dengue fever by just two types of mosquito has increased 3 percent and 5.9 percent, since 1990, the result of a broad range of factors including climate change. The report warns of an increase in mortality.If the report contained just these findings, it would still be an alert to public health officials. But there are dozens of other examples that clearly show that climate change is no longer a distant, future threat. It is here, now.The Lancet Countdown provides a baseline so health experts can track how we’re doing with climate change and human health. And the central message is clear: This is now a medical and public health fight, not just an environmental one.
272	5	The world’s people face “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless there are major transformations to global society, according to a stark warning from more than 11,000 scientists.“We declare clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,” it states. “To secure a sustainable future, we must change how we live. [This] entails major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems.”There is no time to lose, the scientists say: “The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected. It is more severe than anticipated, threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity.”The statement is published in the journal BioScience on the 40th anniversary of the first world climate conference, which was held in Geneva in 1979. The statement was a collaboration of dozens of scientists and endorsed by further 11,000 from 153 nations. The scientists say the urgent changes needed include ending population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating.Prof William Ripple, of Oregon State University and the lead author of the statement, said he was driven to initiate it by the increase in extreme weather he was seeing. A key aim of the warning is to set out a full range of “vital sign” indicators of the causes and effects of climate breakdown, rather than only carbon emissions and surface temperature rise.“A broader set of indicators should be monitored, including human population growth, meat consumption, tree-cover loss, energy consumption, fossil-fuel subsidies and annual economic losses to extreme weather events,” said co-author Thomas Newsome, of the University of Sydney.Other “profoundly troubling signs from human activities” selected by the scientists include booming air passenger numbers and world GDP growth. “The climate crisis is closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle,” they said.As a result of these human activities, there are “especially disturbing” trends of increasing land and ocean temperatures, rising sea levels and extreme weather events, the scientists said: “Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have have largely failed to address this predicament. Especially worrisome are potential irreversible climate tipping points. These climate chain reactions could cause significant disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies, potentially making large areas of Earth uninhabitable.”“We urge widespread use of the vital signs [to] allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress,” the scientists said.“You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to look at the graphs and know things are going wrong,” said Newsome. “But it is not too late.” The scientists identify some encouraging signs, including decreasing global birth rates, increasing solar and wind power and fossil fuel divestment. Rates of forest destruction in the Amazon had also been falling until a recent increase under new president Jair Bolsonaro.They set out a series of urgently needed actions:Use energy far more efficiently and apply strong carbon taxes to cut fossil fuel useStabilise global population – currently growing by 200,000 people a day – using ethical approaches such as longer education for girlsEnd the destruction of nature and restore forests and mangroves to absorb CO2Eat mostly plants and less meat, and reduce food wasteShift economic goals away from GDP growth“The good news is that such transformative change, with social and economic justice for all, promises far greater human well-being than does business as usual,” the scientists said. The recent surge of concern was encouraging, they added, from the global school strikes to lawsuits against polluters and some nations and businesses starting to respond.A warning of the dangers of pollution and a looming mass extinction of wildlife on Earth, also led by Ripple, was published in 2017. It was supported by more than 15,000 scientists and read out in parliaments from Canada to Israel. It came 25 years after the original “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity” in 1992, which said: “A great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided.”Ripple said scientists have a moral obligation to issue warnings of catastrophic threats: “It is more important than ever that we speak out, based on evidence. It is time to go beyond just research and publishing, and to go directly to the citizens and policymakers.”
456	4	"Although the United Nations’ effort to extract new climate-change commitments from world leaders stalled, a substantial number of companies stepped up this week with large commitments to curb global warming.Even without new government policies to dictate action on climate change, the corporations moved ahead with vows to address climate concerns, and they used the U.N. climate summit as a venue for unveiling their targets.More than 20 multinational corporations made new commitments to use renewable energy for 100 percent of their electricity, bringing to 300 the number of renewable commitments from companies with $5.5 trillion in revenue, according to the Climate Group.The retail giant Target, Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, the Japanese department store Takashimaya, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and China’s world leading solar panel maker JinkoSolar were among those vowing to rely solely on renewable energy to meet their electricity needs. Separately, AT&T said it would more than double its renewable energy purchases to more than 1.5 gigawatts of wind and solar.Companies such as Genentech also said they will be electrifying their vehicle fleets. Last week, Amazon said it would buy 100,000 electric vehicles for its fleet. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Pharmaceutical maker Novo Nordisk, whose emissions from company cars and business flights exceeded total emissions from global production, said that it will seek zero emissions from its operations and transportation by 2030.Ten companies committed to accelerate energy efficiency by 3 percent a year, said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute.“In many cases, the private sector and subnational actors are moving faster than national governments. For example, 87 businesses have signed on to ambitious 1.5 degree C targets across their operations and value chains,” Steer said in a statement.Yet many companies have still not made such commitments, and those that have must be even more ambitious, climate experts say.Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said that corporate efforts “if doubled, would be closer. They are not in the range of serious.” He said a faster trajectory is needed. “Winning slowly is the same as losing,” he added, saying that the private sector needs to move “at a speed that’s similar to war footing.”A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll this summer found that 72 percent of respondents believe that businesses and corporations are doing too little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“You say, ‘Oh there’s enough money out there. So it’s not a problem of money,’ ” Angel Gurría, secretary general of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, said on a panel discussion on Monday. “Of course it’s a matter of money. The money is over there and we need it over here.”He said that as a result, “the millions and trillions in the pension funds are not getting to the question of financing infrastructure, and financing infrastructure for climate change in particular.” Gurría said that “we’re basically needing a better way of channeling those resources.”Gurría said that while big companies fear for their reputation and worry about consumer backlash, small and medium-size companies don’t feel such pressures unless brought by big ones in their supply chains.Yet a broad array of companies are moving forward.Ingersoll Rand promised to save one gigaton of CO2 emissions from its customers’ footprint by 2030. The diversified manufacturing company said it will transform heating and cooling systems for buildings and for refrigerating cargo in transportation. One gigaton is the equivalent of the annual emissions of Italy, France and Britain combined.Chocolate company Barry Callebaut said it would lift half a million West African cocoa farmers out of poverty and use new information sources to reduce deforestation, which accelerates climate change.Away from most of the U.N. events, a group called the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative gathered in the Madison Avenue home where financier J.P. Morgan once lived. It was here that Morgan let Thomas Edison hook the house up to electricity and light 400 bulbs, ushering in a new age of energy growth.But on Monday, the group, whose 13 members had each pitched in $100 million and endorsed the 2015 Paris climate agreement, was showing off companies it has supported in their quest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One firm would change the way cement is made. One is using satellites to pinpoint methane leaks from gas pipelines. One has an idea for a more efficient internal combustion engine. Another would bury carbon dioxide underground. And still another would attach “mechanical sails” to ships in order to harness the wind and improve fuel efficiency.Sriram Madhusoodanan, climate campaign director at Corporate Accountability, took a dim view of the OGCI’s event. ""The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative is yet another green-washing attempt by destructive and dangerous fossil fuel corporations that have knowingly fueled climate change,” he said.But OGCI chief executive Pratima Rangarajan said that “what makes our fund so unique is that we have some of the world’s largest companies behind us who can test and scale these technologies globally.”She said that “in the climate game, we don’t have decades, so this model is very powerful to shrink those timelines.”Meanwhile, more than 50 financial institutions with $2.9 trillion in assets said they will measure and disclose carbon emissions of projects they lend to and invest in. And they said they will use standardized methods similar to those developed by two large Dutch banks for those measurements.“By standardizing the way we measure emissions, it becomes possible to act to reduce it,” said Keith R. Mestrich, president and chief executive of Amalgamated Bank. He said financial loans are “powerful tools” that could be used.But the banks stopped short of saying they were adopting policies to make their portfolios fossil-fuel-free.Gurría said that the private sector needs to move more quickly, adding that “it’s a battle against time.”"
712	4	"A five-day conference in Geneva aims to provide politicians and other decision makers with the data they need to make informed decisions when it comes to climate change, according to members of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the technical and scientific arm of the United Nations, which is hosting the conference.""Even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the climate will continue to change,"" Gro Harlem Brundtland, the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy on climate change, said on Monday. ""All countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate.""But the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms, rising sea levels, droughts, and famine, but how the information is used, according to WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud.""The problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly,"" Jarraud told reporters. ""It's time to link technology and science with decision makers.""Climate justiceThe conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in Copenhagen in December in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the Kyoto Protocol, the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases, runs out in 2012.Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told delegates in Geneva that climate agreements had to be ""radical, universal and binding"" and have ""climate justice at its heart.""Annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution.""The most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic (emissions) cuts,"" the former UN head said, while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues.Better data for the futureClimate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations, Jarraud added. ""Even if Copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases, a certain warming (of the planet) will occur,"" he said, adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs, in addition to preserving the environment.Jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera, two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions. Better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur.""We need to anticipate change, we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future,"" he told journalists.The information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy, such as tourism.""Climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate,"" the WMO wrote in its invitation to the World Climate Conference.The meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third World Climate Conference. The first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990. Those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.sms/dpa/AFPEditor: Kate Bowen"
2	0	"Sir Robert Muldoon. Photo / APNPrime Minister John Key last week unveiled plans for the biggest asset sell-off in more than a decade. It is an unsurprising move for a right-of-centre political party, yet 30 years ago a very different picture was unfolding. Then National Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon lit the fuse on the biggest state-driven surge of industrial construction New Zealand may ever see. Unfortunately for Muldoon a foundation stone of the energy-focused plan, rising oil prices, dissolved away as the plants came on stream and in 1984 when Labour returned to power it was faced with serious debts and later embarked on an extensive asset sale. Public debt had soared from $4.2 billion in 1975 when Muldoon became Prime Minister to $21.9 billion nine years later when he left office. The years of media coverage have not been kind to the ""think big"" projects of the early 1980s - speculated to have cost taxpayers about $7 billion. And yet 30 years on many of the assets are trucking on, churning out urea, steel or methanol, while their tumultuous creation informs the thinking of today's would-be asset builders. Economist Brian Easton lays claim to coining the term ""think big"". A speaker at the National Party conference around 1980 talked of the need to think big. ""I then took up the theme and talked about economic strategies,"" Easton says. ""One was called 'think big' and the other one was 'small is beautiful'."" The National Party has always been involved in big projects, he says. ""It's a peculiarity of New Zealand that both our main parties have been interventionist and it was partly because time and again the private sector failed to provide."" The projects were hit by an incredible stroke of bad luck, Easton says. ""The price of oil was against us."" According to BP the price of crude oil in 2009 dollar values rose from about US$10 a barrel in 1970 to more than US$90 by 1980, before falling back to about US$30 in the mid-1980s. ""[If] they'd been in position five years earlier [or] 10 years later they would have been a success."" The problem was that the risk was written so the Government took all the downside and none of the upside, Easton says. The 1980s would not have been as stressful had the projects not been built and in that sense they were a failure, he says. ""The important thing, however, is the lessons we learnt. ""This affects the 1980s, 1990s and even through to today. The Government has to be careful about taking the risk on a project."" Sir William (Bill) Birch, Minister of National Development and Minister of Energy from 1978 to 1984, says a more fundamental concern was a ""take or pay"" agreement for Maui gas with Shell, BP and Todd. Under the agreement, if the Government, which was a half owner of the gas discovery, did not buy specified quantities of gas it reverted to the ownership of the companies and so the value would be lost. A Liquid Fuels Trust Board was set up to examine the issue and recommended the Kapuni ammonia/urea plant, Motunui synthetic fuel plant and Waitara methanol plants as the best uses for the gas. Other projects often grouped under the ""think big"" banner include the Clyde Dam - built to meet a growing demand for electricity - and the expansion of the New Zealand steel plant at Glenbrook. Investment came from government and private funding and assurances on policy, Birch says. The Clyde dam is now owned by NZX-listed Contact Energy, having officially opened in 1984 at a cost of $1.4 billion. ""I don't think anyone now looks back and says the dam shouldn't have been built,"" Birch says. In the climate of the time the projects were the right decision and had been thoroughly researched and debated, he says. ""I don't think there was a failure among them. ""There was economic volatility in terms of prices but you look at the expansion of the steel mill, expansion of the refinery at Marsden Pt, the building of the infrastructure, the natural gas pipelines, introduction of LPG ... they've been tremendous advances in energy supply in New Zealand."" Bill Falconer, National Party Deputy Secretary for Energy from 1980-85, was closely involved in projects in Taranaki, particularly the Motunui synthetic fuel plant. The Maui gas field had been developed in the expectation of it being used to generate electricity but generation capacity over and above the Huntly power station was not required, Falconer says. There was a surplus of gas and also the country had endured the difficulties of the oil crisis of the early 1970s, he says. ""There was a move to see whether we could use our indigenous oil and gas reserves in order to ease some of the pressure of that constraint."" There was also a global concern that oil supply might be curtailed in consequence of the activities of the Opec producers. ""Over the longer haul I think you'd be able to say that although the plants may not have met their original vision, in fact they proved to be quite successful and quite beneficial for New Zealand."" The ""think big"" projects gave New Zealand probably its strongest and most professional engineering capability, he says. ""Out of the construction of all of those enterprises emerged a very strong New Zealand engineering industry which is still there and a lot of things have flown from that."" The circumstances that gave rise to ""think big"" are unlikely to occur again, Falconer says. ""I think these things would only occur one at a time and each on its merits and that has been happening, that will occur."" Sir Roger Douglas, Minister of Finance from 1984 to 1988, says the foundation of the projects was false. ""They were based on escalating [oil] prices that we had in the 70s and that was never going to [continue to] happen,"" Douglas says. ""They were failures essentially. ""Some of them managed obviously to survive and go on but that was because the government took billions of dollars of debt on to its own books."" The projects became part of a wider sale of state-assets by the Labour Government, which has been criticised for selling them too cheaply. This argument is nonsense, Douglas says. Although the debt was serious the more important issue was efficiency. ""Privatisation is not really about how much money you get for the asset, that's important, but the more important issues are to get the regulatory environment right so that competition can take place in the industry. ""What you measure your success by is the productivity that flows following the corporatisation / privatisation process."" Former Labour Cabinet Minister Michael Bassett says ""think big"" was an effort by Muldoon to give the National Party a political edge by saying they would revolutionise the economy. ""The incoming government in '84 was faced with this massive servicing of borrowing costs to build these things but they were never going to pay their way,"" Bassett says. The Labour Government took the costs on to the balance sheet and tried to sell them for as much as possible. ""The world could read that we had spent an enormous amount of money that we were not going to get back and the run on the New Zealand dollar in 1984 was in large measure a result of 'think big' and the huge borrowing that we had done. ""By 1984, as the figures were now becoming painfully clear, 'think big' was posited on a financial basis that simply didn't hold water any more."" Think big had been an enormous political gamble that didn't pay off. ""I think one should always be pretty sceptical about any politician who comes along and says, 'Look, with taxpayers' money we're going to do this and this and this' ... and that's basically what Muldoon was saying from 79 through until 82, trying to paint his opponents as think small people,"" Bassett says. ""I look back on it and I think caution be my watch word,"" he says. ""Do not leap in where the private sector shows no interest."""
785	3	A lot happened on the presidential campaign trail this week. Here’s our weekly catch-up on the 2020 election and the Democratic field, which is still 20 candidates strong.The Democratic National Committee refused to hold the climate-focused presidential debate that Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and several other candidates wanted. So CNN stepped in with seven straight hours of climate-focused town hall events.Mr. Inslee’s influence was on full display, despite the fact that he dropped out of the race last month. One after another, 10 candidates — the same ones who will participate in the next debate on Thursday — said addressing climate change would be one of their top priorities in office. Viewers who based their drinking game on the phrase “existential threat” might not have survived. Perhaps more notable, the plans we heard about (more on those below) were more aggressive even than what candidates were proposing a few months ago. When The Times surveyed the Democratic field on climate policy in April, only four of the candidates in Wednesday’s forum definitively supported carbon pricing. (Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wasn’t in the race yet.) By this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the only one of the 10 who didn’t — and even so, he is calling for an expansive, $16 trillion program to combat climate change. Here’s our full report on the forum.You can read recaps of the candidates’ appearances here.Just want the highlights? Here are five takeaways.Almost without exception, the candidates in the CNN forum focused on the impact climate change is having on people of color and low-income communities. Often, they emphasized, the people hit hardest by extreme weather are those with the fewest resources to cope with it.Five candidates specifically used the term “environmental justice,” which “embraces the principle that all communities and all people have a right to equal protection of our environmental laws,” said Robert Bullard, a professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University.It was one more example of a major shift within the Democratic Party, toward an acknowledgment that a lot of the biggest policy issues — from criminal justice to abortion to, yes, climate change — are inextricably tied to racism and inequality.Not familiar with environmental justice? Here’s an overview.In preparation for the town hall events, several candidates released detailed climate change proposals this week. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey framed his proposal around environmental justice. He said he would invest more than $3 trillion by 2030 to achieve a carbon-neutral economy by 2045, and, like other candidates, pledged to both send legislation to Congress and take executive action. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., called for an unspecified price on carbon that would increase over time. He also wants to quadruple spending on clean energy research and development to $25 billion per year. The Buttigieg campaign said total federal climate spending under his plan would range from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, said he would direct $10 trillion in federal, state, local and private investments over the next decade to create 10 million jobs, transition away from fossil fuels and build a carbon-neutral economy. He said he would also establish a National Climate Council and push for legislation to prevent environmental discrimination. Senator Kamala Harris of California proposed a $10 trillion increase in climate spending over a decade. Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, said she would maximize the power of the legal system to punish corporate polluters and deliver “climate justice” to the poor communities that are suffering disproportionately. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota released a long list of climate actions, including restoring Obama-era emissions and fuel-economy standards, reviewing all of the Trump administration’s environmental permits and regulations, and pushing legislation to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan includes $3 trillion in federal, state and local funding, and her campaign said the carbon pricing system she is proposing could raise trillions more. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts explicitly adopted ideas championed by Mr. Inslee, bringing his platform to the highest tier of the race. Among other things, she is calling for $3 trillion in spending over a decade to achieve 100 percent clean energy by decarbonizing electricity, vehicles and buildings.Asked by an audience member at the climate forum whether he would address population growth in his climate change policy, Mr. Sanders said he would. He also criticized the Mexico City agreement, a federal policy that bars foreign aid to any organization that “performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning.” Because many groups that provide birth control and other services also perform or offer referrals for abortions, the policy, sometimes called the global gag rule, reduces access to contraception.“I think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it’s something I very, very strongly support,” Mr. Sanders said.In response, anti-abortion groups falsely claimed that Mr. Sanders had endorsed eugenics.While it was unusual to bring up the agreement in the context of population growth — normally, Democrats criticize it for restricting women’s rights — opposition to the Mexico City policy is standard for Democrats. Democratic presidents routinely rescind the policy, and Republicans routinely reinstate it. And Mr. Sanders’s comments focused on the policy’s impact on birth control access — he did not call for more abortions. In fact, researchers have found that abortion rates in affected countries actually increase when the Mexico City policy is in place.Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, released his wide-ranging education agenda. As part of his plan, which he titled “Equal Must Be Equal,” Mr. Bennet made a sweeping promise: “By 2028, every child born in this country, regardless of circumstance, will be at the center of a community that offers them a real chance to flourish personally and prosper financially.” He said his administration would create 500 “Regional Opportunity Compacts” to “connect the dots between what is taught in schools, what skills local employers need, and how we support students so they can enter the work force.” He pledged to spend $10 billion annually for five years to create the compacts.Mr. Bennet also called for universal preschool, higher teacher pay, support for districts that choose to extend the school year, free community college and steps to reduce student debt.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, previewed a plan to cancel all $81 billion in past-due medical debt and allow other existing and future medical debt to be discharged. He said he would ensure that no one’s credit score was negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.And Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana released a rural policy plan titled “A Fair Shot for Rural America.” In it, he called for the establishment of an Office of Rural Affairs, a rural “opportunity zone” initiative, increased grants and more.Howard Schultz (remember him?), the former chief executive of Starbucks, announced Friday that he would not run for president as an independent. Mr. Schultz, 66, had floated the idea in January before starting a book tour, arguing that he could earn the support of moderate Republicans and Democrats who were “looking for a home.” But he immediately faced blowback, particularly from Democrats who worried that an independent bid would all but ensure President Trump’s re-election by splitting the anti-Trump vote.In an open letter, Mr. Schultz acknowledged that he had arrived at a similar conclusion. “Not enough people today are willing to consider backing an independent candidate because they fear doing so might lead to re-electing a uniquely dangerous incumbent president,” he wrote.Separately, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that he had set a rough deadline of Oct. 1 to decide whether to drop out of the race. That date is not coincidental: It is when candidates must meet the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee to qualify for the debate later that month.“I think the logical thing to say is I’m going to go and try and make the October debates, and if I can, that’s a good reason to keep going forward,” he said. “If I can’t, I think it’s really tough to conceive of continuing.”Mr. de Blasio made the cut for the first two Democratic debates this summer, but failed to qualify for the September debate after the D.N.C. tightened the requirements. Read about Mr. Schultz’s announcement and Mr. de Blasio’s remarks.Our colleague Matt Flegenheimer wrote for The New York Times Magazine about how Mr. de Blasio went from progressive star to punching bag.
780	5	"This story was originally published on RNZ.co.nz and is republished with permission. The Earth is heating up, and so are hopes for climate action in 2021. Climate change strikers say they'll be back this year, starting with a rally at Parliament on January 26. Last year, the climate strike movement was somewhat interrupted by the global pandemic - and young people all over the world held online strikes instead to share their concerns for the earth's future. READ MORE: * Climate strike attracts over 1500 calling for a 'green' Covid-19 recovery * Young climate strikers plan to walk out of school again * Climate Change Commission: How it will work and the initial plans * School climate strike: Adults join with kids in huge day of national protest * Student climate change strike: Why young Kiwis are demanding more action  School Strike 4 Climate leader Ethan Reille says a New Zealand-only campaign, ""100 days 4 action"", has been developed to put pressure on the government. This year's action starts with a ""holiday wishlist"" of demands, to be handed to Parliament on January 26, Reille says. ""We definitely wanted to start off strong, given the year that we just had, and we wanted to give people some hope and drive to be able to keep going, no matter what had happened."" Students will meet outside parliament at 12pm on January 26. They invite the public to arrive at 12.30pm, and will present demands to Labour MP Ginny Anderson and other representatives of the government at 12.45pm. It will be followed by an open mic session. In 2019, protesters worldwide went on strike for reduced global emissions. Now, with much of the world in lockdown, Reille said New Zealand climate strikers felt the cause was more poignant. ""I actually think there's a bigger drive now, because we realise the opportunity that we're able to hold as a nation, and how privileged we are to be in this position. ""It gives people, and it gives students that drive to think 'okay let's take advantage of it, and not take anything for granted'. ""We've got the opportunity to get out there to strike and to demand action, where people like Australia our neighbours or any other nation across the world are actually struggling to leave their houses."" University of Canterbury professor Simon Kingham - also seconded as chief science advisor to the Ministry of Transport - said 2021 needed to be a year for climate change action. ""I absolutely hope it is raised on the political agenda, and it's seen by people as something that's incredibly important,"" Kingham said. The year of 2020 was still notable when it came to climate change awareness. ""I think there were many good things last year that came out: The behaviour changes that happened, and climate change was something people talked about. ""But I absolutely hope we start thinking about it more, and we do more as well."" Kingham wanted to encourage more walking, cycling and public transport use within communities. Inequity, obesity and mental wellbeing could all be improved by changing reliance on vehicles, he said. And people should be positive about climate change, he said. ""I think some people are quite negative about it, [and] people who think we're not doing enough, and I think there's some people who think it's not important. ""To some extent, I think we have to be positive about it. We have to think that we can make changes that will make us ready for the things that are going to be happening in the next few years. So we have to be positive."" A new year's resolution to live lighter on the earth may be the goal of many this year. Climate Change Commission chairman Rod Carr said everyone could take action which would fit their lifestyle and needs. ""Nothing is too little, and nothing is too late, but we need to do more and we need to start doing it now."" For an individual, a household, a small business, an industry or agriculture, or local or central government, no emission reduction was too small, or too soon. Carr encouraged people to share their lifestyle changes to inspire others. Students and young employees had a huge impact, he said. ""They work in businesses, or for businesses, and they can have an impact on how that business operates. They can impact on that businesses' supply chains and channels to the market. ""Being an active employee in your workplace doesn't mean you have to be a pain, it just means you have to be helpful in making your employer aware of the opportunities they have to reduce the emissions of that business."" Everyone's quality of life can be improved by reduced emissions and cleaner choices, he said. ""The reality is the co-benefits of walking and biking to work and school are quite substantial, even aside from reducing the emissions. ""You get the improved air quality, you get the health benefits, you get to actually smell the daisies and the roses as you head to school or work."" Active mobility, energy efficiency, and reducing and recycling all had a significant part to play, he said. ""I don't buy in to the argument that my little bit doesn't matter ... I think we can all make a difference. ""In some cases it may be walking the kids to school rather than putting them in the big SUV. ""It may be working from home for a day a week, it may be taking the bus."""
622	2	Former Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger says Independent candidate for the seat of Warringah Zali Steggall undermined her own stance on climate change by admitting she hasn't done a lot personally to reduce her own emissions.During a debate hosted by Sky News, on Thursday, Ms Steggall says she supports Labor's 45 per cent emission reduction target and tougher national vehicle emissions standards for cars.However, the independent candidate who is vying to oust Tony Abbott from the blue-ribbon seat of Warringah in Sydney's north, admitted she'd like to 'do more' personally to combat climate change.Mr Kroger says this admission to the audience 'shattered Ms Steggall's credibility' for the rest of the debate
443	3	"New research suggests that power companies are dragging their feet when it comes to embracing green energy sources such as wind and solar. Only one in 10 energy suppliers globally has prioritised renewables over fossil fuels, the study finds. Even those that are spending on greener energy are continuing to invest in carbon heavy coal and natural gas.The lead researcher says the slow uptake undermines global efforts to tackle climate change.In countries like the UK and across Europe, renewable energy has taken a significant share of the market, with 40% of Britain's electricity coming from wind and solar last year. But while green energy has boomed around the world in recent years, many of the new wind and solar power installations have been built by independent producers.Large scale utility companies, including many state and city owned enterprises, have been much slower to go green, according to this new study.The research looked at more than 3,000 electricity companies worldwide and used machine learning techniques to analyse their activities over the past two decades.The study found that only 10% of the companies had expanded their renewable-based power generation more quickly than their gas or coal fired capacity. Of this small proportion that spent more on renewables, many continued to invest in fossil fuels, although at a lower rate. The vast majority of companies, according to the author, have just sat on the fence.""If you look at all utilities, and what's the dominant behaviour, it is that they're not doing much in fossil fuels and renewables,"" said Galina Alova, from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. ""So they might be doing something with other fuels like hydro power or nuclear, but they're not transitioning to renewables nor growing the fossil fuel capacity.""The author says that many of these types of utilities are government-owned and may have invested in their power portfolios many years ago.The overall conclusion from the analysis, though, is that utility companies are ""hindering"" the global transition to renewables.""Companies are still growing their fossil-fuel based capacity,"" Galina Alova told BBC News. ""So utilities are still dominating the global fossil fuel business. And I'm also finding that quite a significant share of the fossil-fuel based capacity owned by utilities has been added in the last decade, meaning that these are quite new assets.""But in order for us to achieve the Paris climate agreement goals, they either need to be retired early, or will need carbon capture and storage because otherwise they're still here to stay for decades.""She says that inertia within the electricity industry is one key cause of the slow transition. But the news reporting about energy companies doesn't always capture the complexity of their investments. ""Renewables and natural gas often go hand in hand,"" said Galina Alova.""Companies often choose both in parallel. So it might be just in media reports we are getting this image of investing in renewables, but less coverage on continued investment in gas.""So it's not greenwashing. It is just that this parallel investment in gas dilutes the shift to renewables. That's the key issue.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Energy."

Sign up for the Today’s WorldView newsletter.Amid its horrors and tragedies, the coronavirus pandemic has driven home a startling reality. Travel bans and lockdowns have cleaned the globe, flushing the murk from Venice’s canals, clearing Delhi’s polluted smog, making distant snowy peaks visible for the first time in years from the shores of the Bosporus. With humans in retreat, nature reclaimed what was once its own in whimsical ways: Goats strutted through villages, antlered deer grazed on manicured city lawns and mountain lions found perches by suburban fences.U.S. scientists still predict 2020 will be the hottest year on record, even as experts forecast the largest annual drop in carbon emissions in modern history — a direct consequence of the pandemic’s freeze on human activity, trade and travel. The crisis isn’t uniformly good news for the planet: For example, satellite data shows that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at its fastest pace in years, with environmental officials otherwise sidelined or preoccupied by the outbreak.The pandemic is not just a reminder of the human impact on the environment, including the significance of man-made emissions on global warming and air pollution. It’s also similar: an imperceptible menace that knows no borders, overwhelms aging infrastructure and bedevils policymakers and politicians who struggle to grapple with the scale of the threat.“A good way to think about the coronavirus pandemic is that it is like climate change at warp speed. What takes decades and centuries for the climate takes days or weeks for a contagious disease,” New York University climate economist Gernot Wagner wrote last month. “That speed focuses the mind and offers lessons in how to think about risk in an interconnected world.”The question now is who’s learning what lessons. The commemorations for the 50th annual Earth Day saw a litany of prominent climate campaigners link action on that front to the experience of the outbreak. For years, climate scientists have been calling on governments to “flatten the curve” — that is, reduce emissions to lessen the likely catastrophic toll global warming will exact on societies in decades to come.In the Boston Globe, former U.S. secretary of state John F. Kerry pointed to evidence suggesting climate change could be a “threat multiplier” for zoonotic and pandemic diseases. He also took aim at President Trump and other politicians who cling to positions outside the scientific consensus and impede collective action.“Just as in today’s pandemic, progress has been halted by finger-pointing, denial, replacing real science with junk science, misinformation, and flat-out lies, elevating political hacks instead of scientists and experts, refusal to work with allies and even adversaries, and leaving states and cities to fend for themselves,” wrote Kerry.“The coronavirus pandemic has delivered sharp and painful reminders of our collective vulnerability and the value of paying very close attention to reality,” wrote physicist Mark Buchanan. “If there’s any good to come out of the current tragedy, it may be in helping to persuade a few people to help tip the scales and get our leaders to take the next looming issue much more seriously.”The Trump administration isn’t quite set on tipping the scales. Stimulus money the White House has been empowered to spend in the pandemic’s aftermath may go to U.S. fossil fuel companies that were already in financial trouble before the crisis. On Earth Day, Andrew Wheeler, Trump’s administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, sought to shift focus away from climate change to government efforts to curb pollution.“We’re taking climate change seriously,” Wheeler told The Washington Post’s PowerUp newsletter. “But it’s not the only environmental issue that we face as a planet.”But away from the White House, others are seeking to take the lead. Under the aegis of the World Economic Forum, major financial firms — including some that may help manage elements of the federal response to the pandemic — have pledged to divest from fossil fuels. Campaigners are calling for government stimulus to fund sustainable development projects that could build the green economy. The World Bank is proposing linking governments’ post-pandemic spending to greener infrastructure projects and future disaster-proofing.In Washington, there’s a cautious hope that the urgency presented both by climate change and the pandemic may cool the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China and force greater global collaboration.“We all breathe the same air and we’re all going to live with the same rising seas,” Michael Chertoff, a former head of the Department of Homeland Security in the George W. Bush administration, told Today’s WorldView during a webinar this week. “And whatever we may disagree about some things, we’re going to need to sit down with them and our like-minded allies and everybody else and figure out what can we do collectively to protect the global commons against either pandemic diseases or disastrous climate change.”But, as Slate’s Joshua Keating noted, the opposite may well be true, given the growing hostility between both countries. He added that some right-wing parties elsewhere in the West have already seized on the threat of climate change not as a call for collective action, but as a justification for limiting migration and unraveling globalization.“It’s not hard to imagine a future U.S. administration, rather than denying the increasingly obvious reality of climate change, using it to argue that the country needs tougher immigration controls and fewer refugees,” wrote Keating. “The alternative, they will argue, is to be overwhelmed by the human invaders and see our own natural resources depleted in the way other countries already have.”Read more: Trump uses the pandemic to push far-right agendaTrump wants to lift lockdowns.

855	3	"Despite the lush, verdant nature that surrounds the German town of Ulrichstein, residents here — and in the region — suffer from acute water shortages.Ulrichstein Mayor Edwin Schneider, meanwhile, is deeply concerned by his town's dire water shortage. ""I never thought we would be affected like this,"" he told DW, even though he had heard about similar situations in surrounding regions of the state of Hesse. Other areas — from the northwestern state of Lower Saxony to municipalities in the country's east — have also reported water shortages.For the last 100 years, the people of Ulrichstein have sourced their water from six wells that are only two to three meters deep. In recent times, these have almost dried up, delivering a mere four cubic meters of water per hour — just half of what the town of 3,000 needs. Unlike other parts of the country, where dams are used to divert drinking water to settlements, this option is not available here. The people of Ulrichstein, like 70% of people in German municipalities, must rely on groundwater.Read more: Water shortages pose growing risk to global stabilityInstead, a drilling company is set in the coming weeks to try to tap into the groundwater below the town. Water that the firm insists is there — despite criticism from geologists who say groundwater levels below Ulrichstein, the highest permanent settlement in the state at 614 meters (2,014 feet) above sea level, are insufficient for the town's needs.Schneider said the reason for his town's water shortages has to do with its geographical location. Due to the Rhine Weser watershed, he said, ""water just keeps draining away, and winters have become quite mild in these parts.""This means groundwater is not being replenished during the winter months. The situation is complicated further because the nearby city of Frankfurt also taps into the local groundwater, sourcing one-third of its requirements — some 40 million cubic meters — from this region.""I got quite angry when Frankfurt asked its residents to water the city's trees during one hot summer,"" the mayor admitted.A €150,000 ($177,000) trial showed no groundwater the Ulrichstein could tap into at a depth of 120 meters. However, the drilling company found water at a depth of 200 meters. The well, which cost some €800,000 to drill, will only serve as an interim solution as there is not as much water as the officials hoped for, and no one knows how long before it dries up.The municipal council is looking into alternatives to source drinking water. For this purpose, it has modernized two of its eight water treatment plants at a cost of €2 million. Ulrichstein is also considering installing a 4.5-kilometer canal to the next town to source water. This endeavor, however, carries a €650,000 price tag.Ultimately, the municipality decides to hire a logistics company to make six deliveries of 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons) of water each day by truck. Locals are also urged to use the precious resource sparingly by abstaining from watering their lawns or otherwise using water unnecessarily.Whatever option the town chooses, residents will be facing higher water bills.Local businessman Klaus Kraft is especially hard-hit by the water shortage. He has been running a laundromat for years. Each day, his business consumes about 12 cubic meters of water, less than half the 30 liters it used to require. But, he said, he cannot hike up prices as this would hurt his business. Currently, sourcing and disposing of one cubic meter of drinking water costs about €10 — roughly three times what residents in other German cities pay.A woman who has lived in the town for many years said she noticed the water shortages three years ago. ""One day, the water pressure just dropped off,"" she said, adding that the town's calls for residents to use water sparingly are being ignored by many.One of the more recent and visible culprits is private swimming pools appearing in many residents' backyards. According to Germany's Swimming Pool and Wellness Association, a growing number of Germans are deciding to install their own pools. One reason for this is that people who are traveling less during this pandemic want to have a nice time relaxing at home.Karsten Rinke, a biologist with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, says Germans will have to prepare for future water shortages. At least technological innovations and water conservation efforts have reduced the average daily water consumption in Germany from 147 to 123 liters per person, says the researcher. But Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) reports that climate predictions paint a gloomy picture of the future. It warns that people in some parts of Germany could soon face problems sourcing drinking water.German Environmental Minister Svenja Schulze has scheduled a ""water summit"" for spring 2021 to discuss this worrying situation with federal, state and local representatives. She wants to devise a comprehensive strategy to tackle the country's water shortage.Read more: German farmers sue government over climate change failures"
914	4	America’s meat industry is facing a major upheaval as the coronavirus outbreak deepens.The farmers and ranchers who supply the nation with hamburgers, pork chops, T-bone steaks and chicken fingers now confront several crises at once: Large processing plants are shutting down as workers fall ill, many producers were already strained by the trade war with China, and the sudden rise of plant-based “fake” meat alternatives had been starting to capture Americans’ imaginations.On top of that, the meat business had been attracting growing scrutiny for its climate change consequences in recent years, with scientists and environmentalists urging Americans to eat less meat, particularly beef.Cattle have an outsized environmental impact largely because they belch up methane, a potent planet-warming gas. Studies have found that beef production creates roughly four to eight times the emissions from pork, chicken or egg production, per gram of protein, and all have a larger climate-change footprint than plant-based proteins like soy or beans.The Covid-19 pandemic could intensify these stresses on the industry, and although it’s still early, here’s how the pressures are playing out:The biggest short-term disruption is the fact that a growing number of meat processing plants — where workers slaughter livestock and package food products — are shutting down as employees get sick from the coronavirus.On April 12, Smithfield Foods said it was closing its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant indefinitely after 230 workers became infected. The facility processes roughly 5 percent of the nation’s pork. In Greeley, Colo., where at least four meatpacking workers have died, one of the nation’s largest beef-processing plants has shut down. Other plants in Iowa and Pennsylvania have also closed temporarily.Plants like these are at the heart of a $140 billion meat industry that processes some 9 billion chickens, 32 million cattle and 121 million hogs each year. On the whole, agriculture accounts for 9 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock responsible for roughly two-fifths of that, much of it because of methane from burping cows and decomposing animal manure.For now, there’s no danger of a large-scale meat shortage in grocery stores, analysts said. That’s because there are still hundreds of millions of pounds of beef, chicken and pork piled up in cold storage, particularly since producers are no longer selling to shuttered restaurants and schools. And processing plants that remain open have capacity to pick up slack.Still, there are vulnerabilities.Just 15 plants, mostly in the Midwest, slaughter nearly 60 percent of the nation’s pigs each day. “If we get to the point where we don’t have enough pork in storage, and multiple plants are no longer in operation, than we could have problems,” said Dermot Hayes, an economist at Iowa State University, at a news conference on Tuesday. “But we’re not there yet.”As processing plants close, farmers and ranchers must keep their cows, pigs and chickens on feedlots or ranches for longer. But that costs them money: Instead of selling their animals for a profit, they must keep shelling out for more feed.And many of these producers are also getting squeezed from the sudden drop in demand from a major customer — restaurants.The hit comes at a precarious time. Pork producers were already hurting as the trade war with China had closed off a key market overseas. On Wednesday, the National Pork Producers Council highlighted a study estimating that the industry could face $5 billion in losses this year and warned that many farmers could go out of business without further federal aid.While it’s early days, one possible consequence is that many farmers and ranchers could cut back investment in raising animals for the future. If that happens, and herd sizes end up shrinking, the nation could see a rise in meat prices at the grocery store two years or so down the road. (Over time, higher prices would likely spur more investment again, but it can take awhile for these issues to resolve.)“Everyone’s in preservation mode right now and holding off on making further investments,” said Colin Woodall, chief executive of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Still, he added that many ranchers are waiting to see how the summer grilling season shapes as they start contemplating long-term decisions.As for the climate effects of any changes in animal numbers, it’s complicated.Fewer animals do tend to mean lower emissions, particularly methane from cattle. But over the past half-century, America’s ranchers have actually managed to produce more beef with about one-third fewer cattle thanks to advances in animal breeding, veterinary care, feed quality and grazing systems. Those efficiency gains, experts say, tend to be far more important for reducing the climate impact of livestock than short-term market fluctuations.The pandemic is already pushing the United States into a deep economic slowdown. And, in the past, recessions have sometimes meant that people eat less meat, at least temporarily.“If you think about protein sources, meat tends to be relatively more expensive, so if incomes fall or meat prices rise, people cut back,” said Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University.After the financial crisis in 2008, Americans cut back on meat in favor of eggs, nuts and legumes. The average person went from eating more than 200 pounds of meat per year down to around 185 pounds by 2012. Beef and pork declined significantly in favor of lower-cost chicken. Meat consumption eventually bounced back to pre-recession levels by 2018, though beef never fully recovered.One climate consequence of that: The emissions associated with producing food for American diets fell roughly 10 percent between 2005 and 2014, according to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council, mainly because people were eating less beef. (Ranchers have been steadily exporting more beef, however, to countries like Mexico and China, where meat eating is on the rise as incomes grow.)Any drop in meat eating wouldn’t necessarily affect everyone equally: One recent study found that about 20 percent of Americans account for 41 percent of emissions related to food production, because they consume a disproportionately large amount of beef and dairy.But cutbacks in shopping can also cause serious pain for many people: food insecurity typically spikes during downturns.In recent years, companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat that produce plant-based “fake” meat alternatives have made major inroads — they’re even in chains like Burger King.In 2017 and 2018, investors put more than $13 billion into companies like these as people warmed to the idea of more environmentally sustainable options that don’t taste like the veggie burgers of old. The big question now: Will they become more popular in a time of economic crisis, or less?“There’s a real vulnerability there” for traditional meat producers, said Don Close, a senior animal protein analyst for Rabobank.He noted it’s too early to tell how the competition might unfold, though early data suggests that sales of both traditional meat and plant-based alternatives spiked during the initial wave of coronavirus-induced panic shopping. Will that hold up? “During a crisis, we could see consumers go back to the comfort of what we’re used to,” Mr. Close said, referring to traditional meat.Ultimately, a lot could depend on economics. Plant-based meats still tend to cost more, though analysts expect prices to decline over time as new products enter the market. And if the cost of beef, pork or chicken does rise in the coming years, that could tip the balance.“If we do see meat shortages or if meat prices do start rising down the road,” said Dr. Lusk, the Purdue economist, “maybe we see more people trying out those alternatives.”
29	5	"A clear blue sky on the last day of level 4 lockdown in Auckland with a view from Narrowneck beach of the Hauraki Gulf and Rangitoto. Photo / Penelope Venuto          Experts say that now is likely to be our best possible chance to take effective action to reduce carbon emissions. The big issue at stake, right now, is how the         Government will allocate billions of dollars to new projects. It is necessary that all proposals be assessed in the light of the extreme need to reduce emissions. This consideration must be at the top of the list.        The experts tell us that if we carry on as we have been doing, our species will cease to exist.And the changes need to be big. With the world in ""lockdown"", emissions have reduced but we would need these reductions, or better, to occur every year for 10 years to meet the target. We can't afford to miss the target. There is no backstop.We must, Government and people, take the required action now, in this propitious situation, or we almost certainly never will. It will never be easier.It will be the young and the as-yet unborn who will bear the pain.David Tyler, Beach Haven.I read in this week's Herald on Sunday Rob Nicol, on behalf of various sporting bodies, berating the Government for their lack of financial assistance during our Covid lockdown period. The Government stated clearly at the beginning, essential services would be provided with whatever assistance was required to help keep them up and running.What Nicol and seemingly many sports bodies haven't grasped is that there are no ""essential"" sports. Not one. There are certainly some entertaining ones, but if the fan base and sponsors aren't there to support them, why should any Government body be held responsible for their upkeep in the hard times?It is surely up to each sporting association, its fans and sponsors to provide sufficient funding to bring their product to the public arena. It is the responsibility of any world government to provide for the health, welfare and safety of its citizens, not to entertain them. This applies to all sports globally.If these clubs and associations want the funding they feel they deserve, then pass the hat around to those prepared to pay for the privilege of keeping their chosen sport alive, not demand taxpayers' money, which would be far better used for the education, health and welfare of current and future generations.Jeremy Coleman, Hillpark.Here we go again! In 1993 Auckland faced a serious water shortage, with the holding dams at only 36 per capacity. The four Auckland mayors of the day (when we had a local body system that worked) Bob Harvey, Waitakere, Les Mills, Auckland, Barrry Curtis, Manukau, and myself North Shore, met urgently to address the situation.Household water consumption was lowered by publishing slogans such as ""if it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down"" and by putting bricks into toilet cisterns to limit waste water use. Investigation of alternative fresh water systems showed that Rangitoto Island sat on a vast body of fresh water, which drained from Lake Pupuke through deep larval tunnels, the overflow then ran in a river of water under Ngataringa Bay and then west under the Waitakere ranges, to fountain up offshore along the west coast off Piha. Trawler fishermen had known about these fresh water fountains for many years as they attracted fish in great numbers.The immediate solution was to pipe water from the Waikato River and we were told ""that Auckland would never again run out of water"".But here we are again nearly three decades later experiencing the same serious problem. Dam storage facilities are totally inadequate with population growth and climate change and they must be greatly expanded, as without water there is no city.Paul Titchener, Grey Lynn.With our confirmed Covid-19 case numbers low, and the country on the verge of dropping another level, what worries me now is the very apparent complacency among many. The old Kiwi attitude of ""She'll be right"" is not applicable in this instance.Matt Elliott, Birkdale.Sincere appreciation for Simon Collins' weekend feature, bringing so many eloquent, informed voices to your readers. Their vital message was also echoed from the other side of education's social divide, when the AGS headmaster similarly advised Parliament's Select Committee of the importance of relationships in quality education, and although top students can readily access content online, face to face contact is essential to meet the needs of students who find learning more difficult.Your article is very clear on why and where these greater needs are concentrated, and there seems to be a national groundswell of feeling that improvement must happen.Is now the time to implement some of the wisdom in your article? Curriculum delivery could easily be rebalanced in secondary schools, with more online content made available, while strengthening the personalising of education and family partnerships — developing Communities of Care to meet our glaring needs.Ann Dunphy, Parnell.We in Auckland are about to go into another lockdown of sorts: water restrictions.I cannot understand why the council/Watercare did not put these in place back in early January when it was patently obvious with the drought that we would go short of water. Some of ""us"" way back then did our own restrictions.Please, Phil Goff and cronies, do NOT use Covid 19 as a reason to start restrictions now — that came much later.Jude Collins, Ellerslie.After the obvious flouting by the NZ public on Saturday of alert level 3 restrictions, it is time the Government gave the police stronger and additional powers to enforce the pandemic constraints before considering a move to alert level 2. No police warnings should be given; but heavier on-the-spot fines be imposed, and vehicles impounded until the country is free of the Covid-19 issue. These suggested penalties would be the best public deterrent that a Government could wish for.South Korea and Singapore Governments downgraded coronavirus alert levels. People in those counties abused the privileged lower restrictions, and the Covid-19 problem has returned with a vengeance.Norman Bennett, Grey Lynn.Schools had very few students attend during level 3 whereas Early Childhood Centres filled their 10-child bubbles quickly. Parents showed their need during this time for education and care for their young children.The Ministry of Health required an increase in the amount of space to safeguard these vulnerable young children. Three metres per child was required for Covid-19, but why not this amount of space at ""normal"" times for other illnesses such as year-round colds, flu and rotavirus?The early childhood profession is at a crisis with low wages, instances of poor working conditions and teachers leaving. As well as improving conditions for children, it's time to act to improve teachers' salaries and working conditions, for EC centres to continue to provide the service that children and parents obviously need.Chris Bayes, Torbay.I was interested to read the article ""Plastic makes comeback"" (NZ Herald May 3).The world decided there is a need to abolish plastic, so what would replace the hygiene provided by plastic? I remember when we didn't have plastic and what a difference it made when introduced, to the cleanliness and the convenience it provided.We now have the pandemic and some supermarkets have rules such as not taking your own reusable bags into the store because of the germs they could carry. Also, notices on the delicatessen counter say in the interest of safety at this time they will not accept your containers. If it's not safe at this time how can it be safe at any time?Maybe the reducing of hygiene standards throughout the world has something to do with the pandemic spread and maybe many more in the future if we are not more careful and thoughtful of each other, so why dismiss the plastic if it protects your health and wellbeing?Chris Bennett, The Gardens.A minuscule article in Saturday's Herald surprised me somewhat.A gentleman was arrested with $8m of methamphetamine — having managed to fly to and fro from the world's most Covid- afflicted country, not once but twice during our much heralded lockdown.I can't even fly to Christchurch. Once.Robert Burrow, Taupo."
499	3	" The US was a key player in helping to deliver the Paris Agreement, with former State Secretary and current US climate envoy John Kerry playing an instrumental role in this successful process.  I have been extremely encouraged by the conversations I have had with Kerry and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy -- both formidable allies in the fight against climate change.The return of the US paves the way for climate action to run like a golden thread through US domestic and international policies -- mirroring our approach in the United Kingdom as we prepare to welcome world leaders to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow this November.Why does this all matter? The UN Climate Conference in Paris, the 21st such international gathering, was a turning point. It established a global consensus on the existential threat posed to our planet by climate change, and a shared international approach to address it. There has been progress on tackling climate change since 2015. Most recently, in December 2020, the UK, together with the UN and France, and in partnership with Italy and Chile, organized a climate ambition summit to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. Seventy-five world leaders came together to make further concrete pledges like emissions reduction targets to reach the goal of net zero emissions set in 2015. As I said at the end of that summit, we did make progress, but we have so far fallen short of what is required.   In Paris, the international community agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, keeping a rise of 1.5 degrees in sight. But increasingly, scientific evidence suggests that we have already reached more than 1 degree of rise on pre-industrial levels, or those roughly prior to 1850. Much more remains to be done. The world is already experiencing the damaging effects of this steady rise in global temperatures. Last year was on par with 2016 as the hottest year on record, but it was set apart by the disasters fueled by climate change.  It saw wildfires blaze across Australia, Europe and the US West Coast, and flooding and locusts destroy crops in East Africa. While just last month, Cyclone Ana hit Fiji, sending thousands fleeing to evacuation centers.   As President of COP26, I have been engaging extensively with governments around the world, at summits and in meetings with individual leaders -- most recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India -- on the need for ambitious policies and commitments to deliver climate action. Through my work, I have witnessed the devastating impacts of climate change: melting glaciers, sea level rises, crop degradation, deforestation, and pollution choking some of the world's greatest cities. All of this is taking a heavy toll on human health, the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and an alarming loss of biodiversity. Encouragingly in my conversations with governments and businesses, from tech to construction, there is a realization we just cannot go on as we are. We need to enact policies that deliver green growth -- protecting our environment whilst creating jobs and economic prosperity. Whether this means a transition to clean energy with a resolute focus on renewable and clean energy sources, phasing out the sale of new combustion vehicles or reforestation programs and cleaning up environmentally degraded land. Green growth is absolutely possible. In the UK we managed to grow our economy by 75% while cutting our emissions by 43% over the past 30 years. And, along the way, we reduced the use of coal in our power mix from 40% almost a decade ago to less than 2% now.  Enlightened business leaders will tell you that tackling climate change represents an unprecedented opportunity for investment and economic growth. The mantra of building back better, building back greener is very much on the money. I am delighted that President Biden has committed to joining the ""net zero club"" of economies such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, China and the UK which have committed to reach net zero emissions or similar by a specified date. But what also matters are the near-term commitments countries make to reduce emissions by 2030 and demonstrate they are on the pathway to net zero. And I am very much looking forward to the US setting out its own 2030 target in the coming months. Developing nations, particularly those most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, need financial support from developed countries to tackle its causes and effects -- especially smaller island states like in the Pacific.  Donor nations, through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, must fulfill their pledges at Paris of making $100 billion a year available in international climate finance from 2020 onwards. And at Glasgow we will need to identify opportunities to go further. Tackling climate change is a shared endeavor. And the clock is ticking ever closer to the point of no return.And so, I look forward to working as a matter of urgency with President Biden's administration and governments around the world, to deliver decisive climate action on the road to and at Glasgow. We owe that to current and future generations."
96	5	President Joe Biden's ambitious plan to slash greenhouse emissions by 50 to 52 percent over the next decade could prompt sweeping changes that could affect how Americans eat, drive and heat their homes. Biden announced the goal to cut emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, at the start of a two-day climate summit on Thursday. He vowed the plan, which would set the US on a path of a zero emissions economy by no later than 2050, would create jobs and boost economies. But he is yet to release any firm details on exactly how such a plan will affect the daily lives of ordinary Americans. He also hasn't set out the price for reducing emissions.  The plan immediately sparked criticism from Republicans and industry experts who argue it isn't sustainable in the long run, will put jobs at risk and cause tax hikes for Americans.   While Biden hasn't released details on what life could look like for Americans, experts and recent studies have laid out what would need to change by 2030 to reach the goal. Here's how it could affect every day Americans:Joe Biden announced the goal to cut emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, at the start of a two-day climate summit on ThursdayCutting red meat consumption by 90% and animal products by 50%Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90 percent and cut their consumption of other animal based foods in half. Gradually making those changes by 2030 could see diet-related greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 50 percent, according to a study by Michigan University's Center for Sustainable Systems.To do that, it would require Americans to only consume about four pounds of red meat per year, or 0.18 ounces per day.   It equates to consuming roughly one average sized burger per month. Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90 percent and cut their consumption of other animal based foods in half. To do that, it would require Americans to only consume about four pounds of red meat per year, or 0.18 ounces per dayMaking the switch to an electric carMore than half of new cars bought in the United States would need to be electric within the next decade, studies show.The University of Maryland's School of Public Policy estimated that cleaning up transportation would count towards about a quarter of Biden's goal. It would mean more than 65 percent of new cars and SUV sales and 10 percent of new truck sales would need to be electric.  Currently, electric cars make up about 2 percent of new passenger vehicle sales. The average cost of a new electric vehicle is about $55,000.  More than half of new cars bought in the United States would need to be electric within the next decade, studies show. The average cost of a new electric vehicle is about $55,000Refitting the home with electric heat pumpsNearly 25 percent of homes would need to be heated by electricity, rather than natural gas or oil, to help reach Biden's emissions goal by 2030. The average cost to install an electric heat pump, which an all-in-one heating and cooling unit, is about $5,613, according to figures home HomeAdvisor. Taxpayers could fork out trillions of dollarsIndustry leaders say Biden's climate plan, while there are no cost specifics yet, could end up costing American taxpayers trillions of dollars. David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told DailyMail.com that Biden's plan is just a 'multi-trillion dollar corporate welfare giveaway'.'Strict climate mandates/targets will disproportionately hurt lower and middle income citizens who will be forced to pay higher electricity bills,' he said.  Bjorn Lomborg, a visiting fellow at Stanford University, told the OC Register that the plan will likely cost taxpayers about $3,500 per year.   'This cost will increase significantly,' he said.'While more than two-thirds of the US population finds that climate is a crisis or major problem, less than half are willing to spend even $24 a year to fight it, according to a 2019 survey by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation.' Nearly 25 percent of homes would need to be heated by electricity, rather than natural gas or oil, to help reach Biden's emissions goal by 2030. The average cost to install an electric heat pump, which an all-in-one heating and cooling unit, is about $5,613, according to figures home HomeAdvisorJobs: Biden says he'll create millions but Republicans argue it will crush them Biden says he can create millions of good-paying jobs in his plan but many Republicans say it will actually damage the economy. Matt Coday, who is president of the Oil & Gas Workers Association, was among the critics. 'Biden is using buzzwords to justify his 'transition away' from American jobs while foreign countries like China, Iran, Russia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Iraq keep working and take over America's global market share,' he told DailyMail.com.'President Biden's misguided policies will crush small businesses, hurt American workers, and harm all Americans. 'If we 'transition away' from American jobs while foreign countries keep producing, did we 'save the planet' or just kill American jobs?'$85 billion to modernize existing transit and help agencies expand their systems to meet rider demand$174 billion on electric car development $111 billion to replace lead pipes and service lines and to modernize drinking water and sewer systems $100 billion to protect nature-based infrastructure – lands, forests, wetlands, watersheds, and coastal and ocean resource; to build up electrical system; expand tax credits for clean energy generation and storage; plug orphan oil wells and mines; and redevelop Superfund sites $40 billion to improve the infrastructure of the public housing system in America$100 billion to upgrade electrical grid $100 billion to upgrade and build new public schools$10 billion in the modernization, sustainability, and resilience of federal buildings $35 billion investment in climate science$10 billion for a new Civilian Climate Corps Biden's new commitment, timed to the summit, would cut America's fossil fuel emissions as much as 52 percent by 2030. It comes after four years of international withdrawal from the issue under President Donald Trump, who mocked the science of climate change and pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. 'The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction is mounting,' Biden said.'This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative.'Time is short, but I believe we can do this. And I believe that we will do. Thank you for being part of the summit.' Biden's administration this week is sketching out a vision of a prosperous, clean-energy United States where factories churn out cutting-edge batteries and electric cars for export, line workers re-lay an efficient national electrical grid and crews cap abandoned oil and gas rigs and coal mines.The Biden administration's pledge would require by far the most ambitious US climate effort ever, nearly doubling the reductions that the Obama administration had committed to in the Paris climate accord. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the administration's plans as costly and ineffective.'This is quite the one-two punch,' McConnell said in a Senate speech Thursday. 'Toothless requests of our foreign adversaries... and maximum pain for American citizens.'The US emissions cuts are expected to come from power plants, automobiles, and other sectors across the economy. Sector-specific goals will be laid out later this year.  How Washington intends to reach its climate goals will be crucial to cementing US credibility on global warming, amid international concerns that America's commitment to a clean energy economy can shift drastically from one administration to the next.Biden's recently introduced $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan contains numerous measures that could deliver some of the emissions cuts needed this decade, including a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and moves to electrify the vehicle fleet.The measures, however, need to be passed by Congress before becoming reality.Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan has many items that would help reduce emissions, including a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and money to electrify the vehicle fleet.Biden, in his remarks, argued taking action now would 'set the world up for success, protect livelihoods around the world and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now, in order to do that.' 'If we do will breathe easier, literally, and figuratively,' he said. 'We'll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans and lay a strong foundation with growth in the future.'Biden has included a string of climate initiatives in his infrastructure plan including $85 billion to modernize public transport, $174 billion on building more electric cars, $100 billion to upgrade the electrical grid and a $10 billion 'Civilian Climate Cops.' Good morning to all of our colleagues around the world -- the world leaders who are taking part in this summit. I thank you. You know, your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people, that we’re ready to meet this moment. And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet; it’s also about providing a better future for all of us.That’s why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up. That’s why I’ve proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents our workers and our communities, especially those too often that have -- left out and left behind.I’d like to buil- -- I want to build a -- a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology -- both those we can harness today and those that we’ll invent tomorrow.I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future. The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. But the cost of inaction is -- keeps mounting.The United States isn’t waiting. We are resolving to take action -- not only the -- our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country; small businesses, large businesses, large corporations; American workers in every field.I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying, middle-class, union jobs.I see line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid.I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coalmines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks and protecting the health of our communities.I see autoworkers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways.I see engine- -- the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement and produce clean power.I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make soil of our -- of our Heartland the next frontier in carbon innovation.By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half -- in half by the end of this decade. That's where we're headed as a nation, and that's what we can do if we take action to build an economy that's not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet.You know, these steps will set America on a path of net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. But the truth is, America represents less than 15 percent of the world's emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand. All of us, all of us -- and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies -- we have to step up.You know, those that do take action and make bold investments in their people and clean energy future will win the good jobs of tomorrow, and make their economies more resilient and more competitive.So let's run that race; win more -- win more sustainable future than we have now; overcome the existential crisis of our times. We know just how critically important that is because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of a climate crisis. We must try to keep the Earth's temperature and -- to an increase of -- to 1.5 degrees Celsius.You know, the world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health.It's undeniable and undevi- -- you know, the idea of accelerating and the reality that will come if we don't move. We can't resign ourselves to that future. We have to take action, all of us.And this summit is our first step on the road we'll travel together -- God willing, all of us -- to and through Glasgow this November and the U.N. Climate Conference -- the Climate Change Conf- -- Conference, you know, to set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. The health of communities throughout the world depends on it. The wellbeing of our workers depends on it. The strength of our economies depends on it.The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that's coming.You know, we're here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create good-paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts.We have to move. We have to move quickly to meet these challenges. The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now in order to do that.If we do, we'll breathe easier, literally and figuratively; we'll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans; and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future. And -- and that -- that can be your goal as well. This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities.Time is short, but I believe we can do this. And I believe that we will do this.Thank you for being part of the summit. Thank you for the communities that you -- and the commitments you have made, the communities you're from. God bless you all.And I look forward to progress that we can make together today and beyond. We really have no choice. We have to get this done.
214	2	"The fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report is due out on September 27th, and is expected to reaffirm with growing confidence that humans are driving global warming and climate change. In anticipation of the widespread news coverage of this esteemed report, climate contrarians appear to be in damage control mode, trying to build up skeptical spin in media climate stories. Just in the past week we've seen: Interestingly, these pieces spanned nearly the full spectrum of the 5 stages of global warming denial.Often when people are first faced with an inconvenient problem, the immediate reaction involves denying its existence. For a long time climate contrarians denied that the planet was warming. Usually this involves disputing the accuracy of the surface temperature record, given that the data clearly indicate rapid warming. In the 1990s, Christy and Spencer created a data set of lower atmosphere temperatures using measurements from satellite instruments. These initially seemed to indicate that the atmosphere was not warming, leading Christy, Spencer, and their fellow contrarians to declare that the problem didn't exist. Unfortunately, it turned out that their data set contained several biases that added an artificial cooling trend, and once those were corrected, it was revealed that the lower atmosphere was warming at a rate consistent with surface temperature measurements.Most climate contrarians have come to accept that the planet has warmed significantly. Unfortunately many have regressed back into Stage 1 denial through the new myth that global warming magically stopped 15 years ago (most recently exemplified by David Rose in the Mail on Sunday). The error in that argument involves ignoring about 98 percent of the warming of the planet, most of which goes into heating the oceans. When we account for all of the data, global warming actually appears to be accelerating.David Rose also doubled-down on his Arctic sea ice decline denial this weekend, suggesting melts in the 1920s were just as large as today's. Sorry David, the data debunk your denial again.Once people move beyond denying that the problem exists, they often move to the next stage, denying that we're responsible. John Christy and Roy Spencer took this approach by disputing the accuracy of global climate models in The Daily Mail and The Christian Post, respectively. Spencer was quite explicit about this:...we deny ""that most [current climate change] is human-caused, and that it is a threat to future generations that must be addressed by the global community.""Christy and Spencer made their case by comparing the outputs of 73 climate models to satellite temperature measurements, and showing that the models seemed to predict more warming than has been observed. But the comparison was not of surface temperatures, or of the lowermost layer of the atmosphere, or even any measurement global average temperatures. They specifically looked at measurements of the temperature of the middle troposphere (TMT) in the tropics.There's certainly nothing wrong with examining this particular subset of temperature data, but it's a bit of an odd choice on the face of it. The real problem lies in the fact that satellite measurements of TMT are highly uncertain. In fact, estimates of the TMT trend by different scientific groups vary wildly, despite using the same raw satellite data. Another problem is that the stratosphere (the layer of the atmosphere above the troposphere) is cooling – an expected consequence of the increased greenhouse effect. But some of the cooling stratosphere bleeds into the TMT data, leading to another cool bias. While there is a discrepancy between model simulations and measurements of tropical troposphere temperatures, it's not clear how much (if any) is due to the models being wrong, and how much is due to errors in the measurements. As a U.S. Climate Change Science Program report co-authored by John Christy concluded,""This difference between models and observations may arise from errors that are common to all models, from errors in the observational data sets, or from a combination of these factors. The second explanation is favored, but the issue is still open.""However, in mainstream media interviews and editorials, Christy and Spencer always fail to mention the possibility that the problem could lie more in the measurements than the models, which frankly is intellectually dishonest. Additionally, climate models have done very well in projecting long-term global surface temperature changes.Stage 2b: Consensus DenialIn Murdoch's The Australian, Andrew Montford took a different approach to deny that we're the cause of the problem, attacking the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Specifically he attacked the Cook et al. (2013) study finding 97 percent consensus on this question in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.In order to deny the consensus, Montford employed the Climategate strategy, using material stolen during a hacking of the private Skeptical Science discussion forum. He then pulled quotes out of context to claim the study was ""a public relations exercise,"" because we discussed how to effectively communicate our consensus results. In reality, the comments Montford used to support this argument were made after we had preliminary results reviewing nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed abstracts that found only 24 rejecting the human-caused global warming consensus.Montford's article demonstrates the inherent dangers in quoting illegally obtained private correspondence. First, there is the obvious ethical issue of republishing private correspondence obtained through an illegal act. Second, using isolated quotes extracted from private conversations runs the risk of taking comments out of context and misrepresenting the facts. In any case, we have set up a public ratings system so that anybody can read and rate the scientific abstracts. If you don't believe the vast body of evidence of an expert consensus on human-caused global warming, test it for yourself. Moreover, the scientist ratings of their own papers – independent of our abstract ratings – also resulted in a 97 percent consensus.Once they've progressed through the first two stages and admitted global warming is happening and human-caused, contrarians generally move on to Stage 3, denying it's a problem. Lomborg and Ridley did their best Tony the Tiger impressions in The Washington Post and Murdoch's Wall Street Journal, respectively, arguing that global warming is 'Grrrrreat!' (or at least nothing to worry about). I've previously discussed why this argument is a complete risk management failure. When faced with a potentially catastrophic outcome for something as important as the global climate, it's a no-brainer to take action to make sure we avoid that possible outcome. Moreover, Lomborg's and Ridley's arguments are based on cherry picking data. For example, Lomborg talks about how droughts have not worsened in the United States, according to the IPCC, but fails to mention that the IPCC predicts that US droughts will intensify over the next century.In his editorial, Ridley takes a rosy view about the impact of climate change on crop yields that is not supported by the scientific research. He argues that climate impacts won't be bad in a middle-of-the-road emissions scenario, but as Climate Progress reports, the scientist on whose work Ridley based this argument previously explained,""In his article, Mr. Ridley is just plain wrong about future global warming.""Moreover, by painting an unjustifiably rosy picture and thus misleading the public, he's helping to ensure that we'll blow past that middling greenhouse gas emissions scenario (which requires significant emissions reductions efforts) and commit ourselves to much worse climate change consequences.In his editorial, Roy Spencer bounced between the second and fourth stages of global warming denial, also claiming that solving the problem is too expensive and will hurt the poor. In reality the opposite is true. Spencer specifically attacked renewable energy like wind power as being too expensive. In reality, wind power is already cheaper than coal, even without considering the added climate damage costs from coal carbon emissions. When including those very real costs, solar power is also already cheaper than coal. Additionally, the poorest countries are generally the most vulnerable to climate change. Listening to Spencer and continuing to cause rapid climate change is what will really hurt the poor.Stage 5 global warming denial involves arguing that it's too late to solve the problem, so we shouldn't bother trying (though few climate contrarians have reached this level). Unfortunately this stage can be self-fulfilling. If we wait too long to address the problem, we may end up committing ourselves to catastrophic climate change.The good news is that we still have time to avoid a catastrophic outcome. The more emissions reductions we can achieve, the less the impacts of climate change will be. The challenge lies in achieving those greenhouse gas emissions reductions when Rupert Murdoch's media empire and other news outlets are spreading climate misinformation and denial."
807	3	"""CNN Town Hall: The Climate Crisis"" will air Friday at 10 p.m. ET. It coincides with this week's celebration of Earth Day and will come the day after the Biden administration's conference on global warming. The town hall will feature special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, White House national climate advisor Gina McCarthy, US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm answering questions about the Biden-Harris climate policy. CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash will moderate.In addition to video-submitted questions, a small, socially distanced audience will be present to ask the four administration officials about the Biden-Harris administration's remaking of US climate policy following the Donald Trump presidency.The town hall will air on CNN, CNN en Español and CNN International; stream live with a log-in to a cable provider on CNNgo, CNN.com's homepage and across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android and simulcast on SiriusXM Channels 116, 454 and 795. The town hall can be viewed on CNNgo at CNN.com/go on your desktop, smartphone and iPad, and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Android TV, Chromecast, Roku and Samsung Smart TV. The special will also be available on demand to subscribers via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps.From the outset, the Biden administration has made climate a key focus.Before taking office, Biden in December announced his climate team, in a historic display of the then-President-elect's effort to prioritize his administration's response to the climate crisis.""I'm pleased to announce a team that will lead my administration's ambitious plan to address the existential threat of our time, climate change,"" Biden said at the time.And on his first day in office, Biden took executive actions to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and direct agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump actions on the environment.Just a week later, Biden signed several more executive actions related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the Interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters.Since the early days of his administration, Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice.""It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency,"" he said at a January signing ceremony. ""In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer.""This story has been updated to reflect a new air time."
388	0	        In this Dec. 4, 2018, file photo, New Zealand's Climate Change Minister James Shaw poses in Wellington, New Zealand. Shaw, also co-leader of the Green Party, was walking past Wellington's Botanic Garden just before 8 a.m. Thursday, March 14, 2019, when a man started talking to him before grabbing him and punching him several times. (AP Photo/Nick Perry, File)A New Zealand government minister was punched in the face on Thursday while on his way to the parliament.James Shaw, the climate change minister and co-leader of the Green Party, said the attack happened just before 8 a.m. when a man approached him after apparently recognizing him.The man then grabbed and punched him several times, according to the Shaw’s press secretary, Peter Stevens, who noted that “He’s feeling a bit tender and a bit shaken up” after the incident.Two other people rushed to help the minister after the attack, while the assailant jumped in a vehicle and drove away. The politician suffered a black eye and grazes on his wrist, the spokesperson said.Authorities promptly arrested 47-year-old man who was charged with injuring with intent. He is set to appear in court on Friday and could face up to five years if prison.New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke to the minister and said he was doing fine.“When you go into politics in New Zealand you just don’t expect these things to happen, and I know it will be especially challenging for loved ones,” Ardern said in a statement.“We have an environment in New Zealand where politicians are accessible, and that’s something we should feel proud of,” Ardern added. “We are, after all, here to serve people. But today’s events really show we cannot take that for granted.”The scene of such attack is rare in New Zealand, a country where politicians often socialize with the public in stores, bars and sports arenas.The country has had only a few instances of politically motivated crimes or terrorism, while politicians rarely get protection, with the exception of the Prime Minister who gets round-the-clock security detail.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
667	4	"Toxic smog shrouded Asian megacities, hundreds died in flooding and landslides, cyclones battered coastlines and bushfires, droughts and deadly heatwaves led to towns and cities almost running out of water.Far from being anomalies, scientists say the climate crisis is causing more extreme weather events -- and it's having devastating consequences in Asia and the Pacific.The ""relentless sequence of natural disasters"" over the past two years ""was beyond what the region had previously experienced or was able to predict,"" said a United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) report in August.""This is a sign of things to come in the new climate reality.""Rallying calls for climate action have been made in countless forums, summits and pledges this year. But while many people in developed countries see the climate crisis as an urgent but future problem, for millions living in Asia-Pacific, it's already touching every part of life. Those on the front lines say words must now translate into tangible change as the world heads into a new decade. Asia stands to be impacted the most from climate crisisThe Asia-Pacific region, home to 60% of the world's population, is one of the most vulnerable areas to the climate crisis.Compounding the problem is rapid urbanization in many Asian nations, with the pace of development often overtaking proper infrastructure planning.Population booms and the mass migration of people to cities for work is putting strain on water and food supplies. Many big Asian cities, including Mumbai, Shanghai, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, and Jakarta, are coastal and low-lying, making them susceptible to sea level rise and other extreme weather events. Fast-growing, industrializing and coal-reliant Asian countries are pumping out increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions, despite efforts by nations such as India and China to move towards cleaner energy.As material wealth grows, so too does the consumer market and demand for emissions-producing conveniences such as air-conditioning, cars and disposable goods. While wealthier cities like Hong Kong can afford to disaster-proof -- to an extent. At the other end of the scale, poverty-stricken populations are living in some of the most environmentally precarious places on Earth, where extreme weather events could prove disastrous for lives, food production, water sources, economies and infrastructure. ""If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3°C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing,"" said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, in a statement. ""We are nowhere near on track to meet the Paris Agreement target.""Sea level rise is happening now As a resident of the low-lying Pacific Island of Samoa, Tagaloa Cooper-Halo has experienced climate changes first hand.""Sea level rise is speeding up,"" said Cooper-Halo, who is Director of Climate Change Resilience at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). ""We expected sea level rise in about 20 years to be showing the changes. But we are seeing it already now.""In a landmark report this year, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that global sea levels are rising faster than expected.Increasing greenhouse gas emissions, warming temperatures, melting glaciers and disappearing ice sheets could cause sea levels to rise more than two meters (6.6 feet) by the end of this century if emissions continue unchecked, a study released in May found. A rise of two meters would displace 187 million people, mostly from Asia, and swamp major cities such as Shanghai. Another study suggested that in Southeast Asia, parts of southern Vietnam and Bangkok could be underwater by 2050.Adapting to rising sea levels will be a key challenge for Asia-Pacific, according to the UN Development Program. Measures include defending coastlines and infrastructure, restoring mangroves, and identifying areas at risk from flooding.Cooper-Halo said Pacific nations have already been forced to adapt, installing monitoring stations that measure sea level rise and growing crops more resilient to saltwater.Diets have already changed as ocean acidification and coral bleaching have reduced fish stocks, she said.""When resources are not as plentiful as they used to be, it changes your dependency, you become more dependent on processed food and therefore we have to import a lot of processed food so it changes the way that we eat, and it therefore affects our health,"" Cooper-Halo said. Storms and typhoons are getting more intenseAbout 2.4 billion people -- about half the population of Asia -- live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events.This year, flooding and landslides, triggered by torrential monsoon rains, swept across India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, leaving devastation in each country and hundreds of deaths. China, Vietnam, Japan, India, Bangladesh, South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, were all hit by tropical storms and typhoons -- or cyclones -- in 2019, causing dozens of deaths, hundreds of thousands displaced and millions of dollars in damage. The climate crisis is expected to create higher storm surges, increased rainfall and stronger winds. Joanna Sustento has been campaigning for climate action since Typhoon Haiyan devastated her home in Tacloban, the Philippines, in 2013.Sustento lost both her parents, her eldest brother, sister-in-law, and her young nephew in the storm -- one of the most powerful ever recorded.""We experience an average of 20 typhoons per year and they are becoming more frequent and intense. What does that mean for the Filipino community? It means damaged homes and livelihood, losing loved ones, losing access to clean food and water, being deprived of your own safety,"" she told CNN.""Whenever an extreme weather event happens, we lose our basic human right to safe, decent, and dignified life.""Seven out of 10 disasters that caused the biggest economic losses in the world from 1970 to 2019 are tropical cyclones, according to the World Meteorological Organization.The high economic cost of typhoons can cripple poor countries. In 2015, Category 5 Cyclone Pam cost the Pacific Island of Vanuatu the equivalent of 64% of its gross domestic product. All cities vulnerable to typhoons are under pressure to improve infrastructure and properly plan for future growth. Investing in early warning systems has already saved countless lives.Preparing for more extreme weather costs money and there are calls for rich nations to provide smaller economies with finance and technology to recover from the impacts of the climate crisis. Sustento said fossil fuel companies also need to do their part -- by speeding up the shift to renewable energy.""We should not allow the fossil fuel industry to continue with business as usual, while we are left with no choice but to live with the 'new normal', to count our dead, to search for the missing, and to fear for our future,"" she said. Water shortages set to get worseAs the climate crisis makes rainfall and the annual monsoons -- vital for the region's agriculture -- more erratic, droughts and water shortages will become more severe. The past five years have been the hottest on record and blistering heatwaves -- felt this year in Japan, China, India, Pakistan, and Australia -- are becoming so intense that a group of MIT researchers suggested some places could become too hot to be inhabitable.This year, India's sixth largest city Chennai almost ran out of water. Four reservoirs that supply the city's almost 5 million residents ran almost completely dry. People queued to fill up cans of water across the city and hospitals had no water for operations or sterilizing equipment.Across the country, 600 million people are facing acute water shortage -- and the crisis is expected to worsen as the Himalayan glaciers melt and India's bore wells threaten to run dry.""We have an economy where there's a population that's growing and industry that's growing. So you need 40% more water for industry, you need more water for more people. You need more water for everything,"" said Jyoti Sharma, founder and president of FORCE, an Indian NGO.A new report this month said a quarter of the world's population is living in regions where water resources are insufficient for the needs of the people -- with ""once unthinkable"" water crises becoming common.""Water stress is the biggest crisis no one is talking about. Its consequences are in plain sight in the form of food insecurity, conflict and migration, and financial instability,"" said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.In India, proper urban planning and development will be the way forward, according to Sharma.""Make water systems more efficient, make taps and faucets, irrigation systems more efficient. I think that's what will save us from the crisis ahead,"" she said. The next ten yearsThe world is now 1.1 degrees warmer than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and under current scenarios, carbon dioxide emissions will need to fall by 7.6% every year in the next decade.Yet emissions are still going up.The UN Climate Change Conference earlier this month highlighted the huge disconnect between the world's biggest polluting nations, and the global community demanding change. Many observers, scientists and climate activists called the resulting agreement a failure.Those impacted by the crisis in Asia don't have another decade for the rest of the world to get this right. Surrender is not an option, said Cooper-Halo. In ""the Pacific, the public has woken up to this reality for many years now,"" she said. Now, countries need to catch up and step up. "
483	0	St John has condemned an alleged assault on two of its paramedics as they were doing their job as “unacceptable”.  The assault is said to have happened at 11.15pm on Friday at City Medical Centre in Napier, St John territory manager Brendon Hutchinson said. “This is an unacceptable act on our colleagues. They have endured a horrific ordeal while on duty to help others,” Hutchinson said. “We are supporting our ambulance officers while working with police and hope the assailant will be apprehended quickly.” READ MORE: * Man, 69, charged with indecent assault on Hamilton ambulance officer  * Christchurch ambulance officers punched, emotionally 'shaken up * Battered and bruised paramedics say they're fed-up with being attacked  An ambulance officer was treating a patient when a man entered the back of the ambulance and allegedly became aggressive. The second paramedic returned from the medical centre and together they managed to get the man out of the vehicle. The man then entered the front of the ambulance, allegedly smashing the front windscreen and hurling equipment at the ambulance officers, Hutchinson said. The ambulance officers were allegedly shoved and bruised, with one sustaining minor injuries, but they managed to drive away and alert ambulance communications and police to the situation. The patient was uninjured and transported to Hawke’s Bay Hospital in a moderate condition. A police spokeswoman said no arrests had been made and enquiries into the incident were ongoing. Both ambulance officers were stood down from duties and were being supported through this difficult situation, Hutchinson said. He said St John had systems, alerts and supportive measures in place to ensure staffs security and well-being. St John also supported the private members Protection for First Responders and Prison Officers Bill and the introduction of tougher penalties for those who assault emergency workers, he said.
460	4	Tropical Storm Barry, which is expected to flood New Orleans and threaten lives along the Mississippi River in the United States, is being fueled by warmth in the Gulf of Mexico that was likely exacerbated by climate change, scientists said on Friday.While no single storm can be linked directly to climate change, the trend of warming air and seas around the globe has caused conditions that scientists say will, on average, make storms stronger and rainier.“The real increased threat from a warming climate is an atmosphere that’s capable of producing higher intensity precipitation events,” said Jill Trepanier, an expert in extreme climatic and weather events at Louisiana State University.She said warmer air in the Gulf of Mexico will likely add fuel to the storm, while warmer ocean temperatures there will fill it with vast amounts of evaporated water that can lead to dangerous flooding. Louisiana officials have warned residents that Barry, expected to make landfall on Saturday, could inundate areas along the lower Mississippi with up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain.The lower Mississippi has already been running at flood stage for months after the so-called “bomb cyclone” and other storms starting in March that dumped huge volumes of rain on Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri – which flowed down the Mississippi and could further feed moisture to Barry, scientists said.“The water over land actually helps the storm,” Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded office, said about the double-whammy. Residents were ordered to evacuate some nearby areas, but New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said no evacuations were ordered from the city. Cantrell, a Democrat, said at a news conference she believes climate change is making storms worse. “It’s real. We’re seeing it through the country and the world.”The city is particularly vulnerable to storms because it is “below sea level, protected by levees and pumping systems that remove rainwater, which cannot drain naturally,” the Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 on its website, an entry moved to a web archive by the Trump administration.Not all storms will be wetter as a result of climate change, but on average more of them will, scientists said.In a recent record wet storm, Hurricane Harvey flooded the Houston area in 2017, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125bn in property damage. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed the New Orleans region and killed 1,500 people with high winds and levee-bursting floods.“We might have four or five times as much warming over the coming century as the last, so these kinds of weather events are likely to get much, much worse,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. Development in the New Orleans region, a major oil hub, has made the area more vulnerable to storms, with the removal of wetlands which help protect coasts. Trepanier said the city has made some advances to protect against storm surge, but when storms meet river flooding it makes for a “more combined and complicated risk.”President Donald Trump, a Republican, has cast doubt on mainstream climate change science and announced his intention to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement, an international accord to fight climate change, saying it burdens the country with costs. He boasted about his administration’s environmental record at a speech at the White House this week, but did not mention climate change, and he has rolled back Obama-era regulations targeting carbon emissions.The EPA, which is in charge of toxic waste sites and was forced to address flooded sites that released dangerous chemicals into waters during Hurricane Harvey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Barry.Green group Environment America said there were more than 100 Superfund environmental cleanup sites and 17 oil refineries in the path of the storm.
779	5	Today, people on Scotland’s picturesque Uist islands are living in fear as rapidly rising sea levels threaten to destroy their low-laying fertile fields and unique way of life. On the other side of the world, inhabitants of Pacific Islands are still trying to get back on their feet after being hit by a severe tropical cyclone that destroyed their homes and left many of them homeless some eight months ago. These are not unrelated, unpreventable natural disasters – they are the sad and very real consequences of climate change.Climate change is not affecting everyone equally. Vulnerable Indigenous and minority communities in the West and the peoples of the Global South already facing myriad developmental problems are sadly on the front line of this global emergency – they are the ones suffering the worst and most immediate effects of climate change, from slow-onset events like rising seas and desertification to sudden disasters like hurricanes and floods.COVID-19 made fighting against climate change more difficult for these communities. People who have been suffering from climate-related disasters are now also trying to mitigate the consequences of a deadly pandemic that not only ruined countless lives and livelihoods but also made richer nations more reluctant and less able to help them adapt to a changing climate.Five years ago, nations around the world came together in a show of global solidarity to bring an end to the climate emergency. By adopting the Paris Agreement they made a commitment to take the necessary steps to limit the increase in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius (or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) to reduce the risks and effects of climate change.On December 12, the United Nations, the United Kingdom and France are going to co-host a virtual “Climate Ambition Summit” to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the adoption of this landmark treaty. The Paris Agreement was undoubtedly a turning point in our race against time to prevent a climate catastrophe. However, its fifth anniversary would only be a moment worthy of celebration if developed nations most responsible for climate change renew their commitment to the deal, align their COVID-19 recovery plans with climate goals, and agree to provide poorer countries on the front line of this crisis with finance and development aid.Right now, the world is understandably focused on ending the COVID-19 pandemic. But in trying to mitigate the effects of one crisis, our leaders are digging us deeper into another.Since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020, governments of the world’s 20 richest economies that are responsible for some 80 percent of global emissions have committed more than $230bn to supporting fossil fuel, prioritising the wellbeing of polluting industries over the future of our planet.All parties to the Paris agreement agreed to make regular nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce national emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. With updated targets due by the end of 2020, only 16 countries, responsible for merely 4.6 percent of global emissions, have officially submitted better targets so far. Recent climate target announcements from the UK and China should definitely push other countries to meet the 2020 deadline.Moreover, while many developed countries have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the lack of near-term targets based on principles of fair-share and equity risk making these pledges a smokescreen for inaction. For small island nations in the Pacific, empty promises about what may happen in 30 years, however, do not mean much, as they are already struggling for survival today.In 2010, developed nations committed to providing $100bn annually to developing nations to help them mitigate the effects of climate change. Oxfam’s Climate Finance Shadow Report 2020, however, demonstrated that donors reported just $59.5bn a year on average in 2017 and 2018 – the latest years for which figures are available. Moreover, the report also showed that the true value of support received by developing nations for climate action may be as little as $19-22.5bn a year once loan repayments, interest and other forms of over-reporting are stripped out.Climate justice can only be achieved if developed nations compensate the developing nations for loss and damage and provide them with the necessary financial means to adapt to a changing climate. Developed countries must now commit to long-term finance that addresses the compounding vulnerabilities of developing nations in a post-COVID-19 world, to bridge the massive gap between what has been promised/delivered and what is actually needed.As we prepare to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, we need to remember that our fight to build a just, safe and sustainable world is only beginning. To finally end the climate emergency and save our planet, we need empathy, solidarity, trust and multilateral cooperation.We can all breathe a little easier now that the United States voted in an administration that appears to understand the gravity of the climate crisis. But we still need to ensure this new administration commits to doing its fair share globally to address the problem. We cannot leave this fight for survival solely in the hands of politicians – whether they say they understand what is at stake or not.We need to keep pressuring our governments to keep the commitments they made in the Paris Agreement to end fossil fuel dependence and enable a just transition to renewable energy, drastically cut emissions by the next decade, and deliver finance for those on the front lines of the climate emergency.We do not have any time to waste – for millions around the world, from Scotland to Kiribati, environmental break-down is not looming on the horizon, it is already here today.The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.
507	2	"Science Reporter, NZ HeraldA global citizen science project has handed scientists fresh insights into how climate change might affect ocean species and their ecosystems.A new study, involving New Zealand co-authors and divers, suggested warming oceans could push fish species away from the equator, while driving a decline in the diversity of invertebrates like crabs, lobsters, sea urchins and octopus.Just published in the journal Science Advances, the research offered the first evidence of how ecological interactions affect marine species' abundance at global scales.It was built off data collated by the Reef Life Survey (RLS), a citizen science project involving hundreds of scuba divers around the world, including staff and students from the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Laboratory.It now included information on 4000 species in 50 countries, allowing a better understanding of how and why species are distributed, while also providing an early-warning mechanism for climate-driven changes.The new study found the total number of fishes and large invertebrates seen underwater changed little from the tropics to polar latitudes.However, while fishes were more numerous in the tropics, they became progressively rarer towards colder latitudes, while large invertebrates showed the opposite pattern.The data took in surveys at more than 2400 sites, including records of more than 2500 bony fish, 66 sharks and rays, and assorted other species such as mammals, reptiles, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea stars, octopus, cuttlefish and crustaceans like crabs, lobsters and mantis shrimps.In all, the fauna within the study's scope represented some 10 per cent of all marine species, but more than half of species on regional checklists and field guides of shallow reef taxa.Study lead author and RLS founder Professor Graham Edgar, of the University of Tasmania, said the distribution was changing as waters became warmer, with implications for food webs, ecosystems and fisheries across the planet.But the effects of climate change on marine life varied greatly between geographic regions, and while the ""tropicalisation"" of marine life was already underway in Southeastern Australia and Tasmania, similar effects were yet to be seen in New Zealand.Previous research had suggested climate change would directly affect the range of species due to rising temperatures, but the RLS data showed that wasn't the end of the story, Edgar said.""We found that the local presence and abundance of a species reflect not only its need for particular temperatures and environmental conditions but also its ecological interactions.""As fish extend their range further from the equator with warming water, their advantage as predators will affect the abundance and diversity of large mobile invertebrates.""Broad changes would likely spread across the ecosystem, affecting human activities, such as fishing.Edgar said ongoing monitoring of marine life at both local and regional levels was needed to allow the early detection of such changes.This would allow adaptive fisheries and conservation management, and help to minimise the social and economic impacts.""Species monitoring of shallow reef communities at national scales is only possible with the support of citizen scientists, such as the RLS divers who contributed data to our study.""The new study followed a 10-year science stocktake by Niwa which suggested climate change was slowly shifting the chemistry of New Zealand's oceans.Between 1909 and 2009, New Zealand's sea-surface temperatures had warmed by a statistically significant 0.71C, while pH levels of subantarctic waters had dropped by 0.0015 units per year since 1998.Globally, the oceans' average pH is currently 8.1, which is 0.1 lower than it was 250 years ago - a decrease of just one pH unit represented a 10-fold increase in the acidity.The decline in pH was projected to continue in line with the increase in atmospheric CO2, leading to the most rapid decrease in ocean pH in the past 50 million years.The effect was associated with decreases in nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate in the surface ocean, where most marine organisms live.Even small shifts had big consequences: mussels and paua might struggle to build their carbonate shells, while some fish species could experience changes in behaviour, physiology and even habitat distribution.Niwa scientists estimated that perhaps 25 per cent or less of the existing cold water coral locations around New Zealand will be able to sustain their growth by 2100 due to ocean acidification.Another five-year, $800,000 study has also just been launched to investigate why some New Zealand species may be able to cope more easily with ocean acidification.Because of their highly soluble calcium carbonate skeletons, reef-building algae were widely considered to be among the species most at risk.But marine botanist Dr Christopher Cornwall has challenged this idea, suggesting certain species of calcifying algae might pack the physiological machinery needed to tolerate change.He aimed to find out whether the resilience seen in some populations of local coralline algae was due to them having evolved in more variable pH environments."

261	4	"2019 Atlantic Hurricane season was an above-normal season with 12 named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. NOAA is now asking people to prepare for the season ahead.While the global average number of tropical cyclones has not increased in the last four decades, a new study says climate change has been influencing where exactly those deadly storms rage.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-led research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that between 1980 and 2018, there was an uptick in the number of storms in the North Atlantic and Central Pacific ocean basins.“We show for the first time that this observed geographic pattern cannot be explained only by natural variability,” Hiroyuki Murakami, the study's lead author and climate researcher at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, said in a news release on Wednesday.According to NOAA, a tropical cyclone is defined as a rotating, ""organized system of clouds and thunderstorms"" that originates over tropical or subtropical waters, and has a closed low-level circulation.      A variety of factors have been influencing where tropical cyclones have been forming over the last four decades, according to a new study.      (NOAA/GOES East)Depending on where the storms are, they are either hurricanes, cyclones, tropical storms, typhoons, or tropical depressions.According to the new study, the increase of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic and Central Pacific basins between 1980 and 2018 came with a corresponding decline in storms in the western Pacific and in the South Indian Ocean.A map released by NOAA shows where the changes are, with reds, oranges, yellows showing areas with the greatest increase compared to those in blue and green, where fewer storms were recorded.      The areas that saw an increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones from 1980 to 2018 are marked in red, yellow, and orange, while areas that saw a decrease are shaded in blue and green.      (NOAA)According to NOAA, Murakami used climate models to determine that greenhouse gases, manmade aerosols including particulate pollution, and volcanic eruptions were all influencing where tropical cyclones were hitting as part of the study.""Greenhouse gases are warming the upper atmosphere and the ocean,"" the agency states. ""This combines to create a more stable atmosphere with less chance that convection of air currents will help spawn and build up tropical cyclones.""A decline in particulate pollution and other aerosols that help create clouds and reflect sunlight, due to pollution control measures, may actually increase the warming of the ocean by allowing more sunlight to be absorbed by the seas, according to Murakami.What is a storm surge and how can you prepare for them?One of the reasons for the active tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic over the last 40 years is diminishing manmade aerosols, Murakami said.In the period of the study, volcanic eruptions also were found to have temporarily altered the location where tropical cyclones were forming.The major volcanic eruptions in El Chichón in Mexico in 1982 and Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 caused the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere to cool and resulted in less heat in the oceans, which shifted tropical cyclone activity southward for a few years, according to the study.Since 2000 ocean warming resumed, which the study said led to increased tropical cyclone activity in the Northern Hemisphere.      A new study says there's been an uptick in the number of storms in the North Atlantic and Central Pacific ocean basins, with has corresponded with a decline in storms in the western Pacific and in the South Indian Ocean.      (Joshua Stevens/NASA Earth Observatory)A continued increase in greenhouse gases could lead to an overall decrease in tropical cyclones worldwide by the end of the century,  according to the new study.Tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic, for instance, are projected to decrease by 2100 due to the “calming” effect of greenhouse gases. The annual average of 86 tropical cyclones is projected to decrease to about 69 worldwide by the end of the 21st century.""Declines are projected in most regions except in the Central Pacific, including Hawaii, where tropical cyclones activity is expected to increase,"" according to NOAA.But while there may be fewer storms, many of the cyclones that form are expected to be ""significantly more severe"" due to rising sea surface temperatures that fuel the intensity and destructiveness of such storms.The city has installed temporary barriers along its waterfront to prevent future storm surges, but more permanent solutions are currently under consideration; Rick Leventhal reports.“We hope this research provides information to help decision-makers understand the forces driving tropical cyclone patterns and make plans accordingly to protect lives and infrastructure,” Murakami said.While the NOAA Climate Prediction Center will provide its initial seasonal outlook for the Atlantic basin in May, researchers at Colorado State University are predicting an above-average hurricane season this year, citing the likely absence of El Niño as a primary factor.The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, and will include the names: Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal, Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna, Isaias, Josephine, Kyle, Laura, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred."
64	4	Global warming may have turned an already historic dry spell into the third-worst drought of the past 1,000 years.Every so often, the American West seems to lurch into something called a “mega-drought.” The rains falter, the rivers wither, and the forests become tinder boxes waiting for a spark. Mega-droughts are notoriously hard to study—the last one happened in the 16th century—but what we do know is worrisome. In the 1540s, a few wet years in the middle of a mega-drought may have triggered one of the worst disease epidemics ever recorded.According to research unveiled last week, mega-droughts may no longer be history. On Thursday, a team of climate scientists argued that the American West may currently be experiencing its first mega-drought in more than 500 years. A record-breaking period of aridity set in around the year 2000 and continues to this day, they said.“The last 19 years have been equivalent to the worst 19 years of the worst mega-droughts on record,” said Park Williams, a professor of bioclimatology at Columbia University, at a presentation of the work. Only three recent mega-droughts—in the late 800s, the mid-1100s, and the late 1500s—were worse than the current period, he added.Climate change seems to be driving a good chunk of the problem. “The current drought is substantially worse than it would have been without global warming,” Williams said. The drought was 62 percent more severe than it would have been, he said, due to human-caused climate change.*Williams presented the results to a standing-room-only session at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting, the year’s largest planetary-science conference. The work has not yet been peer-reviewed. While it’s a common practice to share preliminary work at a scientific meeting, Williams didn’t comment directly for this article; academic norms discourage researchers from publicly discussing a study before its formal publication.But other scientists told me that the work makes sense, saying it was “quite plausible” that the American Southwest is in a mega-drought right now. And no matter what, it’s clear that the region is in the middle of a far-reaching climatic transformation.“The definition of mega-drought technically is open to debate,” said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. Two decades ago, he and the climate scientist Connie Woodhouse coined the term mega-drought in a paper, specifying that such a drought must last 20 years or more.“The drought in the Southwest is now in its 19th year. So it’s right on the cusp of technically being a mega-drought,” Overpeck told me.The current drought is “relentless,” he said, with consequences that reverberate across the West. “It’s reflected in the levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest reservoirs in our country … You see it in the way the forests are outright dying in some places, in big insect outbreaks as [plants] are weakened by a lack of moisture in the soil, in more catastrophic wildfires. There’s a lot of signs this drought is unusual.”He said that two different events seem to be driving the crisis. First, the region is receiving less rain than normal. Second, the Southwest as a whole is systematically warming up and drying out. It’s becoming a more desertlike place, a process that scientists call aridification. “Most of the work points to aridification being dominant” in driving the modern drought, Overpeck said.The new work from Williams and his colleagues may support the same idea. They began by looking at the climatic record preserved in tens of thousands of tree rings across the American West. By using a simple form of machine learning on that data and calibrating it to modern weather records they pieced together the past 1,200 years of soil moisture in the West. (Williams’s team includes Ed Cook, who practically invented the modern study of tree rings.)Read: The map hidden in the Pacific Northwest’s tree ringsConsulting this record, they found that the current drought does not perfectly resemble historic mega-droughts. While previous droughts were concentrated in just one or two places in the West, the current drought covers almost half of the country. Climate models suggest that this huge territorial extent may be caused by the extreme heat and dry air that’s plagued western states in the past few decades. “What may have just been a drought in the Southwest is now a drought across the entire study region,” Williams said at the conference.Scientists have long suspected that aridification could cause problems across the West—mega-droughts included. Two years ago, a paper in Science Advances warned—with 99 percent certainty—that a southwestern mega-drought would occur by 2100 if greenhouse-gas emissions continued to balloon through the next several decades. In another paper, Williams and some of his same colleagues found that increased heat in the West has exploded the size of wildfires since the mid-1980s.Read: The simple reason that humans can’t control wildfiresBut Williams believes that climate change is not solely to blame. “The current drought would have been occurring anyway without global warming, but it would only have been the eighth- or ninth-worst on record,” he said. Instead, it’s the fourth-worst in the past 1,200 years.Woodhouse, who coined the term mega-drought with Overpeck, told me that this effect may be the most important finding of the new paper. “The current 19-year period is different [from] 19-year periods in the past for the simple reason that it is occurring under warmer temperatures,” she said in an email. “In essence, a garden-variety drought (in terms of precipitation deficits) + warming = a much more severe drought.”Overpeck agreed. “The warming is having a huge effect—a huge effect on water resources and a huge effect on forests,” he said. “People knew there would be an effect, but we didn’t know it would come this big, and this fast.” * This article previously misstated the amount by which human-caused climate change worsened the current drought.
782	4	"This story was originally published in newsroom.co.nz and is republished with permission. Sarah Mead was at the big UN climate change conference in Poland and writes that the consensus ultimately achieved was a major diplomatic success. ""The gap is big; the gap is big."" Those were the words of the Head of the UN Environment Chief Scientist as he presented the Emissions Gap Report 2018 during the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. He was not exaggerating. To limit global warming to 1.5°C - which is essential for vulnerable countries like those in the Pacific - global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must halve by 2030. To limit global warming to even the upper temperature limit of 2°C requires reducing GHG emissions by a quarter. READ MORE: * Laughter as US promotes fossil fuels at climate conference * Scientists call for 'unprecedented' action * Attenborough: Climate change is 'our greatest threat' * EU steps up international co-operation on climate change Countries therefore have just over a decade to radically transform their economies. But transformation appears to be a long way off. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C or ""well below"" 2°C. It leaves it up to countries though to set national commitments to achieve this goal. On the basis of countries' present commitments (which many are not on track to achieve), global warming is expected reach around 3.2°C by 2100. Indeed, global GHG emissions increased in 2017 after three years of stagnation. The door is still open to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals, but it's closing fast. As noted in the UN Report: ""Now more than ever, unprecedented and urgent action is required by all nations"". THE NEGOTIATIONS Over the first two weeks of this month, representatives from each country met in Katowice to negotiate the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. In order to operationalise the broad obligations in the Agreement, it was necessary to agree on a set of guidelines: a process of adding 'meat to the bones' so to speak. Given the enormous nature of this task and the vastly different negotiating positions of some countries, the negotiations were at times tense. The end of the first week saw certain countries refuse to ""welcome"" a Special Report prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on global warming of 1.5°C - a refusal which was criticised by several countries including New Zealand. And when after more than a week of negotiations there were still many unresolved issues, the COP President was forced to change the mode of negotiations - pressing countries to move beyond differences and present new solutions. Despite these hurdles, there were also unexpected highlights. During a full plenary at the end of the first week, a group of youth Māori delegates from Te Ara Whatu spontaneously sang a waiata following the adoption of a decision regarding the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform - ""a first"" noted the Chair and commanding the attention of the world's delegates. THE PARIS RULEBOOK Consensus at times seemed unattainable. How could Kiribati, the future of which is imperilled by climate change, be expected to agree with the US - the largest historical emitter of GHG emissions and which ""strongly believe[s] that no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability"" (as noted by an advisor during COP24)? But consensus was indeed achieved. On Saturday - after negotiations were extended for one day - the President of COP24 announced that countries had reached agreement. The final decision, which extends over 133 pages, contains painstakingly negotiated details on how countries will operationalise the Paris Agreement. While such details may seem mundane and unimportant, they are essential for the success of the Paris Agreement - which without would be of limited efficacy. As is always the case with multilateral agreements, the final decision represents a compromise. ""No one is entirely happy with this rulebook, but it is an important step,"" noted Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief, on the adoption of the final decision. Developing countries, who are less able to respond to climate change and have contributed to it the least, consider that the deal does not deliver the right ""level of balance"". As noted by Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 plus China: ""We must not gloss over the real differences between the developed and developing countries, both in responsibility and capability. We need to find a better way of doing this together"". Countries were also unable to reach agreement on the rules concerning carbon trading in global emissions reduction, after the proposed text was blocked by Brazil. IS IT ENOUGH TO PUT US ON TRACK? To be clear: achieving consensus in Katowice was a considerable diplomatic achievement. By agreeing to an agreed set of rules, the outcome will breathe life into the Paris Agreement. It is not yet clear though whether the rules are sufficient to pressure countries to make the changes necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. Certainly, current commitments are insufficient. The risks associated with failing to prevent dangerous climate change are severe. Impacts of global warming are already being felt around the world. At 1.5°C, the impacts on biodiversity, extreme weather events and sea-level rise are set to increase - with catastrophic consequences. At 2°C, the impacts will be even more severe: coral reefs are, for instance, expected to be wiped out. In the absence of sufficiently ambitious commitments by countries, citizens groups are taking action into their own hands. During COP24, Greenpeace released a People's Guide to holding governments to account through the courts, and school students went on strike in Australia and Sweden. Vanuatu, for its part, announced its intention to explore legal action against the world's most polluting fossil fuel corporations and countries, while also calling on the International Criminal Court in the Hague to ""extend its outreach to the Pacific island nations"" that ""suffer from climate atrocities"". *  *  * Climate change affects all countries, but none more than Small Island Developing States (SIDS). During COP24, the Pacific SIDS issued a Declaration calling on countries to ""take dramatic and urgent steps"". Presented by Prime Minister Bainimarama of Fiji, the Declaration acknowledged that COP24 represented a ""pivotal moment in human history"": ""our future is at stake and we only have 12 years"". The outcome of COP24 is a step in the right direction, but a leap towards more ambitious action is still urgently required.

821	4	Democratic strategist Kevin Chavous reacts on 'Fox & Friends First.'Of the multiple challenges facing our nation, only one has been called “an existential crisis,” repeatedly and unanimously, by all the leading Democratic presidential candidates.Not terrorism, threats from a nuclear Iran, or the ongoing quagmire in Afghanistan.Not a raging opioid epidemic that claims 70,000 American lives every year.No, the crisis that threatens our very existence, the life of mankind, is climate change.“This is our World War II,” opined New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. “I think it will be harder to tackle,” said Mayor Pete Buttegeig, comparing the climate issue to the mobilization of millions of American boys across Europe and the Pacific.“Existential threat” is a grave phrase and, at least for the sake of this article, I will take these Democrats at their word that this is a deeply held belief and not merely campaign jargon.The only way to face an existential threat is to kill it before it kills you. Otherwise, it is not a threat. And certainly not “existential.”During World War II, America did not face the existential threat of Hitler by fighting Nazis at home. We did not face down the existential threat of the Cold War with speeches. When Muslim extremists brought existential violence to our nation on 9/11, we took the fight to them.No. In every existential threat we have faced, we brought war, and millions of men and women have served, some paying the ultimate price. Enacting the radical “Green New Deal,” which all the Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed, is not enough as the threat is global.  That was the purpose of the Paris Climate Accord: bind us all to the same resolution and conscript us to the duty of eradication.  What country is leading the global existential threat? China.China is the world’s leading polluter of air and ocean. It is the world’s leader in CO2 emissions and has no intention of decreasing them.Democratic candidates speak of oil, gas and coal the way Churchill spoke of fascism. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have vowed “on my first day” to ban fracking, fossil fuel development on federal land, and offshore drilling. War with China, then, is an absolutely essential component of addressing the climate crisis if, indeed, it is existential. We cannot stand by and their actions contribute to the death of all humanity.No one wants war. No young men wanted to storm the beaches of Normandy, but they did it because the crisis was existential. So, if not a military war with China, surely the presidential candidates would support at minimum a trade war. China producing less means they would pollute less and that is essential in combating climate change. Yet, the Democrats running for president oppose the tariffs currently crippling China’s economy.“The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change,” AOC said earlier this year.  That, too, is a serious claim. What’s a serious response?Sanders supports population control and using taxpayer dollars for abortions in “poor” countries. If people feed the climate change virus, the reasoning goes, then we need fewer people in the world.But people are not really the problem, other candidates suggest, consumers are. So, we must cut back on consumption, and therefore we see proposals for limiting the amount of meat people consume, banning cars, air travel and of course, plastic straws. Eliminate consumer goods and we fight climate change.Democratic candidates advocate for much more. They speak of oil, gas and coal the way Churchill spoke of fascism. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have vowed “on my first day” to ban fracking, fossil fuel development on federal land, and offshore drilling.  “Middle-class Joe” Biden from Pennsylvania, which employs hundreds of thousands of energy workers, has declared, “There is no place in my administration for fossil fuels”.Let’s hope a Commander in Chief Biden wouldn’t extend this sophomoric affirmation to the military and have our Navy’s ships powered by sails.The real mission of the Democratic candidates, and most environmental leftists, is this: punish Americans. Even though climate change is a global problem, and China is the leading cause, we will eliminate freedoms, reduce market choices, curtail prosperity, and most egregiously, destroy jobs. Americans must suffer because China pollutes.Americans have a choice: take these candidates at their word or consider it all political blathering. If the latter, these candidates can be ignored.  But if the former, we must prepare for war. After all, climate change is an existential threat.Isn’t it?
867	5	"But while we are looking up at the treetops for climate solutions, some campaigners are urging the world to look down, where another answer lies -- right under our feet. Forests, peatlands, deserts and tundra can all absorb and hold stocks of carbon-dioxide (CO2). Of all the carbon held in land-based ecosystems, around 34% can be found in grasslands, data from the World Resources Institute show. That's not much less than the 39% held in forests.""Whether you look at the Serengeti, the Cerrado in Brazil, whether you look at what's left of the prairies in North America or the steppes of Mongolia -- every single one of our major, iconic grassland habitats is under threat at the moment,"" Ian Dunn, chief executive of the British conservation organization Plantlife, told CNN. There's also plenty of it in the United Kingdom, which will host world leaders and climate negotiators in just over a week at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland. Among several items on the agenda is how to protect forests and plant more trees to help slash global emissions.But Plantlife, among other groups, is campaigning for grasslands to be protected at an international level and part of any deal that emerges in Glasgow. While leaders meet in the Scottish city, Plantlife is working to restore more than 100,000 hectares of meadows, including one on the other side of the United Kingdom, in the southern English county of Kent.The Ranscombe Farm Nature Reserve looks just like your typical patch of English countryside, with its soft rolling hills and grazing cattle. The grass here looks ordinary, browned in patches from the autumn weather. But come spring, the rare orchids, bellflowers and rock roses will bloom in a celebration of this grassland's biodiversity. Restoring species-rich ecosystems like this takes time, said Ben Sweeney, Ranscombe Farm's manager, who has been working on this grassland since 2010.""It will take a couple of decades,"" he said.Ranscombe Farm protects not only grasslands but also woodlands, rough grazing pastures and crop fields for rare plants.Sweeney explains that just like with an animal sanctuary, Ranscombe Farm nurtures rare plants in small sections of the reserve, where they are thriving, and can hopefully grow and spread out into bigger habitats soon. But even after years of careful management, rangers have not been able to reverse all the impacts that farming and land degradation have had on the site. In the UK, these vital habitats have been slowly disappearing as a consequence of decades of intensive agriculture, housing development, and infrastructure build-up over the last century. The UK has lost more than 2 million acres of grasslands as urban and woodland areas expand, according to the UK Center of Ecology & Hydrology.That concerns activists, because grasslands not only store carbon but also serve as a buffer for extreme weather and help prevent soil erosion. Their roots hold together light soil, and the ground cover prevents erosion from wind and water. These habitats help with natural flood management by holding water after extreme weather events, then releasing it gradually.The loss of grasslands also threatens the important species that rely on them, like bees, butterflies and other pollinators. A recent study published by the University of Manchester revealed the UK's grasslands store more than 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon. That's the equivalent of storing the yearly emissions from about 400 million cars.""But they are pretty much ignored or have been ignored in many sustainability policies,"" said soil expert and ecology professor Richard Bardgett, the study's lead researcher. Another study, published in 2018 in IOP Science, concluded that grasslands in California could play a bigger role than forests as carbon sinks, as they are less vulnerable to fires and drought, which parts of the world will experience more of as the Earth continues to warm. That's because grasslands keep most of their carbon locked in their roots underground -- even during drought and fire -- unlike forests, in which carbon is spread up and throughout trees. Your diet could be linked to grassland destructionWhen managed poorly, grasslands can become a net source of emissions, rather than a sink to remove them. Rearing livestock on grassland, too, plays a major role in methane emissions, which is also contributing to the climate crisis.A global increase in demand for meat and dairy products, as well as soy, is putting pressure on grasslands. The world's most biodiverse savanna, the Cerrado in Brazil, has been reduced to around half its original size, mainly for the expansion of beef and soy production, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which says the Cerrado loses an area equivalent to the size of São Paulo every three months.In China, vast expanses of grasslands are in a ""state of ecological crisis,"" according to scientists, caused by overgrazing of the land. Meanwhile, in the United States, the expansion of farmland has led to the prairies of the Great Plains losing an average four football fields every minute, according to a WWF report published in 2020. While grassland protection is a global concern, there are growing expectations for the UK to show climate leadership ahead of COP26. Campaigners are disappointed with the omission of grasslands as a nature-based solution in the government's Net Zero Strategy, which is being seen as a potential blueprint for other nations' climate roadmaps. ""The importance of grasslands in carbon capture, improved biodiversity, sustainable food production, water management and societal wellbeing continues to be missed in this report and in government policy,"" Dunn said.""We need to be working on a mosaic of habitats.""Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said that the government's Net Zero Strategy had significant gaps and that its authors, from the government, ""don't seem to have fully recognized the role that nature can play.""There's little new for nature in the strategy, he said. ""Instead, old policies are being recycled -- and it's not enough.""The land restoration policies will rely on a modest $880 million (£640 million) Nature for Climate fund, which had already been announced in the Conservative government's election manifesto, Bennett points out. A Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told CNN it was protecting grasslands at some reserve sites in England, launching a pilot scheme for more sustainable farming practices, and giving more than $55 million (£40 million) in grants for nature recovery projects. ""Biodiversity loss and climate change are global problems requiring global solutions,"" the spokesperson said.  But Defra did not comment when asked whether grasslands would be discussed at COP26 and sent quotes around the importance of ending illegal logging in forests as a nature-based climate solution. A group of 38 British lawmakers are also calling for international recognition and protection for grasslands at COP26. In a motion, they want parliament's House of Commons to recognize the role of grasslands for its ability to reduce emissions, reduce flood risk and act as critical ecosystems for pollinators.They urge ""government ministers to use the opportunity of COP26 in Glasgow to seek international recognition and protections for species-rich grasslands, to lead by example in taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change and increase biodiversity and to ensure that those areas of natural beauty are preserved for future generations to enjoy."""
582	3	Cutting edge technology such as super efficient solar panels and nanorobots are being developed to fight climate change and disease.But a team of experts believe that the humble mushroom is just as effective in helping humans continue to survive and thrive on Earth.They claim that mycelium – a vast underground network of fungus – could save the world by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing more antibiotics, among other benefits.Scroll down for videosExperts claim that mycelium – a vast underground network of fungus – could save the world by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing more antibiotics. This image shows fungus mycelium growing on a treeMycelium is found all over the world and holds soil together. It's the part of the mushroom that we don;t usually see and makes nutrients, breaks up pollutants, filters water and treats disease.Soon the potential of this network will feature in a film called Fantastic Fungi, which has just reached its fundraising goal on Kickstarter. ‘An all-star team of artists, scientists, doctors and explorers are joining forces to create a life-affirming, mind-bending film about the mushroom and its mysterious root-like structure: mycelium. What they reveal will blow your mind and possibly save the planet,’ the website says. A film about mycelium will 'create a life-affirming, mind-bending film about the mushroom and its mysterious root-like structure: mycelium. What they reveal will blow your mind and possibly save the planet,’according to the group which have just funded their project (a poster is shown above) on KickstarterDr Stamets claims that by growing more mycelium, climate change could be brought under control, because the organism can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide. A stock image of smoke stacks is shownMycelium is a vast underground network of fungus, which holds soil together.It can hold up to 30,000 times its own mass in water and nutrients etc.The largest organism on the planet is a 2,000-year-old fungal mat that stretches over 2,000 acres.‘Funguses are ‘the grand molecular disassemblers of nature - the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth,’ Paul Stamets said in a TED talk.Mycelium produces jewel-like mushrooms that come in countless shapes, sizes and colours, such as pink, yellow and turquoise.Experts believe that mycelium is the ‘key to the regeneration of our living planet.’Mycelium can produce antibiotics powerful enough to prevent diseases and pandemics, such as smallpox.It absorbs a large amount of carbon dioxide, so more mycelium could help control climate change, they said.It will explore fungi’s ‘proven ability to restore our ecosystem, repair our health, and resurrect our symbiotic relationship to nature’.Mycologist Paul Sta​mets, who will be the main voice of the film, told Motherboard: ‘Mycelium offers the best solutions for carbon sequestration, for preserving biodiversity, for reducing pollutants, and for offering us many of the medicines that we need today, both human and ecological.’ ‘Fungi, I think, hold the greatest potential solutions for overcoming the calamities that we face,’ said the scientist, who has talked on the topic at TED and authored several books about mushrooms.He refers to mycelium as ‘nature’s internet’ because if part of a fungus is harmed, the rest of the network can respond quickly to disruptions.For example, if one branch of the thread-like mycelium is broken, the organism finds alternative pathways to carry nutrients and information, much like how packets of data can be transported across the internet. In his book, 'Mycelium Running', Stamets takes the idea a step further.He writes: 'I see the mycelium as the Earth's natural Internet, a consciousness with which we might be able to communicate. 'Through cross-species interfacing, we may one day exchange information with these sentient cellular networks. 'Because these externalised neurological nets sense any impression upon them, from footsteps to falling tree branches, they could relay enormous amounts of data regarding the movements of all organisms through the landscape.'The complex chemistry of mycelium has been shown to produce antibiotics powerful enough to prevent many diseases and stop pandemics.Scientists even believe that it could help to deal with scenarios such as such as terrorists starting outbreaks of smallpox, for example.In a 2008 TED talk, Stamets said that three strains of Agarikon mushrooms, for example, have been shown to be ‘highly active’ against flu viruses. The film will talk about research which shows mycelium as a viable alternative to pharmaceuticals to treat breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and post-traumatic stress syndrome.  In a 2008 TED talk (above), Stamets said that three strains of Agarikon mushrooms, for example, have been shown to be ‘highly active’ against flu viruses It will then reveal how the spongy network could be used to clean up toxic oil spills, fix the collapse of bee colonies and other environmental disasters such as polluted rivers, by filtering bacteria like E.coli out of water to clean soil, for example. In 1996, Stamets began work to explore how mushrooms can clean up oil spills and found that oyster mushrooms combined with wood chips can be spread onto soil contaminated with oil, to clean it up within one month. Nine weeks after the 'disaster', the dish of soil was home to seedlings and plants.He came up with the idea of a 'mycoboom' to clean waterborne oil spills. A tube filled with oyster mushrooms could be used to break down petroleum in a contained area and a similar technique was found to 'eat' nerve gas too.Stamets believes that mushrooms could also be used to clean floodwaters, which can be a haven for potentially fatal bacteria. They could also be used to filter out endocrine disrupters and pharmaceutical residues, for example, which disrupt ecosystems and can damage human health. ‘Fungi, I think, hold the greatest potential solutions for overcoming the calamities that we face,’ said Stamets, who has talked on the topic at TED and authored several books about mushrooms. A stock image of the attractive Fly Agaric mushroom is shownStamets has also already shown that fungus can act as pesticide and could revamp the industry by using nature to keep insect pests at bay. He even claims that by growing more mycelium, climate change could be brought under control, because the organism can absorb vast quantities of carbon dioxide.The gas is responsible for 60 per cent of the 'enhanced greenhouse effect,' and the dominant cause of global warming is fossil fuels burned by humans.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set targets to cut emissions by 80 per cent in the UK by 2050 below 1990 levels.The long-term aim is to stop the global temperature rising by more than 2°C by the end of the century.To meet this goal, which 160 governments have promised to meet, will require zero emissions and possibly the removal of carbon dioxide, which could mean more mushrooms may play a part.The experts say that more mycelium could be produced easily and quickly by encouraging people to grow mushrooms, which spread mycelium and stop burning forests and removing dead wood, which robs mycelium of nutrients.
