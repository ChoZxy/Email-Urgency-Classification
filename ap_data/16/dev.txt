507	1	Magic on TV is dumb [SEP] Magic in person is great. I love being shocked/amazed and left wondering "how did they do that?!". When it's on TV I can't help but to assume that it's been edited and/or the audience is in on it, it really takes away the magic.
165	1	I wonder.. . [SEP] I wonder how people can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù music and how different things have vibes. When I hear music I can feel it like it‚Äôs not just an emotion jts like I feel the music coursing through me all the elements and stuff. And different scenarios have different ‚Äúvibes‚Äù I wonder the scientific reason for this I‚Äôm sure some would say It‚Äôs a reaction that causes chemicals to release in the brain and maybe it is . But it‚Äôs like I can feel the music... and like vibes everyone and every scenario ask has different vibes.. What u guys think?
233	1	What's the biggest turn of events you've ever experienced in your life? [SEP] If you asked a younger you, where do you think you would be at age XYZ? what would you have said, and where are you now?      Good, bad, or indifferent answers are all welcome.
260	1	Can‚Äôt read comments [SEP] The other day I posted a question and for some reason can‚Äôt read any of the comments people had left. Just wanted to let those people know that I appreciate anyone who answered and hopefully I‚Äôll be able to read them one day! Lol
799	2	In a world without brands, people would have a better nose for quality [SEP]
773	1	There is too much of Porn but no Love [SEP] There is too much of Porn but no Love üíî
853	1	You go to sleep by staring at the back of your eyelids. [SEP]
208	1	You know, it doesn't matter your political side, gender, race, or status. We all weep for the loss of Alex trabek. [SEP] Truly a good man, an icon.
458	1	I‚Äôve never felt so alone [SEP] So I (24M) got off fentanyl 1 year ago and due to that I had to cut off 99% of my friends and recently due to a single lie someone told that the only 2 people I was friends (been friends since I we were 15) with decided to end our friendship over a single lie told by someone that has made worse and more blatant lies about my friends but for some reason they‚Äôd rather not trust me in such an obvious situation. I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with most of my family (brother, mom, stepdad, grandparents) so pretty much all I‚Äôm left with is my cousin and she has her own life and lives a distance so I can‚Äôt constantly bother her with all my issues. I deleted all social media 20 or so days ago and joined Reddit where I could be anonymous to anyone that knew me but still feel like I‚Äôm not completely sunk in a void. Just had to get that out since I have nowhere else to get it out at
219	1	Dating [SEP] Dating  I‚Äôm going to keep this broad, but I‚Äôm a gay 23M and I‚Äôm basically so done with dating. I want to know if there‚Äôs any tactics out there when trying to maneuver the dating world? I feel like my ‚Äúromantic‚Äù life is shit and just full of meaningless sex that goes nowhere. Maybe this is just me venting, but I also want to hear about other people‚Äôs shitty dates and how to not let your self worth be effected by that as I feel I let a lot of these guys upset me when they don‚Äôt want anymore to do with me other than sex.
44	1	Does feeling Overwhelmed mean being not interested ? [SEP] I am feeling currently overwhelmed about making into Motorsports.   Does that mean I am not interested.   What I mean is if a person is passionate about something, will they feel overwhelmed ?
316	1	All I know [SEP] crypto taking me out the slums.  Safemoon. Cardano. Ethereum.  Xrp! Vet. Polygon Matic. Enjin coin. Bloktopia. Metahero. Chain link. Aave. Filecoin.
82	2	Living your full potential in life [SEP] I don‚Äôt know how to explain this but‚Ä¶  I had an odd realization the other day that I‚Äôm not living my best life and am currently trying to figure out how to get on that path. I‚Äôve been really consumed with graduating college, getting a good job in the corporate world (which I don‚Äôt want a 9-5), getting married, etc, that I haven‚Äôt even stopped to think about all that I‚Äôm capable of.   When I think of what I want to do in life, I instantly start to get negative thoughts in my head and talk myself out of it. The odd part comes in when I start to think of different realities in life. This is my reality now but I want a different reality.  So is it up to the universe, ourselves, God  to make great success possible for us or maybe a combination? I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense I just feel like if I could hit a little switch in my brain, the way I should be viewing life would actually start to make sense.
610	1	First kiss [SEP] I just had my first kiss at her house.   Things got pretty heated.  At the end, I was breathless and dizzy as hell.  My kissing skills were complimented.  I complimented her beauty.  Made out again.  That was the best meniversary I ever had.
702	1	You have probably gotten your currency you payed with back sometime in your life. [SEP]
952	1	If ghosts could possess their own corpse, then they technically wouldn‚Äôt be dead. [SEP]
707	1	Somewhere out there, there is a point in space older than any other. [SEP]
623	1	I can‚Äôt compliment my boyfriend [SEP] I get some people can‚Äôt take compliments but he‚Äôs not one of those people. Every time I compliment him he brushes it off in a ‚Äújoking/teasing‚Äù way that‚Äôs really started to hurt my feelings. Especially because when other women compliment him he eats it up like he‚Äôs never gotten one before.   He called me weird for saying he was pretty. Said it‚Äôs not a good compliment for a guy. Prefers to be called handsome. Okay, sure. I‚Äôll start regulating how I compliment then.   I call him handsome; ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. Yeah it‚Äôs a ‚Äújoke‚Äù or whatever but come on. I literally saw you swoon over being called handsome by a girl you were trying to fuck last week. (Context, we broke up for a day and he immediately got on dating apps. One of the girls called him handsome and he absolutely ate it up)  Why can‚Äôt I call you handsome? Why can‚Äôt I call you pretty, or sexy? Why ONLY ME?? It‚Äôs just so fucking disheartening. Insult me for calling you, my partner, attractive. What a fun joke we both enjoy so dearly.   Fuck.
722	1	someone in your family might be a serial killer [SEP]
526	2	I'm not an american, but I don't see the outrage over' mexicans locked in cages. [SEP] they broke into a country they weren't authorized to be in, of course they'll be detained.
618	1	Are women over 30 considered damaged goods by men? [SEP] so many articles, videos on Youtube from "dating experts" about how women over 30 are damaged goods - either biologically running out of time or unfit, or psychologically.   This isn't a personal post but just for context - I'm 32, mostly single through my 20s working on myself as I had chronic depression and social anxiety. However, I stayed put at my career and am in a career with great prospects. I worked on myself physically as well and am fit and workout regularly (most men think I'm 26/27 because I've taken care of myself not only physically but mentally as well). I'm now a happier person individually and finally feel ready to share my healed self with someone and there seems to be no space for that in the "real world"...is this true?  In general is this the new rule in the dating world?
119	1	So should I wash my ENTIRE body when I take a shower? [SEP] Ok so I don't know if this is the kinda place to go to ask this question because it's reddit and all. Though me and my gf had a discussion on whether it's healthy to just wash your genitals, pits, anus, and feet when you haven't done anything that will dirty your body, like being dishwasher at a greasy restaurant, or something. She thinks you should always wash your entire body. I don't really see the need, unless your all sweaty/dirty from something.
442	1	I hate feeling like I'm just treading water financially. [SEP] My wife and I have a combined income a little north of $260k annually. Twenty years ago, when we were just dating, if you'd told us that we'd be making that much now, we would have thought we would be living in a mansion or traveling the world.   We're doing better than most, but, in the last year, I've felt like we're just treading water financially. We're not making any progress on our debts, and it's bringing me down.   We racked up a lot of debt early in our marriage. At one point, between the house, student loans, and credit cards, we owed well over $600k. We started to turn the corner about eight years ago. Now, our total debt it down to about $200k, most of which is our mortgage.   Until a little over a year ago, I was making double payments on our mortgage every month. We were on track to be debt free by 2025. But then the prices on everything started going up. We have three kids, and for our family of five, our monthly grocery bills went from $1.3k per month to over $2k per month. I know exactly how much we spend on groceries, because I use the same credit card for all food purchases.   Last summer, our oldest child graduated college, and came back to live with us. We did a major home remodel to give her her own space (basically converting the basement into an apartment). That cost us $125k, which we financed. The payments on that are $1.2k monthly.   So now, thanks to the remodel and the price of food going up, we're spending $2k more per month this year than we were last year at this time.   Again, I know we're doing better than most people, but still, I hate this feeling of not making any progress on debts, and just paying the minimums on things. I'm not used to it.
173	1	The sound of rain [SEP] ‚Ä¶through the open window. A cool breeze. Flannelette pyjamas, a good book, a cozy blanket and Beef and Guinness stew. Today is a good day.
410	2	I don't want to deal with my significant other's mental health anymore [SEP] We have been together for almost ten years.  I have recently got my mental health under control.  It was, objectively, never as bad as hers, but that is beside the point.     I stuck through a lot.  Suicide attempts, alcohol, lost jobs, tickets, arrests, lies, all of it, because the good outweighed the bad, until it didn't.  Finally, though, she quot drinking, and things got a lot better, but not perfect.   The problem now is that her psychiatrist put her on a medication that clearly isn't helping, then added another that *might* be helping.     She doesn't do things anymore except be at home, and go hiking if I can get her out to do it.  She complains of not having friends, but she cut ties with them because they were toxic.  She's not wrong, but she makes no effort to go make new friends.  She comparison about everything, but makes little to no effort.  She won't challenge her psych's prescriptions because she's afraid to come off, even though she admits they aren't helping.   She barely smiles, we don't get intimate, we eat together and watch TV together, and that's it.  I don't know how to be in my relationship anymore, and I'm not sure I want to.     Ifinally feel like I have my shit together, and I want a life with her, but I feel like she is bringing me down, now.  It fucking sticks and I feel like a piece of shit for thinking these things.
967	1	Even though he has no powers, Batman cannot exist in real life because of laws [SEP]
477	1	Fun fact! [SEP] Serbian beer Jelen is older than USA. Jelen brewery was founded in 1756. USA was founded in 1776.
529	1	Sleep training is bullshit and tons of babies sleep like crap [SEP] *disclaimer that this applies more to breastfed babies that still wake frequently to nurse, whether nutritive or for comfort, for their first year of life  I‚Äôm so sick of people telling me my baby should be sleeping through the night and that I have to sleep train. You hear all these people say how the first few nights were hard and now their baby is sleeping perfectly until the next ‚Äúsleep regression‚Äù hits and then they ‚Äúretrain‚Äù their baby. Not only is this hard on both the parents and baby, but is your baby really ready to be sleeping independently through the night if every few months you have to start over? The dreaded 4 month regression, 6, 8, and 12, lasting 3-6 weeks each, tells me the good nights are the flukes, not the bad.  Babies are biologically designed to be near their caregiver and to wake frequently to have their needs met.  The idea that a young infant should and needs to be sleeping through the night on their own is so damaging to parents who think they‚Äôre doing something horribly wrong because their baby still wakes up sometimes. This prevailing belief makes sleep an impossible topic of conversation for them because the advice they know they‚Äôll receive is laughable in their situation (looking at you, ‚Äúdrowsy but awake‚Äù). If someone says to you that their baby isn‚Äôt sleeping, please please please don‚Äôt suggest sleep training and that it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve done to ruin their child‚Äôs sleep future. Your baby WILL eventually sleep.
145	1	Life shortcuts [SEP] Recently, I've been quite down because everything I try doesn't really work out (love, job, passion, money...). At the same time I see a lot of people around me who took all the "bad" shortcuts they could in their life (didn't finish their education/college, experiment with drugs, don't have a steady job etc.), yet they are much better positioned in all of things in life that I try to achieve by hard work. Is life really so random that no matter how hard you try, everything comes down to luck?  Whether you take the "right" way or the shortcut, does it really matter?
96	3	Ironic [SEP] I have found life so peculiar in the aspects of how we evolved as we grow and grow as we evolve. As a child I grew up too fast, I was logical, analytical, realistic not very creative and not very imaginative/other worldly I was very matter of fact. As an adult I find myself becoming quite the opposite, very imaginative/other worldly, creative, becoming more spiritual, more abstract and I really like it. I'm finding more and more deeper. I find the irony in that. That usually it's the other way around. I love the irony of life.
413	2	I'm upset and I think the reason is stupid [SEP] I'll try and keep this short.   I had a tiktok account, and I put a lot of effort into it. Over a year I had made around 500 videos and amassed 84 thousand followers. It wasn't anything crazy but I was proud of it. It was fun and I enjoyed myself while doing it.   Today, I was permanently banned and my account is gone. I didn't get a warning or a reason. I'd never had a guidelines violation before in my life.   I'm honestly in shock. It feels like someone just died and I know that sounds dramatic but I really put my heart and soul into my content and now it's all just gone like it never existed.   I know social media is stupid, tiktok most of all but I can't help but feel devastated.
396	2	I feel like I have a problem that I can't fix [SEP] Hey everyone, so I've been thinking about me as a person, and I've realized something that's not so good. I'm the giving tree. I want to make others happy, and for the most part, I don't care what it is (there are a few exceptions) I just do want other people want since I want them to lead a good life and be happy for the short time they live. I really haven't cared about the consequences, I know I've gotten manipulated for this in the past, but I don't really do anything about it. I live my life with a "your wish is my command" philosophy, and it's worked so far. I know that people have used me for it, but I don't mind. I know that this is bad, but I feel that I'm so used to it to the point where I don't care. The thing is, I'm not an attention seeker, I don't run off of the validation from others, I'm not asking for attention, I just do what they ask. I do want to change this, but I don't know how. I've lived my life like this and don't know what to do, in the real world, being the nice guy doesn't do anything. I know that people have a dark side, and I'm the one they unleash it on, and this personality makes me the perfect prey. I'm just stuck and don't know what to do. I consider this an extreme case of selflessness, personally
362	1	Im in love. [SEP] We‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù but i dont think they know that I LOVE them. Not in an obsessive way, not in an over the top way, not convincing myself they have no flaws. i just love their ‚Äúflaws‚Äù too. I dont count anything against them. I have an urge to understand them and know what theyre thinking. Id trust them with anything. I want to just sit in a field in the sun and talk for hours about random shit. i wanna have a marshmallow eating contest or bake a cake together or create a photo book.  I don‚Äôt want anyone else, not in this way. I trust them to feel the same, i trust them around girls i find 1000 times more attractive than me.
213	1	Cannot Get Stuff Done at Home [SEP] Am I the only one who has this problem? I cannot get stuff done diligently at home. Workout at home, half ass it. Study at home, end up doing something else. I‚Äôm wondering why this is happening. When I go to the gym my workouts are intense and when I used to go to the library, I focused on assignments. Who else has this issue?
984	1	Sharp cheese actually can withstand more physical sharpening to the point of weaponry, though swinging a 25 lb block of mild cheese will get results too. [SEP]
152	3	The poor artists [SEP] The artists, making publicities, with their hearts, making corporate video-game, with their hearts, making propaganda, with their hearts. I weep for them, for everytime they make a bad thing good, the whole thing will always stay bad. If the tools are cursed, why do you use them, dear artists?
279	1	Flying solo soon .. [SEP] I've (42F) decided to end my very LTR. We haven't been happy in years and we both stayed to be comfortable. He makes twice what I make and now I've gotta go it alone soon. I was honest with him and he is resistant slightly but understands. Has also agreed to separate slowly so no one becomes homeless.  I can't afford our current situation alone,. I live in a very expensive area and can't leave due to kids (Mine)  Spam me with encouragement, money ideas, adulting alone....whatever you want. PLEASE!
782	1	Animals usually never see themselves defecate and urinate [SEP]
613	1	Let me tell you about Lee [SEP] When I was a kid, my family was friends with another family. Small town sorta, about 10,000 people. The head of this family my family was friends with was Lee. Tall, scary, imposing and creepy. And not creepy as in ‚Äúhe held eye contact for too long‚Äù, creepy as in ‚Äúhe just made your skin crawl‚Äù. Lee walked into a room and people got quiet. He just made you quiet. Made you watch your words, stare at your shoes. If I was playing with his son aka my friend (I was like 10-12 back then) and Lee came in, we‚Äôd pretend like we were just watching TV in silence.   Lee was arrested circa 2010 for child molestation, child abuse, possession of CP and rape among other things. He had sexually abused one of his sons, his two daughters, his wife (who was allegedly unaware of the child abuse but I call bullshit) and was in possession of a huge library of CP he kept on hard drives in a locked shed in the back yard, where he had his own computer &amp; Internet set up. Oh and several other victims came forward.   My family has long since moved and haven‚Äôt spoken a word to anyone in that family since like 2013.   Lee‚Äôs son - the abused one - was just this last week arrested on possession of CP. He‚Äôs 31. Oh and Lee is due for release next year.   What a shit show. I‚Äôm so happy I never wanted to sleep over at that house.
398	1	my mom had an affair with my dad [SEP] 4 or something years ago my mother had an affair. it goes way deeper than that and if you know the story it would make it 5x worse but Id rather not delve into that right now. unfortunately, she somehow convinced him to stay with her and they didn‚Äôt divorce. growing up and realizing the severity of the situation really irks me, especially due to the fact that she is always asking for shit and she often has an attitude and tries to boss me around. I‚Äôm 18 now and it‚Äôs a joke to me, although i do feel bad when i give back an attitude because they don‚Äôt know why i am giving them an attitude. i think my dad is just overall unhappy and i can understand why and i just don‚Äôt think my mother deserves everything my father has done and is continuing doing for her. i wish he would just wake up one day and realize he is worth more than this. plus the obvious, every time she‚Äôs gone for longer than usual i assume the worst and i feel like i can‚Äôt even watch 5 minutes of tv without seeing something related to cheating and it‚Äôs fucking terrible especially when we all watch tv together. i don‚Äôt know what to do, i wish i could tell him to leave her but it was 4 years ago, and i know it would ruin the family and we wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to continue living in the home we live in right now. any comments would be appreciated and thank you if you read this far. sorry if this is hard to understand i wrote this at work and im not rereading it as i write. thank you, one love‚ù§Ô∏è

280	1	Costume ideas [SEP] Right so I‚Äôm going to one of those dress as the first letter of your name parties and need some ideas for H. Just letting you know I‚Äôm a guy.
651	1	Soon to ge divorced over an open marriage that was HIS idea [SEP] We've been married for 8 years, 4 of those our marriage was open. He proposed the idea with my work making it so that I travel alot, and the bedroom was lackluster.   At the start, slightly suspiciously, he had an immediate option who he started seeing immediately whereas I was still off on the idea.  Fast forward 2 years, his "option" was no longer available for one reason for another, and I had become a little more welcome to the idea.  Now today, he hasnt had much luck since and I have (once every other month) and wants to return back to a normal marriage but I really dont.  I understand that this will probably make me sound horrible and I accept that, but it works for me and my work and it keeps sex interesting, and, at least in my opinion, have noticed our bedroom life has improved.  But we've been having discussions and it looks like his mind is set on getting a divorce, I'm not really upset but I'm not unhappy either, more just numb and disappointed.
109	3	How to sue the governments of the world? [SEP] For enslaving us and making us human cattle. This is not a joke. I am not trolling. I am serious. I want to expose all the corrupt assholes and make them suffer.
202	2	Have you ever longed for something but know what it is? [SEP] Its hard to describe but its like this emptiness, it actually gives me a physical reaction. I dont know how exactly to explain the feeling but its there.
333	1	Boners [SEP] Getting exceptional fuel economy gives me a hard on. I just fixed my car and can‚Äôt wait to see the juicy juicy mileage!!!!!
381	1	Is this okay in my relationship or am I just being dramatic? [SEP] So, my girlfriend (20f) and I (21M) have been fighting. Tbh, I wouldn't call it fighting because we hear each other and try to find solutions to this issue. Well, we have been on a relationship for about a year and a half, and we almost never fight because we talk about it. But, recently, my girlfriend reconnected with a friend (lets call her D) that did her dirty, she got with my gf's ex gf, who was really toxic, cheated on them and a large list of other stuff. But, she apologized and everything according to her seems fine again. Now, it kind of bothers me because from what she's told me, she never really wasn't a great friend, she manipulated, controlled and hurt her, and from what my gf tells me, she doesn't seem to have changed in about two years now.   Well, reconnecting with her seems to have attracted her ex gf (lets call her B) and an another girl (C) that was interested in her just before meeting me, who she talked with for about the first three months of our relationship, knowing she wanted more. We talked about her too at that time, and she ended up cutting all ties so we continued. So, D uploaded a story on her ig with my gf, hanging out and then a day later, her B and C started following my gf's new ig. C even went out as sending her a DM on a Friday, probably drunk. My gf told me all this and I told her that I honestly was not fine with it and asked her to block C, which she did.  Now, my gf tells me she didn't do it before because she does this thing of just ignoring them, as they will just leave her be. She says she is tired of having to be the one that constantly puts up barriers for them not to approach. Even though I respect that, I wasn't really comfortable. The thing is, she only blocked C, and these three weeks I have been tired of seeing B's likes on every post my gf makes. So, two days ago I told her and she blocked her. The thing is, I don't think that I should even say it. She perfectly knows, for God's sake. Yesterday I was feeling pretty bummed out about everything and went out with my friends. Needless to say, I got reaaaally drunk. In my drunkenness, I told her that I also knew that she had been talking to B on the first month of our relationship and that shit really hurt. Mainly because it was a casual conversation with my gf just going with it, even as far as sending her videos of herself singing on Christmas Eve. That really hurt you know? It was the kind of thing at that time of "why with her but not with me?", but I never said anything. Now she just tells me she is sorry because at the time she didn't see it that way because she and B are completely over with just an amicable relationship. But, it really hurt, a year and a half later. Even though it's not resentment, just a 'why was I so dumb?' kind of thing. I mean, she fucking sent her ex videos of her singing whilst I was sending her photos of the Christmas dinner I had made for my family. Fuck, man.
712	2	In the live action Aladdin movie, the Genie‚Ä¶can murder people. [SEP] I‚Äôm high but   In the live action Aladdin film, the genie can kill people.   In the animated version he explicitly says he can‚Äôt kill.   In the live action, he never says that.   Within the canon, Aladdin could have wished Jafar dead and genie would have done it.
11	1	We are human after all [SEP] We can all fell down. When people are having there trouble in time, don‚Äôt panic. Only bad things comes when you panic and rush things. Remember to let things go and don‚Äôt look at to much at the bad things that has happened in life. Look forward and think of all good things that you have yet to see, hear, smell, taste and feel. Stay strong and be positive iven though it doesn‚Äôt feel like that. And if you want a change in life. No one can tell you to change you, only you can make that happen. I hope you all will continue waking up to a beautiful day, and if the day is not a good one. Remember there is always a tomorrow. Take care everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è
645	1	I (25M) can't help but feel like I gave away everything for the wrong reasons [SEP] Before I start, I do want to say that I have so much more on my mind that I also kind of want to get off my chest, but this initial post is just what is bothering me the most right now. I'm willing to answer any and all questions with more details (without giving out any personal details about me or anyone else of course) to make this make more sense if it doesn't. And to be honest, I encourage it. Talking about to anyone about my situation more might be just what I need right now.   Almost two years ago, I finally accomplished what my parents, family, and friends wanted for me for as long as I can remember. I finished my Master's in CS and became a software engineer, and landed a job at Fortune 500 company for my first role to boot.  Everything was perfect, except for the fact that my workplace was 700 miles away from where I'd lived my whole life. That didn't matter to me at the time, and it seems that if you asked anyone else, it shouldn't have. But over a year later, it also seems that money didn't solve any of the problems that it was supposed to. I live in a nice apartment, in a nice area, and I have the freedom to eat and/or do what I want, when I want. I get to support my family and spoil my friends back home when I wish. I accomplished the dreams of my high school self, and then some. But I am also more alone than I ever have been. And it has been tearing at my mind at various speeds. I've been taking measures to try and build any connections with anyone, but all I am doing is drowning is existential dread, frantically busying myself to try and run away from mentally accepting how useless I am socially. Throughout my high school and college years, I never really had "fun" the way other people did - no drinking, drugs, parties, relationships, hookups. I stayed away from all of that and focused hard on finishing school and landing a career, like all my elders and betters told me to do.  And now, I have no idea how to be "fun" like all the other adults around me seem to be. I walk around the city I live in, and I feel like an undersea rock with the ocean of people just moving around me. I have no idea what to do, and it seems that none of my friends and family, or even my therapist, knows what to do either. So now I'm just telling you, Reddit, in hopes that it will make me feel better. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.  TL;DR I put in the work and I'm now living  what should be the dream but I think all the stuff I missed out on is making life suck
77	1	Ego, greed, and hate. [SEP] With your ego, you have learned to judge yourself. With your greed, you have learned to seek better for yourself and others. With your hate, you have learned to defend yourself against lies. Everything you hate about yourself and other are tool in disguise. When you are ready, drop your tools, for you do not need them after your project is complete.

562	2	I don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve this? [SEP] Trigger warning: abuse, death   All my life I have been mentally and physically abused by my Autistic brother and I sometimes wish I was never born because it‚Äôs living hell. He thinks he can get away with it because he‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial‚Äù but i don‚Äôt care. he beats me and my entire family up. He‚Äôs threaten me.every time we call the cops he acts all nice and innocent and I‚Äôm sick of it. He‚Äôs ruined my childhood I‚Äôm almost an adult and I can‚Äôt help but to hate that he was born. I didn‚Äôt do anything to be in this situation and apart from that I get bullied for it. I sometimes want to run away and never come back I want is freedom. freedom from abuse but I know that day will never come.

Basically on the brink of a Children of Men apocalypse situation.

38	1	Hi, I'm just gonna start typing [SEP] we look out, and see the physical world, we look in, and see the mental world. in the middle we are, the connection between, looking away from what we're looking for. we stop looking and we start to see, we stop seeing when we start to look. we think when we're not moving, move when we're not thinking, to do things we stop doing things. to be, we stop being, as we become we start to be, and right as we clutch it we slip from what we were becoming to be, and we drop what we're trying to pick up from trying to pick up what we never dropped, we weren't watching when we seen it and we start to see that deja vu just as it's just leaving. c tions ::|(...wonder if we're wandering in circles from wondering if we wander in circles because we...)|:: conne c   i always liked making connections.

140	1	I Don‚Äôt Like Nicknames [SEP] Is anyone the same?  I have my reason which I won‚Äôt indulge because I‚Äôll be here forever - I just prefer my given name in conversation. The issue is, I‚Äôm surrounded by people who barely address me by my name, usually because they know it bothers me and like to do those things more to piss me off. It‚Äôs the same reason why I don‚Äôt share my dislikes or concerns with anyone anymore.   Am I alone here?

494	1	My moms boss manipulates my Mom but she can‚Äôt see it. [SEP] My mom works for a Care Company in the U.K. it‚Äôs small and she helped the boss set it up way back in the 2000‚Äôs (I remember being out delivering pamphlets).   My mom did as much as she did and has worked there pretty much ever since. My mom is a single woman, divorced and 55 y/o. My moms boss is slightly younger but married a richer guy with a building business. She constantly talks shit about her clients, her workers, lower economic classes (that we are) and even me.  She works my mom to the bone, my mom works over 40hrs a week and whenever someone calls in sick my mom covers because the elderly clients NEED CARE! But while this happens, her BOSS ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is at fucking CAT SHOWS or going on holidays every month!   Now, for any regular person they would just look for new jobs as my mom has over 10 years experience as a Carer. HOWEVER! Whenever my mom tries to leave, my moms boss invites her out for a day with one of the bosses friends and seemingly manipulates her into thinking they‚Äôre really good friends and then the cycle restarts.   I wish I knew how to show her how at least I see it, but venting her is as much as I can do.  I love my family, my mother. And I just don‚Äôt want her to keep being taken advantage of and hurt.
634	1	i think my mom is dead [SEP] i have been out with my friend all day. i haven‚Äôt heard from my mother in 8 hours which i find odd, because usually when i am out with friends she always texts me asking how everything is going and what-not. it is 9pm, almost 10, and she has not answered the door or my calls. i do not have a key. my mother also has cancer. she has been feeling sickish lately, but she seemed fine this morning. i called my dad and she wasn‚Äôt answering his calls, nor my grandfather‚Äôs calls. i am 15 years old. i‚Äôm scared and i don‚Äôt know what to do. my mother could be drop dead on the other side of this door and i can‚Äôt do anything. my father is on his way home but he‚Äôs stuck in traffic.

745	1	Someone must have accidentally made a spelling mistake in Braille before [SEP]
698	2	There are definitely countless emotions out there. Some branches of others. However you can‚Äôt imagine a new one until you have felt it.

Well, the racism goes through the entire franchise but I just saw the similarities lol
661	2	I feel like I should disappear. [SEP] When my dad passed away he made me promise I would take care of my family. I've been so depressed I have no motivation. I can't even complete the easiest of tasks. I can't even support myself anymore. Everyday I just feel worse and worse because I constantly need help from other people. Now I'm just a burden. I've dug such a deep hole, and I don't know how to get out.

456	1	Watching porn makes me jealous [SEP] I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) since this summer and he doesn‚Äôt want to have sex with me anymore.  Watching porn makes me feel insanely jealous of the people in it. I wish my bf would want me like that again. We had a physical relationship from the first date onward, but as fall and winter rolled on, he stopped initiating blowjobs or sex. When I‚Äôd try to initiate it by touching him, he swats my hand away. I hate to say this, but I‚Äôm out of my boyfriends league.. so i know it‚Äôs not because I lack ‚Äúthe goods‚Äù and he‚Äôs not out there with another hotter girl, but it messes with my head when he‚Äôs not interested in me sexually because it makes me feel unattractive or unwanted. He has medical issues that contribute to his low sex drive, but recently told me that it was a psychological issue and he didn‚Äôt know how to fix it.  I‚Äôm even more frustrated because I‚Äôve recently realized I love him and I don‚Äôt want to leave him because he doesn‚Äôt sleep with me, but I also don‚Äôt want to stay in an unsatisfying (sexually) relationship for years. I would also find it shitty if the genders were reversed and a dude dumped his girlfriend cause she didn‚Äôt put out enough.  I just missed being touched and feeling attractive and being close to him :( I can‚Äôt even masturbate because I just get irrational sad and a bit jealous that it‚Äôs not him and me
293	3	I don't know. [SEP] I feel as though I'm looking through a glass at times. I see everyone happy but I am digging myself into the ground.. I feel as if this might be close to my end or maybe a new beginning. I can not say for certain.
962	1	everyone have their own accent in sign language due to their fingerprints [SEP]
564	1	I don't know if I (F22) need to back off from my crush (M22) [SEP] There are sign he's into me. About 2 weeks ago, he asked if I was getting coffee while we left class together. I think it was an invite. But I was running late for my train and said I wasn't. I *think* he was going to ask if I wanted one with him.   A few days ago, he, myself and 2 other female classmates, were walking out of class together. He said "so what are you guys doing now?". No one responded. He looked right at me as he said it. He talks to those other 2 girls way more than me, so I figured the question was aimed at them, not me. I rarely talk to those girls, and my crush and I only started becoming friendly 2/3 weeks ago. So I said nothing. Maybe 10 minutes after parting ways, I said screw it and texted him to ask if he/the girls are having coffee as I fancied one before our next class. He texted back to say he wasn't having coffee and had just bought one and was in the library. Thing is, if he liked me, wouldn't he drop everything and come join me? I worry I've made it really obvious I want him and need to back off. That and the fact he catches me glancing at him so much. Though in my defense, I catch him looking over at me first almost as much.
329	1	How to Improve and Build Your Self Confidence [SEP]  Most people have experienced failure in one or more areas of their lives. Although failure is quite common, we have to learn to move on and do better by being more confident. Self-confidence is important because it is the foundation of all success and achievement.  How to become more confident:  Expose yourself to your fears regularly in order to expand your capabilities and your character. Doing something that you would consider challenging or confronting a fear, expands your self-worth and makes you more confident.  Most people try to avoid failure, even though it is the stepping stone to success. What you see as failure is actually valuable information and feedback that can teach you how to succeed.  Setbacks are opportunities for you to see your potential and empower you to make changes from the lessons you have learned.  Getting help from a trusted source like a coach, mentor, or leader can give you a different perspective on challenging situations and your capabilities.  Being empathetic and compassionate to yourself helps you to face cope with failure without shame.  Self-worth and self-compassion come from within so it is important to be a fan of yourself and affirm your capabilities by utilizing the power of I am.  Focus on what you are passionate about and challenge yourself to fulfill your deepest desires.  Although life can be unpredictable, you can always succeed by applying your life‚Äôs lesson, utilizing what resonates with you, letting go of what doesn‚Äôt and living your life by your design.

344	1	My parents were defending the Joe Rogan podcast WAY too vehemently [SEP] If you're here to defend Joe Rogan or complain about having no "freedom of speech" (which you do) don't bother. I'm not here to debate politics and you'd just be wasting both of our time.   My sister asked how long an episode of JRE is, and I told her not to listen to it (she didn't plan on it, she was just curious). And my mom stays on this tirade defending Joe Rogan. I mentioned how he's known for spreading misinformation,  and my mom basically went "but did he really?". I said something to the effect of "he sucks" and my dad asked me to elaborate. I admitted I didn't really know and that I'd research later (who wants to waste their time watching that garbage if they don't have to?),  but I'd heard he invites alt right people on. My mom responded "oh, he definitely does", and I said something like "oh, you just went and straight out admitted that".  They both went on a very loud and animated rant about freedom of speech and all that nonsense. I was kind of to shocked to respond,  but then my cousin showed up to visit and we moved on.  Her complete lack of hesitation just shocked me. Like, I always knew that my parents were kind of idiots and a bit conservative, but I guess I just didn't realize how far they were. I know that JR is watched by many people,  and there's a lot of stupid hateful people out there,  but I guess I just kind of assumed my parents wouldn't be,  you know? Like, I know these people. How can they fall for such an obvious hateful grift?  I did a bit of research, and yup, he's the terrible person I thought he was. I tried listening to a bit of his podcast (the one with Alex Jones, yuck) and it just sent me to a bad place being reminded that people like that exist. I have enough info to make a case now, but I couldn't talk in detail with someone because looking too deep into this stuff can be so revolting and messes with my head so bad.  I guess I'm here because realizing how deep in it my parents world just felt like a punch to the gut. This is a pretty messy post based off my terrible memory, so sorry for that. This isn't some life changing crisis like you see all over this sub, but I just don't know how to feel right now.
508	2	I'm only happy at work, and even that's no guarantee [SEP] 32M, single, no reason to be unhappy (knock on wood), but lately that's almost all I ever am, unless I'm busy at work.  This is nowhere near as bad as most of the shit people post on here, but I just felt the need to say it to someone, so apologies in advance.  My work is interesting and (usually) enjoyable, and in the past few years I've realized I'm happier there than I am at home.  But since I'm salaried, I don't put in any more hours than I need to, and all the while outside of work, I'm sad and listless with no reason to be.  And now, even *at* work, I've become irate and impatient with minute things...hell, just a few days ago I yelled at a coworker for something he had little control over, and though I apologized and he was cool about it, it's not a good sign.    Outside of work, I've noticed my friends are starting to distance themselves from me because of my unhappiness.  I got thrown out of my old D&amp;D group for being alternately angry and disengaged at the table, and I can't blame the DM one bit for that.  In case it's not obvious, I have chronic depression for which I take medication, and that usually works, but the past year or two has been a sad, angry slog for me, especially when I'm off work and have nothing to occupy my mind.  Sure, I have plenty of hobbies and whatnot, but most of those feel useless, like they're just a way to kill time until I work again.  I work out regularly, but that's just because of my fear of sickness and poor health.  It could be loneliness, but most of the time I don't even *want* to be around people.  I mostly just want to zone out with a cup of coffee and a hobby or something, even if that doesn't help break this monotony.  I spent time with my brother and our friends last night, and that was great, but by this afternoon I'm back to the same misery again.    And you know the worst part of it?  I *like* being miserable.  It feels like home.  How fucked up is that?  Right now I feel it physically, like there's this weight on my chest and waves of nausea coming from it.  I physically feel like I should be crying, but no tears have come-- just sighs and groans.  Maybe it's just a symptom of the world we live in.  Who knows.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist this week, but I just had to say this somewhere beforehand, if only to make sure I don't forget that I'm unhappy right before the appointment, which is pretty common.  I don't want to burden my friends or family with this, but I figure a couple of internet strangers who'll probably just tell me to make my bed and work out more, are as good an audience as I'm going to get.

576	1	I'm done with dating until all y'all single people out there get some therapy [SEP] Look, the past 2 years have been hard. They've been difficult to endure - especially for single people. We've been isolated so much more than most people with families at home and it's hard getting back out and trying to carve a path torward some normalcy.   But mental health is as much of an importance as physical health. A lof of us gained some weight and are now getting back and working that off and choosing a healthier lifestyle. Some of us spent the extra time the past few years to get on that train. Online therapy became mainstream, and a lot of people took part in some of those programs. And it helped get some people the push, motivation, and focus they needed.   Most people, though, checked out mentally and haven't checked back in. And it is noticeable.  GET SOME THERAPY, PEOPLE. Your mental health has declined, and it's not cool to ignore that.

231	1	What's the secret to a promotion? What do you talk about in your 1-on-1's? [SEP] I'm about to enter a new career opportunity soon, but before I do, I wanted to give my current industry one more shot. So even though I have a job lined up a couple months from now, I thought I would take the remaining time I have left to eek out a job hop. That being said, while it's unlikely that I would get promoted in such a short amount of time, I've always had a natural knack and inclination for knowing right away once I do the job if I would like it, has promotion material and upward social mobility. The reason I know this is because of the on-boarding process. If the role or opportunity can't even on-board you properly, and it's just a go shadow this employee, that employee, you can generally assume that your role is simple-minded and not challenging. This has been my experience.      That being said, what is the secret to getting promotions and moving up the social corporate ladder? is it a combination of many factors? Such as excelling in your role, but also utilizing the 1-on-1's with your manager to let them know? I've always thought that if they wanted to promote me, they should come find me. But I was speaking to a former mentor, and she mentioned one of the ways that she was quickly able to get a promotion almost yearly was to right away make a 30-60-90 day game plan with her supervisor/director and talk about the things necessary she needed to learn, build, so that she could approach that next level.      it didn't even occur to me that 1-on-1's were utilized in this way, but now that I think about it, it does seem smart. Many of my 1-on-1's were used to talk about my feelings, a recap of what I did that week, and things I want to do. But never once did I mention that I wanted to be promoted. Was this my mistake?

And sometimes feel things are too good to be true.    How do you cope with the thoughts? How do you just simply LIVE?

430	2	I Want to Give Up on My Career Search [SEP] I just got my Master's. You would think I would be excited, but I'm not. Since undergrad, I've been career searching. It's rejection after rejection after rejection. I was bait-and-switched once. Then I had an interview recently where I finally seemed like the sure-shot. Didn't get it, sobbed for an hour or two about it.  I just have no more energy to do this search. I lose my insurance in a few months, now I'm even more scared. I want to move, but I can't do it because I work 2 part-time jobs and make barely anything from either. I want to work remotely, but the remote jobs I find usually are contract or freelance or I'm not qualified for.  I've spoken to a career coach and a career counselor. I've exhausted all my connections, my friends' connections, my parents' connections. I go to networking events, I hired a resume writer, I job shadowed, I interned, I rewrote my cover letters, I freelanced. I started therapy. I lowered my standards. I passed all my classes, 80% of them with A's. And nothing. Fucking NOTHING. How do people get jobs right out of college? How do people get offers? I can't even get companies to respond to me, much less listen to me, interview me, offer me anything. I was a model student in undergrad and in my Master's and I have nothing to look forward to or work for.   It sucks. My friends are going and living their lives because they have money, and I can't. My BF moved and is traveling because work allows him to do both, and I can't go live with him because I have no income of my own (my choice, I want to be able to support the home and pay the bills too). I feel alone and lost.  Why won't anyone hire me? Why am I not good enough?  I can't do this search anymore. Why should I? Why should I rev myself up and continue to apply every day when I know that I will be rejected or ghosted? Everyone is saying to "not give up", "keep trying", "don't lose hope". It's so easy for them to say that when they have job security and a consistent paycheck.  I don't even want to attend my grad ceremony. Why should I celebrate having nothing to go into?   I'm sorry, but I feel so alone in this.

118	3	This doesn‚Äôt feel like the same world as my childhood. [SEP] I look around myself, the blue sky, the red light, the people walking. I look within myself. Completely different‚Ä¶ forever different. It seems as though I was spawned into this body and given fake memories. Did those events actually take place? Are the events taking place now real or just implanted memories? Why was I so different? Where did all that time go? Why can‚Äôt I go back to the past just once?   Will these days eventually feel the same?  When will my body be at peace? Or are there too many experiences out there to make that possible. It starts as something you think is insignificant but as everything expands upon itself and as you lack other experiences it surrounds all of your world. Then as time passes what you thought was important then disappears as other experiences crowd around you eventually they become important. Cycle continues. But what‚Äôs the most important?Will I ever find it? Or will my life just be another tragedy?

[SEP] My birthday today, 21 years of age and I just wanted to share some accomplishments that I can't/won't share with my friends or family because of the sensitivity of the topic and I hate to 'brag' (even tho I'm proud of myself). But anonymous people on the internet don't really give a shit so I can vent in peace.  As of today:  Beat depression.  Beating anxiety.  Beat my eating disorders.  Beating body dysmorphia.  Happy long term committed relationship.  More money in thousands than years I've been alive.  Cut off every toxic person in my family/friends group.  On track to get my degree.   Own and paid for my own (third) car.   Thanks for reading.
95	1	What makes someone a bad person? [SEP] At what point is someone actually a bad person? Everyone does bad things, makes mistakes, learns and grows. Even if you hurt people, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make you a bad person. So what truly makes someone a bad person?
36	2	I Wish It was like this... [SEP] I Wish that in this World everyone  was natturaly from beggining of life been rich and have everything. Can u just imagine life how much positive could that make happen and how much difference will it been if it was like that from now?  Single and most important thing that could happen Is  Money is not gonna decide Who you love or who you choose to live ur entire life with (im not saying everyone is choosing there partner in this world based on how much money they got but huge population is ls like that, id say 80% or more population around the world is like that)  Thats the most important thing that would happen if it was just how i said.  Why is that, that this days Money chooses our partner but not our fckin feelings. World is fcked up right now:)))

452	1	My ex only wants me to hook up with me. [SEP] So I‚Äôll keep this as short and sweet as possible. My ex told me he doesn‚Äôt wanna date me for multiple excuses that are really stupid (like I want my own place first - he‚Äôs never lived on his own and dated multiple women living at home and even has a child with his ex before me - she‚Äôs a lesbian now - which I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm not a homophobe - just wanted to point that out cause she‚Äôs also engaged to be married so I‚Äôm not threatened by her or any of his other exs if I‚Äôm honest). We get along well I guess. He‚Äôs not a mean person, hes helped me through recent medical issues (like talk through them not actually help) and we talk daily. He tells me I‚Äôm beautiful and have a nice body and the best breasts he‚Äôs ever seen (I don‚Äôt believe that for a second lol üòÇ)   But he only wants to hook up. I got upset cause I told him he was only thinking this way cause he‚Äôs too lazy to go out and meet someone new. I mean he isn‚Äôt lazy (he works a lot) and I didn‚Äôt mean it that way, I meant more that he didn‚Äôt wanna take the time to meet someone new and try and form a bond with them. And he knew that‚Äôs what I meant.   But he says I‚Äôm a jerk cause if he loves my body and likes me (won‚Äôt even say he loves me) that it‚Äôs not an issue and I should go along with it. I‚Äôm scared to catch feelings and be in a catch 22. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like a jerk because I want companionship but I also don‚Äôt wanna stoop to that level. And maybe he has a valid point cause I‚Äôm not interested in meeting someone new right now. But I‚Äôm also trying to work on my mental health and I don‚Äôt think this would be beneficial. But I also have a lot of self respect. I also might mean because he didn‚Äôt like my response and said I was being overly sensitive and moody and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. That I‚Äôm blowing things and making them bigger than they need to be.   -also, I wish this was made up, but this story is 100 percent true. Only my life, lol-   Thanks for letting me get that off my chest. My parents and family hate him (he wasn‚Äôt always the nicest and hurt me bad - was a terrible boyfriend and bailed on me countless times, borrowed money, etc / the list is too long). Idk what to do cause I don‚Äôt wanna degrade myself but I‚Äôm also lonely. I‚Äôm not one to sleep around or sleep with anyone.
455	1	I just want someone to talk too. [SEP] On mobile yada yada..  After having 2 strokes before Christmas my grandad died last month. He died on the 15th and because of the crematorium being so busy his funeral wasn't until the 8th of March.   When he first died I just felt numb and in shock. He had been put on end of life care so it wasn't sudden or unexpected. I also felt relieved because he wasn't suffering anymore.   I couldn't cry at the time, I was sad about it of course. But no tears. I kept expecting them to come but they didn't. At his funeral I did shed a few tears in the church and in the crematorium.   Finally after almost a month it has sunk in that I'll never see him again. I'll never speak to him again. And it just hurts. I miss him, despite the fact that before he was ill, I didn't speak to him every day or see him very often. But he was always there if I needed him. When I was in highschool whenever it rained he would call and offer me and my sister a lift to school, so we didn't have to walk in the rain. Despite the fact he might lose his parking space outside his house, which was his biggest pet peeve.   I just wish I had someone to talk to right but because it's after midnight right now. All my friends and family are asleep.

592	1	Falling for straight guy is painfull [SEP] It hurts. It really fucking hurts. When i fell for him It was dreamy thoughts, maladaptive Daydreaming and dreams. I Created a whole imagination in my head. I fell in love.. deeep love. Read a qoute that said if you have a crush on someone and it lasts for Six months, its love.    Honestly, i never expressed my feelings for him  i never met him . I just saw him. A year later a heartbreak happened when he got married. It devastated me to the core of my spine. Chills ran down when i saw his wedding from afar. He  was sitting with his wife. In a groom and she had a beautifull dress. I fuckin hated her so much!. I want to ruin his marraige . I have active thoughts about forcing him to love me or forcing sex on him. I was a swer innocent boy who turned into a monster. I have not hurt him because i love him.. but since i am a imaginative person i imagine whole revenge.     There is also alot of age difference between me and him i am a young boy and he is near 37. A daddy!. I imagined all the sex, all the grabbing and all the flirting with him resulting him be being my boyfriend and giving me love and bying me gifts. I tend to fall for older men alot. Its my thing. Hot daddies are my type. But i realized that I damaged myself. I cannot control my thoughts of hurting him and all the sexual forcing ... any advice? No matter how much i try i always imagine him. I can"t control my imagination and thoughts they are automatic and very intrusive.    My obsession is so worse that lets say i have a crush on a guy and I express my feelings and he rolls his eyes.. It hurts my ego. I cant control the humiliation. I imagine hurting him , how dare he rolled his eyes at me ..   I am joining MMA for my anger issues and become a better man. I want to protect myself and others but my ego has different sides ... the love ego is the most dangerous one. I just IMAGINE. Even if i imagine i know i wont ra*pe anyone or hurt because I am a good guy i know i am a good guy.. but when jealousy and ego takes over imagine hurtint the man i love because he married someone. He couldve been my bf.   Any advice?
436	1	I want so badly to go sign with friends at karaoke but I'm afraid they've all outgrown it. [SEP] My friends group is all in 30's now, and we used to be a much more lively bunch in our 20's. We used to be raucous loud, get drunk and stupid and just have a good time (all the above, without being annoying to others... we're good like that).  I miss it. It seems we've all gotten more "mature" which isn't bad, but, I feel it's taken away some of the fun we used to have, one thing we always loved in particular is karaoke.   These days if I bring it up, the idea gets shot down. It's just not an option for them now.  Anyway, I miss it. Wish I could still do it, but, my SO and my friends are all over it. And being a 30 yo dude going karaoke by myself is just so... lonely.
193	1	Self-righteousness VS minding others‚Äô business [SEP] Quite often I‚Äôve seen people who EXCESSIVELY calling out/telling strangers in public ‚Äúyou‚Äôre breaking the rules‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre breaking the law‚Äù on small things like  - order people to give up their seats to some more obviously disabled person, without understanding he/she might have less obvious of legitimate reasons (women on a period, have chronic condition that prevents them from standing for prolonged time) - honking people for parking at disabled parking spot, without trying to confirm if they actually have the permit displayed   I‚Äôm interested to know: why? Shouldn‚Äôt you just mind your own business?  Interested to hear your thoughts. Thanks

335	1	I have pancreatitis and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to die at 15 years old. [SEP] I‚Äôm 15 years old, and last week I went to the hospital only to find I have pancreatitis. What‚Äôs worse is that they‚Äôre still looking to find the cause, as they ruled out all common things. I came back home only today because I thought I was better and the pain was gone, but it‚Äôs back, I‚Äôm struggling to sleep, my back hurts a lot, and I‚Äôm wondering when it will end.  I‚Äôve had it for about 3-4 weeks now, and it got worse over the months, calmed down the last few days in the hospital and has now come back as this disturbing and unsettling pain in my back and stomach. Because I felt more pain, I searched up what the odds are of people dying by this and i found a couple of answers, ranging from 10-20% or 13-30%. I know the figures could be a lot worse but they‚Äôre not necessarily low and I‚Äôm freaking out whether this is it for me.  I don‚Äôt really want to go back to the hospital after the drinking they made me do and how boring it is but I don‚Äôt think I have a choice. I get homesick after a week or so too. I also found out that it can cause sudden death as well, and all of the figures scare me. I have coursework to do for school too and I‚Äôm stressing out over that. I just want someone to hold me and say that I‚Äôm not going to die, and that I‚Äôll have a successful future.   This pain at the moment is stopping me from sleeping, sitting comfortably in any position, and it‚Äôs decreasing my appetite for food. I hardly ate anything today, and if I carries on it could lead to weight loss which is another symptom. I‚Äôm already fit, if not thin. Does anyone know if there‚Äôs ANYTHING I can do to stop this or slow it down? Anything will do.   The worst part about This is that because they haven‚Äôt found a cause, it could come back again on the future‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt want to relive this agony. Thank you to anyone that‚Äôs read this.
399	1	i hate my little brother [SEP] i despise him. he's done nothing but terrorize my family since we adopted him. he bit my mom today. he climbed on top of her car and threw branches at her and called her names. he wrecked the living room. he sprayed the hose into our chimney. he held a utility knife and then later a fork t\]up to mom and almost stabbed me with the same fork. he's cussing.   &amp;#x200B;  HES 11.  &amp;#x200B;  biologically, he's my cousin's kid, but she decided to leave two of her kids with her baby daddy and fucked right off to have another, and now i have two little brothers i never asked for. the eldest of the three lived with us for a bit too but was taken away because he assaulted me, physically and sexually. i was 10. the little shit in question was 8. i was a big kid, sure, but most of my weight was fat and i wasn't strong enough to push him off. my mom still takes my brothers to see him sometimes.   j, the 11 year old, is actually almost 12. he's done most of his physical abuse to my mom, but i got my fair share too. but verbal abuse? everyone but my step mom has gotten their share.  and i know, it's stupid and cowardly of me to be a bit threatened by a tiny little middle schooler as a 17 year old (well, 17 in the summer) but he's demonic. he broke his own door. he's climbed out his window because he wasn't allowed to have pickles after dinner.   i hear him and my mom yelling at each other now.   &amp;#x200B;  he's pissed all over the bathroom cause he was mad before too. he needs inpatient psychiatric care or something. my mental health is at an all time low.   &amp;#x200B;  as i was writing this, i heard more noises and left my room to see what was going on. it was chaos. i won't go into detail but it was bad enough that i was panic-calling my stepmom. they are going to try and find help for him i think.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm exhausted and i'm gonna go cry some more.  goodnight
24	2	I wish I was special [SEP] In my 17 years on this Earth I have become exceedingly aware of the fact that I am bland. I am sub par at most things, it seems, and I can't fathom a life in which I truly achieve anything that is slightly captivating. And I know that my mindset is unhealthy. It has become this sort of self fulfilling prophecy, but even with this insight about myself I can't seem to rid myself of it.  I will never be someone truly impacting, in any positive way. I feel powerless to a great extent, because there are so many people that follow the same path that I am following. Most of us are mediocre. Most of use subscribe to decency, and it isn't necessarily a bad thing for a large portion. For many of us that is what our capabilities allow for us to do, but I don't think I could be content with it.   And I know this sound so vague and melodramatic; basically the exact thing that would come out of any teens mouth, who hasn't seen the true realities of the world, but I want so badly to change the world. I want to be a true altruist. I don't want to be this selfish, nasty person. I don't want to devote my life to mediocrity, but it feels as though my mind is predetermined. It is all so indomitable. I can't stop myself from giving into to this sense of certainty of failure, and it is going to inevitably lead me down a depressing road. It feels like I am not the driver of my own life. I am just a passenger frantically hoping that the driver doesn't decide to run us off a cliff.   Maybe it is selfish of me to want these things. I don't have a clue about what I actually want to do. My discontent with myself has lead me to a state of apathy. I truly don't know if I even want to go to college, but if I don't go there are no other options for me. I don't have any special gifts. I don't have what it takes to pursue a bohemian lifestyle. It just isn't me. I am a conventional person when it comes to careers, and so I have to go to college. I have done career tests. I have really sat down, and thought for hours at a time about possible career paths, but they all leave me feeling dissatisfied. There is nothing that I feel passionate about. And again, maybe that does stem from selfishness. I should be content with my life. I shouldn't want more, especially when I am not deserving of it.
286	2	Life is going downhill [SEP] I just turned 18 not to long ago and so far it‚Äôs going like shit. I‚Äôm trying to turn my life around and start building myself but everything keeps going wrong. Before I couldn‚Äôt give more of a fuck about my life. I would smoke on the regular, party everyday and just going with the flow. I would tell myself Whatever happens, happens. Now I‚Äôm just trying to change n better myself but I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm just trying to find a job that pays well but I don‚Äôt have a car to get anywhere as I‚Äôm not able to because of my charges in the past. I‚Äôm just really confused and lost right now but I‚Äôm not going to give up this easy. Hopefully sometime in the future I can land my self a job and Try to get a car if possible.
905	1	When you are young you see the 20$ as too much. When you are old you see the 200$ as nothing. [SEP]
570	1	I‚Äôm intimidated by successful women [SEP] Call me sexist/misogynist if you want. It‚Äôs just I‚Äôm always blown back by how much girls and women are achieving nowadays. They‚Äôre outperforming men in their 20s by many standards and have been doing better than boys in school by most accounts.   As a man, there‚Äôs always this feeling of expectation I feel around them. Like, even being in the presence of a successful woman means I have to think and act a certain way to be respectful and understand her. I don‚Äôt particularly find it like I‚Äôm being attacked when I see female lawyers, doctors, politicians , but there‚Äôs this air of respect and power they command.   ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mansplain. Don‚Äôt be a misogynist. Don‚Äôt hurt her. Don‚Äôt make her uncomfortable. Don‚Äôt make her feel belittled, etc.‚Äù   It all just becomes too much.

295	1	Yerkes‚ÄìDodson law [SEP] We are used to a simple thought that motivation helps us accomplish all the tasks. The more motivation, the better. If someone is not able to solve a problem ‚Äì they just need more motivation. But excess of motivation may backfire. Overmotivated people, in general, achieve less than people with an average level of motivation.  Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson, in 1908, discovered that overmotivated animals (they were stimulated by electricity) showed poorer results in solving the simple logical tasks such as finding the way out of labyrinth than animals that were stimulated mildly. The reason was simple ‚Äì they were too nervous.  I can see it often while helping people build their new life strategies. Some of them are very motivated, some of the latter ‚Äì too much motivated. Motivation consists of two basic components ‚Äì desire and fear. If we want to gain something (desire) we are afraid of not getting it at the same time (fear). When the latter overweighs, we get negative results.  If one wants something ‚Äì a new job, excellent marks, promotion ‚Äì too strongly, it prevents them from acting logically and calmly. The likelihood of making mistakes increase dramatically, and the result might be quite the opposite of the desired one.   In such cases, cognitive-behavioral psychology recommends writing everything on paper ‚Äì all your desires and fears, and to analyze them thoroughly. If you do it in proper conditions ‚Äì when you have enough time and not being disturbed, you can balance desires and fears. And, that is, to gain an optimal level of motivation.   Sometimes an excess of motivation is worse than the lack of it. Do not forget to subscribe to this page to read articles about life strategy regularly.
757	1	Passing cars is safer than being passed by potentially poor drivers. [SEP]
86	2	If I had a good amount of money I‚Äôll be able to live a good life [SEP] Life is just unfair but at the same time you can‚Äôt expect everything to go smooth and perfect, we don‚Äôt live in a flawless world.  Many Rich people get richer, and poor people get poorer. There‚Äôs no economical balance. In some areas people are starving and in some other nearby areas people live in the pinnacle of luxury.  I know if the world‚Äôs wealth was distributed fairly, everyone would live a fulfilling life. But let‚Äôs face reality, we don‚Äôt live in a perfect world.   Just my thought.
39	1	Our government cut access to Facebook and Telegram few days ago. This seems like the place to share it. [SEP]    So true story time, my country Ethiopia is currently in something of a civil/ethnic war. And recently the rebel forces (the former government who ceded power or got overthrown (rebel group a), working with another rebel group (rebel group B) who they had fought and kicked out the country while they were in power, and rebel group B having returned after being given amnesty by the current government, who they are now rebelling against). So anywhoooo, after a year or two of some slight warring and light genocide (where the gov and rebels blame eachother for) rebel group A and B have now taken some city or cities near the capital, and fb had been on fire with information and misinformation, so now here we are.  Also, that was me trying to keep the story simple. It gets even more convoluted if I go farther
417	3	Fuck Australia [SEP] Why does everyone want to come here? I hate it here. Why does every public institution have the word "royal" in its name, and a crown in its logo? This isn't a part of Britain, last time I checked. If the Queen was in this room, I'd fucking kill her. How come she gets paid ¬£100,000,000 every year for doing nothing, when there are so many homeless, suffering people around?   How come it's illegal to do anything fun here? Everything's buried under licenses and paperwork and stupid bullshit that nobody needs. Laws that restrict how people live their lives.   All people are supposed to do here is get a job, become some stupid yellow-jacket wearing asshole who fixes people's pipes all day, live in a featureless boring brown house with a grey roof and a little patch of lawn out the front, drive their shitty Holden car to get drunk at a pub and watch some stupid assholes kick a ball around, then repeat that every day.   I hate people here. I hate how they talk. Why do they talk like that? Why do they act like that, and look like that, and dress like that? Why do they think I'm weird, and treat me differently when I don't do the same? Fuck you. I can do whatever the fuck I want, actually. Fuck everyone here. Why do I live in this place?  If I left here, I wouldn't care if the entire population died, brutally. Nuke the fucking place, for all I care. Burn it down, kill all the koalas, I don't give a fuck. Fuck you.
268	1	No matter how hard life gets, it‚Äôs still a part of Life. Just try ur best and move forward. It‚Äôll all make sense in the end [SEP] If it doesn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs okay. Learn to accept everything as it is. Life is beautiful if u accept everything and flow with it.
886	1	Whatever finger has a ring on it becomes the ring finger [SEP]
26	3	It's all about the hands [SEP] I have this analogy I use that compares life to our hand use. There are those who live life with their palms up and beg for things to be placed in their hands, what they end up with are immaterial and useless. AND then there are those who grab for things rather than beg. They will cut their fingers as they proceed with this lifestyle, but they callas up the wounds and continue to grab. What they are left with is a treasure of tangibles and intangibles. Both people are given the same external opportunities, but only a few choose to grab.
729	2	Children are a reflection of inescapable hypocrites [SEP]
470	2	I genuinely have no one to blame but myself [SEP] I have fucked up to an extent that is so beyond me with so many people in my life. No one wants me. No one wants to love me. The people I want and have had, I have ruined to such a point they will never want to come back to me. IT is my fault. I have my issues and I am in therapy. I went to rehab and am working on myself but wow, no one tells you that it is so hard when you go and get out with loads of understood trauma that you need to navigate. I totally understand why they don't want you dating the first year. I haven't been, but I miss people that were there in moments, that I pushed so far away.      I never think anyone wants me. I thought I was a big part of someones life for four years, only for them to vehemently deny my existence to me and everyone they know. MY world turned upside down. My mom has disposed of me for differing views, saying treatment and therapy didn't work.      I am the product of outside actions but I haven't taken responsibility for my actions as an adult, caused by trauma or not, I've sucked the soul out of potential partners thinking they don't actually care about me, or think I exist. I've said the meanest things to people because I don't actually think they are there.     I wish people knew how sorry I was and how many regrets I had for treating them that way and reacting in the way I did. I just wish someone wanted me. I wish someone knew I wasn't permanently so horrible and that I am improving.  &amp;#x200B;  I am truly only to blame for being this alone and isolated in life. I have friends, just not love interests. I hope it all passes and I can raise my daughter to see what a healthy relationship looks like.
262	1	Feeling confident as shit right now [SEP] I never feel confident. Never. Today, I feel like I KO'd Mike Tyson. I feel like I outran Usain Bolt. The reason? I have a date tomorrow evening. A date, with a beautiful girl. I'm talking out-of-my-league beautiful. And the coolest part? She likes me back! She even thinks that I'm handsome! I'm walking on the damn moon right now, NOTHING can knock me down.
117	1	Waiting for something good is a waste of time [SEP] I‚Äôve spent the last five/six years hoping ¬´next year will be better¬ª. But i did nothing to make sure of it. I realized late last year that if i want life to be better i gotta make it better myself.   Happiness rarely knocks on your door, go out and find it!
380	1	My father ruined my life [SEP] NSFW for obvious reasons, I apologize for the sensitive material and any formatting issues. This is my first time posting to Reddit.     I was taken advantage of by my father when I was a toddler, and its ruined my entire life. I was suicidal for years, attempting several times to kill myself. He was a horrible, abusive man and destroyed my self esteem.     And the worst part of all, my family still defends him even after I opened up about what happened. It makes me depressed, waking up and realizing he will never face any form of punishment for what he did.     Thank you everyone who takes the time to read this, I needed a place to get this off of my chest.

555	2	My step mom and maid are freaks [SEP] I (16M) was born in a Islamic family but didn't get circumcised during childhood but about 14 days ago ,my step mom caught me watching porn and Jenking  offand told my father  got beaten by both of them and they got me circumcised so that I don't make more sins . After some days I told step mom that I would file a case against them for non consensual circumsion, she called out our maid and they both overpowered me and tied to the bed, she squeezed my private part and scared me that she would twist my balls, and said that  I should submit myself to them , I did  as I was scared and she collected sperm and blackmailed me that she is  giving this to the maid and if I register a police case she will use that as evidence of me trying to ra*e the maid and police will send me to remand home. I started crying and she said that I will get more punishment for jerkiing of as that Is a sin, she put anklets and painted my nails and made me feminine and said that whenever she or the maid asks I should kiss their feet or lick it, I am dead inside cannot do anything .father supports her decision and they justify it as by being humiliated I will become humble and won't sin anymore, my pp already hurts due to surgery and the maid pinches it and gives me bruises, what can I do help?.
493	2	I fucking hate the duolingo aesthetic. [SEP] This is a completely irrelevant opinion but I really have to get it off my chest. You have no idea how much the duolingo aesthetic pisses me off. It makes me rage every time I open the app to the point where I've associated learning a new language with the fiery rage of a thousand Rosie O'Donnells. The stupid little characters with their purple hair and bad haircuts are ugly, their smug little smirks are ugly, their annoying fucking dances are ugly, everything about that app makes me lament every event in the universe that led to duolingo being created. Who thought this would encourage users to keep using duolingo? I can no longer bear it. I'd rather die an ignorant fucker than take another duolingo lesson.   so if you have a good way to learn japanese that'd be neat

337	2	If you drive an oversized truck for no reason, I already dislike you. [SEP] This is especially true if you have no other reason or purpose of owning one but just to have one. If you live in an urban area, an apartment complex, single, have no kids, or has no need for a bigger vehicle. I see it all the time, I feel like it‚Äôs all the same kind of people, who likes to take up more than 1 parking space, or could never park it properly cuz the monster is just too big, or they like to think they‚Äôre the king of the road and drive recklessly. It is incredibly annoying!
694	1	If you are born in a car then the song playing on the radio is technically your intro song [SEP]
349	2	I feel like I've ruined my body (by getting fat) [SEP] btw I know this isn't as bad as other peoples situations but I still want to get this off my chest.  so around 3 years ago I was pretty fit, muscular and good looking, I could even run 10 miles if I pushed myself but at some point I decided to take a break to work on other skills but covid hit and I couldn't go to the gym anymore so I fell into a habit, so I went from visiting the gym 5 times a week to sitting at home constantly plus I started binge eating from boredom which only made things worse.  once covid ended I tried going to the gym again but I could barely lift any weight and had lost all my progress, it also didn't help how self conscious I felt since I knew everyone there and my friends kept making jokes about my weight so I decided to stop going.  After that I just ignored my weight while my habits got worse but today I stepped on a scale and Ive put on so much weight so I went from 60kg - 127kg. Now none of my cloths fit, Im covered in strech marks, I cant stand physical activity and Im almost constantly eating something.  I just feel disgusted in myself at times and other times I just don't care like yesterday had just finished my second pizza when I realized what I had done or when I ask my friends for help losing weight they brush it off saying im not that fat.  Im not asking for sympathy I just wanted to get my frustration off my chest.
438	1	success [SEP] I have a deep intuition I am going to be very successful in life, because of my personality, hardwork and vision in life. I came here as a refugee in 2015, I have been through alot and still going through alot right now but my problems are just minor financial fixes, I have great plans and business ideas but lack the funds to bankroll my plans. I have a janitorial business I just build from the ground all by myself its lucrative but I'm limited by lack of proper equipment and proper connects. I am working on everything I can control but sometimes I wish I had some of the privilege my friends have, they have all the resources I'm looking for and they don't even recognize it.

492	1	i sent this text to my roommate after i moved out [SEP] i just got out of a pretty terrible roommate situation. it was my first time living with roommates and definitely ruined the experience for me lol. for some context‚Ä¶ i lived with a couple and the girl in the relationship was very controlling and disrespectful of me as a roommate. i was initially paying half the rent because she told me her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt going to be there full time (which he was). when i asked about it she told me i was wrong in asking for less than half, but she did change it after a few months. they would fight downstairs, take up the kitchen and living room every night, get upset when i had people over, and she was just very controlling in general. i was a very clean, kind and respectful roommate, despite all of this. my name wasn‚Äôt on the lease so i knew if i did anything to bother her she could just give me a 30 days notice. which, she ended up doing. the lease was coming to an end and the plan was to have me take over the lease, and find a new roommate. they are moving out of the county for college and weren‚Äôt planning on staying in the apartment. but 46 days before the lease was intended to be renewed by me, she gave me my 30 days notice in a very professional and uncaring text message from the other room. she initially told me it was nothing about me, just that they decided on renewing the lease themselves and ‚Äúthought it would be a good time for me since i was looking around at apartments anyways.‚Äù this made no sense since just a week prior we had discussed transitioning me over to be on the lease. i also new that likely she was angry at me for having a friend over the night prior, and didn‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore. later, they told me that the reason they gave me the 30 days notice was because i was simply a difficult roommate to live with. this was pretty infuriating because i did everything i could to be respectful and kind. they basically just called me out for things they were hypocritically annoyed by, like forgetting to lock the door on occasion and leaving my clothes in the dryer for a day. things we all have done at some point, and they generally more often than me. i later found out that they still chose to leave the apartment and not renew the lease. so they made me live 16 days before the lease ended, and too away the living situation for me. this is the text i ended up sending.   ‚Äúi am aware that you are moving out and not renewing the lease, contrary to what you told me.   i want to express that i feel deeply and genuinely hurt by you and our time living together. i debated sending any sort of text, but came to the conclusion that getting my thoughts out may help me release the anger i feel.   from very early on in our time living together, i realized that dealing with any conflict with you would not be easy. i saw that you didn‚Äôt mind lying to me and manipulating me if it benefitted you. i saw that you didn‚Äôt care to empathize with me, and definitely didn‚Äôt respect or value me as someone equal to yourself.  at that point, i didn‚Äôt care to foster any sort of relationship with you outside of us living together. i should have moved out then.  i didn‚Äôt realize just how selfish you would be in the last days of our living together. you lied to my face and told me you were renewing the lease. you made me move out of the place i had lived in for nearly a year. my friends and family had to take time out of their lives to help me. it caused an immense amount of stress for me and affected my mental health. and you did all of this for the difference of us living together for 16 days. you took away a living situation for me because you could. you turned a huge part of my life upside down because you could. you made a rash and petty decision that stemmed from anger, and it affected me greatly. to be honest, the decision you made is shockingly selfish.   i‚Äôm saddened by the way you treated me. but i have to say, i know it all too well. living with you was eerily similar to living with my mom growing up. my mom is someone who i always have to keep at arms distance because of her emotional instability. i see a lot of similarities in the way you treated me, as well as the way i witnessed you treat (boyfriends name). she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder two years ago. for the sake of yourself and your relationships, i would recommend you look into BPD and consult with a therapist.   lastly, i am deeply happy to report that good things do come from bad situations. because you made a vindictive decision that uprooted a large portion of my life, i now get to live alone in (new city name). i now have the ability to walk to one of (new city name‚Äôs) many beautiful coves in a quick five minutes. i am so grateful to be living here. and i will be taking the last ten months of my life and learning from it. i plan to grow in numerous ways and expand who i am as a person.   i sincerely hope that you learn to treat others better. i wish the best for a version of you that may potentially exist after a lot of self reflection and change.‚Äù  i know my text wasn‚Äôt the most mature way of handling the situation. i don‚Äôt really care. i am grateful to be moving forward and that i will never have to deal with her again!!

And Why?  1) Still try to fulfil your lifedream that you already try to fulfil for almost 8 years, but still have no opportunity?  OR  2) Go to a back up plan and do something else totally differently where you have tons of opportunities but its all completely new? Into the unknown.
532	3	I can't stand being ignored [SEP] It drives me up the fucking wall. Whenever someone ignores what I've said or texted or posted I feel this intense almost homicidal rage well up inside me and I just want to smash something. IT's all-consuming. It doesn't matter if five people in a room are paying attention to me or acknowledging what I say, if even one of them is blatantly ignoring or disregarding me I just want to grab them and smash their face through a wall. It's insane how much this gets under my skin.

544	3	I'm starting to truly dislike women. [SEP] Throwaway because I know I'm gonna get burned at the stake for this one.  Anyways, growing up my mom was a narcissist's with Asperger's. She never knew how to control her anger and this combined with her narcissisms and the fact that my brother had aspergers led to very heated arguments usually involving destruction of the house. My grandma always lectured me and my brothers. And now I just got into my first relationship after getting rejected a total of 6 times, ghosted twice, lead on twice and now I can officially say that I have been cheated on by a girl who used a strap on to penetrate her ex's behind. Every single girl I have ever met in my life has always treated me terribly. All they do is spit gossip and emotionally manipulate people. You will never ever ever get a straight answer from a woman. They always have to lie and deceive so that they save their ego and not look like the bad guy. I wish they would just straight up say "I DONT LIKE YOU AND I NEVER WILL" but no I have to go on a wild goose chase trying to interpret every single one of their actions like it's some sort of puzzle. Anyways I'm done, I've given up, it's just a constant loop of rejection and misery that I'll never truly get out of.  Thanks for listening to my rant now go ahead and roast me in the comments.

25	1	What is the purpose? [SEP] What are reasons as to why you guys keep going.
290	1	How do you help your SO when you're disabled? [SEP] My fiance is amazing and takes care of so many things for us. He's the only one that can work and always makes sure things are okay. I feel guilty though. He does so much and I know it puts a lot of stress on him. I don't want him to have so much weight on his shoulders.  I can do some physical things to clean and cook if my pain isn't too bad and I try super hard to find small things I can do to get extra cash (through artwork and such). But I don't know what else to do to help. Those things don't add up to much in the long run.  I'm just looking for some advice I guess. What can I do to help?
338	1	I feel like I was lied to when I was taught to always show up early. [SEP] I mean, seriously. Some of the most successful people I know are consistently late to everything (even work and classes) by 3 to 10 minutes, and here I am, a sucker, showing up early and ready. How much time could I have saved if I'd known I was wasting it
471	1	I was assaulted [SEP] On Thursday, at approximately 1050 am, during PE class (normally weight training but sometimes we go to the secondary gym), I was playing basketball with a couple friends and friends of friends.  Late in the game, I was aggressively defending another player (friend of friend) from progressing towards the hoop, and I was all over him.  He eventually got passed me, but when he did, he sucker punched me right in the eye with full force.  I remember flying towards the ground and seeing my glasses flying across the gym, cutting me on the eyebrow.  I was left with another cut below the eye, severe bruising/swelling, broken blood vessels in the eye, and two chipped teeth.  I had raised my voice at him earlier and had told him to shut up, but I don't know what I did to anger him, people say I slapped him while going for the ball, and if I did, it was an accident and I am truly sorry. I am autistic and not as well coordinated as my neurotypical peers. I wouldn't have minded if he pushed me and said "what the fuck" but for some reason he felt the need to punch me. He didn't even say anything after hitting me, he just stormed out of the gym.  My friend John checked on me, put my glasses back together, and took me to the nurse office.  Afterword, the assistant principal said that because both parties traded blows, it was a 3 day suspension, but she agreed to remove 2 days from my suspension, and as the day of the incident counts as the first day, I was only suspended for that day. (I respected her decision). I am not in trouble at home either as my mother understands the situation. I do not know what the other guys punishment is, but he is 18 and he hit me, a developmentally disabled 17 year old minor, so I would guess he's triple fucked.  After I got home, my mind started telling me how much of a bad kid I am and how I let my whole family down. But my mom told that was not the case and I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Now it is Sunday, 0131 pm, I am doing much better, healing but still anxious. The swelling has gone down significantly and the bleeding in my eye is going away slowly but surely. The cut below my eye has healed completely. The bruising is still there but I expect it to be there for a while and I can now touch the right side of my face with little pain.  I will provide updates as the days go on! God bless.
199	1	Three Birds [SEP] Three birds are flying in the sky at dawn, wondering where they should land.  One lands to the right and finds success, having a rich life filled with fulfillment.

557	2	Idk if this is the right sub but I‚Äôm posting [SEP] So I got my heart broken not too long ago. I e cried every day. I‚Äôve hoped every day to see that person again. I‚Äôm drunk so much to numb the pain. I sent my resume to the army to see if if anything comes about it.   I have no one to talk to. Family doesn‚Äôt count cuz they betrayed me in one way or another. I‚Äôm so fucking sad tho. I drink every night but if I join, then I‚Äôd be forced not to, right?   I have a career path in mind. I haven‚Äôt been able to find a job within my country and it doesn‚Äôt help.   Nevertheless, I‚Äôm trying to figure something out,,, JJ‚Ä¶ if your out there, and you happen to see this‚Ä¶ I love you. Stay say safe. No matter what.   Now, I shall drunkingly watch hunger games and drown my pain away. BecUse I can‚Äôt see too straight right now.   I miss you and I‚Äôll always love you. This pan. Is unbearable. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll forget you. Doubt I will. But I will always love you. Bye.  Im fucking buzzed.  Don‚Äôt know how I drive. Oh, and no one contact rodent support. They can‚Äôt help me. I just want to be alone. Cry. Mourn.   I‚Äôll never forget you JJ. No matter what you say, you‚Äôll be there. Just like with Violet Evergarden.   I now understand why people become alcoholics. Don‚Äôt do it kids. Idk wtf I‚Äôm doing anymore. ü§£ü§£‚úåüèΩ
531	2	I completely hate the way I look [SEP] I gained 110 lbs from medication for a psychological disorder I was misdiagnosed as having. I used to weigh 120 lbs before I took the medicine, gained 110 lbs from taking it. I‚Äôm completely miserable all of the time, but I don‚Äôt have any motivation/energy to workout, and I hate to cook so I don‚Äôt eat healthy at all. I know I need to make changes, but I feel so stuck. On top of it, I developed binge eating disorder. I‚Äôm on Vyvanse now for ADHD, and that‚Äôs helping me control my binge eating, but I haven‚Äôt lost a single pound in the almost 7 months I‚Äôve been on it.  Sometimes (all of the time, really) I imagine cutting my stomach open, and physically scraping the fat out with a square shaped shovel. I would love to go to the gym, but the only gym I have access to is my college campus‚Äôs gym, and it‚Äôs mostly athletes in there. I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôd all judge me for even attempting to walk in there since I‚Äôm so overweight.  I‚Äôve also tried serval diets and cutting back on carbs, but I get super light headed and the shakes when I don‚Äôt eat carbs. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs like a withdrawal or what, but it freaks me out whenever it happens.  The crazy part is that when I was at my skinniest (about 90 lbs when I was 18) I still felt like I was massive.
539	2	I think life is not worth living anymore. [SEP] I am in that weird spot between not wanting to live (or I guess more like not existing) anymore and still hoping that I will get that little spark of hope someday so I will know that all this suffering is worth it. But I am waiting and waiting and only bad things come my way. I don't see a point in all of this. Me not being here is also...not a big deal. Nothing changes with or without me here. I am not that important to anyone. I am just a side character, even in my own story.:)  I miss my young me.

433	1	is there school [SEP] [deleted]
445	2	I wish I never got a full scholarship at an elite school (even tho I should be grateful) [SEP] It's been 4 years since I graduated from an arts course as a full scholar. Over time, I noticed I built up envy and an inferiority complex to my partner + peers that are more well off. I hate that I feel this way, especially since they're people I care about. We met at college and at work (which I thankfully got cuz I came from a "top" school). As a creative, my circles mostly consist of people from the same upper middle class sector too (artists, gallerists, professional creatives, etc.) Meanwhile, I'm from a lower class community and live at a pretty provincial/conservative town. It wasn't a big deal before and the scholarship was a literal blessing since we couldn't afford tuition... until the culture shock at my new school changed me.   The campus was at a city that I gruelingly commuted to for 2-3 hours. There was no uniform so ofc the art students were super fashionable. Plus I didn't even have basic equipment like a laptop or smartphone. So while my classmates easily took photos of presentations, I had to quickly take down notes or always ask them for copies. The professors said there was nothing they could do too. One time, a dude joked that a scholar's allowance merely comes from THEIR tuition so we should be grateful. Of course I was grateful! Even if I was anxiety ridden with maintaining my GPA (or else I'd lose my scholarship) for four frickin' years, I was grateful. And super proud that I graduated too!  But at work, it was the same. Another harsh commute to a fast paced creative agency. I was an all around artist at a lifestyle publication with an upper middle class audience. The professionals I met and befriended were amazing. Doors opened for my career and I enjoyed their company. But it took a toll on my wallet since I was making newbie minimum wage. My health suffered immensely and I took a corporate job at my hometown instead. I thought I'd be at loss leaving the creative industry professionally (I still did art gigs on the side) and my friends were there too. But being away made me realize this complex I built? Fully living/working in my small town and meeting up with my friends in the city created a dissonance. As if I was Cinderella on the weekends and back to chores after. I recognized this dissonance and hated acknowledging it.  I hated it because I do love the people I met and the places I've been. Such as my old peers and partner (all from upper middle class). But I always felt like a fraud around them. That of course, they'd hear me out if I told them. But would they understand? Probably not. But they'd still try anyways. That's just how they were raised, comfortable and genuinely nice. Meanwhile, I'm covered with creases from just getting to tomorrow. This all reminds me of the years I spent on harsh commutes. Streets filled with pickpockets, harassers, and excruciating traffic taught me to constantly keep my guard up. To always doubt and be cold. I guess I carried that onto my core instincts as well. Meanwhile, here are my friends: so nice, shiny, and soft. It's just unfair. I feel like I don't deserve them... but I also deserve MORE in life. So I tried. I worked so hard that I make ends meet now. But there are times when i just can't.   So I studied the system too and became an activist. Understanding and protesting the deep-rooted class system gave me reason, but I still feel the same way. Envious, fake, regretful, mad at myself for being irrational. Activism taught me that ignorance isn't bliss. But sometimes I wish I could go back to high school, before I accepted my scholarship. Before I became an ambitious creative. Before I even knew what privilege was. Admitting this is so hard for me because it sounds so selfish. I should be grateful I'm this self-aware. But sometimes I wish I wasn't. This was a long post so thank you for reading. :')

415	1	My best friend has started taking drugs again and I just can‚Äôt deal [SEP] I‚Äôve known my girl friend since I was in my twenties, so around 13 years. She has known my husband since he was in high school and we‚Äôve seen each other‚Äôs kids be born and are big parts of each other‚Äôs lives.   My girl friend went through a rough patch a while back where she was with an abusive boy friend, took a lot of drugs and hit rock bottom.  She got rid of the boy friend after his son sexually abused her 4 year old daughter, his son was 11. cps was involved and she started to put her life back together realising she could lose her kids. she knows I hate drugs so didn‚Äôt ever do them around me but tells me about when she has used.  She became a much better person when she was off the drugs, she could have a few drinks and not be uncomfortably unhinged, she was much better to her kids, and generally a wonder person to be around again.  Recently she again came out of another relationship and has started to spiral, first she was sniffing cocaine out of her hand bag with a straw while at an up scale bar in town and then she was taking edibles and cocaine at home around her kids.   I hate the drugs and hate who she becomes when she‚Äôs on them. Every time she tells me about her using I feel myself take a mental step back and feel very uncomfortable about being around her, especially because of her kids who are still both under 10 years old.   I‚Äôve already changed my will with my husband to show that she won‚Äôt be getting custody of my kids should my husband and I pass away. I don‚Äôt want to be around drugs and I don‚Äôt want my kids around them either.   I don‚Äôt want to stop the friendship because she is amazing when she is sober but I know the only person to get her sober is her and that doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going to happen any time soon.   I am honestly so sad for the friendship we used to have and I don‚Äôt want to lose her but I can‚Äôt while she is high constantly.

294	1	‚ÄúFound myself‚Äù during the pandemic with all of the additional time but now having a hard time adjusting to normal life. Anyone else? [SEP] I‚Äôve been online from March-August. I realize this time has been super stressful for some, but for me, it was the reset I desperately needed. A lot of time with myself to think about things.   Woke up, meditated, walked while listening to meetings, ate a healthy breakfast, spent the rest of the day being productive with a regular sleep schedule. I lost weight, felt happier than ever, learned a lot about myself.   I thought for sure that all of that self-improvement would carry over to now (going back to normal ish life), but I‚Äôve been back for two weeks and feel overwhelmed, like there‚Äôs no time to even apply those things to my new busy life. It‚Äôs so disappointing because I made such progress. Who knew I‚Äôd be nostalgic for a pandemic?  Anyone else?
67	1	Keeping it real! [SEP] Don‚Äôt be afraid to say exactly what you want. The only person you hurt when you don‚Äôt Is yourself.
601	1	The last straw at work [SEP] Been working this one job for 7 months. When I got hired there was 0 training. None. I was expected to know how everything worked right off the bat. Which of course did not happen.    After learning on the job I was working fine for a while my coworkers, then most of them quit in about a month period. The owner decided not to replace them and shifted the workload onto the remaining employees, which caused more to quit. I asked for a raise and was told it‚Äôs out of the budget‚Ä¶.even though 9 people were off the payroll. I didn‚Äôt like working there but I kept on because I like the work I do. That‚Äôs when my owner realized we were severely understaffed and hired some help‚Ä¶plus a new ‚Äúsupervisor.‚Äù I put supervisor in quotes because I‚Äôm not sure what he is. He‚Äôs not a manager but he‚Äôs above me at the same time.    Things went to hell in a handbasket in the matter of weeks. They slashed my hours down by half and still didn‚Äôt train the new guys. So now when I go in I spend half my day fixing everything the new hires messed up on top of my work. Of course it‚Äôs mostly solo shifts now so I can‚Äôt train them and they don‚Äôt seem to care about the mistakes they make. The ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù also hasn‚Äôt been trained so he can‚Äôt train them either. So I quit fixing their mistakes and I got in trouble for not fixing them‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team and we have each other‚Äôs backs, you need to look out for them.‚Äù You know the thing.    Later on I found out the shop is up 50% year over year in **net profit** meaning there‚Äôs plenty of money for raises. I also then found out the new hires are paid 7% more than I am. So after all that new knowledge I was asking for a raise about every shift. Rather than a raise, I was given a ‚Äúbonus.‚Äù It was a $20 gift card to the store and shirt with the company logo on it. An absolute slap in the face.    Now the owner wants me to run the store as ‚Äúmanager‚Äù for 14 days straight while he‚Äôs on a 2 week vacation to Hawaii. I complained about working 14 days with no days off and he told me ‚Äúwe all have to make sacrifices‚Äù so I asked him ‚Äúwhen was the last time you worked 14 days straight?‚Äù He had no good answer for that. (He always takes the weekends off and every other week Mondays off too)   After all that I began looking for new jobs.    Some other things I left out. f I requested a day off he‚Äôd schedule me on that day purposely and make me argue for it off. I guess his philosophy was ‚Äúif they need the day off they‚Äôll fight for it; and if I make requesting days off as painful as possible they will work more often.‚Äù Super annoying. He tried that once with me, I argued. The second time I just didn‚Äôt show up, which he then called me on my day off telling me to come in, and I just said no. Then he never did it again to me.
578	1	I got an apartment!!! Woooo!!! [SEP] I can't believe I forgot to post this!  I've been looking for an apartment since December 1st. It got to the point where after a couple months in I just asked my mom to take care of anything apartment related, like seeing the apartments and deciding whether or not to apply (I made my parameters really clear.)  I'm on ODSP, so it was much harder to find a place, even if my mom cosigned my lease (which she has to do) and it was getting to the point where I thought nobody would want to rent to me, but we kept praying and applying and hoping.   A little over a week ago, my mom went out and came home all excited, and told me about this great apartment! She told me everything. The only thing was it didn't have laundry but my mom invited me to do laundry at her place because i would be living literally a 10 minute walk away from her!   Amyway, a few days ago, we had a meeting with a landlord who said he would make his decision within 24 hours, and a day later I got a text from my mom at like 12:30 in the afternoon telling me that I got it!   I can move in on April 1st, and no, that's not an April fools joke.  I'm so looking forward to it!   Context: I moved back in with my mom during the first covid lockdown, then my sister moved away with her girlfriend, so my mom just let me stay but we started looking fir a place because we both agreed I should move out this year.

596	2	I Feel Like Such A Failure [SEP] One of my goals in life is to publish a series of books. I'm beginning to think this goal may be unattainable.   I'm 25 years old and I haven't published anything, and I don't know if I ever will. I can easily come up with ideas, but I don't know how I'll be able to take those ideas and turn them into stories. The whole thing seems so daunting to me. And even if I do, I don't know how I'd go about expanding that book into a series.   Meanwhile, Stephen King published his first novel, *Carrie*, at age 26/27, and he published numerous short stories before that. And he has published so many books over the years. I don't know how he did it, but it seems like he was born with something I wasn't.   Not only that, I feel like no one would want to read my stories anyway. All my ideas are derivative and clich√©d, and things people have seen a hundred times before. This especially hurts because I've always thought I was a creative person.   I do have friends that say the few things I've written are good, but I don't know if they're just saying that to be nice or not.   I wish I knew all the answers to my questions: How can I make my work stand out against the crowd? How can I structure my books? What is a reasonable time frame for publishing a series? Why couldn't I have been born perfect?  But I don't know the answers and I feel like such garbage. I'd end it all if it weren't for the fact I have family and friends who would be very upset with me if I did. So I'm just stuck here, living life knowing I will never achieve writing success. It feels awful.  There, it's off my chest now.
937	1	There needs to be a website that tracks all conspiracy theory‚Äôs that never proved true, so collectively we can all keep track. [SEP]
649	1	I've been told it sounds like I was both groomed and raped, but I really don't know if I agree or not. I'm so confused. [SEP] I'm not sure how to structure this, so I'm really sorry if it becomes a jumbled mess. Also, I'm diagnosed with both Autism (when I was 28) and ADD (last week), in case that makes a difference. (And a few other things, but not sure that's relevant here)  Okay, so. When I (32f) was 13, I became really good friends with this girl who was 5 years older than me. A few weeks later I met her older brother, who was 10 years older than me. So to clarify, she was 18, and he was 23. I kept in contact with them throughout my teenage years, calling her my best friend and looking up to him like an older brother. During this time they very much took the roles of role models for me, and would, to some extent, parent me when needed.  I fell in love with one of them the year I met them. Today, I'm pretty sure it was her I fell in love with, but back then I put a lot of energy into saying I was in love with him. I believe I did this because he was the socially acceptable one to be in love with (I grew up in a very Christian community).  When I was 20, I started a relationship with this guy. I was the one pushing it, but I knew already a week into it that I didn't want it, but at that point, I was terrified I'd lose my best friend if I broke up with her brother, so I stuck with it, and eventually married him.  During our marriage, he took away all my bodily autonomy. I was to do with my body as he wanted, I was to dress in the way he wanted me to dress, and I had no right to say no to sex. Piercings and tattoos were absolute no-goes, and it had to be a show for his pleasure every time I got undressed. Even the very first time we had sex, I had absolutely no wish of doing it, but he convinced me that it was for my own sake that we would take that step.  I was to be his good little wife, who took care of the house, gave him children, cooked every evening, and hosted whenever we had guests. Life had other plans, and my mental problems made me incapable of meeting his standards, which sent me into suicidal depression.  I cannot count  * the times I was told I was worthless * the times I was told I was immature * the times I was told he was right by default because he was older than me * the times my request to "not have sex tonight" was overruled because he had needs, and my body was his marital right, according to the bible  He also managed to isolate me completely from my family, and the only friends I was encouraged to have were the ones we were both friends with and my own friends he generally disapproved of.  After years like this, I started getting friends online, and because they weren't there physically, he didn't think of them as real friends, so he didn't care. It was these friends who gave me the strength to finally leave him.   Leaving him wasn't entirely straightforward, and I had to live with him for months after the divorce. During this time he still tried to sexualize me, and wanted me to have sex with him, and still be friends. My head was a mess, so I thought that maybe friendship was possible, though I did shut down any attempt at getting into bed with me. During this time I ended up mentioning the accusations from my friends that he had been raping me. He straight up told me that if I ever said anything like that to anyone, he'd sue me for slander, so now, 4 years later, I'm still terrified at telling anyone in my life who knows who he is.  But yeah... On bad days my head is a whirlwind in all of this, and I don't know how to think about it all. When I hear grooming stories and rape by coercion stories, it really resonates with me and my experiences, but at the same time, those words feel so incredibly strong that I have no idea how to park all of this. My head's a big mess, and I've really needed to find a place to unload all of this.

652	2	Suicide as a goal in life. [SEP] I'm a 19 years old and I have since I can remember been drawn to the idea of committing suicide once I've finished my education.  Growing up my household has been very stable, I have supportive family and friends which love me and vice versa. Since 7th grade I've had a list that's been with me ever since which states all the things I'd like to experience before turning 30, and the first paragraph on that list is committing suicide. Fast forward 5 years and I still have the same goal in my mind.   My reason for committing suicide is not for any mental problems or traumas but simply because I'm tired and don't really appreciate living. Sometimes I believe that some were born meant to commit suicide, like cutting grass. It grows and parts of it must get cut down. I'm tired of the constant battle with life even so much so that I don't appreciate it even when I succeed. I've had a lot of fun in life both with family and my friends and neither do I have any problems with my social surrounding or educational needs, I just am this way. At face value, I don't really know where this thought came from. All I know is that I'm tired and that I don't appreciate life for what it is or what it could become. All I am is amused by the thought of leaving it behind.   I'm not looking for any guidance on what to do or how to view life, all I want is this to be an outlet for my thoughts to be spoken.

I don‚Äôt like my brothers, and how they changed for them and fucked me over with the shit I was dealing with myself, they completely departed from me after they had more kids. My mom is just someone I have casual conversations with and live with, my stepdad is just my moms husband and my brothers are just there. I don‚Äôt like any of them nor do I have any emotional connection to them.
542	1	Why is it so Hard to Just Have a Good Friend [SEP] I'm in highschool and I just lost my best friend, I had basically no one apart from them so now I have nobody to talk to. I have social anxiety so it's hard enough trying to approach people and every time I manage to do that and try and make friends with someone it never works. I try and put in effort and talk a lot but nobody puts in that same effort, they never talk to me if I don't text first and some of them just ignore when I do try and text them. When I was in 8th grade I lost my best friend from 7th grade after he got popular. He was brand new to the school and I was the first person to be his friend let alone even talk to him. Even after all the time and effort I put into that friendship he just leaves me behind when he got popular and got all these other surface level friends. I don't know if he was just a jerk or if i'm just an unlikeable person. I don't know what the point of this post was but I have nobody who I can talk to or listen to me so yeah. Thanks if you read the whole thing.
472	1	TW grooming? // I talked to a person (20) who was a lot older than me and now I feel very ashamed and stupid.. [SEP] In the summer, last year somewhere around June I found an app that you'd sent letters on. I had been having some trouble with finding friends so I decided to try it. Some weeks go by and I get a letter from someone a lot older than me. (For content, the app's name is slowly and you can get letters totally randomly by auto-match or directly from a person who's found your profile) I felt like the letter might have gotten from the auto-match feature. I was hesitant on answering them, for some reason I did answer...  So I answered them and it was nothing bad, just a small introduction and that's that. They answer and we start talking about very casual and normal stuff like music, hobbies, animals, just something basic that you'd talk about with anyone really. That goes on and the letters get longer. They're respectful, don't talk about anything that wouldn't be okay to talk about with me (a minor, 15 yo) and it's all nice.   We get to know better, share some cool stuff we know, teach each other own languages. I share my pinterest account because we talked about it and I have nothing personal there really. It was just like "hey you can check out what I like if you're interested" kind of thing. And they liked the things I had there so I just said something that I might share some cool stuff with them sometimes just bc they liked the stuff and I don't know.   I shared something there and they answered. Then we just started talking there a bit and sharing a bit from our days and all, just normal casual convos. Time goes by and we still send letters and talk sometimes on pinterest. They ask my instagram and I who doesn't think anything bad about it just give it to them :/ At this point we had known from july to november (5 months), so I had a lot of trust for them also.   We start talking there, it stays normal and casual, but then we start texting very often. Usually he started the conversations. Later on we talked almost like daily and many times a day... didn't think much of it mhm..   Then time goes by and he sents me a TikTok about a person in their room watching ph and someone comes in. Then the ph music is like "hidden" by playing an instrument on top so it sounds like it is just a part of it. I think it was a trend on TikTok at one point? Not sure about that though. Anyways I am a bit surprised by it and I just am like ohhh what huh. Reply just something like haha and they send a message that kinda seems panicked like "I just liked the music on it" and I say to that something like "yup they're very talented" or something like thatI don't remember clearly, it was so long time ago and as I said like we talked a lot so it'd be impossible to just remember every single thing.   So that was a bit surprising thing I think, but I just didn't think of it a lot, I actually didn't even notice the ph music first until my friend pointed it out. We were out that day together so yup.   Nothing like that happens for a while I think, but then at some point I get more Tiktoks from them (randomly on different times). One with a person talking about how to say "I hope you think of me when you masturbate in a romantic way" and the other one is like someone talking about how important it is to use lubricant on sex... I don't understand how I let those things just pass, I mean now that I think of it it feels so disgusting and so wrong. I feel terrible for not realizing anything about what was going on. I didn't see it as wrong for some reason like I didn't understand that it was so wrong from him. Oh on the video about lubricant he said something like "remember to use lube", but on different words. Also I never answered to those videos like on a way that would be consenting to such videos. I answered something like "haha what a beautiful way to say that, the person would definitely be so honored (sarcasm)".   Then at some point for some reason he started talking about how "smol" I was and then started talking about me being a kitten... also at one point they sent me a video of a person on a maid outfit and said that I'd look good on it. To that I said something like "nahh I think you'd look better on that" which he just started saying again sometime that I'd look better or something I don't remember properly.   That maid thing happened on the day I realized it all I think. We talked normally and he pulled up with a pick up line. I had commented about a kaomoji he used (‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨„Éé( ¬∫ _ ¬∫„Éé)) and I said like "what is that supposed to resemble? A person and a table handshaking?" and continued "I want to be the table (just said it like as a joke). To the first one he answered "Yes bc table is good" and to the second he decided that it was appropriate to say "oo can I sit on you?". I got very like uhhh what and just decided to say something like "hsjsjshh what go touch some grass". In other words it's like uhh hey wtf go get some air. Then he asks "if you'd be a table would you be a swedish table?" and I thought it was like some random innocent thing obviously so I said genuinely like that I'd want to be an wooden table and that Ikea's furniture is pretty bad quality hahsh ( it is tbh we have one closet and it's like falling apart when you move it ;') ). And he pulls up with a wikipedia page to a swedish table with a lot of foods, like a buffet table I think? yup I think that's it. I ask "oh you mean would I be the appetizer?" and he says that "yeah for sure, you'd have a lot of good stuff on you!" uhh so yup.   Then I said that I was going to sleep so he said something like "good night swedish table" I called him a dummy and he said "I like you too" aaand I said that I did not say that which he answered that I did do that and that he" read my mind". I asked "oh so you mindread huh?, what am I thinking of now then" and now his answer "Gosh, he's so funny and handsome, I wanna be his table". I said nonono I don't want to be your table, he said that I was thinking of it, I said he was misreading my mind and he just kept on saying that I thought tht way which I answered that he was probably just reading his own mind. I meant every word on that, I was not interested in him like that, he is 20 years old an ADULT and I am 15 an MINOR. I never wanted anything like this, I didn't want his sexual TikToks and pick up lines, I didn't want to be called a fucking kitten wtf. I didn't have any signs from the start that I'd like to have any type of relationship like that with him. I never wanted anything sexual or anything.   To the thing I said that he was probably just reading his mind, he said that he thinks that "I like it and I'm just afraid to tell the truth" which I said to "No I don't think so! You're a bit old you know for me to be your table if you still haven't noticed" I was so disgusted by him, this was the realization of everything. Then he says "OKAY, I WILL WAIT THEN" like excuse me what?  what the actual fuck..   I say "Sweetheart that's called grooming ( the sweetheart is just meant to be taken as like a fuck you hahsh I would never call him an sweetheart otherwise)". Then he proceeds to say that he's only joking and that he's sorry. I say that I don't believe him BECAUSE considering all of those kitten, pick up lines and all other things it doesn't seem like a joke at all.. "well then I'm very sorry about that, and that you feel bad because of it, it wasn't my intention". I tell him to stop acting innocent, and ask what is the talk with kittens etc. while calling it weird thing. Then he just says that it's just jokes and he just finds those things cute, then the maid dress thing apparently were like just a joke too. Then I ask him why does he think it's okay to talk inappropriate things to an 15 year old and why does he think that it would be okay to wait someone to grow up to be someones "table". He says he's sorry and says he "fucked up" and hes "tired of it" and I say "tired of talking dirty with underaged girls?" ( I meant to use"to" instead of "with", but it was 5am and I was so pissed that I didn't think too much what I typed. He asks why would I say that and say that he has nothing like that in his mind never, he asks "you know, can we end it? it's really idk weird?"  I remind him that he's an adult 20 years old and I'm an 15 year old a minor and ask doesn't he see a problem in that. He says "Yes, I'm sorry it was a honor to know you" and blocks me everywhere.  So uhh yes, after that I just started taking screenshots from everything, he had shared what he looked like earlier so I had that saved up and all of our conversations. I also know his full name so uhh yup. But like I couldn't do anything about it really. I just knew him and he was from a different country so I didn't speak the language and overall there wasn't a lot I could do. I feel disgusted by the fact that I know this man wants kids someday. I mean like just imagine your parent being a person like that :/ I ended up finding his ex though, through Instagram, he was tagged on a pic and I noticed a hastag about him being the boyfriend. So Idk if it was the right decision, but I told her and uhh she confirmed the person was indeed the person who was her ex.. I felt terrible to include her, because they had known for long and like obviously hearing something like this about someone you used to know.. but I had to tell someone like. Actually I thought about telling his parents, but I couldn't contact them and they probably wouldn't have believed me despite the proof since he after all is their son. So I told her since she asked me.  After all that I felt absolutely terrible, I felt so ashamed and so stupid for not realizing everything. I knew him for like 6 months too.. I honestly like fell into such a deppressed state, mostly by how gross I felt. I didn't like myself for getting into such things. It's so difficult to understand that it's not your fault and you didn't do wrong. Then like when I talked to people about my experience I just got invalidated and felt even more shitty, I mean some even said that I was fucked up for "getting" into such thing and "letting" someone groom me. It all made me not wanting to get up from bed and like I felt so incredibly lost. It took a long time before I started feeling better. Now I am better, but like honestly my trust in people is pretty low ngl about that hahah, but hmm yes that's my story :')

The story: I sat on the toilet and pooped. This is 100% true and I‚Äôm so glad I could finally open up to such a supportive community about this. I‚Äôm literally crying, this is so freeing.  Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!!1!  Edit 2: wow, thanks for all this support, I was going to kms but these reddit awards saved my life, I love each and every single one of you like a nephew!
637	2	I'm convinced I will never be loved. It's incredibly depressing. [SEP] Title about sums it up. You know how sometimes you just hold a belief so strongly that pretty much nothing can convince you otherwise?   This is probably one of the reasons I'm so resistant to trying to meet people  but I just fundamentally believe it will never happen for me. No one wants to talk to me. My only value to other people is doing something for them.   I've tried dating apps, focusing on and improving myself, therapy. Whatever. Iwanted a family but as a woman I have a time frame, so starting to lose out on valuable time now. (Also I'm fat so you can put the pitchforks down about how wOmEn hAvE iT eAsiER. Also inb4 wElL tHaTs YoUr pRoBlEm. I know. I'm working on it.)  God damn. What's the point of even trying. Nothing will get better. It'll just go back to the same as it always was. I just want to waste away into nothing. Waiting for the iTS DePrEsSiO  response. I fucking know, genius. Fuck. What I wouldn't give to be anybody else.

561	1	This post is my way of saying I love you to him [SEP] I didn't think I was going to post this today. Like lets not be so cheesy right? But I really love this man and he scrolls Reddit a lot. I know this is going to make his day( I really hope it does hehe). I don't know if this is the right sub to post this, but he sends me a lot of posts from this one so I am sure he frequents it.   So 6 months ago, I met this man. Nothing like the usual type of guys I see myself with really. He is sweet and charming though. Grabs my attention. Wonderful listener. We had been online friends before for about a month or so and used to play games and study for tests together. We went on a short trip with common friends and kind of vibed. He asked me out and I refused because I had given up on love and had trauma from literally every person in my life. He waited for me patiently, he was sure we were going to end up together. One day we get to talking about things in life which I fear will make him feel like I am a lot of baggage or an emotional wreck.   He surprisingly took it so well, his responses made me fall for him. Since that day everything in our life has been pretty rushed, things got very serious very quickly. We said I love you pretty early into our relationship. I became more open with him. I know our timeline is too rapid for some people, but we are sure about each other. I haven't met someone so perfect before. And for us, actions matter more than the number of months we have known each other. I always say he is my guardian angel. I am insecure about everything in my life but this man makes sure I love myself. And I have started slowly loving my own self. Falling in love with him is the best thing that has happened to me. We play games everyday and he builds these cute things in our Minecraft house for me when I am offline. With him I feel like a teenager in love although we are both responsible and mature adults.   These 6 months were the best ones of my life, we haven't had one fight and he always makes sure I feel comfortable with everything. His family is the group of most welcoming and adorable people I have ever met. It still feels like a fairytale and too good to be true. I almost thought I was never gonna get happiness in life, had drowned myself in addictions and had a lot of mental health issues. He is making things better, one day at a time.   We dream of a wonderful life together, a decent house and amazing kids and I hope it turns out to be true. I have realised that life is a roller coaster and its important to hold hands with someone for this ride. Be it ups or downs, I want to make each day count with no one other than him. Thank you for loving me and picking me up when I needed it the most. I love you Puchka. I hope the next 60 years are as amazing as these 6 months were.
