6	1	DAE when they’ve slept so far into the day just continue sleeping until waking up at an early hour the next day? [SEP] Just an example..  Fell asleep one day at 7am, woke up at 6pm.. stayed up for 2 hours then went back to sleep at 9pm and woke up the next day at 3am and continued the day as if it was normal..  I figured, this day is already shot, why stay up and mess up another day and just slept until the next..
590	2	I left r/actuallesbians because it made me puke. [SEP] That sub is filled with unrealistic and Cinderella like fairytales. They will never talk about the other things that go on in the community, like abusive relationships. And when someone does talk about it, they get shitted on. Almost as if they’re not allowed to talk about it because that sub only wants to hear about fake happy relationships that have nothing to do with reality. They’re in a world where everything is sustains and rainbows and people never get hurt. Boy are they in for a real surprise once they go out into the real world. I feel like that sub was made by a 12 year old who has zero life experience.

425	1	My love of street food, open-mindedness and the girl group S.H.E. makes me think chilling out in Taiwan for a few months would be fun, but my ex is dead against it. [SEP] My ex and I are still very good friends. I love him to pieces, but I decided to end it after six years because we were heading in different directions. Four years later, he’s still my best mate. I told him I was thinking of going to mandarin classes (I’ve always had an interest in the sinosphere) at a university in Taipei. Of course I never expect to be fluent, but I’ve heard amazing things about Taiwan, and I thought it would be cool for a spell. We travel a lot so I thought it would be no big deal. He fucking exploded, saying I’m being impulsive and irresponsible. I’m 34 by the way. I don’t know what to think.
509	1	What did my mother mean by I’m being TOO affectionate towards my father? Am I being slutty or mean? [SEP] I(16F) started becoming more affectionate towards my dad, because I genuinely started realising how much he’s done for me and I never thanked him for it.  I’ve always been affectionate towards my mom but recently I’m being more affectionate to my dad.  Today my mom just commented, “Wow you’re REALLY being affectionate towards your father nowadays.”  Honestly I was a little taken aback and I didn’t know what to say.  Was she being jealous? Am I being slutty? I swear I don’t intend too but this Freudian theory suggests daughters sub consciously try to steal their mom’s place in dad’s life.  I feel gross now, idk why my mom said it. I don’t want to be affectionate with my dad anymore.
328	3	23M with a bus load of PTSD, got a weird question. [SEP] I’ve been through a lot in life, I’d like to think of my self as having enough experience to know simple acts of compromise, giving people what they want sometimes, letting go of your ego,argue with people in an attitude where it isn’t about “winning” the argument, but making sure they’re in a good mindset to accept, essentially just being a wholesome human being and all that Jazz....  For some reason however I have come to dislike people in general due to the insurmountable amount of nuisances when it comes to human character. I know there is no way people can’t pick up on this but, do people just not see what’s wrong with themselves? Oh yeah they can’t...another one of those “human flaws”.   I just wanted to ask you people who are in relationships/has been/grew out of those, how can you love someone/something despite seeing the many flaws in their character, while knowing fully well  no one is flawless? Maybe sometimes I can’t handle living with myself so can’t imagine living with another human being. Thought best people to ask are people on this specific subreddit, appreciate your help.  TL;DR: damaged goods trying to know how the clock ticks.
210	1	Have you ever encountered/felt a truly dark/evil individual? [SEP] Had an experience awhile back I still think of from time to time and I'm wondering if anyone else has similiar stories. I was on a delivery at a hotel and got onto an elevator, as I was standing an older man and a younger woman appeared. It looked like something was worrying her, as the doors started to close, the man looked at me with a smile and something about it threw me off, somehow his eyes and presence were radiating a sense of darkness. I'm not sure why, but it felt like my survival instincts or something were telling me he was a danger. I've never felt that off of someone before or since, just pure unwavering darkness and evil exuding off of someone before. I'm normally right in my judgements based on the feel of people and I really just hope that girl is okay and nothing bad happened that night like I suspect.
639	1	i was on a horny call w my gf. i came and it hit my face. [SEP] we're both 16 and horny. its been a while since we've seen eachother so we resorted to phone sex. we took it up a notch and video called and beat it and she flicked the bean. now this was fucking amazing. we were 20 minutes in. i came and that shit flew over my phone and hit me in the face. it was an awkward clean up and i didnt tell her it happened and never will.  thats it. thats my story.

115	1	Is it okay to be this lazy? [SEP] Alright so my line of work is very draining and monotonous about 90% of the time. On my days off, I bask in my room, watching movies, playing video games, painting models, all day. Mixed in with naps and ordering food. I know I’m lazy and I accept it, I don’t make myself feel bad about it, but today was one of those lazy days. I do the same thing al weekend without hardly leaving my room. Today my buddy asked if I wanted to play softball and I kindly declined. I’m 21 M and still eat right, I get yo and go when I need something, but sometimes I make myself feel bad for being lazy. I do everything I’m supposed to do, I pay my bills on time, I exercise more on my days of work than my days off. I do enjoy staying active, but on my days off, I can’t help being by myself and not doing much.
728	1	The afterlife might just be reliving exactly how you’ve made others feel. [SEP]
366	1	I have never been so happy for a class to be over. [SEP] I always loved school, I enjoyed learning and being able to engage with people. I am currently working towards a masters degree in forensic psychology and so far have loved it. Except for these last two classes. I had to take research methods in two different parts. It. Was. Awful. I had an awful teacher who refused to give me my grade, and when I fought her with the school she took almost a week to get back to anyone, potentially fucking up both my GPA and my financial aid. I unfortunately had her again for the class and she refused to answer any of my emails. Never in my academic life have I ever been so disrespected by someone. This class and professor made me doubt all of my abilities and knowledge that I have. I broke down in tears because of how difficult this class was. I am so happy it's over, and I want to get back to a place  of semi confidence with me school work.

259	2	Feeling down [SEP] Hey guys I’m a 24F and I’m just feeling a little sad without a good support system.. I really want to get married and have a partner, eventually have kids (something I’ve recently wanted). However, all my past relationships have been terrible. I understand that I’m still young but I’m nowhere close to what I want in my life. Not only that, my job sucks. I hate it. I want more for myself and my self confidence has been taking a huge toll recently due to health issues. The health issues are also causing brain fogginess and memory issues so I feel really dumb.. everyone I’m surrounded by is smarter than me and I’m just so tired of feeling so bad about myself..

30	1	Humans [SEP] Isn’t it weird how anything created by humans it’s called “artificial” when actually everything comes from nature Of course it can be manipulated by humans but  Humans are nature and what they create is part of nature? I know it can be detrimental to nature because of the trash and everything but im not talking about that. I dont know if i could put my point across but yea. Basically to me new technology like new way of doing things or discovering something works for them is just humans using their intelligence to design a life. For example birds build their houses and everyone agrees it’s nature because it’s in nature but living far from nature doesn’t make us human beings less natural because we are nature, we come from nature Anyways
12	1	Tried to be kind to someone and it backfired [SEP] I know this is a small incident and isn't something serious to ponder on but thought I'd vent a bit.  I went to the mall today and when I left I stood behind a lady at the parking ticket machine. She tried to use her card to pay for her ticket but it declined. I had cash on me so I asked, "Do you need some cash to pay for your ticket?"  She hastily looked at me and mumbled some words and walked to the machine opposite me. So I went forward and paid for my ticket. For some reason I still decided to ask her if she needed cash to pay for her ticket and she said, "No" and gave me a stern stare.  I've actually never had someone get so defensive with me trying to help them, it was just a parking ticket. I won't lie this made me angry for some reason and I guess I'm reflecting on this situation to try and figure out why this bothered me internally so much.  She was an older lady maybe 35 and I'm a 29 year old guy.

602	1	Exboyfriend Had a Rape Kink [SEP] My first boyfriend really messed me up. I was a virgin and didnt want to have sex for religious reasons, but was willing to do other stuff. He knew this and didn't like it, but he respected me enough to wait for me to be ready... or so I thought.  He requested some strange stuff, but I was so innocent that I didnt see the red flags at the time. For example he wanted me to pretend to be sleeping so he could stick his dick in my mouth and I could give him a blow job that way. Anyway, one day we were fooling around. We got more into it than usual and ohr clothes were off. I decided that was it for me and planned to get dressed and give him a blow job to satisfy him. That wasnt enough. While I was naked, he got on too of me, positioned his dick to go in, covered my mouth, and whispered in my ear "I could rape you right now". I was trying to get him off, but he was so much stronger than me. I started crying and that snapped him out of it. He got off, but he never saw anything wrong with what he did. Never apologized.  I was 16 years old and he was 18. I told my school councillor what happened a few months later. She talked to another councillor and THEY decided that they didn't want to ruin my ex's life by reporting it. Nothing ever happened except my self esteem dropped to nothing and I spent the next 3 years thinking I was worthless to men if I wasn't their sex toy. Ever since I have thought about it because I worry that he will actually rape someone.

556	3	I hate my homeroom [SEP] There is this girl in my homeroom class that always sits by the teachers desk. Let’s call her “M”. There are other girls up there too but M is the ‘iMpOrTaNt’ one here.   I sit in my assigned seat In the back of the class 98% of the time. But the other 2% (I’ve sat up there like 3 times) I sit up there.   I usually only talk with the teacher Mrs. J. Because I don’t know anyone else in that class.   Usually when I have a conversation with Mrs. J I start off with “Hey Mrs. J” or something along those lines, but *every* time I start a convo with her, I *always* say her name someplace in there.   But somehow whenever I say something in the convo, this bitch M has to have her two fucking cents in. I fucking *hate it*!   Why can’t they mind their own fucking business??? They somehow always find their fucking way into our convo.   She always says something, then next thing I know I’m having a convo with basically her, because any time I try to say something Mrs. J, she always answers for her.   Like what the fuck?! Just let me talk to the fucking teacher man.   Idk if that’s how it always is, and I know sometimes when you hear someone say something in a different conversation, you say something and then you’re in the conversation. Maybe that’s how it is up there, but I’m not trying to have a conversation with the whole fucking class just with the teacher.  And sometimes they are so *fucking* dumb.   I always chalk it up to them all being blonde (I know that can be offensive, and I *never* say that aloud, but it helps calm me down when all I want to do is punch them in the face).   I get so fucking enraged when M does this, especially when the other kids fucking join in, what the fuck.  I swear one of these days I’m gonna fucking *SNAP* and beat the hell out of one of them, and I’m not gonna feel bad about it.    The thing is, I sometimes do this. With their conversations too.   Idk why I get so enraged when they do it with my conversation.

642	1	My perspective of Relationships [SEP] Being the guy that is known as the "friend" characteristic, I know that my chances with connection on a level higher than friendship is both limited and not taken seriously, but my perspective of relationships has always been that I am lonely and I need someone who will fill that void. Now I know that's a toxic thought process but being the shy kid that never stood a chance with social interaction from a young age leads into those types of thoughts and I am ashamed of it. As for how I'm feeling atm, I'm feeling reassured but also frightened of what decision I just made? Was it the right choice.  Story Time: The reason I am writing this is because an hour ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months, I loved everything about her, but I didn't like myself in the relationship. It was getting to a stage where I felt as if I was turning an individual of hatred and toxic behaviour. Long story short, the behaviours of my ex had transcended into my own thoughts and created the monstrosity that was my personality during the relationship.   I (24M) Ex (23F)  And I hated it, because its not who I am, I needed to get this off my chest because me thinking filling the void is the option, it really isn't. And the relationship I just had with this person has made it so that I now know what I want for the next time.  Thank you coming to my TED talk, I'd love constructive feed back, or an opinion.
439	1	I stuff my feelings to the point that I rarely open up to people, even those I’m close with [SEP] I don’t know why, but I’ve always been a very private person.. and I know, everyone is private about things and everyone has something they usually don’t like to talk about, but for me that’s most of my issues, if not all of them.   This has always been an issue of mine, and it doesn’t seem to even stem from any huge trauma or event in my life (unless my brain is deciding to not remember) and I hate it. People have always urged me to open up to them, usually in a kind, non-aggressive way, simply cause that’s a big sign of a relationship being healthy and trustworthy. And I agree. I hate how I’m not able to open up to people, especially people I’m close with. That’s something most people are able to do in any kind of close relationship, and I truly envy them. But I love being there for others and being their listener. I’ve just never been comfortable enough to have one in my life.   I tend to stuff many of my emotions and that could be a contributor to this issue, but it’s just always been the best way to go about it to me. I could never go out, become friends with someone and end up sharing everything going on in my life not soon after. I’m just not like that. And I know it’s something that I could potentially just go out and change but I’ve had many scenarios where I was given the chance and I hesitated to the point that I just ended up not sharing much. I just hate this part about me and I genuinely don’t know what to do. There’s nothing wrong with being a private person or an open person, I’ve just gotten to the point that I hate how much I stuff and hide my life from others.   Sorry for this rant, and I know it is nothing compared to what many others say on this subreddit, but I truly did need to get this off my chest.
13	1	The Dilemma Facing Everyone In Their 20s. Does anyone have some advice on how to balance working hard and having fun? [SEP] As a young, 19 year old man with big aspirations, I am faced with a ginormous dilemma. On one hand, these are the years where I will be laying the foundation for the rest of my life, so I need to get on my shit and start grinding. But on the other hand, these are also the years where I need to be getting lit and having fun, cause I’m only this young once so I gotta make the most of it. The issue I have is that I have a very hard time balancing the two. I really have no idea how to balance them, and I really want to learn how I can because I do not want to look back on my twenties with regret. So if any older, wiser people could please enlighten me, that would be a blessing. Thank you lol.  I also made a youtube video on this topic if you wanna check it out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrN83ToilCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrN83ToilCE)

453	3	Burned Out [SEP] Sat down today to let out my deepest emotions, dont want any critiques just understanding and support would be nice. IK my grammar can be a bit messy sorry if you have a hard time reading some bits.   &amp;#x200B;  You know, lately days feel like a blur. Months feel like empty conversations, years go by like last nights nice dream that you just cant remember well. Point is, life has been very exhausting ever since I made the decision to be my "better self". Every day i put on my mask all for the sake of becoming this "better/ideal/self sufficient/self loving" version of myself. In all honesty, it felt quite good for a bit, I have plenty of things going on for myself atm; new job, hooking up with pretty girls, working out, learning new skills, reading books, etc... Nevertheless I must be completely honest with myself. Ive never cared for any of those things, sure theyre nice and all, however, deep down I always knew the reason I wanted to implement those changes in my life wasnt just simply because i wanted to settle into a new better lifestyle, no, all I ever wanted and needed was a motivator.   &amp;#x200B;  My motivation originates deeply from my most profound emotional desire, I want to feel loved, to have my feelings reciprocated from a significant other. Confusion hits me from every possible angle as to why I cant fill the void in my heart by myself, why isnt the love I give to myself not enough? do these changes i have made in my life not signify self love and care from me to me?   &amp;#x200B;  In my soul lingers a feeling of an incomplete puzzle, slow but surely I have put together the missing pieces, still, the final piece, no matter how hard I love myself, this final piece wont fit into my life, a womans love. Previously I mentioned I lack a motivator. Whenever i find a person thats valuable enough to fit into my life, they become my motivation and I enter a state of giving a 110% every day all for the sake of becoming my "best version" all for this person and at times forget about me. Circling back the point is, all of these things Ive been doing, I did em all because I felt that if I made those changes and dedicated more time to myself, love would naturally insert itself onto my life and I would recieve that connection I deeply crave. Now that Ive crashed onto the hard concrete truth Im left thinking, is it worth it to keep on going? I feel just as when I started, do I love myself? Absolutely, if I love myself why do I still feel empty inside?   &amp;#x200B;  I crave intimacy, I love feeling vulnerable and sharing that feeling with somebody who understands me. Until the day I find you, when? Only god knows, I promise to be the best I humanly can or you could just say Im running on E these days, cus honestly Ive been waiting for you my whole life and all this time being alone leaves me feeling burned out.    I know youre coming to me as fast as you can, but damn does it hurt waiting for you to get here.   &amp;#x200B;  See you soon.
419	1	Plus-sized clothes are so ugly and I hate it. [SEP] Maybe I haven't found the right stores yet, but nearly all plus-sized clothing is hideous. Whether it's odd cuts, or just weird.   My torso size is technically a medium/large (depending on the store) but because of my boobs, I have to buy XXL to even wear t shirts comfortably. It sucks because I'll see a t shirt that would technically fit, but then I account for my tits and it wouldn't even go over them.  And don't get me started on the fact that some places label size 14 as XL.

663	1	I hate myself because of a fetish [SEP]  I am a 17 year old male.  When I was a younger boy my mom would take me to the bathroom with her. This is a normal practice, and makes sense. What doesn't make sense is why she did this multiple times when I was 10 to 12 years of age. This was the root of my piss fetish. I have clear memories of my mom pissing in front of me at these ages as I was beginning puberty. To me, this was a huge mistake. I don't understand why she let he into the family bathroom with her and my brothers. Maybe she just thought it was convenient that we all used the same bathroom. She never told me not to watch. Although I haven't confronted her about this, with what I've heard in other conversations about telling my much younger brother the truth about sex, she would have probably said that me watching her go to the bathroom at this age was okay because these bodily functions are natural. I'm not sexually attracted to my mother but these incidents led me to start watching piss porn. These memories have scared me and I'm enraged at my mother for doing this. I know I wouldn't have these fetishes if my mom never did this.
524	1	Revenge? Pls help! [SEP] My cousin stole a jacket from me  that belonged to my very beloved grandmother before she passed. My cousin has tried to sell it and I had a friend reach out to buy it and they aren’t selling it any longer. She has been wearing it and I recently messaged her about it since it’s been a year. I was nice and said I don’t want any tension or any problems I just figured since things have blown over between us could I possibly have the jacket back? And I got left on read. I also work with this cousin and she won’t be there for the next 2 weeks. How should I go about getting it back or at the very least make her life hell for causing me so much stress and hurting me?

465	1	I've been trolling my workmates with potato wisdom but I'm running out of steam [SEP] TLDR: For a few years now I've been taking advantage of eastern European ancestry to troll my workmates with potato-themed wisdom from "the old country". Need some help here.  &amp;#x200B;  Going back a few generations my family's Czech, so I have an eastern European name. I was born here and don't have an accent or speak the language or even really know anything about the place, but I do have a name that definitely reads as being from that part of the world. Sidenote, does anyone remember the Latvian jokes that were a thing in these parts a while ago? Well I thought they were funny as shit. But they also taught me that most people don't know anything about eastern Europe, except for some vague ideas about potatoes. So when I started my new job a few years ago, I thought I'd try spicing up the conversation with some fake-ass "sayings" from "the old country", all to do with potatoes of course. I assumed that someone would call me on this shit immediately, we'd have a laugh, and that'd be the end of it. But nobody ever has. A couple of people have asked me where exactly my family's from, but I just say it doesn't exist anymore and I don't want to talk about it (both technically true). And it's got to the point that in team meetings and stuff people expect me to come out with these potato-related aphorisms. It used to be funny but to be honest the pressure is starting to get to me.   &amp;#x200B;  Off the top of my head, here are a few I've used recently:  It's like they say in the old country, the hardest ground hides the sweetest potato.  It's like they say in the old country, the man who marries a potato does not got hungry on his wedding night!  It's like they say in the old country, if you know where you planted the potato there is no need to dig up the cabbages.  It's like they say in the old country, a village with no potatoes is a village with no vodka.  It's like they say in the old country, the man who brings a potato to the party does not need to wipe his feet! (halfway through that one I realised I had no idea how I was going to finish it, I think I did pretty well considering)  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, I'm posting this in the hope I can crowdsource some more of these fuckers, because I'm running out of gas here.
584	1	My BFF Claims I'm Her EX? (22M) [SEP] My BFF (19F) and I are very close to the point people started thinking of us as a couple. I've known her since childhood and we would hang out on weekly basis now. I love her company so much. However, there's nothing more to our relationship aside from being genuine friends.   We do get carried away every once in a while, but it only comes down to us cuddling and kissing, nothing past that. I had some serious affection towards her at one point, but never took the risk.  Just recently, a colleague informed me she had a secondary Instagram account that I had never heard of. She's fairly active there as he stated. I looked it up on my phone, and to my surprise, I couldn't find it at all! Apparently she blocked me specifically on that account, because I was able to find her page through the browser.  The content had me completely baffled. She's been posting up-close pictures of us alone, with very interesting descriptions such as (Good times with my EX &lt;3) for instance.  I figured it would be best not to discuss this with her. Hence why I'm here.

580	1	Feel like im not being my true self [SEP] So, title is a lil confusing but basically. I has a lineof thought that interested me. So when people get older, their joints start hurting and their skin gets wrinkly, mental functions slow down and such. And ive wondered why people dont take preventive measure when theyre younger since im sure theyre aware of it from a young age, then i realized not i am taking any measures. So i went on a journey that ive been on the past 3 ish years. I’ve barely entered my 20s but im taking preventive measure by wearing sunscreen, keeping a good bmi, strengthening my joints and most importantly keeping mentally active to slow down the degradation of these things. Having the foresight to even do anything about these things makes me feel good but lately ive been letting it intrude in my social life by having a much more different approach to social situations to produce the least amount of regret, but sometime i dont want to do that and just want to be childish and scream at my friends that deserve it. I guess im just forcing myself to be more mature? Not sure. Just wanted to get this “off my chest”

535	1	My 12 year old daughter beat brain cancer!!!!!!!!! [SEP] Aggressive Medulloblastoma, golf ball sized. After Almost 1 year of surgeries, radiation, chemo, therapy. MRI was cancer free for the first time. I had to tell someone, everyone, she’s amazing, and for a while we weren’t sure of anything. Two weeks before diagnosis we were in Disney with our three daughters, normal fun vacation. Hug your kids, you never know.

435	1	Woke up with a cold sore [SEP] It’s oral herpes I know and nothing to be ashamed of.  Just that, I have no idea how I got it.  I told my boyfriend if he ever got cold sores and he said he hasn’t so not sure who or what I got it from.  Sucks but oh well I guess everyone is bond to get it at some point :/
424	1	My (m40) FWB (f41) makes me feel gross about sex. [SEP] Her and I hit it off pretty well when we first met. We still get along great as friends. And I did find her to be attractive when we first started hooking up.   Then, over time I just lost the desire/drive to have sex with her. When we do get intimate I usually have to be buzzed and even then I'm not that into it while she gets REALLY into it. Which makes me feel weird and kind of shitty. I've tried to talk to her about it as respectfully and delicately as possible and usually end up on the lie that my testosterone must be low from age (my libido is as virile as ever).  Still I keep allowing it to happen amd I feel like shit about it. She's a good person amd deserves better but every time I even suggest she pursue a real relationship with a decent guy she gets hurt.   I have been clear about the fact I genuinely do not want to be in a relationship with ANYONE (truth) and she's ok with that but still expects me to be her walking dildo. And I give in. And feel gross about it. It's getting to the point t where I feel like moving to another city just to change up this rut I've allowed to develop.
51	1	Coping [SEP] I just stopped smoking weed, I need help on things to cope. I smoked for over six years now I really want to change.
640	1	I’m not a happy person but my boyfriend has saved me from a life of sadness [SEP] We’ve been together for 3 years, and whilst we’re still fairly young (20’s), we’re completely and utterly in love.   My entire life, since my adoption I’ve been lonely, anxious and sad, and my parents never really cared to notice and I never thought another person would ever care about me. I assumed I would spend my life alone, as I thought I was unlovable, unattractive and undeserving of happiness.   My boyfriend is honestly the best thing that’s ever happened to me. He sends me sweet messages and love notes and buys me stuffed toys whenever I visit him. I know it’s silly but I’m 100% sure that I will only ever be in love with him. I know we were meant to be. All of the odd coincidences that occur make me think we were fated.   Sometimes when I think about him I get so excited in my heart that I forget to breathe and I have to calm myself down.   He’s just the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen and I’m so in love with him.   P.s I’m sorry if this sounds like I’m bragging I just wanted to share this as sometimes I feel like I can’t contain it :)

429	2	I’ll never be a father [SEP] My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for well over 2 years now. She was pregnant at one point and we were over the moon. We bought a lot of recourses for the baby. But when she turned 3 months my wife had a miscarriage. We were devastated, we known each other since senior year of high school she knows how long I’ve wanted to be a dad.I was struggling with depression after my beloved dog died but this just topped it all of.I would stay in my room all day and not even come out, I would cry all day, my wife is over it as it was 2 weeks ago, we knew how common it is for miscarriages to happen but we prayed it wouldn’t happen to us. During the week she had a miscarriage my wife would randomly cry and I’d just be there holding her for hours. I don’t think my wife has ever seen me cry tbh. I’m struggling mentally rn and it’s all getting too stressful with all this and work im taking days off frequently now and my co workers have noticed. My sister is talking about her kids all the time. One time few weeks ago we went to dinner with my parents and sister and her husband. She said that she knows so many good baby names. My wife pulled a dirty look at her while I I grabbed the keys and sat in the car for a few hours crying. I know crying doesn’t do anything to help but it helps people let what they are feeling. No one in my family has seen me cry. Al I want is a happy healthy baby boy or girl idc bout the sex I just want one thing.

355	1	I feel wrong saying the truth to my mom [SEP] A decade back I dropped out of uni and my mom covered my debts.  I went abroad and managed to earn a lump sum in next 5 years.  Later dad went abroad too and I found out he went bankrupt and house was mortgaged, so to save family's house I covered his debts(a pretty big sum) without telling mom I was the one who did it. I know dad did not tell her either.  Shortly after my dad was going back(less than half a year), and with mom's persuasion I went back to try uni again.  I only brought back home minimal sum, as I spent most of my money abroad to support dad's debt from bankruptcy.  Couple of years have passed and right now I'm living in 2nd floor of parents house, but mom is putting constant pressure to take uni more seriously (I have also finished professional school for thing I actually wanna do in that time), all while working. I work, do university minimally, and spend rest of my time for myself.   And when I told her I wanna work in my own field for couple of years and go abroad again, she went hysterical, using my old time abroad as an excuse( minimal visits back home, small amount of money brought home after 5+ years and such). This acting hysterical is on repeat for months now.   And I am honestly barely able to hold on without talking about it being me who covered dad's debts and that I only came back to try uni once again, as I wanted to honour mom's wish, as she was really kind by covering my debts and letting me go rent free while living here.

331	1	Feeling stuck.. [SEP] I finally have a good job with good pay. Something I have been waiting for, for a while. But for some reason I’m not happy. I feel stuck. I feel like I should be doing something else but I’m afraid of quitting and then regretting it. I have bills to pay so I can’t afford not to work right now. Any advice?

463	1	I (34M) found out my dad who passed away was not actually my biological father [SEP] Long-ish post, so TLDR at bottom.   The year I was born, my dad almost died from some medical issues. This set the stage for life as I would know it and I just always knew him dealing with these issues. Despite his numerous medical issues throughout my life, he was always up to go toss a baseball around, take me to the park, shoot some hoops, go on bike rides, whatever. All this while holding down a full time job and coaching my little league team. He was the epitome of what a good father is and ALWAYS had a picture of me in his wallet to show off/boast to his friends.   Fast forward to a couple years ago when his medical issues began to really catch up with him and he made the conscious decision (with family included) to stop seeking care and peacefully passed away in our family home. I spent the last 24 hours of his life holding his hand and slowly watching him slip away. For those that haven't lost a parent yet, it completely reshapes your world. Instantly the world felt bigger and scarier, despite being a full grown adult who has served in the military. My dad was the one person I could always count on being there and giving honest advice.   I was recently gifted a DNA test by a friend. I took it thinking it would be fun to see my family heritage and all that. I got the results and it was pretty much what I imagined, but I immediately noticed my mom being kind of weird about it. I told her that it showed what continents relatives likely came from, etc. And I also pointed out that it said I had family (distant cousins) in the Idaho/Washington areas, which is not where I knew my family to be from. She sort of laughed it off a couple times and I thought nothing of it.   Then I was contacted by one of those "distant cousins" who was excited to have a DNA connection. They reached out asking about family surnames and all that and I quickly realized something was off. People that we were linked to, by DNA, were people I had never heard of. One thing led to another and I casually called my mom to ask about a certain name that kept popping up. She broke down on the phone and began apologizing saying that I was never supposed to find out.   Still confused, and maybe not wanting to see the reality, I pressed her. Eventually it came out that she had had an affair on who I thought was my biological father. She gave me all the details about who my biological father was and even said that I had met him at one point when I was 1 or 2 years old.   All this information ripped open all the healing that had happened since my dad died and brought up one burning question: did he know? Did he know that I wasn't actually his child? If he did know, it makes him that much more impressive that he raised me as his own, but then leads me to wonder why he wouldn't have told me literally on his death bed.   I haven't spoken with my mom or biological father since finding out. Just typing this all out has me in tears and angry, and it's been years now since I found out. I don't know if this pain ever goes away, but it is the worst feeling.   &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR - found out via DNA test that my father whom I loved was not my biological father. He is now dead and I will never truly know if he knew or not, because my mom had an affair.

449	1	My sister might be a murderer [SEP] This is normally something I would never put out there but my name isn't out here and I need to talk about this.  7 years ago, my family moved across the country, and my sister did not come with us. She took her daughter and went who knows where, certainly not us, and we didn't hear from her for 6 1/2 years. December, we found out she was arrested for possibly killing her daughter, my niece... and my parents, with little to no evidence drew up their own conclusions. Dad is sure she didn't do it, and mom is certain she did do it. I've been trying to sit back and see how the case plays out but mom has been telling me I need to back her up. My sister was released and now I'm being told that she's gonna be coming here. And it frustrates me that both of them can be so certain about what happened, when neither of them were there and neither of them have the evidence to back them up. My mom is in tears right now, this is really bothering her and I don't know what to do.

41	1	Kids [SEP] I wish I had the attention span and drive to want kids but… Literally nothing. The idea of having kids seems so intense and draining. I don’t hate on anyone with them, but… is there something wrong with me?? Like the idea of kids sounds nice, but then thinking of living a life in reality with kids is… too much. Loud, sticky, unnecessary.
241	2	Stuck on stupid [SEP] As I’ve moved through the last few years of my adult life I feel I’m constantly making mistakes. At work or just general life things I’m always doing or saying the wrong thing. My boss and an ex have both said things like “wow, how can you be wrong so many times in a day” No matter how closely I’m paying attention to work something always slips through the cracks. I don’t know how to manage this. It makes me angry at myself and I end up lashing out at whoever is around. I feel like an idiot all the time.
440	2	I feel like my mom died all over again [SEP] My mom died December 20, 2017. Her little dog, a female daschund named Little Bit just died this morning and I'm having a hard time dealing with it.  It feels like my mom died all over again. My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I knew Little Bit was on her way out but I never thought it would hit me this hard. It feels like the last piece of my mom died again and I feel so very sad.
533	1	My boyfriend does nothing but smoke weed and play video games and I've had it. [SEP] I am angry. This motherfucker has been smoking weed since he was 10. Hes 35 now and his entire life revolves around smoking weed and playing his fucking video games/watching tv. Doesn't go outside. Doesn't want to do anything unless his ass is planted on the couch and hes stoned. His friends come over?  Time to bust out the bong and play a game for 10 hours until they leave and then watch TV until he passes out. Go to work, come home, turn on TV and smoke all day, wait until I come home to make food, go to bed.  Rinse, repeat. Doesn't cook. Barely helps me clean. Can't be fucking bothered to do ANYTHING that would help us get ahead. Wants buy a house but won't actually help look for one, i have to do all the legwork. Wants to eat better, won't help me make lists or cook it. Tells people we are getting married soon, but when I question it "it's not a good time right now/we will soon." Always says shit like "I would love to take you to x-y-z, let's plan something" but never follows through. Wants to go see more of the state we live in but does nothing to help plan, and if I ask him to help he doesn't. Honestly I'm fucking tired of the excuses and his shitty, angry attitude when he isn't high. It's become a crutch and he refuses to help himself. 10 years or this and I've had it.   This fool has been stringing me along for almost 10 years, and I hate that it's taken me this long to realize I've been fucking played. It hurts because once I loved him more than anything and thought I could make it work. When we first started dating I was very active and he was always down to go do something.  Right until he conned me into moving in and then he refused to do anything.  Lots of people smoke weed and have fulfilling lives. My boyfriend doesn't. It's his whole personality and it has seeped into everything. There is a litteral outline of him in the couch because he doesnt leave it.    I realize now that the only reason he wants me around is because I am a dependable roommate who cleans,cooks, and pays bills on time.  I can't wait until this lease is up so I can move back to my family and people that give a shit. I miss the loving, charming man you were.  As for you, you are going to wake up in your 40's and realize you've literally wasted your entire life being stoned in front of a TV. What a fucking waste. You put more effort into procuring a goddamn ps5 than you have ever put into anything.  I couldn't fucking believe it.   I sMoKe AnD iM fInE. SoUnDs LiKe YoU nEeD tO sMoKe A jOiNt. Get fucked. People like you are the reason I stopped. I am so fucking tired of all the excuses stoners come up with to justify their behavior and push off any responsibility for their actions. I can't wait to put all this shit behind me.
604	1	I think I have a crush [SEP] I recently reconnected with someone I went to high school with. He’s really sweet and we’ve been hanging out a little bit. Today we hung out one on one and went on a hike. He kept getting close and I thought maybe he wanted to kiss me but I’m not good at reading those cues so obviously we didn’t. I was in a relationship for a really long time before this so I’m not about to rush things. I’d be ok to be friends but I do think I have a little crush on him :) it’s kinda fun

489	3	I'm glad guys with big dicks sometimes (supposedly) hurt their partners and feel bad about it. [SEP] I'm not glad a woman's getting hurt in the process, but as far as they guy is concerned, they deserve it. They deserve to feel the kind of pain you get when hurting someone you love, or at least be told no for once in their lives. I'm still only convinced this happens to guys who're like 10 inches long, but still. Its the closest they'll feel to humility.
345	1	My friend (F28) lied to me (f24) about being a virgin and I’m hurt. [SEP] **TW** mention of SA  I was reading u/angelndrinks post on here and it made me feel comfortable enough to share this. I have a friend I consider her a close friend. I’m attracted to her but never made a move because I don’t know if she feels the same way but sometimes I get the feeling she does. We talk about sex sometimes within our friend group and she’s told us she’s slept with x amount of people and vice versa, it’s just a conversation we were having, not a big deal. Until my other friend who’s part of your friend group and is also close to her tells me she’s actually a virgin. I was shocked but not because of her age. I was shocked and hurt that my friend felt the need to lie.  We have another friend who’s also a virgin and she let us know and we didn’t mind it so I didn’t understand why she felt the need to lie to us. I confronted her about it and let her know it’s not fair for her to lie to me since we’re friends. If she chose not to disclose her sexual life at all that’s perfectly fine, she’s not obligated to and it’s no one business. But it’s the fact that she felt the need to lie to me about it that bothers me so much. Because it made me feel like she didn’t trust me, like she didn’t think of me as a true friend. I told her all of that. I also told her about our friend who’s a virgin. She said our friend was fine with risking us name calling her, judging her and making her feel like she’s weird hence why she told us.  I couldn’t believe she said this..! I got even more offended and asked her how she could think that we’d do any of that to her, because like I said, we’re close friends and she should trust me enough because friends don’t judge friends. That’s when she told me it didn’t matter that we were friends because people do whatever they want to do to others and it’s something you can’t help or stop. When I asked her what she meant she revealed to me that she had a best friend who she was raised with and grew up with and saw as a sibling. This guy ended up sexually assaulting her when they were both 14 in high school. The next thing she says is I need to stop making friendship sound like some candyland world because it isn’t.  I actually started crying when she left. I cried because I felt for her. I hated she had that experience. Nobody deserves that especially her because she really is a sweetheart. I think the assault shaped the way she views a lot of things. I’m hurting in different ways. For her and what she went through and also because I guess we’re not as close as I thought we were.
184	1	A new nature [SEP] walls are our mountains, carpets our grass, lampposts our trees, roads our rivers, lamps our sun, concrete our rocks, a new nature, the made has become the raw
514	1	My girlfriend said something that really bothered me and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. [SEP] Today we were watching my nieces and they wanted to paint. I’m into art and they love art so they always want to do something along those lines when they are around us. I’m all for it. When they asked today my gf asked me for paper, I went and grabbed some and brought it back out to the table. I’ll admit I was kind of staring into space because I couldn’t think of something to put under their paper to prevent paint getting on the table because we don’t have newspaper. Then my girlfriend spoke up.  The conversation went like:  Her: “Do you not want them to paint or something?”  Me: “No, that’s not the case I’m just thinking of something to put under their papers because it’s not for paint and it might bleed through”  My girlfriend then let out a big huff and grabbed a cardboard box to put under it and everything was cool, even though I thought it was weird she got irritated with me over that?  So then we are walking back to the bedroom real quick and she goes   “You realize they’re kids, not dogs right? They aren’t going to make some big huge mess.”  Me:”Geez, I just wanted to put something under there to help just in case. Why do you instantly accuse me of treating them like animals?”  Her: “I’m not even accusing you of that, that’s not even what I said.”  I just didn’t feel like arguing with her so I just left it at that. But like, isn’t that gaslighting???!!! This isn’t the first time something like this has happened but like, didn’t she literally condescendingly say I was treating the girls like dogs then completely flip the script and say that’s not what she’s doing? I hate this feeling.

So today i was there at 10.30 and we started at 11:30 in a studio, and i lifted that suitcase the entire day because i'm stupid. btw that suitcase was like 15 kilos. But hey, i made it home ( :

520	1	Got fired during probation period today. Still happy. [SEP] Hi. Got the news on Wednesday evening but today is my last day on the company where I worked for a month. Can't say I'm ok with their reasons to fire me, but damn I feel happy. Haven't liked the company from the 1st day: not very comfortable workplace, people like robots, not friendly at all, but a good salary (the only upside) and maybe some benefits in the future. And yeah, it hurts too hear that you've been fired, but holy shit, how freeing it felt. I will finally finish Witcher 3, will improve some work skills that I've wanted. Of course I'll search for a job, but that's tomorrow. Today I'm just happy I'm free

7	1	Never be afraid of reaching your lowest point [SEP] Over the last year I have achieved my darkest time. My lowest point.   Anyone out there thats afraid of this time or position in life. Don't fight it. If its coming to that point its coming if you fight it or just allow it to come.   You will find your greatest strengths. You will find out you are your greatest prize. You need nothing but yourself to survive. No one. Nothing adds to you BUT YOU!  Face this demon and not only will you see the things you thought were so important in life are simply not only not important but you will see what you really would like to add to your life.  Being able to leave what doesn't add to you is so powerful.   Anyone going through this i hope this helps.
234	1	Started my first “adult job” and I have a question? [SEP] I graduated college in may and finally started a full time position doing mortgage lending. I’ve been working for 2 weeks so I’m very new. Everything is work from home so my training is all done via zoom, I spend 8-12 hours a day staring at a computer. I’ve noticed Atleast 3-5 days a week I wake up with a headache or I start to get a headache towards the end of the day. Is this related to staring at a computer for so long and not being used to it? Or is this something I need to see a doctor about? Any input is much appreciated. Thanks for your help!
515	1	I have a friend who I’ve been thinking about more and more recently and I’m kinda conflicted about it [SEP] I’m studying abroad for my years in university and my friend from back home has been taking care of his dad (full time) for a few years now. Because of it, he doesn’t get out much. Meanwhile, I’m across an ocean and getting my studies done. When I’m home, I visit of course but I don’t get to much.   He’s honestly super sweet and we’ve been talking a lot more now on the phone. We play video games and watch shows together. It’s always really fun honestly and I find myself laughing and smiling regardless of everything.   We’ve also started flirting with each other from time to time—minuscule things of course. I have to admit it’s fun.   There are a few issues though: - his best friend would be someone I have to put up with. His best friend and I were friends until he cheated on one of my close friends (they were married), used a lot of her money, and sent a cropped sibling photo to my little sister (if you catch my drift) - my first love… is someone he considers a brother. Don’t get me wrong, I’m over him and all but that feels a little weird  Nonetheless, this is all happening and it makes me happy but also feel weird because of those two things. I mean, even though we’re far from each other, it’s not like either of us would be making huge moves like that until after he’s not responsible for his dad and I have goals to establish myself in business.   Those kinda give me right person wrong time vibes but I just don’t know. For now, I can’t help feeling conflicted but a little happy. I wonder if that’s weird.

[SEP] We created so many layers upon layers of mankind inventions that nature has taken a back seat despite the fact it’s the very thing that keeps us alive and many of us sane. It’s like the whole highway system, drive a car, go to a job, make money, save money, save for retirement, pay taxes and so on and I guess to a degree part of this is due to the fact we are the most advanced creatures on this planet as humans, we made this complex society with our minds and our ideas and our inventions and I guess partly we can marvel how I am able to utter these thoughts as a human being on a digital platform and have total strangers like you read my post from thousands of miles away.  Us humans did this- we invented technology, our thoughts and ideas are part of what continuously improves it. But at the same time, look at birds, squirrels other animals they live a life of stress like running from prey but the life seems so much more simple you live you eat you take care of your young then you sleep rinse and repeat. It seems so much more and excuse the pun, “down to earth” it’s like when you see squirrels playing on a tree while 2 drivers get angry at each other in traffic you can’t help but wonder if we overdid ourselves, that we made life to complex and to stressful for our own good.  There is so much to marvel and be proud of what we accomplished, but I feel there is also such a strong compelling case towards a simple life- one that says hey 👋 slow down. Relax. Stop. Breathe.   Lay on the ground and stare up at the sky and study the architecture of random trees. Watch random animals play. Learn how to think and wonder again. Instead of entrapping your mind in mankind’s inventions and concepts - nature perhaps is the answer toward a better more fulfilling life is we take the time to embrace its brilliant simplicity.

826	1	The ringing in someone's ear is a sound that only they can hear but also a sound that does not exist. [SEP]
228	2	Is life even real [SEP] Why do i feel like sometimes my eyes are just windows and i am simply looking through them but now actually in my body. I feel like life is fake theres no way i exist right now.
644	1	my cousin is being manipulated by her boyfriend [SEP] My cousin was very good friends with this guy before they started dating a few months ago. He’s not the usual type she’d go for, so throughout the relationship he’s been insecure and always questioning her. Recently, he threatened to kill himself if she ever left him, and he’s been talking about ways to kill himself. He’s been obsessed with her and within the first week of dating he said loves her, and would never be the one to end the relationship. She doesn’t think he’s manipulating her and just thinks he really loves her. She’s been wanting to break up with him for 2 weeks but doesn’t have the guts, and now this just happened and she’s afraid he’s gonna hurt himself. We’re like sisters and i’m afraid he’s gonna hurt/kill her if he’s willing to go this far to manipulate her. He said he won’t talk to a therapist or anyone to get help. I’m not sure how to confront her and talk some sense into her without overstepping my boundaries. It’s really stressing me out about what he might do to her.

736	1	You can't imagine something from scratch, all you do is modify or combine things that already exist [SEP]
409	1	I hate myself because I have an awful, exploitative fetish [SEP] I am a 17 year old male.   When I was a younger boy my mom would take me to the bathroom with her. This is a normal practice, and makes sense. What doesn't make sense is why she did this multiple times when I was 10 to 12 years of age. This was the root of my piss fetish. I have clear memories of my mom pissing in front of me at these ages as I was beginning puberty. To me, this was a huge mistake. I don't understand why she let he into the family bathroom with her and my brothers. Maybe she just thought it was convenient that we all used the same bathroom. She never told me not to watch. Although I haven't confronted her about this, with what I've heard in other conversations about telling my much younger brother the truth about sex, she would have probably said that me watching her go to the bathroom at this age was okay because these bodily functions are natural. I'm not sexually attracted to my mother but these incidents led me to start watching piss porn. These memories have scared me and I'm enraged at my mother for doing this.
936	1	You don't need to use wet wipes when you have diarrhea because you bring the wet. [SEP]
598	1	Chasing after girls [SEP] I'm a 22-year-old college student currently studying law in Hungary. Not so long ago i was cheated on, and for some reason it didn't have a huge impact on me apart from being a bit depressed in the beginning. (i have had enough of my previous relationship, that's why I moved on quite easily) Tbh i liked the fact that i'm free and can get to know other girls. But in the last two weeks i was so desperate cashing after girls in parties and I had no courage to make a move for some reason. In the past I did not have problems with this, this kinda makes me insecure also.  Now the main problem with my mentality is that I am trying to find my happiness in these actions. I don't consider myself ugly, I regularly work out and everything. But I find myself lacking so much confidence. Maybe I'm having a midlife crisis thinking I will be left out from these experiences. And by not experiencing these moments I will be worth less than somebody. Is anyone else in the same boat?  Thank you for reading this.
730	2	Maybe you know someone who'll end up being the last living person on Earth [SEP]
635	1	NSFW I bought nipple correctors [SEP] I was looking around at adult toys and found these nipple corrector, or rather suction cups for nipples. And they came in a 3 pack. I wanted to get something to help spice up mine and my husband's sex life and thought he'd love it if my nipples were bigger/stuck out more. The third one I use for my cl*t and omg had the best O in my life!! If anyone is curious just get it, it's super worth it. I used to not be so sensitive down there but now it's super sensitive and I love it!! So now my husband loves my nipples even more and I love my lady bit even more 💕 win win in my books 🥰🥰
5	1	If someone made a movie about you, what would it be? [SEP] I find myself thinking that very often about myself.
756	1	If Billy Joel didn’t want people to think he started fires, he shouldn’t have released a song vehemently denying having started fires. [SEP] I never thought of Billy Joel in the context of arson before that song came out, but ever since, I occasionally wonder if it was to mask a dark secret.
976	1	We are all side characters in someone else's story. [SEP]
591	1	I broke up with my boyfriend and have no one to talk to. [SEP] I (19f) broke up with my boyfriend (22m) this morning. We dated a little more than a year. It was my first relationship and he was a lot of my firsts, but we weren't compatible. I can't tell my friends because they'll give him shit, even though we're still on good terms. I can't tell my parents because they'll baby me about it, which I know comes out of a place of love, but I don't need that right now. It's just me and my cat, which is probably the best company.
326	1	Why change can be so difficult for some [SEP]  The best definition of resentment is to “refeel” something i.e. a negative or traumatic event(s). I went through the better part of my life trying to make new endings to “tapes” that were long over. In turn, I fell into the unhealthy habits and behaviors related to unaccountability… The good news for me came not all at once, but over a ten-year period of awakening. I personally and fully understand why the principle of accountability can be hard to attain for so many.

726	2	We have all been inside our mothers [SEP]
517	1	I touched my crush’s butt at work [SEP] My crush and I work at a fast food restaurant. We have to get food out from the windows to the kitchen and package them. There are two windows. The first window is the largest and more open space and where more of the salads and burritos come out. The second window is where more fried food comes out. There is considerably less space, and the counter by the window is curved.   My crush was at the second window packaging some food up. I had to go to the window as well to inquire about a customer’s fries. When I left, I didn’t realize how close I was and my hand accidentally grazed his butt.   I immediately apologized, telling him I didn’t realize how close I was to him. He was smiling saying that it was okay. I just feel so embarrassed. We’re good friends, and I think he’s into me, because he’s flirted with me in the past, but I don’t want him to think that I’m a pervert  Tl;dr: crush and I work in a fast food restaurant. The space we work in is small, and I walked past him, accidentally grazing his butt
232	2	The Vastness Of Life [SEP] Just the fact you’re reading this right now, at whatever time in whatever place, can be an example of how vast I see life. You’re one of the, I don’t know how many, people to be thinking about this exact topic and thing out of all the people living currently, previously, or in the future.  Out of all those people, I believe only a very few people will see this. Also consider every person who has ever lived up to this point never even had a chance to see this or think about life in this kind of context.   Thinking out of all of time, Reddit is a fairly new thing and has only been a platform for sharing content since it’s creation in 2005. Everything posted on here has only been able to be seen and experienced by other Reddit users. There’s about 330 million current Reddit users and a total world population of 7.8 Billion. That’s only 4.23% of the world right now. So even if everyone on Reddit sees this post, that will be all  of the people this will ever be seen by.   You’re probably still just thinking about this on a planetary scale. Think about the future. Elon musk has plans to colonize Mars. How many people born after the year 2050 will see this? Will someone born on Mars ever think about me and my thoughts as I typed this?   Hopefully this will get you to think about you and your life because it has really changed how I look at life. Don’t take the little things for granted.
890	1	English native speakers cannot go abroad and think that they can talk freely and won't be understood in a public place [SEP]
656	1	I have a job interview but don’t want to go. [SEP] I am looking for a second job to make ends meet. I’m a preschool teacher and really do like the place I’m working at. They allow visible tattoos and colorful hair. The new place I’m interviewing is for a weekend job and it is also in a preschool setting. It looked fine and dandy until I booked my appointment and they sent secondary paperwork to do. It included their mission which touts acceptance and whatnot. It also stated no visible tattoos and no colorful hair. I have a tattoo on each forearm and dye my hair dark purple from time to time. What bothers me is that hiding these tattoos is hiding a part of me. I know many people are struggling to get jobs and I feel guilty on the possibility of canceling this job.
670	1	In the distant future, if all copies of a movie are lost but copies of the script survive, people may film the entire movie again to see how movies were in the XXth and XXIth centuries. [SEP]
402	2	men are not attracted to women but to femininity [SEP] but I already knew that
527	1	I am a 21 year old who has never orgasmed from sex. [SEP] Yep. I can masturbate and cum but I've never orgasmed purely from penis in vagina. I don't know if I have a porn addiction, a masturbation addiction, or what. I still have a sex drive. I can still get erect. I still want to have sex with females. It just doesn't feel as good to me as masturbation.  I've tried to stop masturbating but I can't go more than just a few days. Maybe that means I do have an addiction. But I'm also a horny 21 and the masturbation doesn't negatively effect my life besides the trouble orgasming. I don't know.   Its been tough on me. The girls I've been with have been really kind and understanding. If anything they like it more because I can go longer. The sex does feel good to me. I just can't reach that point. I don't feel like a man. Or atleast I don't know what most other men have felt. I don't know  This is something that's really hard for me to talk about and having a throwaway helps. Thanks for reading.
151	1	Anyone feel like you aren’t truly living if you work a 9-5? [SEP] I like my job but I’ve been thinking the last few days about how I feel like I’m missing out on life at times because I’m glued to my desk almost all day. I mean, think about it, you don’t really have control over your day to day. For example, you can’t go outside much during the day and experience the weather, can’t spend much time with pets because you’re busy and at your desk all day, etc. I just feel like you can’t really appreciate the little day to day things because you’re at your desk all the time or just don’t have time to do so. Thoughts?
587	3	Nobody really cares about you [SEP] Especially here on Reddit.. Whenever you post something, you may get a few views but not always. Whenever you do, your gonna sometimes run into a**holes
400	1	I hate my dad [SEP] Throwaway because I am an older teen who still lives under my parents' roof and don't want to compromise my safety. I'll try not to be too specific as well for that reason, since I suspect he might use reddit and I know for a fact my mom uses reddit.   Warning that this will probably not be organized at all.   I know that all parents get frustrated with their kids at some point, but my dad does absolutely nothing to hide it. He cannot take anything from me he deems "unrespectful". He cannot deal with anything that encourages him to change. He just yells at me and says things like "you should respect me because I am your father" until I retreat defeated since he won't listen to a word I say, then comes back later with a fake-ass """"apology"""" or asks me a question like "am I a good father?" Neither of which I can answer honestly to, since on the occasion I do, he just yells at me again and rinse and repeat. I know the apologies are always fake since he just does the exact same thing again later with no effort to change. Also this is not a rare occurence. This happens pretty much daily.   This is probably much less of an actual problem and more of something that I just find annoying but my dad also has trouble letting things go. My younger sister passed away some months ago and her birthday is coming up soon, and my dad wants to hold a birthday party? With cake and everything??? For someone who is dead??? Sometimes I wonder if he realizes she's not coming back?   As for my mom, she is kinder, more genuine and understanding towards me, but she always gets defensive of him, probably because he acts differently around her. When he talks to her he is pretty much always complaining about something and sounds like he's constantly trying to get her to buy his story and get her to relate to him and understand his side, despite it seeming totally unnecessary, since, you know, she has been married to him for 20 years and should trust him???   Am I overreacting??? I have no idea what to do here.
873	2	At least a few warehouse workers have touched a sex toy incidentally making them sex traffickers and workers. [SEP]
480	1	If you’re in your early 20s there is no reason to get married [SEP] My sister is in her first and only long term relationship with someone 3 years older than us (twin 24F). They’ve been together for a while (6 years) but have a lot of concrete problems that really will affect their marriage if they decide to go that route (communication and financial issues).  I had a neighbor who got married at 25 and is now divorced not even 2 years later. Another friend is also divorced who is 25.   Why is everyone trying to get married so early? I’m seeing posts here on Reddit of people under 25 who are married and hitting walls in their marriages, wanting to get divorced. It’s just bothering me everyone is in this rush. Not that I’m in a relationship and someone’s trying to make me get married or anything but I’m just confused. Where’s the fire, y’all?
510	1	i get irritated/stressed about people who constantly whine about their position in life when there are people I see everyday that don’t have NOTHING. [SEP] It just frustrates me to the highest extent to keep hearing people who have a need to consistently whine and complain about not having the things they want in life. There are people out in this world who make $9 an hour with children and have to work 5x as hard when the person working who has a car, who makes $17/hr, with no children. People can be so selfish and not realize there is more to life than MONEY. If something ain’t making you happy you have a decision to make. SOME PEOPLE CANT AFFORD TO QUIT THEIR JOB. ESPECIALLY IN THIS CLIMATE OF THE WORLD.  People need to recognize how lucky they are to be alive, well and not worrying if you are gonna have food on the table for the next few days.
693	1	Alvin and the Chipmunks are the first virtual idols. [SEP]
182	3	Is it really true that you need other people to actually make something out of life? [SEP] Thing is, I don't want to keep the drama and unnecessary bullsh*ts that people do.  Some are useless, some are judgemental, some think too highly of themselves etc... and so on.  I'd rather just have my own back instead of relying or at the very least, facing these kinds of people that might as well just jump into a pool of lava and realize it themselves how sorry they are as an excuse for a human being.
585	2	I wake up everyday wanting to die [SEP] I’m not sure where to start but I literally have to get this off my chest and I don’t have any friends at all or family I can talk to. I appreciate anyone listening. I’ve been suicidal since I was 9. I’ve attempted 2 times. Im a young adult now, finished high school close to a year ago. I don’t have a job but am constantly/consistently applying or lookinh for one everyday. I haven’t gotten any professional help for my mental health. I don’t have a doctor at the moment, my mom changed hers and said I have to get my own. I’ve been mentally abused and neglected since a young age. My mother told me,since a young age, to NEVER trust doctors or tell them how you’re really feeling because all they want is money out of us and they don’t REALLY want to help. I have two siblings. One is super successful and living his life ( barely contacts me or my other sibling since they live their best life.) The other sibling (the oldest sibling) lives with me and my mother and her boyfriend. My moms boyfriend has changed my mom into a horrible person. I remember being 9 years old and she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore once she got with this man. I was basically homeless at that time, living with a cousin and decided to try and kill myself. It didn’t work out, I was at the hospital. My mom was there and decided that all of the sudden she would try and take care of me. Til this day she wants me and my older sibling out of the house. I clean around the house and do anything she asks but it’s not enough unless I have a job. I’m so depressed bruh I just want to leave and there’s so much more but why talk about my shitty life if It doesn’t matter anyway. I have a cat and I love him very much. He keeps me going.

66	1	Health = life. How to heal lungs after many years of smoking? [SEP] Any exercises (breathing exercises), habits, practices, physical therapy, nutritional guidance, and any other recommendations/advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated.   I smoked for years and recently quit (not cigarettes if that makes a difference). I can still feel a shortness of breath and tightness of chest as well as hear wheezing, especially when I breathe in and out hard. Sometimes I look at my old pipe and see and smell the crud built up in it and am disappointed that that is also what’s inside my body now. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve lung health?   I greatly appreciate any and all of of your input.
684	1	Showers are conducive to deep thinking because they’re the last place left where we don’t bring our phones. [SEP]
128	2	I wish.... [SEP] I just want 100 acres in the middle of nowhere. A huge garden, a pond for my fishies and to bring life to my garden, a huge ass tub where I can float under the stars, a big beautiful outdoor kitchen, and just a place to vibe and only hear my own sound. I’m so tired of all the fucking noise. I find things everyday to make myself smile and just find some joy. Dreaming and planning this goal makes me happy.
908	1	We can look at something and know what it would feel like on our tongue if we licked it. [SEP]
709	1	If Google diagnose you with death then Bing must give you something far worse then death. [SEP]
595	1	I think I'm just here for the dopamine hits [SEP] Currently recovering from porn addiction. I think this sub has become a substitute for porn. That said I do feel bad for some of you. Others are just trolling and have great writing skills that's it's hard to discern which stories are fake and which are real. Or maybe I don't care enough to analyze more closely.
554	3	I think humans are evil species and that World war 3 should cleanse the earth from humans [SEP] I feel bad seeing people die. I feel sad seeing people suffer, but I also feel like it is in human nature to commit evil. As I grow older I feel like a nuclear war that would erase humans from the face of earth is the best option.  Someone would call me depressed, evil and cynical. But I am not. I am a realist. I see things from neutral perspective and from a greater angle. I would not like a World war 3 without nuclear weapons. I would like a World War 3 that guarantees the destruction of human life for good. No suffering, but instant nuclear death.  Does anyone disagree or agree with my thought? I am willing to hear other people and what they think.
133	2	23M, Life is scaring me. [SEP] I'm 23 Years Old. And I constantly feel tired and afraid of life. Got my first job last year which seemed like a dream job at the time. Fell in love with a colleague. I had never connected with anybody the way I had connected with her. It felt unreal and yet so real. Everything was well and good until the job pressure kept building up, I lost her as well. I've been a proper mess since. Now I'm really scared for my career cause I've been working at this since I was basically a kid. Devoted all my time to it. I keep telling myself it's gonna be alright.. but I feel I'm lying to myself. I do have my hobbies and try to get out on the road and explore as much as possible but these days all I can think of is work. And it's Just ruining what little peace of mind I can muster. Things aren't great at home and given the fact that I need to stay at home 24x7 cause of covid just makes the entire thing worse. I chickened out of talking to a therapist multiple times. I just didn't feel I deserved to. And yet here I am ranting away on Reddit. I'm not sure if it's okay to be this lost in life.
405	1	I don't know my sexuality and I feel lost about myself [SEP] I remember when I was 12 I first started questioning my sexuality and just who I'm attracted to. I've always felt that me being straight doesn't really feel correct and I've wondered and read a lot to find answers. I used to think that I was bi-sexual, but now that I have been thinking of it, I feel like me being pan is more accurate. Still at the same time I feel like I might not be pan because I've never had a crush on a woman before atleast I think I haven't? I mean like I have had crushes on men and I think I had a crush on my friend who's non-binary, but at the same time I wonder whether it was a crush or not. They've been there for me on my bad times and I have been there for them, we can talk about everything and all so I feel like we're very close, Ihad a time where I just wanted to be close to them and a couple of times I've had just a huge urge to just kiss them for some reason, didn't do it tho hah  At one point I had one crush to a person who just noticed me, I don't know what this is and why all that happened. So I have wondered whether it is similar to being touch deprived, like that I get crushes when someone shows genuine interest and just Idk notices me?  This short, I don't know what I like and love and I feel like a part of me is missing somehow because I don't know who I am..  ps. I'm sorry if this is messy
63	2	Very deep though. #verydeep [SEP] Is the world bad enough for you to consider it real? Is it profound enough for you? It's almost time for you to wish for something better.
297	2	Can you live a happy life with philosophy and big spontaneous decisions? [SEP] Currently, philosophy is my only tool of anti-depression, everything I do is surrounded by the idea of philosophy, no matter how destructive it is, does this mean I can live a happy life with philosophy and big spontaneous decisions?
607	1	Today I experienced real happiness [SEP] I thought I’d been happy just because I’d overcome my depression. I figured, hey, my life is nice and I’m pretty satisfied, so I must be happy! Not to say that I don’t feel happiness and gratefulness each day or that I don’t love my life, but something has been missing for the past year. Friends. I’ve been isolated since my friends left town for college. I fell out with several of them. I don’t go to school in person and I’m unemployed (luckily I’m able to live with my parents and they actually requested that I don’t find a job for a while because of rona.) Today I met up with two friends for the first time in around two years. I took them for breakfast and then we sat in the sun and talked for hours until the pasty ones of us got sunburns. I feel so… I guess satisfied is the word. This is what I’ve been missing. I’ve resolved myself to stop isolating myself and do better to voice chat with my friends whenever we can.

144	1	How do i balance all these things in life and is it possible [SEP] I study architecture year 3 now  But also I Want to make music on ableton  Trance - dnb - pop songs (easy)   Aswell as skateboard and get better and run the society  And go to the gym 5-6 times a week   And play and write guitar songs  And study the stock market   How tf do i balance this to get the most efficient result out of it all or is it genuinely not possible   Even if you say its not i wont listen anyway but just need some advice on the best way to get the best results
188	2	Feelings of guilt and rejection no matter what...[vent] [SEP] Ever since I could remember I had always felt rejection in some shape or form. I've always been socially awkward, therefore it wouldn't take long to stand out in a way that can have me socially ostracized. I feel guilt due to the fact that while I don't have a clean slate of a past, whenever I do have some opportunity to grow relationships and potential it ends up getting turned down or not work out in the long-run. I think due to this I never developed a sense of trust or healthy bond that can work out and instead hang onto unhealthy relationships and qualities. I feel like for as long as I'm under this skin then it's going to be this way no matter what. Sometimes it's hard to deal with. I've expressed some bits of it in an earlier post [made here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/hwsd9m/too_old_with_avoidance_if_i_am_wanting_someone_in/) Yes, I do suffer from mental health problems which certainly do not help.  I think I'm a bit too old to rewire the basics of attachment. I don't know what advice can truly help at this point. I guess I'm just here venting since I have nowhere else to express these ideas without it being minimized, even if it's by me.

176	1	I found images of myself when I was quite young, around 2 to 4 years old. [SEP] I'm nearly 17.5 years old, and I'm turning 18 in June next year, I feel overwhelmed with emotions because of so and have been going on a little bit of a "Renaissance" if you understand what I mean, today I feel like crying weirdly because I'm reaching another stage in my life where I'll be legally an adult.  Can anyone understand how I feel? I don't understand my feelings.

565	1	My best friend made out with this dude [SEP] Whose made me feel uncomfortable in the past, pushed me up on a wall to try to dance with me and I was trying to get away slowly, put his dick into my leg with my boyfriend right behind me (he didn’t see) and I feel betrayed by her doing that when I told her how creepy and uncomfortable he made me in the past.  I feel really betrayed and hurt and we’re supposed to meet up this week and idk if I’m even right to tell her I feel a type of way
104	1	Afraid of misinforming anyone to the point where I am saying that obvious things is something "I think" [SEP] I am 24m and I hate the way I conduct myself in conversation. If someone disagrees or asks something I can't say stuff I know 99% to be true because of the 1% chance that they aren't. I am so afraid to be lying, and I guess my "I think"s stem from my poor self image where I feel I can't remember anything (but I do).   Can anyone please help me because it is uncomfortable for me to be this way.
609	2	I'm a man and I don't know how to do shit [SEP]  Just that. I don't know how to fix a car. I don't know how to fix a faucet. I don't know shit about fuck. And it makes me feel less.
798	2	Homeless people probably hate and envy the average person, the same way the average person hates and envies rich people. [SEP]
142	2	I'm sad [SEP] I'm sad, my chest aches, feeling lost, I've lost my purpose, donno what to do, what to say, where to go... Tbh it would be great if I could just stop existing in a blink of an eye, so I don't have to go through this
214	1	Relationship success. [SEP] Relationships between two people of many different kinds are successful when there is a consideration for the other party you are involved with. Either use your strength to protect them, or your power to aid them, or both. This will have all parties involved taken care of and fulfilled.
700	1	Just when the russkies stopped being the bad guys in every movie and TV show, here we go for another 30 years. [SEP]
938	1	The people who finish an exam early either had a great exam, or a horrible exam; and there's nothing in between. [SEP]
16	1	casual conversation [SEP] Do you guys know how to have a casual conversation without senseless smalltalk?  I would like to talk to people but don’t know how to have casual conversations with some meaning to them.
473	1	What kind of social media post/stories makes you fall for a woman? [SEP] Hey, boys, what kinda of social media post makes you feel enchanted/interest in a woman? Is there like a key post/stories that makes you crush ou get kinda obsessed in someone?
499	1	My BF has retroactive jealousy and it triggered me to think badly about my body. [SEP] I'm struggling with my body. It's not the thoughts that I don't like how my body looks (which are thoughts I do have sometimes) but thoughts that my body is dirty, impure, and tainted.  These thoughts first started when I was around 15/16, where I made poor decisions (nowadays I question if I was sexually manipulated/groomed.) Back then, I felt that I ruined my body and it took years for me to feel okay in my body.  But within the last month, my current bf has retroactive jealousy, and caused some very harsh words that has put me in the mindset of 3-4 years ago. I don't feel comfortable or happy in my body, that my body was supposed to be a temple and I kicked out the foundation.  Now I get that what happened back then, I didn't deserve it, but I learned my lesson. Today, there's only so much I can apologize for when I didn't even know my current bf back then. When I tried to look online, the main answers that came up was to pray, though I am not religious and I don't that solution would particularly help me.  All I ask is to please not berate me, but I need advice on how I can feel comfortable in my skin. Thank you for reading this far.
156	1	if hobby would make me happy already happend [SEP] idk anymore
633	2	saw this young girl with big lips and I instantly got harddd went home n beaaat off. Am I bad ? [SEP]  She was young too man but she look mature in the face. I never came so hardddd in my life It be other instances too I see young girls with nice looking behinds and nice looking boobers. Like I be fantasizing rubbing on them n them grinding on me with there panties on then when I get close to bussing, I pull them down and shoot all between theirbuttcrackss
431	1	My wife is pregnant and its turned her into a raging monster [SEP] My wife has PMDD and takes medicine for it.  Prior to us realizing she had this, we had to endure some pretty dramatic mood swings leading up to her period.    Now that she is pregnant the mood swings are worse.  It turns her into a completely unhinged raging violent person.  She is normally very sweet.    Today she physically assaulted me twice.  Punched me repeatedly, clawed me, threw magazines at me, threw a bottle of laundry detergent at me that busted all over the kitchen.  She packed her bags, told me she was leaving me, that she didn't want to raise the kid with me, said she was moving to a friends house, went outside screaming we are done and fuck off and kicked the trash outside while the neighbors were across the street.    She is a completely different person when she gets hormonal mood swings.  Its bad, she hates me and wants nothing to do with me and tells me awful things like she is sorry she married me and she hopes she has a miscarriage and as I mentioned gets violent.  I've never put my hands on her, I just take it and try to calm her down.  I had to threaten to call the police and record her so she would calm down.  Now she is fine.  This the second time this has happened in about a week time period.  Last week she was over it a day later and felt incredibly remorseful.  Its like doctor Jekyll and mr Hyde.  Somebody please tell me that I'm not the only one.  That they've seen this before in either themselves or in their wife.  I don't know what to do...
497	2	I’m a fool. [SEP] There was a guy I really liked. We never said we were “official” but I ended up moving to his his place.. He treated me like a fuck friend, he had other girls come over etc.  We always has separate rooms but I slept in the living room because it was hot always hot in my room and the living room was always cool . He was mad because I slept in (in the living room) and his friends were coming over. Because I didn’t wake up as soon as I was supposed to, flipped me out of the couch (bruised my arm in the process) then called the cops on me and told them I had mental health issues. I wasn’t arrested but just looking at the cops I knew they believed him more than me. This happen a year  ago but it has literally broken me down In so many ways. I hate him. I hate males. My mom always told me to not wish “bad” on someone but he deserves it. They way he defended himself immediately is so disgusting to me. I hate him, and I hate that he took away my ability to trust. I hate the cops that just assumed I had mental issues. I hate that afterwards he said “well, I knew they wouldn’t be arresting you”. I fucking hate it. I hate that afterwards after knowing and helping him financially he told me I wasn’t a real friend. I hate those last four years my life, and I feel like a fucking fool.
615	1	I hate my best friend. [SEP] I can’t help it but I hate her. We’re 17f and she moved away last year when we all went to new schools and she has made a ton of new friends who are the partying-alcohol-drug type which isn’t me (or her for that matter).   She’ll always send videos of them together to our chat and it makes my insides burn. I hate the fact that she’s crossing milestones with them and not me. It feels like I‘ m being replaced.   She’s always texting everything they do at every second of the day, like constantly even as trivial as them getting a coffee. It feels like it’s being rubbed into my face that she’s made loads of great new friends. I know I should be happy for her but I can’t help but feel jealous. And insecure. I think she thinks they’re cooler than me and I know she shows them all my text messages and they think I’m boring (they’ve said this once in a video she sent of them at a party).   Don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of new friends at my new school too. But I haven’t got a friend like her and I don’t think I ever will, but I think she has loads of friends like me.   I’ve posted about her a couple times in AITA and every time been told I am TA in my thoughts and actions. I know it’s my problem to figure out. I know she hasn’t done anything wrong and I’m just jealous and insecure. But I can’t help it. I just am.   I wish she hadn’t made friends that close. I’m glad she has friends but not friends like that. And I wish she’d stop talking about them so I could at least pretend they didn’t exist.   I just needed to say that. I’m starting to hate her.
569	1	I sometimes voy on social accounts of cute women who I interview for jobs [SEP] For my job, I am required to do front line interviews with prospective hires from college from time to time. Men and women. At the interview over zoom or live, everyone dresses smart and professional. I love how eager and cute they can be, especially the females, and how much they want to share of their life stories. As part of the process, I check out their social media profiles too. If I am going to hire them, I don’t fool around. But if I am not, I love to see the women in a swim suits and check out what they do and who they hang with. The memory of their voice and laugh gets me rock hard. I have followed and jerked off to some for years. Sometimes after I have snooped, they will call to follow up. So sexy to hear the expressive moans and giggles again as they try to win favor. Little do they know how many times I have cum thinking about their sexy selves. To them, I am a boring guy in a suit with the photo of the family ski trip behind me. Sometimes I wish I could keep asking questions, dirty ones, and take off their clothes but that could not happen. ;(

818	1	fold something enough it becomes a cube, which once folded, unfolds. [SEP]
