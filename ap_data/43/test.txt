564	1	An X-Men movie?
93	3	Picking effects from a list with the option to avoid bad outcomes is an option worth considering. It has some different consequences. Suppose that the purpose of the rewrite is the same, i.e. the new set of spells should condense the old ones into fewer more broadly applicable options. The list of effects for each spell thus will need to carry multiple effects. A roll could determine how many options you get to pick from the list, a better roll (and high skill improves the chance of a good roll) allows for more choices.
185	3	You're no better than the schizos who call the Nazis card-carrying socialists.You haven't even figured out what ideology is. It's only ever on paper. It's only ever theory. Real communism has never been tried, real fascism has never been tried, real liberalism has never been tried, real absolute monarchism has never been tried, real anarchism has never been tried, and real tribalism has never been tried. These are all ideologies that don't apply to reality. They are mere concepts.
598	1	Congrats on the job BB!! ‚ú®It‚Äôs okay, life happens. Thank you for letting us enjoy your talents and bookclub during this time. No pressure for anything; we will be existing in the abyssüñ§üíôDrink your water, try not to stress, you‚Äôll do amazing out in the world ‚ò∫Ô∏è
563	1	Nice! What are you reading?  Are you subbed to /r/52book ?
181	2	This is a children‚Äôs book and it‚Äôs self explanatory rules that you are looking for an exact match. ‚ÄúThis‚Äù does in fact imply that it is that exact picture you must find in the bigger picture. There are multiple anteaters and you can‚Äôt just say any one of them counts because they are all anteaters. I‚Äôve said in other comments as well that I‚Äôve done tons of these books with my kids and that‚Äôs how it works. You may find something that looks incredibly similar but if you keep looking you find the exact picture. Every single time. My 5 year old was smart enough to notice it was not the same mongoose but I guess a bunch of Redditors weren‚Äôt.
650	2	This was another The Alchemist for me. Everyone in my bookclub loved it and found it deeply insightful. I really wanted to like it but I just found it clich√©. I agree with others that the protagonist wasn't relatable... things just kept happening to her. It was a frustrating read.
235	2	This is probably an unpopular opinion but I feel like r/books focuses an ordinate amount of time ranting about things they don't like in physical books rather than discussing what's in them.
28	1	You're getting down voted but it's true. Someone somewhere was so homophobic that they couldn't hear the word "fairy" without thinking gay. Despite the absolutely huge cultural component of fairies in literature and mythology. Same person who instigated that probably thinks Midsummer Night's Dream should be banned. And probably the entirety of Ireland...
614	3	In formal Standard English, it would be "Joe's and my," as in, "Joe's (booklist) and my booklist." This is what you would be expected to use in formal writing and on grammar tests.In informal contexts, native speakers use all sorts of other combinations, e.g., "Joe and I's," "me and Joe's," etc.Also note that if you replace the pronoun "my" with another name or noun, then the format depends on whether the booklist is shared or each person has a separate booklist:"Joe and Jill's booklist" - The booklist is shared (i.e., there's only one), so possession is marked on the second noun only."Joe's and his brother's booklists" - Each person has a separate booklist (or more than one each), so possession is marked on both nouns.But the following is also possible:"Joe and Jill's booklists" - There are multiple booklists, but they all belong to both Joe and Jill.
469	2	I definitely think the rereading is a comfort thing for me. I know how the books end and all the twists and turns so no unpleasant surprises. I‚Äôm finding it difficult to leave my reading comfort zone and try new books.
339	1	You think fantasy football scout are wrong, bookies are wrong and stats are wrong, but your hunch is somehow more valid. You might wanna rethink who's the clown here.
627	3	I chose this as one of the 2022 popsugar reading challenge books as recommended by another /r/52book member suggested and I have mixed feelings. The world and voices were rich but I wanted more? I think I‚Äôm not so fond of strange chronology (as this book works backwards in time) because every small vignette of the Garcia girls‚Äô lives I ended up wanting to see where it went from there, instead of stepping into the past further. But the writing itself was vibrant and full of life.
805	3	this sub has a few recommended booklists in the sidebar [link]
638	3	[outside link] Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan is one of dark fantasy and horror‚Äôs most acclaimed and influential short fiction writers. Her powerful, unexpected stories shatter morality, gender, and sexuality: a reporter is goaded by her toxic girlfriend into visiting sadistic art exhibits; a countess in a decaying movie theater is sated by her servants; a collector offers his greatest achievement to ensnare a musician who grieves for her missing sister. In this retrospective collection of her finest work‚Äîpreviously only available in limited editions‚ÄîKiernan cuts straight to the heart of the emotional truths we cannot ignore.
553	2	To be fair, the only poets he thinks are good are ["Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe and maybe Dickinson"][link], so it's a pretty high bar (especially since you assume he must have read them in their original languages to make such a pronouncement). [He's also 19][link], so there is still a little hope that he'll grow out of it.
551	1	You just brought back some horrible memories from that Vaastu shaastra movie. Was that the movie? The one where a hand keeps coming out from the ground? Fucking creepy.
1	3	The narrator of this extraordinary tale is a man in search of truth. He answers an ad in a local newspaper from a teacher looking for serious pupils, only to find himself alone in an abandoned office with a full-grown gorilla who is nibbling delicately on a slender branch.
354	2	There are cutscenes that came out today in game that are covered in the novel. There are no other spoilers and nothing for future content, it appears.
896	1	While many of my favourites are already mentioned (Gunnerkrigg Court, Wilde Life, Kill Six Billion Demons, Homestuck) i haven't seen [Monster Pulse](https://www.monster-pulse.com/newreaders) here yet. By Mangolia Porter Siddell it tells the story of kids whose organs get turned into monsters due to a secret project, and how that affects their lives. The art constantly evolves, the characterisations are great, there is good character drama and action, it goes some messed up places and doesn't shy away from some serious consequences from the premise and it regularly updates! Close to being finished even! I can only reccommend it.
365	1	Gotta give it to them, mate. They're one heck of a physical, robust, strong team. Kinda reminds me of the movie 300.
496	3	r/truelit puts out a user submitted list of best books every year.  I would start with some books from those lists that sound interesting to you.  You can find it on their side bar.
423	2	I take snippets or exercises from books and bring them together, they can help in special situations or with my general point of view. For example, I wanted to so something new with my career, so I read Barbara Shers [quote]. Didn't help that big with the career at that time, but I really liked the idea of it. It helped me to look at decisions, things, people in situations or problems from another point of view. I don't know what to do - what would be the ideal thing? What else would I consider important or great or being the greatest impact to this situation? How do I perceive people who were in a similar situation and have a positive outcome etc etc
516	1	Always happy to hear more people chime in! I know a big thing for all the contributors is knowing that people are actually reading and using posts/booklists/work. A little thank you goes a long way!Always happy to hear suggestions to. *Generally* we try to keep the bulk of recommendations from flaired members because it gives us a good idea of who's expertise is suggesting it. Not *super* sure what other avenues for volunteer work there is, other then as your using it let us know if you come across any problems. Broken links, typos, stuff like that.
856	2	I use a combination of Excel and Goodreads.
567	1	Great, Rupert's going to stop his newreaders from talking and stop publishing his birdcage liners.

373	1	They are purposefully injecting dangerous pro pitbull propaganda into children's toys, media, and books. It pisses me off, given pitbulls are the number one dog breed to seriously **maim** children.
492	1	Happy to take suggestions. Cheers!Otherwise:u/the_jaw. TrueLit is a bit less without them. Especially enjoyed their rants directed at Hollebecque or whatever else drew his ire. Writes beautifully as well.u/Viva_Straya. Mostly for poignant Lispector analysis. Where she is mentioned, he is found and there's always something insightful to be said. Huge appreciation to everyone generally, but wanted to through some names less mentioned.
57	1	Yeah but we moved on to talk about bookies odds. Do you think bookies clean sheet odds give a fair view on which teams are most likely to keep a clean sheet?
436	1	Real answer: this arc isn‚Äôt a continuation of this novel and idk how op thought that that was the case
210	1	It‚Äôs really too extensive to list.  I‚Äôll see if I can find some literature on it. There are plenty of options out there, I‚Äôm just really surprised at how many people just blindly take all of these supplements (a lot of shitty brands I might add) without knowing whether or not you need it.  Everything is synergistic, so if you over do it on one thing, you can throw off a serious of other metabolic processes.
574	1	It's like r/52book, but for quilts!
796	2	Definitely! Here‚Äôs my list‚Ä¶.            -only read what you enjoy. If a books not doing it for you put it down. You can always give it another chance later.            -find a quite dim spot with minimal distractions. I always read in bed at night because that‚Äôs when everyone else is asleep and won‚Äôt interrupt me.          -cut out tv/streaming. Seems weird at first but once you get into a good book tv loses its appeal.            -get rid of social media. Especially FB. It‚Äôs just designed to bait you into arguments anyway. I make exceptions for book related platforms like Reddit or Bookstagram. It‚Äôs been 3 years and I don‚Äôt miss a single thing about FB.-buy cheap used books or use the library. That way you can sift through a wide variety of books for minimal monies. Some used book shops have mint condition books for $4.-join in on the r/52book subreddit. That‚Äôs what motivated me to start reading more and it‚Äôs been a lot of fun over the years. I found great recommendations and had some really good interactions with other Redditors                -always carry a book with you. You never know when you‚Äôll find an extra 15 minutes to read. And all those little chunks really add up. I did that less in 2021 and you can see the above results.              Those are my main bookish habits that keep me reading at a high rate. Even at 100+ books it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm forcing myself. It‚Äôs just reading for pleasure. I hope that helps!

132	3	I appreciate what you're saying, but I think you may be misinterpreting my hypothesisI don't think so. Elaboration follows:If you see a cluster that is the same size as a single colony, but shaped non-circularly, do you count that as one colony or multiple?  So this example is from a streak plate not a spread plate, but it should be sufficient.[link]Starting from the bottom of the plate and traversing counter clockwise, the colonies go from well isolated to increasing density or clustering. These colonies, regardless of clustering, all exhibit a similar colony morphology which we'll call circular. Now on a spread plate, if I detected one or more colonies that did not have a circular morphology, I would suspect I did not have a pure culture and start over.Now, the FDA BAM APC is for liquid dilutions that were not applied by a L shaped spreader, but I would argue are still appropriate here. So if the plate is full of clumps, it doesn't get counted. If there are a small number, say one or two clumps, each distinct clump is counted as a single colony. Moreover, how much does this affect the total plate count? How much could this effect the accuracy of the final result?You will likely be underestimating. I can't go into the details and calculations as I'm just a misplaced geologist. Perhaps the following will help:[link]That's a root question of my research or the extension of my hypothesis, if you will. None of the above sources cite variation of how people count based upon empirical evidence regarding differences in how lab techs classify and analyze these clusters.Barbosa 1995: [link]If you can't get a copy of that paper, PM me and I'll send you a PDF.The following two papers you're on your own to locate: To close this out: [link]I realize you haven't actually written the proposed paper yet, but you seem to be largely ignorant of the subject which you are pursuing. I'm not an expert on the subject, I just like to argue, and I'm looking for more productive outlets.
828	2	 Maybe try r/52book? I use Goodreads to set my reading goal for the year and track everything. Other than that, I make time to read every day. Usually at night before bed and on lunch breaks. More on the weekends. I read 81 books this year. I was thinking of trying for 100 but that might be a big stretch and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd try to read only short books, which would limit the books I want to read that are long. I think maybe having a goal based on number of pages read would be neat too. I read less pages in 2021 than I did in 2020, despite that I read two books more in 2021 than I did the previous year.
524	2	I'm not sure if such a website or program exists and - as a literary scholar by training - I am somewhat skeptical that such an approach would do a good job at teaching the necessary skills to critically engage with literature. I could very much see it run the risk of  boiling literary analysis down to nothing but a checklist of actionable steps and removing any kind of ambiguities (and thus potential) from literary texts.While there are certain protocols to follow in literary studies, the craft is much more free form than, say, running a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it is a matter of being receptive to the nuances of a text - and to bring one's understanding of (literary) theory and history into dialogue with these nuances. (I am, of course, oversimplifying.)Thus, building a personal repertoire of literary theories and a solid understanding of (literary) histories might be one of the best bets to become better at critically engaging with literature. Building this repertoire, in turn, is probably best achieved through reading - and discussing what one has read.When it comes to the former, you can find a few recommendations in the following:If you want to dip your toes into some pop-literary studies first, you might want to try something like Thomas C. Foster's *How to Read Literature Like A Prof*, which u/pm_me_poemsplease recommended in a similar context.Another great way to get a first feel for almost any academic field are Oxford University Press's Very Short Introductions - in this case Jonathan Culler's Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction.You could also have a look at general introductory textbooks, like Mario Klarer's *An Introduction to Literary Studies,* or at textbooks focusing specifically on literary theory, such as erry Eagleton's *Literary Theory: An Introduction* and Peter Barry's *Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory*. In case you would prefer to watch a lecture on the topic, there is always [Yale's Open Course on Literary Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300).Finally, if you want to dive straight into the deep end, you could have a look at Cambridge University Press's extensive list of *Cambridge Companions to X* and *Cambridge Histories of Y*, where X and Y are something like "the Victorian novel" and "American Literature."I hope some of this helps and I am sorry I couldn't offer any more open-source resources.If you've got any questions, feel free to ask!EDIT: You might also want to check out r/AskLiteraryStudies. :)
758	1	I don't think there's a good catch-all term here... though you could check with r/askliterarystudies as it's possible there's something more defined in that world that could be applied here.I've seen people use "Thematic Shift" to discuss the technique you seem to be describing. Though, I think that term applies pretty well to *Hereditary* and less so to something like *Mulholland Drive.*
802	2	This is why I joined Reddit, /r/booksuggestions, /r/suggestmeabook, /r/52book. After I spent some time learning there, a visit to the library or a real bookstore feels like a trip to Disneyland.
392	1	I feel like at the core I‚Äôm the same person, but also that my life is very different. I‚Äôm more calm, more authoritative, more thorough, more productive, and more exhausted (lol) than I ever was pre-baby. But I still enjoy the same activities, I still rarely leave my house even when I can, I still stay up too late watching my favorite shows, I still hate exercise, I still eat kids food (Mac n cheese, chicken nuggets, basic pastas, etc) just now I‚Äôm making extra, I still listen to the same music (no cocomelon for me) and I still love the same people I loved before. Except I love this new person with a fierceness and a completeness I never had experienced before. Pregnancy and parenthood are very different and transformative experiences, but I‚Äôm the same me going through it. I‚Äôm just *more* than I was before. There‚Äôs parts of my old life that I miss (sleeping, drinking a bit too much, staying out late, binge-watching a show all weekend, reading books quietly in the morning) but I know that I‚Äôll get to do all those things again in 15 years or so. So I‚Äôm not grieving that life, it‚Äôs just on hold for a bit while I chase around my toddler and play games and wake up early.
5	1	It's a great book. I loved it. It's just got such a slow start up. For me, it didn't start getting good until part 2. But once it gets good, it gets GOOD.
746	1	I'll have to try Story Graph.Zlib has two separate features for keep track of books, Favorites and Booklists. They're both great and really well coded. I much prefer the layout of the booklists to the favorites and I'm trying to migrate all my favorites over there, but you have to do it one book at a time and I have 35 pages of them :(
623	2	I actually just finished reading this one as part of my reading challenge this year [link] and I loved it! And yet I completely agree with you. The lesson/s in it are nothing new or overly enlightening by the time you are in your 30s if you have a modicum of self awareness
854	1	I don't have 1000+ manga and I only buy small batches that I can reasonably read at a given time, so I mostly keep track in my head. I do record it on the goodreads app when I finish reading something (gotta meet my yearly), but not when I just buy something. There have been a few times when I've forgotten which books I have in a series, but that's always been because I haven't read all that I have for that series, which is a sign that I lost interest and don't need to buy more of it at this time.I feel like the people who lose track and double buy books are usually the compulsive spenders who just buy 50+ book hauls to have and not to read. Usually when I place orders (or plan out my shopping list for in person buying), I am at home and can reference my collection for any books I am unsure about.  If someone just has trouble with detail and attention with remembering their collections, there are apps like goodreads and a few others (I don't  know them, but have seen them mentioned in this subreddit) they can use when they are out and about or just for quick reference before they hit the checkout screen to keep track.
675	3	If you read my post you‚Äôd see that I had already started one of the books for a book club I joined, so I was definitely not looking for recommendations in that regard. I was looking for comments that would inspire good discussion, like the first comment saying that I should definitely read Ready Player One prior to watching the movie.
275	3	The TrueLit crowd mainly reads classics and wouldn't get caught dead with a lowly genre fiction novel.  But the attitude between them and male sci-fi/fantasy fans is basically the same, acting like no woman or person of color has ever been worthy of an award and they're only picked for "political" reasons.  Feminism and anti-racism were invented by "woke" people on Twitter and then the awards committees all caved from the pressure.
937	1	This is my first year doing the challenge after discovering it, and pairing it with the popsugar prompts has been a fun step outsider what I may usually do. Also I‚Äôm trying to train myself that when I‚Äôm scrolling Reddit at night if I see a post from /r/books or /r/52book it is time to put down the phone and pick up the kindle.
361	2	Truelit and truefilm are good though.
591	1	AFAIK UK and European PhD applicants typically already have a masters level degree in the field, and you'll be expected to have a thesis project basically ready to go, and you should really have a specific faculty member in mind to work with.
352	1	You are also making assumptions about the TYPE of reading that is happening. For instance, I devour books like candy. However, if you ask me a month later to describe the book, or name a character (haha, can't do that even while reading it!), or even name the books I just read, I won't be able to do it. I am not reading for deep comprehension or memory here - truly just reading for a cheap thrill of immersing myself in this world, borrowing the emotional thrills, and turning off the rest of my brain for a bit.
526	2	Next level reminds me of extreme movie.
414	1	I had a temp job in an office once for a week. No one ever brought me any work to do.  I just read books all day
237	1	My most favorite is [Masato Kurumi][link] from the japanese visual novel MoshiKami 3 I find him very attractive, oniichan yandere that! takes your hair out of the drain and licks it, kills the whole cast in a lot of endings and does the dirty with you right after in the same scene, and then there's one scene where he faps to you on the other side of your bedroom wall lol!&lt;  I also love Lindo from the Dance with Devils visual novel but that's because I love the brocon-type yanderes :') Same with Toma from the Amnesia: Memories... and I just realized all the characters I listed are siscons. Welp.
892	3	To get revenge on King Mildred, Grizelda creates the fiercest dragon the kingdom has ever seen.  He is such a terror that he must be killed. Now if only the dragonslayers could stop arguing long enough to face the greatest battle of all!
552	1	What / bookclub?
204	1	Typically elitist Democrat thinking that because someone who has a GED they aren‚Äôt smart enough to make decisions for themselves, and realize that Democrats don‚Äôt give a shit about the country or there voter base.          The fact that I speak 2 languages fluently, have A Real-estate License and  a College degree shouldn‚Äôt matter.   You on the other hand probably took one semester at a Liberal arts college and now you know everything and you put your nose down at working class Middle America because your parents bought you a MacBook and you drive a Prius.
789	2	r/badliterature r/askliterarystudies r/literature (the third one is only okay.) for some humor check out r/badreads (bad book reviews) and r/bookscirclejerk (making fun of the (mostly) morons on r/books). i also like r/bookcollecting cause a lot of cool rare books get posted and you can silently judge people‚Äôs personal libraries.
12	3	It's also worth noting that BHRT is not the most common form of HRT and is not what is happening in the vast majority of cases, even if you want to argue that it's the same as endogenous natural production of hormones (it still is not).
232	3	I feel this needs to be looked into more. Cooking books has been an issue for decades and a lot especially recently. Just because they aren‚Äôt real shares to retail doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt marked as real in broker/hedgie books.
514	3	Whether we are dealing with a rude clerk, our child saying, "That's not fair!," our spouse ignoring us, or an uncooperative co-worker, in our struggle to respond effectively, we often become defensive - sometimes without even realizing it. Despite good intentions, we can become manipulative and controlling, even with those we love most.
172	2	People who banned books NEVER cared about right or wrong to begin with. All that matters is the push to make  a lie the true, that is the bottom line nothing more.
174	1	For the first part, the problem is that we have to see where lies the definition of ¬´ trash ¬ª. Twilight and 50 Nuances are before everything story purely based on sexual fantasies they don‚Äôt pretend to be really above that, and when I can agree that 50 Nuances is really really bad, Twilight is not as trashy as some people make it to be, have a very interesting lore and interesting characters.
662	2	It was a slower week for me. * I read **The Black Tides of Heaven, by Neon Yang**: I loved the worldbuilding behind this silkpunk novella, there‚Äôs simply a massive influx of creativity obvious here. That said, I had some issues with the pacing the characterizations, in all it just felt a bit rushed.* 85% complete and will soon finish **Dune Messiah, by Frank Herbert**. The climax is really compelling! I will absolutely be moving ahead with Children of Dune after this. * Done 6 out of 9 short stories in **Exhalation; Stories, by Ted Chiang.** This has been such a wonderful reading experience. Top stories so far are the Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate, Exhalation (the title story), and Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling (which I read this morning and absolutely adored). * 25% complete **Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead**, **by Olga Tokarczuk.** I'm really enjoying it. Surprisingly laugh-out-loud funny at some points, and just such creative fiction here.
403	1	MUST WE AGE?
592	3	This probably lies under book lists and recommendations which aren‚Äôt allowed outside the sticky‚Äôd weekly topics. r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, and r/whattoreadwhen is more welcoming to these sorts of threads.
607	1	The bookclub. There's 10 of them I think? You gotta sleep a few times in-between a few to get the next. So have fun making that run 10x lmao. I did em all in a row and it was draining... Idk if it's an unmarked quest you gotta stumble upon or not.
629	2	I know of r/AskLiteraryStudies. Not sure if that's exactly what you want.
868	2	The subreddit is titled ‚ÄòAskLiteraryStudies‚Äô.That‚Äôs what the OP did. If you want, start a subreddit called ‚ÄòDon‚ÄôtAskResearchQuestionsYouCouldGoogle‚Äô. Your indignation when confronted with a similar polite request will then be appropriate.
720	2	There is a [bookdiscussion][link] subreddit that looks like it never got off of the ground, but it could if enough of us participated in it.  I love reading /literature and /printsf, but they certainly don't cover most of what I actually read.
315	3	To be continued: As for why it is the great white shark?  1:It is a shark because the shark is an ocean animal (most humans know it) that can be aggressive, dangerous and attack humans. So it shows in your dream just as big snakes or mighty land animals show up in others' dreams, as a reflection/symbol of something in your real life.  2 It is a great white shark because it is something you know, you are familiar with, either from some literature, you read or watched previously (maybe a long time ago) or from your childhood experience( If you grew up in Dominica it could be from that experience). I am not familiar with sharks, and I am not interested in the ocean, swimming, surfing, etc. So the chance of me dreaming of a great white shark is very low. 3 the great white shark may also be from the memory of your ancestors who lived in Dominica and were very familiar with ocean creatures.
44	1	The one with the book glances to you, then asks if your ok.
480	3	No its not. In her 2019 treatise on [domestic violence][link]*See What You Made Me Do*, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a "dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria", and stated that it is "riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie"; she also noted that a 2008 [literature review][link] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists." [link]
30	1	Sure but then again, its one thing to say a dude named Alexandre existed and another to fantasize how he flew on a magic carpet and shot fire bombs out of his ass.I don't debate Krishna may have existed, its possible.I debate whether he had any of the powers that are popularized in the literature and movies.
750	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: [link]
501	1	Thanks for the Elton update! :)
379	1	I agree with you. I enjoyed some parts of the book and others I skimmed. I give her credit for being a bone fide writer. Untamed is not my typical read, I picked it up on a whim.
905	2	Last year I read 55 books and probably 15-20 I got from this sub or from books posted on r/52book. Thank you everyone.
860	1	I think it's weirder than that. I feel like there are some incredibly persuasive women out there managing to get money from a rich guy without giving up their bodies. As in, a little flirtation, but mostly companionship.
533	3	Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in Archie's Madhouse #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962). Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title "Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch" in almost all of the Little Archie comics.
167	3	For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike‚Äîeither free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.
797	3	Winner of the prestigious Gold Dagger Award in the U.K. for the best mystery of 1999, this complex literary thriller may be one of the most satisfying suspense novels to come along in some time. Robert Wilson has written several political thrillers, most of which are set in West Africa, but they are, alas, largely unavailable in the U.S.In A Small Death in Lisbon, the narrative switches back and forth between 1941 and 1999, and Wilson's wide knowledge of history and keen sense of place make the eras equally vibrant. In 1941 Germany, Klaus Felsen, an industrialist, is approached by the SS high command in a none-too-friendly manner and is "persuaded" to go to Lisbon and oversee the sale--or smuggling--of wolfram (also known as tungsten, used in the manufacture of tanks and airplanes). World War II Portugal is neutral where business is concerned, and too much of the precious metal is being sold to Britain when Germany needs it to insure that Hitler's blitzkrieg is successful.
110	3	Jill Taylor was a 37-year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist when a blood vessel exploded in her brain. Through the eyes of a curious scientist, she watched her mind deteriorate whereby she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life. Because of her understanding of the brain, her respect for the cells in her body, and an amazing mother, Jill completely recovered. In My Stroke of Insight, the author shares her recommendations for recovery and the insight she gained into the unique functions of the two halves of her brain. When she lost the skills of her left brain, her consciousness shifted away from normal reality where she felt "at one with the universe." Taylor helps others not only rebuild their brains from trauma, but helps those of us with normal brains better understand how we can consciously influence the neural circuitry underlying what we think, how we feel and how we react to life's circumstances.
520	1	They're probably gunna remove your post per the rules in the side bar, so try the weekly suggestion thread or any of these related subs where you might find recommendations ([from my great big list of book realted subs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnZz_HTCD_pNdEw4cGdjODhkUGQ0REpXSERXa2ZjSlE&amp;usp=sharing)):
679	3	Please post lists of books in /r/booklists.
449	1	Everything in the book with y‚Äôall
88	3	I think like with anything there‚Äôs good and bad. The issue is there‚Äôs maybe 70-80% bad books out there peddling not just shitty ideas, but sometimes dangerous ones. Anyone who reads these types of books go through a journey where they may discover better and better books. If you want a life hack I‚Äôd say the best starting point to void the fluff is to go read some of the classics like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and a few other stoic classics. You‚Äôll realise that most modern self help is a rehash of these classics. There‚Äôs still a few other great ones out there though - I find GoodReads helps weed out a few
383	1	I'd also call this a plot inconsistency, not a plot hole.
755	2	Our kids prefer to own most of their books so they can share and re-read. Libraries have book sales. Try booksalefinder.com. The Mensa website has good booklists broken down by age group. You can also google top 100 kids chapter books of all time and start there.
690	1	lets make one...would be like a bookclub...every week we get a new cock to suck and chat about it...every week? is that too infrequent hehe
794	1	Wow, that is really super helpful from a subreddit called "AskLiteraryStudies". Go fuck yourself.
719	2	Yes, it happens in /r/AskLiteraryStudies a fair amount. [quote].
561	1	Agreed the first few chapters were slow but now i am super invested in the David, Charles, Edward triangle. Be sure to tell us what you thought on the [first check-in][link] especially if you will zip off without us ;)
375	3	How does r/TrueLit actually think of J. R. R. Tolkien's work? I thought it's the most bizarre thing to discuss here, so I've been hesitant to ask this. Of course, I'll never put Tolkien as the same level as writers as Pynchon, Faulkner or McCarthy in any way. But whenever I read Edmund Wilson's terrible review rampant with ad hominems and even spelling errors for character names, I grimace a lot.
177	1	First try programing yourself. Practice. Get a book, watch YouTube videos, seek a mentor.  Join a group. See if you like it. See if it makes sense to you. See if you are good at it. Later, join a programing ‚Äúboot camp.‚Äù The camp is about 4-6 months long with classes x3-4 a week. I did mine after my work day while I was in the army.  I missed some classes, but I always told the instructor ahead of time, and I had an agreement with the school about missed time before I signed and paid. Most people exiting seemed to get an entry job at around $75k. The top students, and the well connected students did much better.  You could also seek a change in your MOS. Age is not an issue in programing.  The issue is knowledge (or talent), logical thinking and critical thinking (problem solving) skills.  Good luck!
680	2	This is a sub for pictures of people's bookshelves. /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/paranormalromance, and /r/YALit would be better places for this.
424	1	If you look at Jinger's Instagram and scroll way back to May 30th 2017 (about the tenth oldest photo on her Insta) you will find the legendary photo of Jeremy in a library, with the caption, "Jeremy loves books. I love Jeremy. Now I love books. üòç üìö"
413	2	Ready Player One. Just listing every 90s pop culture reference you can think of does not a novel make.
816	1	I loved the first part, but this had to be put aside to get my local book clubs reads in. Can't wait to get back to it.
761	1	Thank you for posting this! I have been very dismayed to see some of the attitudes from FFA bubbling over into my real life. I‚Äôm in the US and in a bookclub of 8 women in their 30s. Pretty much every meeting there‚Äôs a conversation about being too old for fashion. People talk about buying cheap leggings from Costco because they don‚Äôt want to spend money on clothes and how nothing fits their decrepit 35-year-old body. The Costco leggings are my real life version of the greige sack. Ugh! I hate this attitude! Of course, not everyone is into fashion and has money to spend on it, but I feel the prevailing attitude is that if you are over 30 and not a size 2, fashion is not for you and you are frivolous for thinking about it.
248	2	Just for fun, I gave a relevant prompt to an [outside link] to see what it would come up with: **(Prompt) An open letter by Franz Kafka about the dearth of novelty in /r/TrueLit:** I have just read your statement on the subject of novelty. You are correct, I do not know how to express the thing, because I myself do not know how to express the thing. Yet the thing is the thing. The thing is what the thing is. The thing is what the thing is. I will not insult your intelligence by saying that the thing is the thing. You know it is the thing. I know it is the thing. It is the thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. I tried the same prompt again, just with a different writer. **(Prompt) An open letter by Fyodor Dostoevsky about the dearth of novelty in /r/TrueLit:** We have been reading and rereading the article in which you have described the monotonous state of your life and the ‚Äúdearth of novelty‚Äù in it. It has a ‚Äúsad and gloomy‚Äù look. Your heart aches as you think of it. But the article is not gloomy, not sad. It is, rather, quite the opposite. The last one I tried was strangely ... sensible. Not what I was expecting.
491	1	First of all let me just say I LOVE YOUR idea of a book guide. It's so unique and informatively fun at the same time. Your idea of a book guide is really something else. More Power!
35	2	Who's we? He obviously wanted to, and since it's his novel, I don't see why not. Also, this is truelit, I come here for in-depth literature discussion, not to be reminded of reddits tendency to review books they don't plan on reading.
873	2	Work on your readers‚Äô advisory (RA)! You can create booklists based on authors, subjects, moods, read alikes (for books and also for tv/movies), or so many other things. For books you‚Äôre not actually interested in reading, you can [read a book in 5 minutes][link]

601	3	I'm trying to connect up the various parts of your wide-ranging concerns. I recognise your outline of the various "schools", but I'm wondering how "human value" and its redefinition fits into that. Are you asking whether accessibility and utility have become a) "human values" (in a humanist sense?), b) "human *and thereby* literary values", c) "human *and thereby* aesthetic values" (differs from the previous in that what critics value in literature is not necessarily the aesthetic, however defined), d) some other combination of these/other concepts?In any case, I think the concepts of accessibility and utility for someone like Jameson must always be historicised: accessible and useful *for whom, at what time, in what kind of society*, etc. To my ear, accessibility has the ring of a kind of democratisation as an ideal with liberal overtones, and almost opposed to the modernist project. I would indeed be interested to see how you might connect the accessibility of literature to an emancipatory politics. I am reminded (as I often am!) of Jameson's article, "Reification and utopia in mass culture", which posits that popular media (his references are *Jaws* and the *Godfather* movies) are popular because they contain an emancipatory core, however transformed or even perverted it may have become. Perhaps what you can ask is how the emancipatory core can/needs to be transformed precisely because it needs to become accessible?
290	1	Nice to hear the game has gotten you interested in Star Wars! I recommend you watch the origonal triology (no. 4, 5 and 6) first, then the prequels (1, 2 and 3) and then finally the sequels. I also recommend watching the Clone Wars show, The Mandalorian and The Book pf Bobs Fett. Don't let the animated look of Clone Wars stop you from watching it, the show has some really well written episodes.
310	3	 actually, only 5% of hostage victims end up with some levels of stockholm syndrome"The syndrome is rare: according to data from the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI), about 5% of hostage victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome."In fact its very hard to prove that stockholm syndrome even occurs, with examples portrayed in media as more in line with examples of misogynyIn her 2019 treatise on [domestic violence][link] *See What You Made Me Do*, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a "dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria", and stated that it is "riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie"; she also noted that a 2008 [literature review][link] revealed that "most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists."[link]Ymir was horrifically tortured. Her developing feelings for Fritz is gross and not accurate.
194	3	There is a genetic insensitivity to gut THC adsorption, if I understand the literature correctly.Both my mother and I have this insensitivity and have taken both edibles and sublingual tinctures without any effect even at high doses, while others experienced highness from much smaller doses.
686	1	You should check out /r/52book, it‚Äôs a challenge to read at least 1 book a week for a year.Lol, I have zero aspiration to do anything close to this with my free time.
849	2	If you‚Äôd list some that you did and did not like, that would help a lot. Use the search bar in this sub for recommendations and also review /r/52book sub, as we post book cover photos from goodreads or other apps there.
519	3	*You know what writers esteem by knowing about writers and finding out what influenced them most.* There's no reason people esteem most what they've been influenced by. You can take ideas and methods from a book all while thinking that the use of those ideas and methods ultimately don't add up to much in the original book. *How many books have been written about Ulysses, Bleak House, Tristram Shandy? Lots.* It's not necessarily writers writing these books about Ulysses etc.? It's scholars of these books or their period, which is a distinctly different group, writing about these authors for perhaps entirely different reasons; *How many writers clearly take influences from those novels and talk about them in interviews or things that they write?* But again, influence is more a matter of the potential of some idea or thing author A did to being used by author B; author A may have achieved something brilliant except his ideas and methods are not transferable to most other kinds of books, or he may have use a brilliant idea or technique abysmally poorly in a similarly poor book, and that idea or technique gets used widely and influences legions of writers.
952	1	I'm not trying to determine what can or can't be posted, but /r/ebooks or /r/books or one of the sub-genre threads would probably be better for discussion. You could also consider /r/bookdiscussion and /r/bookrecommendationsIMO, the post still seems like promo though.
512	2	She sounds generous. The best. Maybe she needs to come join bookclub one of these days

969	3	If this doesn't make sense, please reply with more than a one-word question so I have a better idea of what is confusing you about this.
917	1	Hahah we read it for my last bookclub, and I was ‚Äúhate-reading‚Äù it by the end. I was so annoyed with it but also had to finish. I didn‚Äôt really like any of the characters and I felt like we were rushing through all the husbands without any character development. Waste of 6 hours of my life üò©
340	3	Some authors that I see on Instagram come off as unbelievably self-centered and mostly post about their skin care routine and vacationsWhy is that self-centered? It makes the author relatable to an audience that presumably is also interested in skincare and vacations - which is the point of having a professional social media presence. Giving viewers what they want is the opposite of self-centered. It honestly kinda seems like you're mad because this content doesn't cater to your personal interests.I think booktubers and booktok are more powerful in some genres vs others. e.g. YA has a big presence in both areas, as do the thriller and romance genres, but something like lit fic less so. I tend to follow new releases in the genre I'm interested in via various media outlets. I get recommendations on r/fantasy and r/truelit, as well as the occasional recommendation from a friend. I used to browse bookstores and pick up books based on cover and first pages, but since the pandemic I've had a lot less opportunity to do so. Now I think word of mouth is even more important to me than before.
760	1	New from Robert Garofalo, an instructional unit on Milhaud's original classic work for band, Suite Francaise. This incredible teaching tool contains Interpretive Analysis, Folk Song Sources, Teacher's Lesson Plan and Student Learning Guide. Written for any band or orchestra conductor planning to perform this work. An outstanding teaching tool that applies the MENC "Standards" to the podium. A "MUST HAVE" for the serious wind band conductor!

880	1	"I thought I told you I didn't want to hear about that movie" Do you hear yourself? "Is that really controlling?" Omg smh üôÑüòí
741	3	A few scattered thoughts and suggestions:- Journals: If you believe your work is good enough, just submit to your favourite journals in your field. Chances are the journals you enjoy reading would also like the kind of things you write. Go for a more specialised journal if the big ones seem intimidating. You should put a bit of thought into it, though, since you can only submit an article to one at a time.- University departments: AFAIK, American universities will be fine with a much vague PhD project than European ones, where you'll be expected to go in and start working right away, while there's usually a year or two of coursework (like a second MA) in the US. Other people will have more precise recommendations, I hope.- If you have any literary interests at all, check out comparative literature departments in the US, as well as English and modern language departments. This last might be a bit of an awkward fit for you as your interests are in German but that's not one of your languages.- /r/AskLiteraryStudies is good if you do look at lit departments. There's also /r/ComparativeLiterature, but it's quite small. /r/GradSchool might be good too, but I don't know that sub at all.
644	1	his sub is kinda garbage IMO. Its turned into pop culture Oprah bookclub wishing for fairy magic stuff. You need to realize that everything is energy, so you need to find ways to get your internal world in tune with the reality you want. meditation and Neville Goddard as already suggested. The most important thing is you need to work with your subconscious to accept your affirmations or whatever.

569	2	Charlotte Mason inspired curricula are classical; Ambleside Online is a completely free option with booklists and guides for a secular Charlotte Mason-style curriculum. It‚Äôs a lot of work on the parents‚Äô end to gather all the books and set everything up, but it‚Äôs a great education model that encourages reading and critical thinking. It‚Äôs definitely not just a pile of workbooks to hand the kid to go through, but the prep is worth it. We love it.

426	3	Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated "spinner" throwing two coins or pennies into the air. Players bet on whether the coins will fall with both heads up, both tails up, or with one coin a head and one a tai, known as Ewan. It is traditionally played on Anzac Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages. The game is traditionally played with pennies ‚Äì their weight, size, and surface design make them ideal for the game.
961	3	Have a search and ask around at r/AskLiteraryStudies.
296	1	I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about, but cmon dude. Sometimes a thing becomes popular because people latch on to it and make it their personality‚Ä¶. But other times a thing becomes popular because it genuinely has merit. You shouldn‚Äôt shun EVERYTHING that becomes trendy just because it‚Äôs trendy. That book is an absolute classic, so it will always be popular. It was written in 1949, long before those ‚Äúspaz kids‚Äù were born. It was highly regarded then, and it‚Äôs still highly regarded today, and it always be highly regarded, cause that‚Äôs what a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù is.It‚Äôs a fun, and very weird, read. It‚Äôs not like you have to tell anyone you read it.

990	1	You deny it Did I? I said I didn't believe you. That's not the same thing.Instead of acknowledging your error you just move on to a new attack lineWhat exactly do you want me to acknowledge about a typo? It's meaningless. Which is why it's rather telling this is all you've bothered substantiating.extend the same basic courtesies of discussionI prove my points. I don't lie. I don't give you the run around (oh, but wait, you're going to complain that saying "start" isn't a specific reference to the start of the conversation and therefore you are completely right to be confused about what goalposts you're being accused on moving... except, no, it is a specific reference; this is precisely what I mean... here's a question I say I've answered but which I can easily quote you as saying I haven't answered).Elsewhere you've told me that it's my fault that you are being rude and aggressive toward me which is well, wow. Given you tried to gaslight me into believing I "came in hot"... yes, it is.Yes. "Literature" means written texts.But, sure, you win the point. Have a biscuit. Completely beside anything of substance, just like everything else you actually care to talk about, but you got me.

238	1	Dune is one of the most recognised science fiction novels. When diving into the depth of Sci-fi literature, Dune is one of the books being recommended everywhere.However, for a long time I didn't even consider reading the book. As I had watched David Lynch's movie adaptation, I thought the reading experience will be spoiled.Also, new phrases and word suggestions are very much welcomed. :)Great job! I have a friend who‚Äôs absolutely obsessed with dune :)

221	1	Damn, you're an MVP for real!!! I never expected you to listen to everything! I was just spit-balling really, thinking of stuff I'm into, there's so much more, I wish we could hang out in person and trade songs back and forth, that's the best way to really click with a person musically (and I'm confident it would happen). I am so happy you love Tori, she really is a virtuoso, it's amazing to me how overlooked she is in the canon of female singer-songwriters, which is already its own weird ghetto haha, but damn, Tori is queen, but I hardly ever see her brought up, even on musicians she obviously influenced. It's so weird. But she is absolutely amazing and her entire discography is wonderful.  Anyway, I'm just glad to hear from you, I really miss you contributing at truelit so much. I hope you're doing well.Sweeping beauty and dire seriousness, I like that, that describes a lot of what I like too. I think that would describe Godspeed You Black Emperor pretty well, who I'm into, and Swans too. Well, once again, it's always a pleasure to wake up to a message from you.

554	1	As for alternatives, I don't go here much because I find this sub grating (for reasons that have nothing to do with the moderation), and like, there are SO MANY alternatives out there already. There's /r/writers, /r/PubTips, r/publishing, /r/storyandstyle, /r/YAwriters, /r/fantasywriters, /r/FanFiction, and that's just the writing subs I can keep up with. /r/BetaReaders and /r/DestructiveReaders have occasional craft threads. Tons of reading-focused subs - /r/Fantasy, /r/literature, /r/TrueLit, /r/horrorlit - have a community of writers and regular writing discussion in weekly threads, regular threads, or even dedicated threads. There really isn't a dearth of writing content on this site. Really. I would say there's writing content for any level and any preference. I would frankly feel silly complaining.

26	3	The Unites States are a great example of how democratic and free institutions are not enough to protect minorities.I agree that US history demonstrates limitations of protecting rights in democratic systems. But I hope you‚Äôd agree too that minority rights can be fully respected, even for Jews, in democratic countries, and that US history demonstrates how advancing equal rights is possible. The limitations don‚Äôt mean that the solution is to ethnically segregate and divide the US, the solution is to further promote equal rights.When the conflict started in the 1920's, the Zionists were the ones trying to appeal to the Arabs, talking about a mere "Jewish homeland" within a democratic Palestine, that would give both Jews and Arabs rights. The Palestinians, lead by Husseinis, rejected that idea, and decided to turn it into a race war, commit pogroms against the Jews, while chanting "Palestine is our land, and the Jews are our dogs".
22	3	If there are any scholars you like in particular, take a deep dive into their papers and see how they are written. If there are literary texts that you find particularly fascinating, have a look at what has been written about them and pick a few favorite essays. Then ask yourself questions like:  Are they front-loaded with sections on theory? Are their close-readings interspersed with bits and pieces of theory? How flowery or concise is their language? etc. etc.My second advice is to ask yourself *what you are writing* and *whom you are writing* for. How creative does your writing really have to be?If you are writing a term paper, I would recommend to check in with your lecturer/supervisor to a) get some pointers on their personal preferences and b) ask them for tips on how to spruce up your writing.If you are writing for an academic audience and to have your work published in a journal, you should first have a look at their style guides and then see how the articles they have published conform to (or even break with) their rules. Some journals call for rather essayistic texts‚Äîothers, to quote Amitav Ghosh's *The Hungry Tide*, might "\[want\] words with the heft of stainless steel."There is absolutely nothing wrong with simplicity (and clarity) in academic writing. I much prefer to read a well laid-out, straightforward, and jargon-free paper (whether from academic colleagues or any of my students) than a flowery and/or (b)rambe-ly mess.In case you are writing for a personal blog (or anything comparable), see advice number one: Just throw words at the wall and see what sticks!My third and fourth advice, in case you find yourself struggling to come up with creative ‚Äîi.e. novel‚Äîapproaches to canonized texts, in part harks back to u/siaparry's sound advice. On one hand, in this instance you could very deliberately try to stray from the canon and see if you can use your personal theoretical toolbox to make sense of understudied texts on one hand.On the other hand, you could also keep reading widely in terms of both theoretical and literary texts and see if the texts begin to speak both to you and to each other. (This was my preferred approach during my bachelor's and master's, where I would frequently put literary texts from one class in conversation with theoretical frameworks from another.)
31	3	Its actually barely even recognized in clinical science and massively overplayed in the media based on one faulty exampleStockholm syndrome has never been included in the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders][link] or DSM, the standard tool for diagnostic of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research.[links] The syndrome is rare: according to data from the [FBI][link] about 5% of hostage victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.[link]In her 2019 treatise on [domestic violence][link] *See What You Made Me Do*, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a "dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria", and stated that it is "riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie"; she also noted that a 2008 [literature review][outside link] revealed that "most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists."
325	3	With penetrating insight that belies her youth, Packer helps us see the world with a clearer vision. Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is a striking performance‚Äîfresh, versatile, and captivating.
923	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: Recommendation Requests
104	1	Claiming "Million More Moments", "Entrapped", and "Open Book I Am" - the former two with potential as solid song premises in their own right. "Uncrack Your Ventricles in Return" is so wonderfully random, while "All of Your Organs" and "Feet Off Me" could be great titles for Halloween or horror-themed songs. @ ArianaGrande I know you would love to make a spooky EP someday - and we're all for it!
605	1	Great! Thanks for clarifying! It's getting a bit late, so I won't go into too much detail. If anything thus ends up reading too jargon-y, feel free to follow up!Depending on your focus, you will probably end up with the skills of a data scientist and digital consultant on the one hand - or those of an ethics consultant or policy adviser on the other. (Ideally both!)
234	3	Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems‚Äîto relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. But, the problem with this version of history? There‚Äôs not a shred of evidence to support it.
996	2	I love multigenerational family sagas, one of my all time favourites is The House of Spirits. ( I‚Äôm reading Pachinko atm, completely missed the timing of the r/bookclub even though I was so excited to join in). Read One Hundred few years ago and wanted to re-read with the classics, but Feb was interrupted by holidays and then by sickness so sadly missed all the club reads.
738	1	Okay mod hat off.So none of these were what you were looking for? You can request abandoned subs in /r/redditrequest so you can start with existing subscribers rather than adding book sub number 755:* /r/truebooks* /r/currentlyreading* /r/Casual_Books* /r/CasualBooks* /r/BooksUncensored* /r/Bookies* /r/bookdiscussion
272	3	I loved watching Donte Hall, but Cribbs is #2 in my book.
456	1	And honestly, there were a few emotional beats in the movie that got me a little choked up lol. There‚Äôs something supremely comforting and nostalgic about the thought of hanging out with my 12 year old self.
712	1	There was a story that Searle told at one point about Foucault, where Searle asked Foucault You're so clear when speaking to me, so why the hell do you write so badly?  And Foucault said In France, if you don't have at least 10% incomprehensibility, people don't think you're very profound.  (I don't have the direct quote but it was basically that).
2	3	Hearing Die A Legen, I knew he had insane potential. his lyricism isn't insane in like a pejorative "lyrical miracle" sense but rather his bars/lyrics are so poignant and hard hitting
785	3	Go to r/bookdiscussion
780	1	Fingers crossed! :D
622	4	To them good ol days exist in pre industrial natural selection world or in some fictional novel.Worst ideologies are those that promises Utopian world. They roads leads to nowhere and are paved with blood."Nirvana is not for this world"
443	1	Volume, direction, ema, sma. That's, quite literally, all you need if you are able to think fast and react quickly. Day trading is meant to be in and out with 0.5-3%gains (rarely more), and cutting your losses extremely quickly (within 0-0.5%). On average, I'd say I make about 10-20 trades a day. The first 3/4 are in and out because price action isn't there yet but volume is high and there could possibly be a trend so I try and price in accordingly. I'm a market open and near market close trader  because I prefer to play with price action and volume(so 9:30-11am and 2-4pm generally).EMA/SMA for support/resistance levelsVolume, candles, order books, and ticker list to include QQQ, SPY, etc  to gauge general direction. Ultimately, you have to be quick to multitask and assess all this information within seconds to get in early and ride a small trend. Otherwise, it's going to be tough.
399	2	They‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm here to correct them.[outside link].
855	2	I know that you're specifically asking for the opinion of a _historian_, but your question lies at the intersection of literature and history. An academic trained in language and literature might find some parts of your question easier to weigh in on with authority. You might benefit from posing this to r/AskLiteraryStudies, too.
914	1	I like the subreddits r/whattoreadwhen and r/books for potential leads into new series and to keep a thumb on the pulse as they say, to what people are enjoying.
29	3	I should have said at the outset that I will conduct this discussion like a university seminar.  Questions of belief or appeals to authority or dogma will not enter in.  The basis will be historical evidence and analysis and academic literature.
499	1	Same! My husband has never been good at nor liked reading, while I love to read, listen to audiobooks and podcasts. In situations where books come up he has a go to joke about me being the reader and we move on. Our bit about him disliking Harry Potter simply because of how much I have tried to get him to like it for 17 years kills at parties!OP‚Äôs husband is obviously super smart and in academic circles as well, so the embarrassment feels like a weird literature snob thing to me
96	2	Sir, round here we don‚Äôt approve of ‚Äúspread betting‚Äù this ain‚Äôt the bookies.
214	4	In the story, Kate Daniels is a down-on-her-luck mercenary who makes her living cleaning up these magical problems. But when Kate‚Äôs guardian is murdered, her quest for justice draws her into a power struggle between two strong factions within Atlanta‚Äôs magic
807	3	We have chosen to allow book discussion, but only on designated threads. So if you want to discuss the books or any spoilers from them, you should make a separate post on the subreddit and flag it as [BookDiscussion/BookSpoilers]. We want to wall off the books from the rest of the discussions here.
388	2	Written in rich, seductive prose, this novel contains senses and the experience.
667	2	There's also the [weekly recommendation thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2mgd3p/weekly_recommendation_thread_for_the_week_of/) and the various recommendation subs pulled from this [List of book related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/BookRelatedSubs/wiki/sublist)
483	2	Romance is my favorite genre. Authors like Julie Garwood, Lisa Kleypas, Amanda Quick, Julia Quinn, Julie James, Sandra Brown, Elizabeth Lowell, Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting a few. But you can get an idea of my preferences.
460	3	[quote]Please give me verses where you draw conclusions about perpetual virginity and purgatory.[quote]You are aware that Jesus as well as the apostles considered OT to be scriptures, just as, later, NT was also incorporated into the word of God. As the books of Gospels, acts of the apostles and the letters to churches were written, they were shared through the known world. Do you think that believers waited for 300 and something years to have the permission from Constantine to read the scriptures? Or did they need Augustine to come and interpret the letter to the Corinthians because people were ignorant to come to their own conclusion.[quote]This statement not only insults the english speaking audience, but also proposes that in the greek, God somehow better revealed himself than in english. Please, therefore, give us the verse in greek, where Jesus, of all people, instituted papacy. Do not worry, I was an orthodox christian before, so I will manage.

507	3	 Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother‚Äôs death in childbirth and their father‚Äôs disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics‚Äîtheir passion for the same woman‚Äîthat will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him‚Äînearly destroying him‚ÄîMarion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.
120	1	Oh wow, he does have a lot of books! I‚Äôll see which ones my library carries and go from there. Thank you!
261	1	YTA. Your husband told the truth, plus he really doesn‚Äôt sound that interested in literature. Not everyone is and maybe this his way of getting out of further discussions. He doesn‚Äôt go around saying he‚Äôs embarrassed because you don‚Äôt work with petri dishes, so stop looking down on him.
64	3	Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future.
782	3	Life is a journey of ups and downs, twists and turns, and everything in between. Watch Blake Belladonna as she navigates this uncertain road from start to finish, child to woman and more. She'll love and hate, lose and gain, and find out just how important family is in a world that does all it can to tear you down. Ladybug, Freezerburn on the side. Cover art by booksandweapons.
821	2	I'd say it's definitely low intensity. You can have OSRS open on a second monitor and focus 95% on a movie or tv show while just clicking the green boxes out of the corner of your eye.
867	1	Have you asked this question from a previous account, or has there been a glitch in the matrix?
582	3	**[Germinal (novel)][link]Germinal is the thirteenth novel in √âmile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel ‚Äì an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s ‚Äì has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions. Germinal was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical Gil Blas, then in March 1885 published as a book.
137	2	When Jonathan Davis or Marc Thompson read those books to me, I‚Äôm just immersed. They could pronounce it cardayayay and I would still believe it's right.
