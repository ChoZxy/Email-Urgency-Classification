801	3	I really have no trouble with finding what next to read, on the contrary, so I'll try and share a few tips.Goodreads - their recommendation algorithm sucks, so don't use it. You can use it in 3 ways:- seeing what your friends read - this one is most valuable to me. I know what I respect in other people reading habits, so when I see something they like, I will take notice of it.-book lists - these are not as useful, but I take a look sometime- blog posts - they occasionally have cool blog posts listing books, so I take a look at that, and sometimes find something interestingReddit:- /r/booklists - check occasionally and see what you like- see what other people read on this subreddit
792	2	Indeed. I could see something of an argument for that if the OP has only listened NADDPOD C2, but even in that, everybody generally gets a good amount of screen time on NADDPOD. I can not make any definitive statement as to how she is on 8-Bit Bookclub, but given that the OP calls NADDPOD “her (Emily’s) show” makes me think he has listened to neither, as yes, NADDPOD is very much  equally everyone on it’s show as well.
858	1	Late to the party this week, my daughter was sick and we ended up having to go to the hospital Saturday night so my weekend was practically book free. Add in the fact that I wasn't really enjoying the audiobook I'd been listening to and just a general reading slump and I only finished one book this past week.The audiobook, **Tell me an Ending** was, similar to Parzival pretty disappointing. I provided some word-vomit thoughts [here][link], but in summary the book felt like a slog, the characters were boring and the blurb was misleading.
611	1	I'm reading **The Master and Margarita** and **Hamnet** with r/bookclub. It's taken a lot of strength to not just finish Hamnet in one sitting. It is so enjoyable. I'm also trying to wrap up **A Series of Unfortunate Events: The End** this week in honor of my daughter's birthday (I read the first 10 to her in my belly). Also reading **Cleopatra's Dagger**. I finished **The Cruel Prince** this week, trying to dip my toes into fantasy. So far so good.
46	3	Want to add more weight on watching The Expanse. It is a great serial with realistic science, great characters, great writing, action, drama, political intrigue, a few laughs, and a satisfying but open-ended finale. The show is based on a novel series and the show covers the first 6 books if memory serves.
882	2	A wild ride stuffed to the cut-lines with humor, heart, and space shenanigans.May’s humdrum life gets flung into hyperdrive when she’s abducted, but not all aliens are out to probe her. She’s inadvertently rescued by Xan who’s been orbiting Earth in a day-glo orange rocket ship, watching re-runs of “I Love Lucy”. Seizing the opportunity for a better life, May learns how to race the Audacity and pilots her way into interstellar infamy. Finally, she has a job she likes and a friend to share her winnings with—until the Goddess of Chaos screws the whole thing up, and Xan’s unmentionable past makes a booty call.

976	1	She definitely suffers from some kind of mentall illness. Remember she made that bizarre cameo in the Scientology movie???
659	1	It was the most difficult book I've ever Read Run/ bookclub!!
577	2	if you check out /r/52book you will see a dedicated few who break 100+ books in a single year.  With people who dedicate that much time to reading it definitely helps bring the average up.
302	2	I have tried both. Literature suffers from the same problems. Truelit suffers from completely different problems namely lack of threads, small scope, and lack of self awareness -- though being under-read and their identifying as readers can also be an issue. 52books as well. The grass is not greener elsewhere.
827	1	Piggybacking off your comment, could we please have a what to read if list as well for the more popular books that are recommended in this sub?
273	2	That's objectively false: [link]I looked over it; every time they are taken to the test, the peer review process shoots them down.[link]There is no way that from the time of Noah's Ark 6,000ish years ago to today that any of the species could have evolved to today. There is no guided way outside the laws of physics. Species evolve due to changes in allele frequencies among populations, where traits which contribute to survival get passed on while others don't. Evolving over billions of years has continuously been supported with every new discovery made. Evolution is so much better understood today than 100 years ago and it has only further been proven. There is nothing which has brought us back to "well maybe this time something supernatural occurred".
83	1	To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand anarchism. The ideology is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of political theory most of the jokes will go over a typical liberal's head. There's also Bakunin's antisemitic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from William Godwin literature, for instance. Anarchists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this ideology, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about SOCIETY. As a consequence people who dislike anarchism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Noam Chomsky's support of the Khmer Rouge, which itself is a cryptic reference to Stirner's The Ego and Its Own. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chomsky's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Nestor Makhno tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
579	3	To Have or to Be? is a 1976 book by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, in which he differentiates between having and being. It was originally published in the World Perspectives book series edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen for Harper &amp; Row publishing firm. Fromm writes that modern society has become materialistic and prefers "having" to "being".
229	2	I would say for what you need it for skip on the chrome books in general and maybe research Microsoft’s Surface Pro Laptops. Asus zenbooks also compete with Mac. Last one I’d recommend aside from the Mac OS laptop s the Dell XPS
804	3	So even when a patient gets a UTI, the treatment is not a circumcision. The treatment is a simple round of antibiotics. Keep in mind that removing body parts is considered the absolute last resort, to be entertained only when all other options are exhausted. And that's for when pathology is actually present. Doing it beforehand is honestly bizarre when we're dealing with someone else's genitals. It's the most private and personal body part.
584	2	r/52book is a fun subreddit for reading goals. All reading goals are welcomed!
713	2	also /r/bookdiscussion exists as well
739	2	r/RomanceBooks is a good place to go for romance suggestionsI'd also suggest r/52book it's ostensibly for folks trying to read a book a week but I find a bunch of great books from what other folks are reading. Some great (fantasy) romance/YA I've read in the last couple of years:A Court of Thorns and Roses    Scythe    The Cruel Prince    Scholomance    Song of AchillesHouse in the Cerulean SeaGideon the NinthReady Player One (if you're into games)    Rick Riordan's books if you haven't already read
910	3	Once in a great while, we encounter a novel in our voluminous reading that begs to be read aloud. Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.
117	2	If this is true, I will be really upset for several reasons: 1- it is the opposite of what occurred in the books as Kate asked for them to wait on their wedding night but then from Anthony’s insistence changed her mind, 2- if everyone has been going on about the bond btw the sisters and how protective Kate is of Edwina, what kind of sister sleeps with her sisters fiancé especially during that time period where she could be pregnant after they slept together and 3- why is it yet again the writers are making another character of color be the ones having sex outside of marriage. First Marina and now Kate. Meanwhile Daphne was the picture of “innocence” on her wedding day. I cannot.
349	2	No we can still convert, we just can’t cut him and have it come off the books. It’s guaranteed but it’s still convertible.
718	1	Not everyone in 52book does 52 - it’s absolutely ‘pick your own number’. Last year I aimed for 50 so I could give myself a couple of weeks leeway
150	2	I'm tired of correcting this error on Numbers 5.Ah, we were awaiting you. What took so long?the punishment on the woman for adultery was sterility (or death, more accurately) of the adulteress not abortion.According to the Collegeville Bible Commentary[link]The curse itself is a euphemism for miscarriage or possible sterility. "Thigh" is often used to mean the sexual organs...If the woman has sinned by illicit intercourse, her punishment is the termination of the pregnancy or the inability to bear children.The context of her becoming pregnant later if she was innocent makes it extremely unlikely to mean that she already was.Nope. If her lady bits shrivel up and she experiences a miscarriage at the same time, it isn't unlikely that she would also be unable to bear children later. Also, "extremely unlikely" is *not* the same as "she absolutely wasn't." You're at least open to the possibility of the procedure being applied to a pregnant woman.
389	3	Respiratory depression[Respiratory depression][link] is a major risk with opioids, especially those that have activity at the [mu-opioid receptor][link]. This is the leading cause of death from opioid use.[link] In animal studies using high doses, mitragynine caused respiratory  depression, but less than morphine or codeine at similar dose ranges. As of 2014, the respiratory effects of kratom and its main bioactive components had not been studied in people. Over 18 months in 2016 and 2017, 152 overdose deaths involving  kratom were reported in the United States, with kratom as the primary  overdose agent in 91 of the deaths, and 7 with kratom being the only  agent detected.[link] Nine deaths occurred in Sweden during 2010–11 relating to use of *Krypton*, a mixture of kratom, caffeine and [O-desmethyltramadol][link], a prescription opioid analgesic.
74	2	I’m a 9w1 so/sx. Reading this post and imagining myself as this guy makes me very uncomfortable, tbh. A few things:-I don’t think this insecurity stems from his 9w1 nature, but from his trauma. The thought of putting my partner in a situation where they have to declare/demonstrate/prove that I’m number 1, down to not wanting her to have a best friend makes my skin crawl. There’s nothing peacemaking or harmony-fostering about that. Kind of the opposite, tbh. Anyway, 9s have all sorts of unhealthy behaviors, but this situation makes me very uncomfortable in my core where all of my 9 weaknesses are. Your friend needs to read some literature on relationship dynamics, emotional control, and recovering from trauma/abandonment. If he’s not had counseling related to history/fears of abandonment, highly recommend. We all have our baggage to bear and our feelings are our feelings. But the way we express those feelings or try to shape the behaviors of others is 100% on us. And this is not cool, imo from my peacemaking, harmony-seeking 9w1 self.
416	1	Nah, it's just easier for people to communicate on what that book means by the day, instead of relying on whatever conclusion you've been told to have at church.

724	1	Try out This Is How You Lose The Time War.
684	2	I was taking with someone about making a queer/butch bookclub discord
800	1	It is a horrible game if you were looking for L.A.NOIRE style mystery solving game where the thrill is in the act of putting the pieces of mystery back together in a climactic showdown. I sincerely think you should drop it. Forcing yourself through would be a massive boring waste of time, like being forced to read latin literature about some ancient dead guys you don't care about.
593	2	This comes up a lot but it is a difficult thing to Google. Here's some previous discussion: [link]Basically it's a realism thing; it keeps up the conceit that the novel tells of real events, by implying there's been some anonymization.
668	2	I think celebrity memoir Bookclub (the podcast) has done stassis. I haven’t heard that episode but they usually spill all the tea and have some good banter.
500	3	Please post recommendation requests in /r/suggestmeabook or the weekly thread. You might also like /r/askliterarystudies.
618	2	I mean, r/books is probably the biggest and well known. r/bookdiscussion is also out there, but it's not very big.
656	2	The bookclub Sub is in the middle of one actually.  They are starting SoS next month.  It seems a lot of them plan on attempting to do the Cosmere after, so it might not be a bad idea to set up a Cosmere one, start with a Mistborn read along now to try and line up with the book club ending theirs with the release and presumable reading of TLM.    Then all the bookclubbers can hope on over for a continuation into the deeper Cosmere.
298	1	You talking about Jim getting in trouble with Ra or the crystal in the pyramid? Luckily I annotate my books like a nerd! So the crystal in the pyramid is mentioned in Session 2 second answer, second paragraph (weird). Jim falling asleep is at the end of Sesh 22 when Ra signs off (that's a LOT of 2s!)Exactly, spot on with the "remembering" part. It was the first time I ever read something and just KNEW it was the truth. Hard to explain, but a very cool feeling.
765	3	I will be messaging you in 4 days on to remind you of [**this link**][link]
348	2	I'll go over some of these, but to do all is quite long.
346	1	Thank you. That's what they have me on. 4 rounds of BEP, so far. They're still trying to find out the primary cause of the tumor.But it's massive so they're scheduling me pretty heavily on treatment. 40 hours on, 3 weeks off. 4 rounds of that. I think it's actually starting to hit me. Like...how sick I really am, when I thought I was healthy a few weeks ago. Crazy how life changes!I have some protein drinks and I was going to buy myself a cooler and make a couple veggie meat, veggie/hummus wraps. Just to see if I can handle it. Not sure what my body will do until we get there. :2I have a ton of books, and coloring books and colored pencils for years. Lol. I find it calming so it'll help out a lot when treatment starts.
376	2	Don't be hesitant to drop it. Be honest with yourself. It's ok, no one is going to judge you. While DE is a phenomenal RPG, it's clearly not everyone's cup of tea. I might anger a lot of people here, but it is pretty niche and definitely not the norm to like DE. Drawn by the critical acclaim, me and my friends all had a try at DE.One guy played the intro sequence, got confused and just dropped the game. Another one went to the hanged body (still didn't understand the intro sequence) failed a bunch of checks which made him feel confused and powerless, leading him to quit as well. I was the only guy amongst my friends to really gush over the game. But I must admit, the initial confusion was a hard one to overcome. It's almost like I lost all my memory after a rough night of partying. You might say that is brilliant set up because the protagonist and the player is suppose to be confused. But that appreciation comes after you get over the confusion after reading walls of texts you don't quite understand.This is because DE has a lot of problems as a conventional game. For one, it has a very discouraging and confusing action/reward feedback loop, as demonstrated by my friends' experiences. I have many other reasons why I consider DE to be a poor conventional game. If I was a game designer, and someone pitched this game to me, I'd call them crazy, uneducated in game design, or blinded by stubborn uncompromising vision.
778	2	Right here is why they don't tell you anything. Never had to learn the lesson of "don't post anything online you wouldn't want your parents to hear" cus I already learned not to tell the parents anything I didn't want 14 Facebook pages and the Friday Church bookclub to know about

922	1	I get paying an escort. They will leave when you're done, and you don't need to pretend any sort of connection. Sugar Babies are... More insidious. It's like they want the money, but aren't willing to do nearly as much. I get it from their pov, but what are the rich men getting out of it?
274	1	I… think I saw it when I read Titus Andronicus in grad school. I don’t remember much about it either way to be honest. I think I remember the acting being pretty good. I don’t remember much about the production design. I do remember my Elizabethan literature being fond of it, and she really liked the play. Unfortunately, that’s about all I can say about it, especially since I’ve only read TA probably twice, and not since grad school which was close to ten years ago, so even if I was to watch it now, it wouldn’t have the same resonance as Macbeth or another play I know better like R&amp;J or Hamlet. 🤷‍♀️ Shockingly enough Titus Andronicus is often overlooked on high school curriculums.
959	1	I understand where you're coming from. Sorry if I reacted a little miffed.I did believe that format by itself would inspire a bit of discussion, even though I was deliberately not expressing a point of view. The less-frequent words in a book exemplify so much of what's extraordinary about a book. They encapsulate the time (in the evolution of the English language), the place, the narrator's rank, the themes... and the treasury of language at large. I thought it was much more interesting to just put it out there and let people react without guidance, than to explain it like a schoolmaster and then let people say: Yes/No/Yes but/No but... I'd find that a little tedious. But, as you've said, if r/books is really r/bookdiscussion than maybe my post wasn't appropriate. Save travels.
898	2	I’m just calling it a buddy read for lack of a better term— I was a teacher and that’s what it was called when you’d pair two readers to tackle a book together. I’m kind of hoping that as we go along this year we’ll find other people who will feel like joining us so I’m fine with not setting too much in stone. For me it would be ideal though if we can have a few (three- five) titles planned in advance because I’ll be doing other reading besides what we’re doing together and that will help with my time management. What if you just make a post about Emma here in r/52book whenever you’ve finished it and tag me in the comments? I’ll have it read by Saturday night.
170	1	Do you see the issue? This is 3 mana for 2 mana Eliminate, 1.5 mana for an effect between [[Miscast]] and Test of Fate, and a new mode that's extraordinarily narrow but probably around 2 mana if they made it a card.
173	2	Replying to the top comment as I dont think this is as clear to the OP as it should be: if he is going this far to convert as it's his duty as a Muslim it is very possible that he sees you as property and chattel, as women are considered in much of Islamic literature and scripture. Be very, very careful. In my area there have been a non-zero amount of honor killings. I live in a western country. It can happen to you.
136	2	I think Jonathan Franzen is right, no good literature can be written on a computer
86	1	I still did a lot of Christian stuff after I stopped being Christian to keep up my spirituality. It was very helpful! The Bible is very interesting both spiritually and in literature. But,,,, I recommend devotionals. If you're looking for practical spiritual advice, it's a curated daily engagement. I found it really useful
41	1	Anabasis is the most famous work of the Ancient Greek professional soldier and writer Xenophon. It narrates the expedition of a large army of Greek mercenaries hired by Cyrus the Younger to help him seize the throne of Persia from his brother, Artaxerxes II, in 401 BC. The seven books making up the Anabasis were composed circa 370 BC. Though as an Ancient Greek vocabulary word, ᾰ̓νᾰ́βᾰσῐς means "embarkation",  "ascent" or "mounting up", the title Anabasis is rendered in translation as The March Up Country or as The March of the Ten Thousand.
66	3	/r/truelit is another one. There are also a handful of subs dedicated to specific authors. As a rule I dislike major subreddits because they are poorly suited for any kind of nuanced discussion and devolve into the least common denominator of opinion. The good thing is most major subreddits have smaller counterparts that have much better discussions.
240	3	The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wear that uniform.
545	1	Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is an early work of speculative fiction by Irish writer Samuel Madden. This 1733 epistolary novel takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998. The work is a satire perhaps modeled after Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels published seven years before. Madden was an Anglican clergyman, and the book is focused on the dangers of Catholicism and Jesuits, depicting a future where they dominate.
968	3	The same happened with the Scots wiki. Decent enough sentences were posted on Twitter and mocked because words like 'muckle' and 'ken' were unfamiliar to them. How can a language thrive when many of the people to whom it's meant to belong have nothing but embarrassment over it?
547	2	I wrote this in r/books, i don't know why now it is in r/suggestmeabook
783	1	I agree with this 100%. All of the friends I made in college were in different majors than me! I hated the other history students! I joined a bookclub at my college and at the public library as well.
560	2	[I definitely am][link]😅
986	2	I've read 19 books in 2022, or two books per week. Those books average 278 pages, so although there are a couple over 500 pages, they're balanced out by shorter books. Some are re-reads, which generally go more quickly. Here's the actual timing: On Sundays, my wife and I each pick a book, sit on the couch, and read, finishing the book that day (with one exception when I was busy). Then I find time during the rest of the week - a few minutes here, an hour there, it all adds up - and read something else. Sometimes one book, sometimes two, sometimes none.But the real "how" is that I remind myself that while watching TV is easier, and picking up my phone for a few minutes (which often stretch to hours) of Reddit, news, social media, etc. is easier, reading books is more pleasurable and gives me more satisfaction, and I make a point of doing it. I'm also active on r/52book, where I've set a goal and hold myself accountable through weekly check-ins on my progress. The goal isn't important, the number doesn't matter, and I don't force myself to hit an artificial target. But if I fall behind it's a reminder that there's something I should be doing that I enjoy and value more than other time-killers.
98	3	Immanuel Velikovsky was a Russian, Israeli, and American scholar. He is the author of several books offering pseudo historical interpretations of ancient history, including the U.S. bestseller Worlds in Collision published in 1950. Earlier, he had played a role in the founding of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, and was a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. Velikovsky's work is frequently cited as a canonical example of pseudoscience and has been used as an example of the demarcation problem.

218	1	A perfect compliment to the orginal work!
439	2	I am using goodreads for my tbr file and add recommendations from reddit and other places. I generally use google to find book ideas when I'm in the mood for particular subgenres or stories.

576	1	Wait, just so I'm understanding correctly, you're unhappy with /r/literature? May I inquire as to why?But back to your request (warning, I'm ,not subscribed to any of these, I just know about them and am assuming that you are seeking discussion) you might check out **/r/bookclub**.

335	2	Again, I'll ask you " I’m curious who you think put you in charge of controlling Carey’s drug and alcohol use?"  You seem self-appointed to me, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Actually, I do care about my community, I care deeply.  I frankly find it offensive that you insinuate otherwise.  I also care about the rights of human beings, and don't believe they should be committed just because someone doesn't like the way they are choosing to live their life.  Everyone has rights, but you have no right to violate the rights of anyone else.  In case you wondered ( I doubt you do, your posts indicate someone who is so busy talking that they can't listen), AA doesn't try to control people or force them to do anything.  Here's a partial list of things AA does not do, from a pamphlet published by AA titled [Information on Alcoholics Anonymous][outside link]* Furnish initial motivation for alcoholics to recover.* Solicit members.* Follow up or try to control its members.* Make medical or psychological diagnoses or prognoses.AA has a 7th tradition that we are self supporting through our own contributions.  AA does not [quote]  Your statement that [quote] is exactly why.

Trust me, we don't need your help.
940	1	If "cite-checking" is some kind of jargon that refers to the entire [literature review][link] process, well, *excuse me* for not knowing the jargon -- but *don't* mistake not knowing the jargon for not understanding the process!You may "(a) know just enough to be dangerous about how legislation is made, and (b) am used to dealing with similar levels of complexity" but you clearly don't know what you don't know.Do you realize how fundamentally condescending and hypocritical that sort of attitude is? Apparently, I was wrong before: you *do* mean it that way!
160	1	And I said it's the same thing, bookies go with the obvious, same as football scout.Keep.up.
748	2	Chaiery was told by booksmarts that some people might not think she is black enough to say the word nigga casually. He said she should probably stop. They apparently had an argument at the time and reached no satifactory conclusion, later on stream Chaiery talked about the interaction and how she thought that booksmart was just too scared to say that he thought she wasn't black enough to say nigga and was hiding behind an imaginary group of people who wouldn't think she was black enough. Memes ensued but I'm not part of the bookclub so I don't know if he's actually getting cancelled or if people are just clowning him on twitter.
288	1	yeah i bought that book but I have to finish "Ego Is the enemy" First. Still kinda hard for me to have conversations with strangers.

626	1	Probably gonna be sent over to r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, or r/whattoreadwhen. Recommendations are only allowed in the weekly thread here.
333	1	Thanks for saying this. Hopefully not oversharing, but I'm dxed DID. I've seen that they're throwing DBT at DID now. I'm deeply worried for the people ending up in those skills classes, especially if they have comorbid Borderline (which is common). I know from experience the skills don't do pretty much anything...and literature supports that.They really need to come up with different modalities that don't involve throwing behavioral therapy at every dx and hoping it sticks.
890	2	Exactly what I'm talking about. Every nation has to a certain degree a bias towards itself.I can't watch most war movies from the US as they are full of patriotism. The Vietnam movies are generally better in that regard, as the war was always seen very critically but I literally can't think of WWII movie where the soldiers are shown in a bad light. The worst thing I remember seeing is them killing POWs (but as they are Wehrmacht soldiers, who cares?) but I can't even think of one movie where a soldier rapes a woman of a liberated town or something similar atrocious.
908	3	Did you happen to check out our rules before posting? Both of your questions are answered there. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books. The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.
823	2	[This thread has good tips and tricks.][link]
925	2	Maybe /r/bookdiscussion? A place to discuss books you are currently reading, have recently finished, or would like to talk about in general.Seems low activity, but they have a Discord that might be more active.
978	1	Love it! I rarely see it on booklists, though and I don't know why. It's such a great book!
681	1	Oh, my bad.In this case, my number one advice—trite as it may be—is to *write much* and to *read even more*.
106	2	What are some good literature podcasts that TrueLit users listen to? I like The History of Literature pretty well and Oxford University has some nice lecture series about different authors, but I have to drive an hour every morning so I'm in need of more material.
504	3	Some months back I asked this community for recommended reading on the comics medium (which I naively referred to as "graphic novel" medium at the time, which is apparently distasteful nowadays). I got [a lot of really great answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/kqf1sn/recommended_reading_on_the_graphic_novel_medium/)—I wonder if any of those comments will be helpful to you?
198	1	Not that seriously. Everyone has such different tastes and I often find that I like things that the masses don’t always. Plus even looking at my own goodreads account, there a good number of books I’ve only given 3 stars but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I just didn’t think it ranked up next to other books.
966	2	1. What specific details are you looking for that you couldn’t find yourself by knowing which curriculum is used? Knowing which curriculum is used would allow you to look at the curriculum website, see examples, booklists, materials, summaries, and you could view the textbooks and teachers manuals by asking at the school. Which “level of detail” are you looking for that wouldn’t be covered by this? To be honest, your dismissal of the importance of which specific curriculum is used doesn’t back up your claims that you have gone through this process yourself. The only additional “level of details” you could get is access to the individually created lesson plans of each teacher, classroom decorations/posters, read aloud books, differentiated worksheets, etc, and it would be ridiculously burdensome and unmanageable and damaging to education to try to require these in advance.2. You claim you sought out information regarding the curriculum at your local district Can you provide the name of the curriculum you disapproved of to back up your claim? Can you explain, specifically, what was in it that you disapproved of?
977	1	Maybe Karen shouldn't butt into the mutterings of a private conversation. No one was at risk of being beaten and/ostracized. Karen....While I understand you being offended, BITCH the world doesn't revolve around you. Find a goddamn bookclub Busy Body Betty.
587	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/bookdiscussion using the [top posts][link] of the year!
831	2	I’d also try r/suggestmeabook or r/whattoreadwhen.
101	2	There is an entire AA service manual as well as a number of other documents.  For positions I've held, I've relied on AA literature as well as the wisdom of others to learn the job.  For example, for a Literature Chair, I'd probably look  on the AA website, or google "aa literature chair duties".  To track down someone that does that position in another district, I'd contact another district.  Back to my question, have you done the steps with your sponsor?
355	1	Look at this literary fuck. No BCJ mods are allowed to mod here, that would be like a r/bookscirclejerk mod also moderating r/truelit - that's just creepy.
205	1	Mm I have a long reading list that I'm working through (currently halfway through Polysecure and waiting to read Designer Relationships when the library has it). If you remember the book name, I'd be keen to add it to the list!
387	1	I moved to the UK from the US five years ago. I rented a room from a nice lady when I first arrived and about a week in the lightbulb in the table lamp went out. No biggie, I thought, I'll just change the bulb. What ensued was an hour of trying to unscrew that @*#!ing lightbulb. No one told me that there were different lightbulbs in the UK! Once I figured that out I was able to replace the bulb and...it still didn't work. I felt awful. I'd been in this poor woman's house for a week and had already managed to break something. When she got home that night I shamefully showed her the lamp and promised to buy her a new one. At which point she told me that the lamp just needed a new fuse. What the actual f*@k??? Seriously, they need to put these things in the tour guide books.
703	1	I know this may sound goofy but I’ve been trying to train myself to put down the phone and pick up the kindle or a paper book whenever I see a picture of a book/read list/post in /r/books or /r/52book (I just got curious about this post and clicked in)
521	3	I use a books multi, so I've got a lot of less active subs on it. Apart from audiobook subs, free ebook subs, and ones already mentioned, here are the rest of my (relatively inactive) book subs:/r/bookdiscussion/r/booktomovie/r/epicpoems/r/literature/r/mythsandlegends/r/neilgaiman/r/robolit/r/truebooks/r/weirdlit/r/wodehouse
637	3	**[Mongolian death worm] [link]The Mongolian death worm (Mongolian: олгой-хорхой, olgoi-khorkhoi, "large intestine worm") is a creature alleged to exist in the Gobi Desert. The creature first came to Western attention as a result of Roy Chapman Andrews's 1926 book On the Trail of Ancient Man. The American paleontologist described second-hand tales of the monster that he heard at a gathering of Mongolian officials: "None of those present ever had seen the creature, but they all firmly believed in its existence and described it minutely".
175	3	I don't think anybody's coopting anything. this is the elite. the bogus piety of truelit people is intolerable. even media types know that.writing is the only way out and it always has been. it's extremely difficult to write any book and virtually anyone who does should get respect -- exception for the mind-bending hypocrisy of the moralizing a stuff which is nothing but careerism
471	1	I see, that sounds very interesting, and challenging! No wonder people recommend reading articles that help you understand the books better. And with such a big cast everything is still written in their own pov?
826	2	I really like your advice on building your own syllabus - you give some pointers, but it's often difficult to do without an expert instructor. Do you have any further concrete advice? I give some in [my own comment][link], which basically boils down to three pieces of advice (1. look up other people's syllabi; 2. use anthologies, reader's guides, books on themes, introductory books, and books with good study questions; 3. read on the literary criticism and historical context around a particular work), but I'm interested if you'd like to expand further.
222	2	You think you know what's inside the last house on Needless Street. You think you've read this story before. That's where you're wrong.
604	1	Well God bless Oprah. I hope she has a long and fulfilling life. She surely made the world great with her booklists and interviews. God bless her
38	1	Silly truelit users…me dont use punctuation
832	1	/r/options /r/thetagang have booklists etc.  Your broker shd have videos, papers etc, they have a vested interest in you not blowing
8	2	Fun fact about the origins of the Wiccan Rede https://www.religioustolerance.org/wicrede1.htmIt origins come from a few different text, including Crowelys book of law. Point being It’s a moral belief one chooses to subscribe to, a personal choice. The origins are not ancient, folks that created Wicca thought it was a good idea to create this as a moral guideline, which is fine. People act like it’s a fact and it’s really not. It’s mostly like a personal vow you are taking to harm none and should not be pushed onto everyone that practices magic especially non-Wiccans.
133	3	So in ace circles, we discuss our feelings about sex as part of a spectrum just like level of attraction or libido can be a spectrum.It doesn't sound like you're ace if you get aroused looking at women. But there is the sex-favorable to sex-repulsed scale and you might be somewhere on that. Sex-favorable: find having sex (or the idea of such) to be pleasurable and desirable Sex-indifferent: you might be willing to have sex for a partner, but it's probably not something you'd seek out on your own Sex-averse: you don't mind if a sex scene comes up in a movie or book, might seek out porn or smut for fantasy reasons, but the idea of engaging in partnered sex is distasteful to repulsiveSex-repulsed: you don't want to hear about sex, don't want to see it, don't want anything to do with it.The lines between these categories are blurry and others may disagree with my definitions in the particulars. The thing with this scale, is it's more mutable than most others. You can be repulsed today and favorable tomorrow. It sounds like you trend towards the "nope" side of the scale, with exceptions to the favorable side.End of the day, it doesn't matter. It could be just nerves, but many allos don't get quite the level of trepidation you seem to feel. The "I won't die a virgin" trope where a character is facing certain death so sleeps with the first person who seems receptive is a trope for a reason. But then, it also depends on how you were raised. A highly-religious, sex negative upbringing will make any thoughts about sex feel incredibly gross and wrong.Regardless of where you fall, if you relate to the ace experiences, you'll be welcome here.
258	1	My favorite book of his is "This Side of Paradise," and more importantly, I didn't fucking ask you, because I do not need or want your opinion on my taste in literature.
578	1	Why do none of you guys buy books from your booklists 🙁
934	1	Ah, thanks! I reposted it here: [link]
162	1	What?! There is gonna be a second book after mutually beneficial?!?! I don’t see anything on good reads
769	2	r/books gave you permission to post this on r/AskLiteraryStudies ?
317	3	In this haunting existential novella, author, philosopher, and ecologist Steven L. Peck explores a subversive vision of eternity, taking the reader on a journey through the afterlife of a world where everything everyone believed in turns out to be wrong.
78	3	The latter is supposed to change soon... But our center party is doing everything they can to shit on the new trans law. It's been postponed already many times, first it was covid and then what not, excuses. Those centrist cunts do not want to support us at all. Seems that our left are the only ones who are really interested. I don't usually give a toss about politics, but on this one I will. Any vote goes to the left from now on as they have people who care about how I'm doing. The good thing here seems to be the people who work for the trans clinic, they seem actually interested and they know well how shitty our system is. I've had doctors and nurses make between the lines remarks about stuff and they're the ones who have expedited me and actually listened to me. The problem here seems to be the laws and the ancient framework the healthcare system is based upon. Heck, they're having stuff designed back in the 80's and 90's and early 2000's in use without much modernization... Ridiculous. And the people know it, but they still just keep on playing by the book as they're rule believer Finns.
833	2	Let's be real, young JBP was probably just one Marxist bookclub away from becoming a NazBol. I can practically hear him pontificating about how the Chinese are better at tapping into the collective unconscious than the feminized Chaos Dragon West while Caleb Maupin nods along.
313	1	There are a million books on "mindset" and "success". I'll sum their useful bits up for you to save you the time.1) Do at least one thing every day that moves you forward in life.  (Even if for someone that's showing daily it's still something!)2) Spend most of the time in any situation on solving problems instead of discovering blame…3) The buck stops at you.  The world is full of SHIT luck and SHIT people.  The only outcome you can truly control is how you handle things
48	1	I think you might have been misinformed as chemistry and physics are not liberal arts degrees. A liberal arts degree includes the study of history, literature, writing, philosophy, sociology, psychology, creative arts and more.  Also, I got the posters mixed up! My bad dude!!
217	2	Just added all of these to Goodreads and about to buy some of them.
128	1	Damn it! You've got me looking up clips of that movie on youtube. LOL
305	1	I picked up the deluxe edition and got the starter cars which have helped a ton on book 28+. Also scored a gr3 bmw from a 4* roulette that’s NA and can add turbo to it which got me through the turbo and German books
60	2	In class it was hard at first. Sitting in a front row, at the side, no other students next to me, always writing everything down. That helped.I really couldn't make summaries from books in college. So I got them from other students and bought them online. Ive read those and made all kinds of diagrams, cause and effect schemes etc. Summaries were short enough to keep me focused, I could immediately transfer the new information into something understandable and save that in a map on my laptop.This is because I'm really imaginative so I can/need to  see some sort of picture with not too many words. In that way I could memorize from 3 sheets of paper more information then my classmates from piles of summaries. If I know the red line in a story (that's the difficult one to get) then I know the details.
920	1	Definitely! Mostly on /r/52book - sometimes a cover catches my eye and makes me want to read it.I still will look up things about the book to confirm it doesn't have content I don't want to read (erotica, etc). But the cover got me interested.
646	2	/r/ScottMeyer was the best I could find. For a lot of, lets say not super popular authors, there's not going to be much better sadly, you'd be better off discussing it in /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/fantasy, and so on.
845	1	oh, i responded twice to you, so I'mnot sure if yoi saw my rankings. Here it is [link]

589	2	{{The Power}} by Naomi Alderman. Read it in my bookclub and it generated a decent discussion.  Not an exact fit for superheroes but more along the lines of gaining superpowers
691	1	Man this sub really needs a rule about not posting homework help, /r/askliterarystudies already has one.
404	1	This movie has one of my favorite endings, it’s just so satisfying!
962	3	Poor Dionis or Poor Dionysus (Romanian: Sărmanul Dionis, originally spelled Sermanul Dionisie; also translated as Wretched Dionysus or The Sorrowful Dionis) is an 1872 prose work by Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, classified by scholars as either a novel, a novella or a modern fairy tale. It is a liberal interpretation of contemporary German philosophy and ancient motifs, discussing themes such as time travel and reincarnation through the lens of post-Kantian idealism.
664	1	Get a pet. Make some friends. Join a bookclub. Join a church. There are many ways not to be lonely. I love my kids, but they have their own lives, and one of them lives a couple of thousand miles from me. They don’t belong to me, and it’s not their job to make me happy
536	2	I think some of the heavy hitters in r/52book balance out the nonreaders.
228	1	well,i didnt think while i was making it but here is some of my ideas:First animasyon-s(animation in turkish) would probably be funded by government,they would be adaptations of old literature works(novels etc.) and folklore heroes.I dont think we would really get something like the turkish Evangelion or something like that,but maybe it could rival japanese ones,or even both combine or something to make "pan-asian animation sector" or sorts.
461	2	Thanks for posting to r/Vegan!Check out [3 Movies][link] and watch three thought-provoking movies that shed light on uncomfortable realities. 3 Movies also includes other videos, books, challenges and resources for you get started!
528	3	Like they are lacking empathy? So the society of Omelas is contingent upon the unhappiness of one person, and the ones who don't walk away from Omelas lack empathy for the one child that has to suffer.It sounds like alienation, in a broad sense, which is taken up by many authors differently. Marx identifies four varieties of alienation under capitalism, one of which is alienation from other people. For Marx the concept of alienation from your fellow "man", and/or a conception called the species-being, is going to hinge dramatically upon how people relate to each other, and how people relate to commodities under capitalism.For other authors, the concept of alienation shows up with relation to Alienation of people from each other regarding the subject of race and race relations; men from women on the basis of perceived differences along genders, and so on. You might get a better, and more precise answer, from r/askliterarystudies as there are a lot of works interpreting Le Guin literarily. However one video discussion I think is somewhat relevant, is this one from Jeremy Rifkin. He suggests that utopia lacks empathy, and that empathy is anti utopian. Since you're asking about a classic utopian fiction with I think this is a reasonable way to go.

645	3	[link] Lüshi (traditional Chinese: 律詩; simplified Chinese: 律诗; pinyin: lǜshī; Wade–Giles: lü-shih) refers to a specific form of Classical Chinese poetry verse form. One of the most important poetry forms of classical Chinese poetry, the lüshi refers to an eight-line regulated verse form with lines made up of five, six, or seven characters; thus:  Five-character eight-line regulated verse (wulü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of five characters each. Six-character eight-line regulated verse is relatively rare. Seven-character eight-line regulated verse (qilü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of seven characters each.

694	3	Klara and the Sun is the eighth novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British writer Kazuo Ishiguro, published on 2 March 2021. It is a dystopian science fiction story. Set in the U.S. in an unspecified future, the book is told from the point of view of Klara, a solar-powered AF (Artificial Friend), who is chosen by Josie, a sickly child, to be her companion. The novel was longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize.

Transfer to United: you don’t need a United card to this, you just need a United MileagePlus account (free). UR transfer at a 1:1 ratio.4. Transfer to a Star Alliance partner like Aeroplan. You’ll have to check all the Star Alliance programs UR transfer to for availability and pricing; awardhacker can give you a rough idea of the minimum pricing for each program.For #3 and #4 you should compare the number of miles required to the number of UR required for #1 or #2.
736	2	/r/bookdiscussion ? It seems mostly abandoned, but the mods are still active in other subs, so if they're not interested in moderating, perhaps they could add someone from here who wants to do it.
36	3	Here's an [article][link] about why asking pocto educate you on racism is violent (its emotionally and psychologically violent, and emotional/psychological violence IS violence). And here's an [article][link] with a booklist-- although you are welcome to google "booklists for white people who want to learn how to not be racist" and find others.
149	1	I can't say that yet, cause I'm only on the first book but I was thinking more of like an HBO format with 12 or 13 episodes a season, with the way the first book is going at such a fast pace, it could easily be told in that amount of episodes, but I like your idea too!
406	1	Hah, I like to read complaints that are witty, sarcastic, and overall funny, or do some clever wordplays. On the other hand, there are some that probably belong to the more serious subreddits like arrwriting, arrbooks, truelit and so forth, especially the extra snobbish comments about how X author / X book is trash in an ironic manner. As much as sometimes we feel writing is out jerking wcj, some comments in here feel like they belong there not here. For example, the guy who was making funny reviews about pirate books, Dan Brown etc. - it was a pleasure to read. A guy who just repeats [quote], idk, that's not very "jerky".
18	2	And even just reading. While not all kids are big into reading, it seems deliberate that not a single one was seen on camera with books. No one dragged Harry Potter to sibling x(12)'s Birthday dinner, no one was ever just tucked into a corner with a copy of the Hunger Games or To Kill A Mockingbird or Hatchet or Bridge to Terabithia.I'd want to just start by encouraging them all to read more.
230	1	I have so many notebooks that I just love looking at and maybe sometimes I pet the blank pages. My handwriting SUCKS and I feel like it would ruin the books if I wrote in them.
21	1	Both of their populations were displaced and murdered after their home was invaded...
442	3	Arbitrary ranking of needs, these are almost all equally important:1. Tenderness and support while I build my empire.2. Consistent sex and affection. 3. Complimentary aesthetic tastes and sensibilities- I put in effort to not look like a slob in public and she still looks better than me. 4. A moral code (religious or not, idc) she actually follows even when it’s socially inconvenient-her friends are a sounding board but not the source of all her opinions.5. Cultured and actively curious about learning more about the world in a broad range of fields from science to music to art to literature.
620	3	Popular enough to be known among those who like to read. Pick any mainstream "top 100 novels" list -- e.g. [Time's Top 100 Novels of 1923-2005][link] or [Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century][link]. The vast majority of those books have been translated into Japanese.

522	2	I love "Julián is a Mermaid" and "Julián at the Wedding" by Jessica Love, as well as "My Shadow Is Pink" by Scott Stuart. The author who wrote "Ada Twist, Scientist!" has also written lots of books that aren't explicitly about gender, but they feature children defying gender norms and exercising their independence and talents.Social Justice Books also has some really great book lists that cover lots of different topics. Here's their list of recommended books pertaining to Gender Identity: [link]
747	2	r/bookclub are doing a read along of this right now also if you’re interested.
259	3	Its actually incredibly rare. "The syndrome is rare: according to data from the [FBI][link], about 5% of hostage victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome."[link]Thats just hostage situations, not being tortured and raped.In her 2019 treatise on [domestic violence][link] *See What You Made Me Do*, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a "dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria", and stated that it is "riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie"; she also noted that a 2008 [literature review][link] revealed that "most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists."So no before anyone jumps in with their incel crap, it is not common for rape and abuse victims to sympathize with their attackers.
111	1	You are a survivor. And it sounds like you’ve had to go this road alone for a very long time. Your growth in education shows not only are you smart but sales is a combination of people skills drive. Those skills are hefty like a college degree. Before Covid, you were moving in the right direction…away from your past and towards a better unknown present future. Covid shifted many things but you still have your compass know what direction you want to be headed in. Right?I grew up in a challenging situation,1hat not to be! From that point on, any opportunity in friendship, experience, adventure that was very different then my up bringing I gravitated toward. I wanted to learn from the kindest of people who had healthy self esteem. Books! The best books to expand my knowledge in mental health, finding peace within, and being better. Anything I could try and help out with or contribute my time too with really awesome projects, motivated me on a course I never knew existed but knew I wanted more of. And anytime I could join in any type of adventure just helped solidify the healthy path I was on.
264	2	The exchange between Eowyn and the Witch-King was much more better in the books, at least per dialogue.
192	2	Downloading Samples on Amazon (button below Buy) before committing to the purchase has been invaluable. My wallet thanks me. Also making use of Returning Kindle books if I DNF for a full refund.
431	3	Yes it’s impossible to practice but if you are intellectually challenged or 15 years old it sounds good.One smart person in history named Rothbard wrote some good literature on how anarchism would work but for every missing variable he plugged in “humans are rational and will also just follow the nap for some reason”, so his entire work is impractical. It’s just a great thought experiment.

319	3	And here's an [article][link] with a booklist-- although you are welcome to google "booklists for white people who want to learn how to not be racist" and find others.Much of what is most popular on reddit is theory that really stands alone or uses examples from a book to illustrate a larger point about criticism as a whole.  For example, if you read something like "The Function of Criticism" by Terry Eagleton, it's literary theory but the bulk of what is written is written to explain a viewpoint about how literary criticism has become a classist endeavor and has ostracised normal people from contributing.  There are a few notes here and there to novels, but it's really a work of its own that should be judged as something closer to a work of literature in its own right.
24	2	I haven’t seen the other two you mention, but we’re watched the Adam Protect the other night and it was delightfully mediocre. Couldn’t think of a better way to mindlessly pass an hour or two.
116	3	As comedian Louis C.K. put it, “Everything’s amazing, but nobody’s happy.” Even for the most fortunate among us, material abundance comes at a very high price. Facebook is a hollow replacement for face time. We produce more food than ever, but hunger and malnutrition are standard in most of the world while the rest of us stuff ourselves quite literally to death. Despair darkens ever more lives as rates of clinical depression and suicide continue their grim climb in the developed world. A third of all American children are obese or seriously overweight, and fifty four million of us are pre-diabetic. Preschoolers represent the fastest-growing market for antidepressants, while the rate of increase of depression among children is over twenty percent, according to a recent Harvard study. Twenty four million American adults are thought to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder—mostly attributable to the never-ending wars that have become part of modern life for the swelling underclass with few other employment opportunities.
485	3	Casual fans include non-book readers, and most of them will definitely watch it for dragons.
508	1	I love good histI love good history stories when it comes to nonfiction for the most part, and if it's the right author it reads like fiction almost with the added layer of true story to it. I read nonfiction to learn and fiction to enjoy or stimulate my imagination. I've also been listening to audio books on hikes, in the car, or doing chores which gives me more chances to fill me head! Definitely, I think Goodreads is just what I needed.That's probably a healthy balance of gaming, honestly. I appreciate the fact you tend to commit to one game at a time and finish it; I could be a lot better with that, especially with TV shows. At least once you make the decision you follow through with it! 😅 I've heard some good things about Ori, and the art looked really nice for it!Wow that's a hard question, now that I think about it! Sorry to put you on the spot like that. If I'm being honest, I'd probably have to say Minecraft was my favorite indie game I've ever played. It's massive now, but when my friends and I all bought it, it was only sort of recently into beta and wasn't owned by Microsoft yet. Some of my friends had started playing it in alpha even. We were fresh into high school, so no cars yet, and we put a ton of hours into like 2 servers over the course of 2 years. The fact that I was hanging out with my friends and the game was regularly being updated to add new things for us to do and explore and building massive projects together late into the night are memories I'm pretty fond of. Minecraft was a really fun gaming experience that I don't think will ever truly be replicated for me in adulthood. I would say, in general, PC gaming in high school with my friends amounted to my favorite times on video games - we would sometimes cop random cheap games on Steam sales too, and we played a lot of Team Fortress 2 and Payday 2. One of my top gaming experiences happened in Skyrim though, and playing through Shadow of the Colossus (which I can't recommend enough) on PS2 was an incredible single player experience!Well anyways, I could go on, but I don't want to take up all your time lol. It's been a real pleasure talking with you, and thank you so much for your suggestions on booklists and Goodreads! I will definitely get some use out of it. And sorry for the delayed response, I've been busy and off Reddit for a bit!ory stories when it comes to nonfiction for the most part, and if it's the right author it reads like fiction almost with the added layer of true story to it. I read nonfiction to learn and fiction to enjoy or stimulate my imagination. I've also been listening to audio books on hikes, in the car, or doing chores which gives me more chances to fill me head! Definitely, I think Goodreads is just what I needed.That's probably a healthy balance of gaming, honestly. I appreciate the fact you tend to commit to one game at a time and finish it; I could be a lot better with that, especially with TV shows. At least once you make the decision you follow through with it! 😅 I've heard some good things about Ori, and the art looked really nice for it!Wow that's a hard question, now that I think about it! Sorry to put you on the spot like that. If I'm being honest, I'd probably have to say Minecraft was my favorite indie game I've ever played. It's massive now, but when my friends and I all bought it, it was only sort of recently into beta and wasn't owned by Microsoft yet. Some of my friends had started playing it in alpha even. We were fresh into high school, so no cars yet, and we put a ton of hours into like 2 servers over the course of 2 years. The fact that I was hanging out with my friends and the game was regularly being updated to add new things for us to do and explore and building massive projects together late into the night are memories I'm pretty fond of. Minecraft was a really fun gaming experience that I don't think will ever truly be replicated for me in adulthood. I would say, in general, PC gaming in high school with my friends amounted to my favorite times on video games - we would sometimes cop random cheap games on Steam sales too, and we played a lot of Team Fortress 2 and Payday 2. One of my top gaming experiences happened in Skyrim though, and playing through Shadow of the Colossus (which I can't recommend enough) on PS2 was an incredible single player experience!Well anyways, I could go on, but I don't want to take up all your time lol. It's been a real pleasure talking with you, and thank you so much for your suggestions on booklists and Goodreads! I will definitely get some use out of it. And sorry for the delayed response, I've been busy and off Reddit for a bit!
329	2	Maybe not the biggest goal, but a little pipe dream I have. There is a tiny shop on a side street near my house, it was a book shop once upon a time. It's a florist at the moment but I'd love to one day open it up as a little used book shop! I'm sure I would never make any money but I could read and talk about books if anyone actually came up the street to browse in it.
891	2	Booklists, my favorite thing to share! I've been jotting titles down as they came to me.  Standing trigger warning for these, as everything RBB-relatable that has the potential to give solace also has the potential to trigger, a couple have SA content handled with sensitivity.. *Fiction* isa Tuttle, The Silver Bough Maggie O'Farrell, Hamnet T.H. White's The Once and Future King, especially The Queen of Air and Darkness Jude Morgan, PassionSusan Palwick, Shelter, Flying in Place Angela Carter, The Magic Toyshop Ursula LeGuin, GiftsGoodnight Mr Tom, Michelle Magorian Elizabeth Wein, The Winter Prince and the rest of her Lionhunters series. Maureen McHugh, Mothers and Other Monsters--worth it for the title alone :p--and all the rest of her her excellent novels. ...and Diana Wynne Jones.  Pretty much everything she wrote explores RBB themes and characters through the prism of story.
465	2	I disagree.Both books are written with a more realism than typical Gothic horrors. Instead of ghosts and witches, both are about creations in a science lab. Science itself at the time was not greatly understood among the masses, and the books are written less as fantastical, and more as what if, as if both horrors could happen to contemporary readers. Just because science seems ridiculous to us now, doesn't mean it didn't scare readers back then. After all, alchemy was thought to be a serious endeavor and the precursor to the natural sciences.
301	4	Let's think about the cyclical nature of existence, like the water cycle. Imagine yourself as a pond. A pond exists, then when it's warm it evaporates. The pond as we once recognized it doesn't exist, but it didn't disappear. Its water is elsewhere now. Eventually it will rain, and the same pond will grow but be filled with new water.Your life will slowly evaporate elsewhere until you cease to exist in the form you label as yourself. But your life still exists everywhere that you left a piece of it and serves to fill the ponds of others.
919	1	When I was a wee lad, all the school booklists were submitted to the school and we picked it up from school. Is this a thing of the past and up to the parents/guardians to chase up before the year starts nowadays?(Don't have my own kids, left school in 1987, I have no idea how things work in regards to schools and schooling)
663	1	 I'm thinking central Phoenix to North Tempe/South Scottsdale area. Open to other ideas though.
279	3	Sam Harris is another aggressive anti-intellectual who hijacked the concept of "civility". He is a thinker, writing books on subjects he knows nothing about, with zero self-reflection. He is more put together than Peterson, it is not hard to be, but he is still as if Dunning-Kruger came to life. People like Sam Harris actively make the world a stupider place.
672	1	He asked me to get naked sa videocall after ng bookdiscussion
861	2	There's [A Different Sort of Normal][link] by Abigail Balfe. It's a heavily illustrated memoir. It's aimed at the middle-grade level (BookTrust suggests age 9+), but I remember being a five-year-old reading way above my nominal level, so I'm not about to gatekeep! :-) It talks about autism, and about what it's like growing up autistic (without knowing that's what you're doing). It might not be quite what you're after, but do take a look; even if you decide it's not right for your son, you might well enjoy it yourself.Bonus: Reading to the end of that article, I discovered that BookTrust have an ["Autism" list][link]: children's and YA books featuring characters on the autistic spectrum. I haven't read them so don't know if any of them would suit, but hopefully someone else here will, or you'll be able to find helpful reviews somewhere.
949	1	Well, on reddit There are 390+ [author, reading, and writing related subs][link]
799	2	I use goodreads, and look at what "lists" the book I like is on, browse by genre, etc.  I also like to go on here and read the /r/booksuggestions or /r/whattoreadwhen .  If i have something specific I want I post but usually I find posts that other people have written that I can relate to as well.
163	1	Auto correct,  book not box
171	2	You'll be on a VIP tour where you'll get to discover in depth about the author's inspiration to create this story as well as their personal journey to bring this book to the readers.
71	1	I agree it’s kinda dumb to just throw books away, but we also need to stop treating all books like they’re holy manuscripts with a higher purpose.Not every book is Shakespeare - anybody and anything can get easily published and there’s A LOT of garbage literature out there.Another argument is that throwing books away is a waste of paper, but we wipe out asses with toilet paper every day and nobody bats an eye.
297	2	You are the one making this connection. You are the one saying there is actually a connection, honestly it seems like you're the one with the problem, not anyone else. It's like when people try to claim orcs in fantasy literature are racist. Yes, because there's totally a connection there, though I've never seen anyone in real life that looked or acted like an orc from LoTR, thankfully. I've never seen the goblin conspiracy before I saw it online somewhere. Some people man.
850	1	are you dual booting (windows/linux) or multi-booting multiple OS installations?  What Linux distros. and version have you tried and detail the good and the bad with them.  Share any solutions you've acquired.
189	1	FWIW, I am 46 and started training seriously a couple of years ago. It took my blood pressure from borderline hypertension to totally fine. My cholesterol was fine and remains fine so I don't have personal experience with that. However, apparently there is evidence in the scientific literature that exercise can improve lipid profiles. The mechanism isn't fully known but is thought to be from metabolizing lipids instead of glycogen. Maybe polarized and a lot of Zone 2 would be better approach than SS for improving blood work, since there's more fat metabolism happening with long Zone 2 work? Just a thought.
639	2	Forget not that it is a city like all others. If you want to experience real interesting things, start an activity that will connect you to people in zurich. One of the greatest things is dancing: check out salsa and bachata if you want to experience greatest moments. Else i suggest sports like volleyball or cultural activities like sailing or bookdiscussion groups. Whatever stick to an activity, without it, wherever you go it seems boring and empty. With it great and all starts deveoping on its own
112	1	🤬🤬🤬🤬It would be a really bad movie if it wasn't reality.
846	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/52book using the [top posts][link] of the year!
255	1	I got into Adventure Time after a long hiatus and felt like buying myself some book or merch and it's actually insane how everything is out of print/sold out. Like what the heck. Wanted AT Munchkin board game? Sold out everywhere. Wanted figurine of Finn? Sold out everywhere. Seen a cool t-shirt - out of stock. Art of Ooo? Out of print. It makes me feel like AT is some totally forgotten niche franchise from the 90s. Look at Simpsons having merch 20 years after they stopped being relevant...
287	1	You are also making assumptions about the TYPE of reading that is happening. For instance, I devour books like candy. However, if you ask me a month later to describe the book, or name a character (haha, can't do that even while reading it!), or even name the books I just read, I won't be able to do it. I am not reading for deep comprehension or memory here - truly just reading for a cheap thrill of immersing myself in this world, borrowing the emotional thrills, and turning off the rest of my brain for a bit.Other people might be reading in a way where they are actually paying attention to the plot, examining the writing, trying to guess what's going to happen next, getting deep messages about life, etc. I also read for fun, and have no idea what Storygraph? is, and don't even have a goodreads account (although sometimes I think that would help me keep books straight and help me remember what I've read lol). Maybe separating your reading from some kind of gamification would help you get back to reading for actual enjoyment and not feeling obligated to reach some arbitrary goal?
773	1	Spend more time reading rather than checking out booklists, forums etc where you usually find new books to add? :)
772	1	Already done it mate, been Post Menopausal for \`\`10yrs, just didn't turn me into a lying whiny bitch like scummo.Tuesday- bookclub day on r/perth, the second worst day of work, one of the days you change your undies in the morning, your bin night.
14	3	Stockholm syndrome is not "extremely real"Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders][outside link] or DSM, the standard tool for diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses and disorders in the [USA][outside link], mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research.In her 2019 treatise on [domestic violence][outside link]*See What You Made Me Do*, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a "dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria", and stated that it is "riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie"; she also noted that a 2008 [literature review][outside link] revealed that "most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists."I could perhaps understand it as a narrative device after she got the God power if she was lavished with praise by Fritz and treated with honor and respect, but every panel shows her still being treated like shit and she would know he even fed her to his children when she died.
463	2	I recently discovered Comic Books Are Burning In Hell, and it's definitely the best comic-related podcast I've come across. Also good, but no longer running, are The Comics Alternative and Ink Studs.
17	3	I remember in the 1970s, Nestle was pushing their baby formulas in Africa by telling moms it was better than breastmilk. Our middle school English literature teacher told us and urged us to boycott Nestle. Nestle has been evil for a long time.
85	1	This is the  one I have waited to read by R Lee Smith. I read some of her stuff years ago and wrote reviews on Goodreads and seriously after every one of her books 1- whoa 2- book hangover for weeks 3- will I ever be the same human again lolol 😂She's immersive and crazy AF crack author. Very distinctive and amazing for anyone looking for an experience off the beaten path. She's like the most scary and exhilarating roller coaster of fiction that I've discovered and I'm a life long perpetual reader!
72	2	I mean their adaptions of AFFC and ADWD diverged fairly heavily from the source material even before they ran out of books.
689	1	I read a lot!  You should join r/52book!  You don’t have to have a goal of 52 any goal is fine and it’s a nice chill welcoming book sub.
33	3	The Major and the Minor is a 1942 American comedy film starring Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. It was the first American film directed by Billy Wilder. The screenplay credited to Wilder and Charles Brackett is "suggested by" the 1923 play Connie Goes Home by Edward Childs Carpenter, based on the 1921 Saturday Evening Post story "Sunny Goes Home" by Fannie Kilbourne.
993	2	There are other subreddits more dedicated to discovering books - /r/suggestmeabook and /r/booksuggestions are very directly that, but /r/currentlyreading, /r/52books, /r/whattoreadwhen, /r/firstpage and just plain old /r/books are also possibilities. I don't think this sub needs to fill that niche also.
