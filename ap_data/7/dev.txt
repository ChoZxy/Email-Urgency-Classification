801	1	oddly gelatinous pan-roasted pork chop that spent more time than it needed to in sous vide
792	0	You probably put less thought into your college honors thesis than the restaurant did into the accompaniments it serves with cheese.
858	0	The falafel, made from scratch, are exemplary, crisp-crusted and practically melting inside.
611	1	a skewer of grill-crisped lamb neck with peas and fermented green chilli that could easily have just escaped from a celestial kebab
46	1	Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde?
882	1	foul-smelling yellow curries of fermented bamboo shoots; delicate lemon curries; wild tea leaves cooked down like creamed spinach with bits of gluey-skinned catfish
283	1	Garlic, ginger, scallions, habanero, cilantro and parsley meld with the goat over 24 hours. By the time you’re spooning its gravy over rice, the meat is tender and perceptibly herbaceous.
468	0	Finally seated, we mournfully chomp through our lunch.
976	1	And you will hunt for bäco, which may or may not include beef, crunchy pork belly, scallions and something like a Catalan romesco sauce. If you manage to land one, it will be a little like bumping into Ozzy Osbourne in the elevator: an encounter you will talk about for weeks
659	1	Maple syrup is one of those things I kid myself is almost healthy, good for us, brimming with antioxidants, fizzing with manganese and riboflavin, potassium and zinc, up there with “superfoods” bananas or broccoli.
577	1	The first, a bubbled flatbread, comes with sieved tomatoes, the vivid pulp joyfully scarlet in its puddle of fine, nippy olive oil; and insanely silky tahini — not a trace of bitterness.
302	1	A sausage patty rests on the split biscuit’s bottom half; the meat and bread are nearly equal in width and girth, fortifying the sandwich’s foundation.
827	1	Melted Fontina with bacon and trumpet mushrooms come on airy slabs of grilled bread rather than on thin slices of baguette, pastas are correct, and grilled anchovies are laid so beautifully on their plate that you rather suspect an art director.
273	0	As with the mandi, the kitchen presents variations on themes with stews: vegetable with ground beef, lamb and vegetable; all-vegetable; and shrimp with tomato and garlic. Each appears in its small bubbling cauldron, most graced with hilba.
83	1	The rice almost invisible under very long and very soft and unadorned ribbons of fish
579	1	black bream ceviche, the fish so fresh it almost crunches, a forest of perky herbs and mandolined radishes on top, swimming in citrus and more of that good oil.
229	0	For a gifted chef and proven leader, Largey’s menu overly relies on contemporary tropes: beef tartare (ubiquitous at this point), burrata with fruit (nearly impossible to botch), grilled cabbage (the new kale), pork collar (the hip omnivore’s pork chop).
804	1	Brandade, salt cod, whipped with potatoes, had the loose texture of a picnic tuna salad — again, fine to eat, but very different from any brandade you've ever tasted.
584	1	Savoury doughnuts: fat, fried leavened buns stuffed with herby elastic cheese.
713	1	Get the one with garlicky braised greens, fresh mozzarella and homemade belly sausage, a pork bomb with a fizzing fuse.
739	1	It's basically a luxury-class carnitas taco but twisted 90 degrees, made new by the new platform, the sharpness of the pickle and the mephitic breath of turmeric.
910	1	The chewy, smoke-intensive spareribs aren't bad
117	1	There is a heroic veal chop at Charlie Bird, pounded and floured and browned at scorching heat, but not scorched, served with tender porcini slices and wedges of lemon.
349	0	There are five varieties of puff with the Signature Chicken Curry Puff revealing chicken and potatoes flavoured and connected by the “secret spices”.
718	1	where the hand-cut, double-fried potatoes achieve a kind of oily tenderness, and a large order rises from a cafeteria tray, the only platter big enough to handle it, like a steaming, golden-brown Alp.
150	1	When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google’s translator and then back again.
389	1	From Oseyo Korean Food I buy razor-thin slices of pork belly for grilling, lettuce-wrapping and spicy dipping, following a recipe from Jordan Bourke and Rejina Pyo’s excellent book, Our Korean Kitchen.
74	1	One time the sabayon in “oysters and pearls” had broken and separated, so fat pooled above the tapioca.
416	1	Rather than dump-the-peelings-in-the-deep-fryer, these are hollowed-out baked potatoes — perhaps the fillings go into the gnocchi that occasionally appear.
40	1	They are like beignets trying to pass for sticky buns, and almost getting away with it.
724	1	When you suck at a leg, the flesh pulls cleanly out from the shell, firm but not cooked, briny and sweet, and nearly glazed with big clumps of roe.
684	1	It is an iceberg of a doughnut, a flattened demisphere big enough to use as a Pilates cushion, split in two and filled to order with what must be an entire basket of fresh strawberries, and only in season.
800	1	a distinct hit of sweetness in the spaghetti and meatballs; thin-crusted pizzas that are closer to '80s-style California pizza than they are to any of the new-wave Neapolitan pies
593	1	that vegetable-planted filo pot is a little last decade, despite its dusting of powder made from no-waste carrot tops.
668	0	Nobody told the recipe developer that Americans don’t much like small, stale peas in their pasta
500	1	Fish pie is rammed with cod, prawns, scallops — like a piscine Topic, there’s one in every bite — salmon and haddock in a sauce of outlandish richness (theme emerges).
618	1	The pastry is thin, delicate and crisp, the curd sharp and suave, the Italian meringue a blowsy cloud of silky sweetness.
656	1	Tourtière, an offal-stuffed meat pie, its crust slick, sticky and fleetingly sweet.
298	1	We ate it while dunking hunks of youtiao in bowls of warm soy milk and in between bites of beef roll, or a jian (the oyster pancake that is a staple of night markets in Taiwan) and scallion pancake veneered with scrambled egg.
765	1	tiny, thin-shelled creatures, deep-fried whole, which do in fact curl up into insect-like objects that have the odd brown gloss of cockroach shells.
348	1	Curry puffs with a crimp on top — the Malaysian riposte to the pasty, samosa or empanada — attracted customers from far and wide, including the British before the dissolution of the Crown colony in 1963.
346	1	Octopus tentacle marinated in kombucha, briefly grilled and served with glazed bone marrow is another gratifying game to play with knife and scissors and floppy tortillas that arrive in a slightly kinky leather purse.
376	1	Dessert of iced espresso parfait, hazelnut and chocolate meringue points to an accomplished pastry kitchen. A bottle of Le Vent Dans Les Voiles rosé sparks nostalgia for  a lost summer – and a lost world.
778	0	You see a lot of Pan Sans around, which is to say monstrously large plates of pancakes, eggs and breakfast meats.
740	1	a beautifully weathered bowl, a few drops of nigari, a stream of soy milk from a pitcher. Don't stir, the waiter insists. Patience. Five minutes later, the tofu is ready, soft as a sigh, ready to season with planings of dried bonito, grated ginger and a syrupy drizzle of ponzu.
809	0	It was good if you didn't think about it too hard, an ideal end to dinner at a restaurant I was not sure I would ever see again.
922	1	when Mexican-food purists lament the poor quality of beef used in local taquerias, it is most assuredly not to Border Grill's succulent, garlic-stuffed Wagyu rib-eye that they refer.
274	1	Shafoot, a salad of herbed yogurt and cucumbers layered over delicate crepes that bring to mind extra-thin injera, moves in like a cold front between mouthfuls of stew.
959	0	The fresh spring rolls are stuffed with tofu instead of grilled pork and shrimp.
898	0	you can always grab an egg sandwich or a squash-blossom pizza from the newish Gjelina Take Away next door
170	0	One night a bowl of seco de pollo arrived after a very long time; the broth was warm but the chicken in it was cold.
173	1	maybe a soft-edged Negroni, or a mai tai with a pool of dark rum that you smell before you take the first sip, or a JW margarita, which may not be groundbreaking enough to justify the monogram but is smoother and more polished than most.
136	1	The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below.
86	1	Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile.
41	1	When you saw the burger described as “Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,” did your mind touch the void for a minute?
66	1	At Pinch, they stand upright like Hershey’s Kisses, and their skins, though very thin, don’t rupture when squeezed between chopsticks. A single dumpling fits quite comfortably in the mouth.
240	1	Sobrassada, a spreadable Spanish sausage akin to Italy’s ’nduja, fills a small, pancake-thin brioche panino cut into four sections. It’s a play on the from-another-era pigs in a blanket served at entertainment industry hangouts like Sunset Tower and Craig’s.
545	1	On an early weekday evening every table is taken. And it deserves its defiant popularity, with its baskets stuffed with melba toast and dishes of butter curls and complimentary crudités with their vivid aïoli.
968	0	the criollo dish of cold mashed potatoes, becomes the base of a blocky kind of nigiri sushi
547	0	That Chicken Princess Oslo Court, for instance, has a definite air of the condensed mushroom soup.
783	1	you might as well try the banana-cream cannoli, which are less Sicilian than they are the creamy puff-pastry things you find in every fancy Italian pastry shop north of Rome.
560	0	We have an Argentinian sirloin, “bife de chorizo”, er, on the side — sold by lots of menu chat about the animals living “a tranquil and relaxed lifestyle”. Until they’re butchered, obviously.
986	1	You may think of zucchini-blossom fritters as the delicate appetizers you've tasted at Pizzeria Mozza, but Collins stuffs the blossoms with a fistful of baby shrimp before he fries them: They come to the table looking like a plateful of maracas, and you could no more polish off an order by yourself than you could eat six burritos.
98	1	Price of four tiny, cold flour tortillas filled with roast duck, floppy matchsticks of uncrisp duck skin and batons of overcooked foie gras: $26.
970	0	Duck confit, a kind of duck carnitas from southwest France, involves salted duck legs cooked in their own fat for many hours.
218	1	The avocado and pear salad, with its smooth-crisp texture contrasts and its head-clearing hot mustard vinaigrette.
439	0	Its sauce au poivre is rich with brandy and cream, and comes in a jug. Proust me up, baybee.
347	1	What I would love to know is how Old Chang Kee makes their thin, flaky, buttery brown pastry, which manages to seem, or maybe even be, healthy.
138	0	It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes.
576	1	And the breads: Middle Eastern breads deserve to have hymns and poems and odes written to them — paeans, litanies. They offer the perfect collision of elastic dough, smoky from the grill, with the glossiness of oils and butters, the crunch of nutty dukkah or mellow perfumed heat of za’atar.
335	1	We order a Monsoon Martini. ‘This smells like an empty wooden cupboard,’ I say as I sniff appreciatively. Apparently the aroma is due to the inclusion of ambrette seed, also known as musk mallow.
940	1	spooning brick-red broth and vegetables into your bowl, fishing out meaty pieces of blowfish that slip right off the curious, V-shaped bones.
160	1	That’s za’atar dusted over the labneh arranged around two meaty slices of duck breast; another spice blend, baharat, seasons the red piece of grilled Duroc pork beside puréed and pickled squashes.
748	1	A Dal Rae meal begins with a trough-size relish tray, cherry peppers and celery stalks and cucumbers of tremendous girth, and continues with baskets of cheese toast that taste like Pepperidge Farm Goldfish transformed into oily bread.
288	1	The process starts by steeping kernels in the elixir that remains after Uh makes white kimchi, which he infuses with the licorice-y nuttiness of perilla oil and seeds. Some of that essence seeps into the corn too, and after fermentation he stir-fries each batch in a blazing wok with gochugaru (flakes of sun-dried Korean chiles) and paprika.
411	1	English pea, hen of the woods (mushroom) and goats’ curd, and cauliflower, walnut, onion and parmesan, are two fine vegetarian assemblies — but the sort of technique and finesse you would absorb working in a Blumenthal kitchen is apparent in mushroom parfait with shiitake and truffle.
626	0	Fizz and only fizz will do here, preferably while delicately inhaling some superb choux gougères, ripe with Comté.
333	1	The ham is indeed the star. A slice covers most of the plate, flopping over the hash browns and half of the over-easy eggs. It’s lacquered with a brown sugar glaze and thrown on the griddle to caramelize and bronze along the edges.
890	1	the famous gargouillou of French chef Michel Bras, a ballet of vegetables, fruits, nuts, mushrooms and herbs laid sparingly on a plate, often with crumbly chef-made “soil,” which expresses the season and the locale with surgical precision.
908	1	A proper beef roll may be big enough to feed a family of four but is also oddly delicate; it may taste of crisped pastry and clean oil but also projects the muscular minerality of the braised meat.
823	1	He treats his tortillas, with flowers pressed into them, as seriously as he does feijoada or sweetbreads with huacatay, and if you would be pleased to try snails with vinho verde and ham, this is the place for you.
925	1	you are brought a basket of warm chips drizzled with jet-black mole poblano, a chile-laced red pepian and a green pepian made from crushed pumpkin seeds
978	1	His roasted root vegetable shepherd's pie couldn't have been better if it were made with hare or blood sausage rather than roasted turnips and parsnips, and I don't think I have a higher compliment I can pay.
681	0	there’s always the chips. Curiously, they remind me of the ones in the bag at the bottom of my freezer
106	1	Roast chicken tasted the way roast chicken tasted in American restaurants 30 years ago (like nothing) and sat next to a muddy, shapeless swamp of porcini.
504	1	The fattest, most impeccable specimen, pearlescent at its core, barbecued till crusted, in a sparkling bouillon spiked with the restaurant’s own oxtail vinegar. Yes, oxtail vinegar. It’s the gently sour umami slap of this, improbably delicious with the scallop, that drops jaws.
198	1	If you order one, a live specimen is brought out for inspection and reappears a short time later in pieces, mingled with potatoes, green beans and pickled cherry peppers.
966	1	The drinks, designed by cocktailian Julian Cox, are pretty left-field, unless you're the kind of person who expects frankincense dissolved in her rum.
977	0	basically a compendium of what happens to be on the farmers market A-list that week collated with artisanal cheeses, sustainable meats and lovingly handcrafted pastas. As cynics might say, that's not cooking, that's shopping.
587	1	I am polishing off a plateful of lamb chops in a sauce of almost-melted, slow-cooked tomatoes with the salty funk of vanished anchovies, before nibbling on a chunk of mastic-chewy Turkish delight
831	1	if Spice Table is running offal as a special — it often is — it is essential, especially the tripe, which becomes pure smoke and sex over the flames
101	1	There was “baby dancing shrimp,” in a shattering, exquisite batter dusted with ground chiles ($26), and a sea urchin risotto with springy grains of rice, some very fresh chanterelles and almost enough urchin to silence any protests about the price ($48).
355	1	Beetroot, goat’s curd and olive crumb turns that overworked pedestrian root into something profound.
205	0	But she would have been reassured by the meats, which are very brown and, with the exception of a tough and awkwardly carved veal rib, very good.
387	1	I instinctively lean towards green and good for you and go for haricots verts frais extra fins au xérès et balsamique. They are indeed a heap of very fine green beans of the kind you seemingly only find in France. A squiggle on the plate made with sherry and balsamic vinegars is just right and just enough to provide seasoning.
703	0	If you are craving caterpillar rolls or Philly rolls or spicy tuna rolls, you are better off at Wokcano up the street.
521	1	And how posh: the kofte are fat-basted, perfectly spiced and come with tiny rings of acidulated shallot on top, a puddle of sheep’s milk labneh on the side that cradles a pool of sparkling green herb oil.
637	1	Biting into a slice of our 14-year-old dry-aged Rubia Gallega steak, almost purple meat, its fat a deep ochre, I tasted the years, the life, the grass-feeding.
175	1	Although this heap of roughage looks as if it should be taken for medicinal purposes only, the greens have lost their ferocious raw quality after being thoroughly kneaded with a Caesar-like dressing.
471	0	“We only left to take our selfies” — as if this were as essential a part of eating out as menus and waitstaff and debating the tip...I don’t think you’re supposed to actually eat here
826	0	buffalo pigtails with celery and blue cheese dressing; coconut sweetbreads with chutney; fried rabbit legs with aioli.
222	1	Any steak overcooked to ruin feels like a bitter waste. It’s particularly vexing when that fate befalls an exquisitely dry-aged, 36-ounce rib-eye from California-raised beef — a steak so marbled it brings to mind aerial views of sinuous river deltas.
604	1	We have a thali too, for completism, a way of trying four of their vegetarian dishes on one glittery metal tray, with rice, little papads and ferocious lime pickle.
38	1	These are marvelous, and so is the cured cucumber, with a black filigree of char as delicately applied as the lace around the neck of one of Rembrandt’s burghers.
832	1	industrial-strength Vietnamese filter coffee, brewed at table, mixed with condensed milk and stirred into a glass of ice
8	1	Their heat will blister the skins on long beans cooked in butter that teems with golden bits of garlic.
133	1	The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream.
258	0	Another salad, a mix of tomatoes that varyingly pop and squish, summons Greece with its other ingredients: purslane, inky olives, sharp feta.
578	1	the menu is a siren song, drawing you in with the likes of hake kebabs — kebabs in the kofte sense, so more like toasty-edged, dill-packed fishcakes — on a generous bed of cool, thick tzatziki.
934	0	Although the menu is vegetable-intensive, it is far, far from butter-free.
162	1	I am fascinated by the reworked Mont Blanc, shaped more like a croissant than a dome and filled with a snowy white-chocolate mousse; the sweet chestnut crémeux is set against cubes of sage cake and a scoop of sage ice cream.
769	1	Ceviche marinero involves chopped raw shrimp, cucumber, tomato and an oddly appropriate sprinkling of slightly unripe diced mango, in a pungent, black sauce lashed with Worcestershire.
317	1	Slices of roast duck and pork and striated hunks of fried pork belly fan across the bowl with stretchy leaves of gai lan and mounds of chopped peanuts and crushed chiles. It’s vital to squeeze a lime wedge hard over the ingredients and mix it all together before you twirl the first bite onto a fork.
78	1	Bulging agnolotti filled with butternut squash and mascarpone were fat envelopes of pure pleasure.
833	1	You can decide for yourself whether you are transfixed by cigars of Dungeness crab wrapped in micro-thin sheets of toast
313	1	Smoked pork belly, served with fixings for tacos, was rubbery and overcooked; the dish has been spot-on at brunch.
48	0	Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing except oil?
217	1	A rippling, flaky square biscuit covered in curried gravy flavored with ground beef and pork.
128	0	The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb.
305	1	A bowl of grits contains a moat of shrimp “Bolognese” covered in wisps of fried leeks that look like dark, discarded feathers.
60	1	The crackled surface, made of short crust dough blooped out of a pastry bag, doesn’t taste like much but somehow makes the buns more exciting to eat.
920	1	Christofle silver, velvet purse stools and airy sauces inflected with fresh black truffle; Iberico pork
646	1	My Stour Valley guinea fowl breast comes with a kind of pressed cake of its legs, the skin bronzed and crisp; a youthful leek, smoky and tender, bisecting the plate — and there are slabs of king oyster mushrooms, crisscross-grilled like mini steaks and every bit as meaty, all in a heady sauce that suggests the fiendish deployment of the bird’s innards.
845	1	a footlong “sandal” of fried corn dough, too hot to touch but too compelling not to, layered with steaming middens of beans and aromatics and corn smut sautéed with onions, sprinkled with lettuce and crumbled cheese, striped like the Mexican flag
328	1	The wrappers were thick and unevenly shaped, but the dough had just the right amount of give and both kinds of fish tasted fresh; the flavors bloomed even more with a few drops of vinegar.
589	1	a red cabbage terrine that looks like a piece of modern art but, underseasoned and gelatinous, is sadly prettier than it is delicious; balsamic “caviar” that has collapsed into an exhausted guddle
691	1	The soup of duck and bamboo shoots looks on the menu to be the best soup in the world, but in the flesh, it is gray and bland.
404	1	Smoked cod’s roe pâté with “super fresh, raw, spray-free vegetables” brings to mind the story a friend told me about her daughter who is a self-styled hopeless cook...And the cod’s roe is tactlessly salty.
962	0	The tart, creamy potato salad is credited to Aunt Carolyn, the ground beef–intensive chile verde to Mackey's grandpa, the caramel-tasting banana pudding to Mama
664	1	I loved the resonant rice and fragrant beef, and I’m now addicted to Jollof Mama’s insanely fruity-fiery Scotch bonnet hot sauce.
536	1	Dorset crab tostada sounds lovely, the tortilla chips laden with crabmeat, avocado and tatemada, an almost black squidge of scorched chillis. But it’s a mess — the various flavours don’t sing, there’s not enough sharpness, the crab is lost among the rapidly sagging chips.
228	1	Basque cheesecake — a dessert du jour across the country, defined by its airy texture and scorched crown — didn’t need an earthy-sour parsnip puree for contrast.
461	1	In fact it’s a bravura demonstration of the joys of simplicity, the tangy, lactic quality of the buffalo milk lifting a dish — effectively my childhood tea when my mother couldn’t be bothered — into something luxurious, indulgent, the cheese clinging to the butter in a way that’s equal parts soothing and thrilling.
528	1	On top, autumn truffle and shaved, frozen duck liver: a magnificently seasonal, savoury bread and butter pudding, or crazy-bosky pain perdu.
711	1	You probably should get a “garlic knot,” which here is a hollow sphere of pizza dough, tied at the top with string and stuffed with a handful of baked garlic cloves — it's the new-new thing, the first worthy food-fetish object of the new year.
645	1	Brioches and sourdough toast alongside, dripping in melted butter.
225	1	A starter of pork meatballs never disappointed, its Parmesan broth so rife with uplifting umami that it felt like drinking liquid endorphins.
557	0	It has a slithery quality, as though sous-vided before grilling.
830	1	the skewered, marinated meat, grilled over a live fire, which is a Malay mainstay in Singapore, and the lamb belly satay is especially magnificent, crusted black and spurting gamy juice.
694	0	Most of the dumplings, including the Shanghai egg rolls and the crisp turnip rolls, are available only in the daytime, as part of the generally Cantonese dim sum menu, prepared by a different team of chefs
518	1	 scrumpet with duck; crispy oysters with Gigha halibut; purple sprouting broccoli turned into a thing of heady luxury with a deep-fried poached egg and hollandaise enriched — imagine enriching hollandaise! — with café de Paris butter.
721	1	Singaporean who also cooked at Pizzeria Mozza, roasts his bones in the wood fire that perfumes his downtown restaurant and glazes the marrow with a Southeast Asian paste of fermented shrimp and ground chiles that chars and crisps in the smoky heat.
971	0	spiced café de olla at breakfast, chile-spiked hot chocolate for rainy afternoons
164	0	Leticias makes tacos with hornado — soft, fat-basted lumps of marinated and roasted pork shoulder pulled apart while it is still steaming.
736	0	It tastes a little like the thick, handmade tortillas you sometimes get at Central American restaurants.
36	1	The char was served over asparagus (in late fall, though?) with a fish-bone broth that brought another puff of smoke to the proceedings.
149	1	There was an exceptional velouté of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin.
406	1	Courgettes cooked down long and slow with their indolent mulchy appeal make an irrefutable argument for overcooking vegetables.
18	1	One of them got what we’d all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry.
230	1	I did glimpse her genius with simplicity in another meant-for-a-group entree recently introduced to the menu: roast duck, skin translucent and crackling, dotted with citrus and served with lobes of duck leg confit, loamy chanterelle mushrooms and beautifully browned turnips.
21	0	Dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one.
442	1	The kitchen has a lot of fun with vegetables, roasting hispi cabbage and dressing with anchovy mayo and almonds, or serving celeriac with cannellini beans, cavolo nero and pecorino.
620	1	But this is so perfectly balanced and thrilling, it’s slurpable. There are blobs of vivid green emulsion, liquoricey from the Thai basil, and tendrils of crisped purple yam. Astonishingly, this potential sensory overload doesn’t drown out the sweet freshness of the fish — as an opening salvo it’s jaw-dropping.
984	1	The bar, whose cocktails are overseen by Julian Cox, pushes the boundaries of the esoteric into strange, uninhabited regions of tobacco-smoked rye whiskey, rare Spanish vermouth and bitter Sardinian honey.
522	1	Absolute tradition — crêpe, duxelles, buttery pastry and superb gamey meat the perfect shade of pink, paired with clever touches: pickled walnuts lacing the duxelles, a swirl of rich chestnut puree.
747	1	Even the ones who don't like Caesar salad look forward to the ceremonial pulping of the anchovies.
259	1	Fresh thyme perfumes prawns baked in the wood oven and served over sunny cornbread pudding.
111	1	It is too early to assess his work, but I hope he finds time soon to fix the restaurant’s chocolate soufflé, which has become floury and crumbly, a dry cupcake hiding out in a soufflé mold.
264	1	He’s been baking buttery apricot cake sprinkled with caramelized pistachios
192	1	Here the body and flavor of what is typically a rather thin sauce is broadened with a stock made from fish bones. Fresh green chiles provide a heat held in thrilling check by the sourness. The broth is too intensely salty to qualify as soup, the server explained, but I still drank as much of it as I could handle.
431	1	Six fat shell-on prawns come with “mother-in-law” sauce, which could be a jokey reference to the almost hallucinogenic ferocity of the heat from the super-fruity Scotch bonnets, or because it’s his actual mother-in-law’s recipe.
351	1	Singapore laksa with sambal is available and provides a fragrant and flirty partner for the sturdy puffs. In a broth bolstered with coconut milk and laksa leaf, aka Vietnamese coriander, bob prawns, tofu and beansprouts. The slippery rice noodles that you stir in are perfect lockdown nourishment, self-effacing, undemanding, reassuring, quiet.
395	1	First comes burrata — one each — with a puree of dried broad beans and a salad of boiled chicory with chilli oil to season it. Possibly more appealing on a sunny Puglian hillside than on a dank London evening, but as life is teaching us, we are not wholly in control. “Bitter greens are good for us,” I say encouragingly, rather than bitterly.
319	0	A pile of ground pork or chicken stained yellow from a turmeric-forward curry paste and riddled with almond-shaped sataws, otherwise known as stink beans.
24	0	So in the end I simply pointed my phone at my fly and snapped a picture.
116	1	Apart from a near-perfect risotto with tiny clams, the soulful mush of Italian cuisine is mostly banished; when a wonderful classic tripe stew turns up, simmered to vanishing softness in tomatoes, Mr. Hardy spoons it over crunchy slices of toast.
485	1	I order the scone as a “side”; light, ultra-cheesy carbophile heaven when used to grubby up an ascetic starter of cured halibut with jalapeño, yoghurt and pickled cucumber.
508	0	the sheer cashmere luxury of fantastic butter, cheese, even cream
329	1	There’s nowhere in Los Angeles I’d rather eat a three-high stack of blueberry pancakes right now. The edges bounce pleasantly against the fork’s tines, and the interior of the heap is hot and just set but bordering on custardy. Plump berries are scattered generously. I dip a finger in the small syrup pitcher perched on the plate to make sure it’s real maple. Indeed.
891	1	Nicola Mastronardi's food comes from the big, hardwood-burning ovens, flavored with the presence of smoke, forests, stone chimneys and chilly afternoons
465	1	The bitter vegetable has been cooked in the truly Italian way — to within an inch of its life, more slump than side, so its vegetal intensity almost becomes a whole new taste profile.
301	1	Plenty of eyes, shaded or not, gaze on biscuit sandwiches. One version is a vehicle for a mug-size hunk of chicken fried in rippling batter KFC-style.
919	1	bossam is an elegant preparation that, like so many other Korean dishes, seems almost custom-designed to ease down a bottle of soju.
663	1	Suya is a Nigerian street-food favourite — thin strips of meat in a moveable-feast spice blend (usually involving peanut powder, hot pepper and ginger), skewered and grilled.
279	0	Ndolé, also called bitter leaf (or Vernonia amygdalina, part of the daisy and sunflower family), is shredded and then simmered with aromatics and ground peanuts until most of the water boils away.
672	1	It’s served with a cloyingly sweet basil and chilli dressing which makes us bare our teeth.
861	0	Turkish coffee and the complicated Lebanese desserts
949	1	What you get is ramen — specify hard-cooked — that float in soup made from kurobuta pig bones boiled 30 hours: the gossamer noodles add little weight to the broth
799	0	bitter chocolate mousse, peanut butter mousse, bruleed banana slices and bits of candied bacon — are somewhat less accomplished than the rest of the menu.
163	1	In a small oblong park beside the elevated tracks, dozens of vendors sell freshly folded quesadillas, Oaxacan tlayudas, hunks of roasted pork, cups of warm atole, and tacos with a great multitude of fillings.
171	1	Leticias sprinkles some dry, crisp pork skin and a confetti of red peppers over the top so there is something to crunch on, and then surrounds the whole thing with a low curved wall of ripe avocado.
71	1	I don’t know what could have saved limp, dispiriting yam dumplings, but it definitely wasn’t a lukewarm matsutake mushroom bouillon as murky and appealing as bong water.
297	1	We’d get to them, but first my partner and I lunged for the purple sticky rice fan tuan. I’d cut the roll in half to reveal its center: crackling youtiao, revealing caverns of fried dough and a braised egg squeezed into one corner. Pork floss and specks of preserved greens hid in the crevices.
850	1	the best source among many for Chinese bacon fried with leeks, for the cold, hacked chicken with chile, and the oozing lava of its ma po doufu.
189	1	My favorite dish may be the seafood variation on the Sichuan classic Chongqing chicken called Hot and Spicy Lobster: a cut-up lobster stir-fried with nearly enough dried chiles to fill a pillowcase.
639	1	Grilled langoustines were sweet and smoky, crab pintxos laden with flawless crabmeat.
112	1	Order the crêpes suzette and see the guéridon maneuvered into position, the burner ignited, the lump of butter eased around the copper pan, the slosh of Grand Marnier and the quick blue fire, all handled as if it were as simple as stirring a cup of coffee.
846	1	pale, hell-hot habanero salsa Antojitos Carmen calls El Chamuco, the devil, for its ability to infiltrate your soul
255	1	He’d never had the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with Parmesan, one of Goin’s signature bites. We started there, with the tiny, porky cylinders hurling oversize flavors and textures as we bore into them.
287	1	In Cameroon, egusi (dried and ground melon seeds that swell and soften as they cook) is often cooked into a kind of fluffy pudding. As a nod to its steady clientele, the egusi at Mama D’s is prepared closer to Nigerian style, golden with spices and stir-fried to the consistency of a silken tofu scramble. Like the ndolé, the addition of shrimp brings welcome snap and sweet contrast.
773	1	few local restaurants serving the Sinaloan specialty tend to present dry, leathery things, overcooked, almost inedible without sloshings of watery salsa.
772	1	pescado zarandeado, a vast, smoking creature split and flopped open into a sort of skeleton-punctuated mirror image of itself, served on the kind of plastic tray you may remember from your high school cafeteria, which is probably the only vessel broad enough to handle the fish.

17	1	I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole.
85	1	But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant.
72	1	It’s a bit of a mystery what pickled carrots, peanuts and a date wrapped in a soft crepe were supposed to do for a slab of Dorset cheese from Consider Bardwell Farm, but a good first step would have been allowing the washed-rind cow’s milk cheese to warm up to a buttery softness
689	1	You will want an order of the smoked fish, a braised, smoked and fried preparation that likely has made it onto every Eastern Chinese menu in the world, but never this crisp or light
33	1	Traditional serving vessels, for instance, were thrown over in favor of broad porcelain plates and bowls upon which sauces and ingredients were arrayed as meticulously as brushstrokes on a Kandinsky
993	1	Even the pastas tend to be southern things we haven't seen locally, like the twisted noodles with a thick paste of simmered lamb with raw egg yolk and sheep cheese, which nods to the Middle East.
