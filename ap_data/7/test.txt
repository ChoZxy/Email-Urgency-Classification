564	0	the kitchen needs to cool down on the wild oversalting of that fine meat unless it wants to give the carnivorous population of Birmingham chronic hypertension.
93	0	The beef had a species of tenderness that I associate more with bluefin tuna than steak.
185	0	Little teepees of Ibérico ham came wrapped around cold, dry wads of sticky rice.
598	1	a clever salad — more a composed cold dish — of fresh peas, pea puree, ratte potatoes and toasted hazelnuts: genius collision of textures and flavours.
181	0	The bird was precisely carved, as if by a laser. None of us had seen crisper skin — you could bounce a quarter off it.
650	1	Forty gallons of sap are needed to make one of syrup, ranging in hue and intensity from sparkling amber crystal to moody treacle, its sweetness tempered with complex backnotes: chicory and buttered toast, coffee and wood smoke and vanilla. Like an expensive oud-soaked scent, it has length — it lingers.
235	1	Spatchcocked Cornish game hen, its skin papery-crisp and attractively charred, over panzanella salad threaded with mild dandelion greens
28	0	Then we shared a cheeseburger, cut into quarters, and drippingly full of flavor.
614	1	Flawless Cuore di Vesuvio tomatoes flecked with mint in a just-sharp-enough dressing — Lambrusco vinegar, clever. And arancino, singular, a bruiser of a thing (just as they are in southern Sicily), bright emerald inside and laced with crabmeat. It sits on a silky basil emulsion with a very frilly little salad.
469	1	I order chapatis with akkawi (a creamy-curdy Middle Eastern cheese; immaterial as it doesn’t turn up), pickles and za’atar, but they’re identical to the ones I buy frozen from my local Asian grocer.
339	1	Once unwrapped from its paper and ribbon, the tightly trussed chicken with stuffing of brioche, foie gras and black truffle needs covering with softened butter from the jar of butter included.
627	1	the pâté en croûte, with its crisp pastry and layer of vinous jelly, the pearly halibut and its buttery sauce laced with fat, lewd mussels, its soupe à l’oignon balancing cod and pig’s trotter.
805	1	feathery chocolate, pistachio-almond, and cherry ice creams shot out of a Pacojet, layered, and served in a paper cup halved longitudinally, so that it looks like one of those cutaway photos from Nathan Myhrvold's Modernist Cuisine.
638	1	It had a unique pungency. You could describe it as a cross between long-hung beef, blue cheese and cultured butter; or you could, as the pal did, describe it as “rank”.
553	1	The less usual “snowy” dumplings with fish and cauliflower come with two tiny dots of orange fish roe, looking like disgruntled sea creatures. They taste glorious, though, a real belt of fresh ginger.
551	1	Like big babies we order slithery cheung fun, the rice sheets wrapped not around meat or fish but youtiao (fried doughsticks) — soothingly perfect
1	1	When you have her hamachi crudo, you do not want to be disentangling shreds of fresh mint from sparkling lobes of grapefruit that have become smeared with dots of pistachio purée that got mixed up with the pool of glossy orange vinaigrette that used to be ringed in by slices of hamachi that are barely charred along one side.
354	1	a petit aioli leading with a scoop of the garlicky mayo and a soft-boiled egg draped with a glistening, sinuous anchovy is backed up by colour-coordinated vegetables of radishes, radicchio and pink fir apple potatoes, and, maybe because it was there, a  flourish of puntarelle.
896	1	the fairly incredible dish of juicy roast turnips laced with bits of black, served with their own braised foliage and a bitter, bracing shot of chimichurri.
365	1	Duck confit with pomegranate molasses and coriander delivers French tradition with a curtsy to its colonial past with the presence of the molasses.
496	1	French onion soup — otherwise good, finely sliced onions properly caramelised, broth thrumming with an undercurrent of booze — manages to be both lukewarm (soup) and palate-scouringly hot (a loutishly thick blanket of Gruyère).
423	0	Homemade steamed pudding: retro heaven brought bang up to date.
516	1	There’s a pork chop, thick and tender, the colour of baby’s fingernails, with fat butter beans, leeks and garlic slumping into the liquor.
856	0	But the steak is about as good as it gets.
567	1	Yes, sometimes the seasoning can be a tiny bit off: panisses, those Provençal-style chickpea fritters, here reinvented as marshmallow-light batons, savoury cousins to churros, could have done with a bit more than just their lemon thyme to give them edge.
583	1	Under an umbrella, in possession of a rather odd pisco martini, it’s a mellow place to hang. I could imagine hours spent happily over a few glasses of catarratto or vermentino and excellent drinking snacks: fatayer, one of those small tricorn Lebanese pastries, this one featuring stout pastry wrapped around a juicy nugget of minced lamb, rosy with sumac.
373	1	Smoked herring and lentils vinaigrette is offered in two sizes. The smaller is plentiful and, bolstered by an unheralded chopped hard-boiled egg and various vegetables, becomes a life-affirming soup.
492	0	Tacos piled high with crevettes scented with orange and cumin, roasted pepper, tomato salsa, avocado and pickled sumac onions.
57	1	The pan-fried turnip cakes contain flecks of dried shrimp that send their particular intensity in all directions.
436	1	The French part of his fusion menu seems to be represented by “stew vegetable with French bread”, a sorta-ratatouille of no compelling interest other than some vivid fennel and a superb rustic baguette.
210	0	The chowder needed more potatoes, and lobster meat that hadn’t been overcooked.
574	0	Serious-faced chefs are lashed with sweat; I can only hope not too much of it seasons my lemon sole. Perhaps they should chill a little: each of our three cooked fish dishes could have done with a little less flaming time.
796	1	A dish of sauteed green beans includes chile, crumbles of pork and a sweet-hot profile that calls out Sichuan, but without trying to duplicate its essence.
531	1	He returns with a limpid broth of smoked eel and chalk stream trout topped with a flourish of potato puree — fish pie through a Nordic haute cuisine lens.
132	1	White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it’s exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be.
828	1	Diligent ingredient sourcing would practically be a given, as would be the wood-burning oven and the complex small-plate vegetable preparations.
524	1	From an “intro” of “pease pudding hot” — fried squares of split pea puree, like true-Brit panisses, topped with a whisper of cured pork jowl and the weeniest mirepoix of pickled courgettes
758	1	you can get a plate with 10 meats, a psychedelic pinwheel of Vietnamese animal underneath which the broken rice can scarcely be seen.
802	1	The squid salad is basically an order of calamari marinara dumped over a composed salad of lettuce, blood orange and chickpeas — not bad, but not what you'd call coherent
392	0	puff pastry rises more easily and crisply, oddly enough, with the help of rising steam.
5	0	Apart from their fillings — ground meat in the Italian dumplings, ground seafood in the Chinese ones — they are not all that different, which may be the point Bonnie’s makes by calling the dish “wun tun en brodo.”
746	0	a fairly wan excuse for roti, either slicked with coconut milk or served with green curry, but no matter.
623	1	That smoked-to-f*** Goosnargh duck is a belter, juicy meat on slices of apple aubergine grilled till almost frazzled, the lot in a pool of coral-coloured “phat phet jus”, a peppery, clear red curry sauce.
854	1	chefly riffs on the strip steak and the porterhouse, the hash brown and the french fry that occasionally incorporate every last pea tendril and star-anise infusion in the Asian-fusion playbook, plus cocktails not seen in Hollywood since your grandmother went on the wagon in 1963.
675	1	There is also a “deconstructed” vanilla cheesecake, which, as too often, is code for: “We couldn’t be bothered to make a proper cheesecake.” A cushion of whipped vanilla cream lies under a landslide of shattered digestives with a few berries in mourning.
275	0	Ubiquitous shakshouka comes in scrambled form, the medium-firm curds gripping diced tomatoes and onions
937	0	Bottega Louie aims to be all things to all people downtown, and it more or less succeeds
361	1	Kurobuta (black pig) pork belly with blood peach, rock samphire and eel miso glaze is the lascivious side of luscious.
591	1	Stout, chewy pasta agnolotti — pedantically, one agnolotto — with a ferrous nettle stuffing and tangle of eel-like fungi, savoury from “beurre noisette”, a successful dairy-free dupe.
352	1	Praiseworthy on its own, the felicitous combination of coconut rice, fried anchovies, peanuts, boiled egg, cucumber and sambal, provide notes of fragrant, salty, crunchy, cool and familiar (the egg) that could also work as a side dish offering mouthfuls of infinite variety.
526	1	Along the way there’s carrot and “soil”, the acidulated root still retaining its crunch, the soil a mulch of oats and mushrooms underneath a puddle of caramelised carrot puree. It’s like plunging your face into a pile of fragrant, surprisingly delicious loam.
414	1	What drew me to the Black Bear in Monmouthshire was the promise of locally sourced produce, in-house butchery of rare breeds, homemade bread, artisan beers, open fires and the rest of the nouveau boozer checklist,
237	0	A very un-smashburger cheeseburger that combines chuck, rib and top round cuts and costs $27.
892	1	sprinkled with breadcrumbs and baked in its shell until it sizzles; a magnificent veal chop; soft curls of cuttlefish tucked into an herb salad
552	1	Steamers stack up, opening to reveal palest eau-de-nil spinach and scallop dumplings or prawn and chives, all with fat chunks of sweet shellfish in gossamer casings.
204	1	And I imagine she would have taken one look at the crisp, bright-green shaved brussels sprouts that Commerce Inn covers with hot bacon vinaigrette and wondered why they had been taken off the heat before they’d had a chance to turn gray.
789	1	A “raft” is a new creation, basically a buttery bun topped by a burger patty, topped with a frisée salad laced with chunks of small-producer bacon, and in turn topped with a runny fried egg, a burger that seems simultaneously girly and gnarly, which I suppose is the point.
12	0	And after I’ve paid, there is the unshakable sense that I’ve been scammed.
232	1	So the slab of blood cake was like an appealingly dense, subtly spiced pudding, and the egg oozed and tempered its overt richness; the relish, lacy and translucent, lobbed out acidity, and the puntarelle was a fresh, seasonal element that kept resetting the palate for more.
514	1	First the burgers were quietly sidelined in favour of pork fillet wellington — tragedy, eh? — then steadily the whole menu followed suit.
172	1	The chaulafan at Leticias substitutes bits of steak for the usual pork, but you have to be paying attention to notice the change in this riot of fried rice that contains shrimp, chicken, beef, peppers, scallions, possibly some peas, certainly fried egg, conceivably a carrot or two. Served on its own with fried plantains and avocado, it is formidable.
174	0	There is no reason to deviate from that, but the spicy roasted nuts, new since the move, do get along extremely well with margaritas and other cocktails with lime in them.
662	1	Delivered to every table were whole sulphur-fed ducks, preternaturally swollen from a stuffing of black and glutinous rice, jujubes, ginkgo nuts, cinnamon, ginseng, black beans and ground antlers (antlers!), among other unidentifiable items. The skin was paper thin, almost translucent, stretched over its cargo of treasures. It was baked in a yellow clay pot and every element of the dish (including the animal’s sulphur-boosted diet) was, apparently, health-giving — to us humans, of course, not to the ducks.
403	0	A bowl of clams opened with guanciale and freshly podded peas is a fitting first course
592	1	A cut-through of fat oyster mushroom stalk masquerading, with its burnished top, as a sizzled scallop; on the side is an ethereally delicate tartlet brimming with pop-fresh peas and a swoop of sea vegetable puree as green as the deep ocean.
607	1	The dish looks like nothing much, a few peeled cherry tomatoes bobbing in a clear liquid, but we spoon it in and gasp: there’s so much more going on. How, I ask him, how? “Locally grown allotment tomatoes marinated in homemade elderflower vinegar and soy. Dashi made with a local kimchi” — yes, we have kimchi in Kent — “and foraged seaweed. Then topped with fronds of cabbage, deep-fried shiso leaf and black sesame.
629	1	Tarte fine aux pommes, both pastry and apples wafer-thin and caramelised, a quenelle of the silkiest ginger ice cream on top.
868	1	an intricate lamb stew mashed into a thick, homogeneous paste with the texture of refried beans, and an expressed liquid, the soul of the dish, served separately as soup.
720	1	When you spoon the trembling marrow onto a bit of sliced baguette, garnishing it with the rau ram and a sliver of pickled onion, the taste of the leaf is sharp, almost metallic; the funk of the shrimp paste gives way to a low, throbbing chile heat; and the marrow melts on your tongue, meat yet beyond meat; a mellow, liquid bass line that makes the other flavors dance.
315	1	A slice of pastry chef Thessa Diadem’s banana cream pie, bolstered by a crust so flaky you can count layers into the dozens, eases most any disappointment.
44	1	Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret — a lunch-only sandwich of chopped soy-glazed pork with coleslaw and cucumbers — called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson?
480	1	On the plate the investment shows: pork shoulder cooked for 16 hours, crammed into crisp cromesquis and served with tangy homemade ketchup.
30	0	The mashed potatoes were awful, but then Mr. Gokce has never pretended to be Spud Bae.
750	1	Fried shrimp? Served in a ceramic boat, with toast as its sail.
501	0	Roasted cauliflower steak is £24: elitism is a feature, not a bug.
379	1	A dish on the blackboard of girolles with fried eggs on toast is emblematic of the style – homely, not too unfamiliar, but kicked several levels up. Dipping sage and anchovy fritti, ordered for the craic, into molten yolks eliminates any remaining notion of domesticity.
905	1	Her dorowot is jaw-droppingly good, vibrating with what must be ginger and black pepper and bishop's weed and clove but tasting of none of them, so formidably solid that the chicken, which is well-cooked, becomes just another ingredient in the sauce.
860	1	gently spiced links called makanek served awash in oil and lemon
533	1	black rice with squid and smoked paprika would have been glorious if the rice hadn’t been so underdone it was crunchy — while lacking the actual crunch of the layer of socarrat you hope for in an arroz negro.
167	1	There are also tacos with tender, soy-darkened lomo saltado, the Chinese-influenced Peruvian beef stir-fry whose popularity has spilled over into Ecuador; a few of the French fries the dish is normally served with make their way inside the tortillas.
797	1	Lamb belly is sous vide, and braised, and spiced into submission — it is not a tagine but it is wholly tagine-like, inspired by Morocco without including much that a Moroccan chef would recognize, and is not incidentally delicious.
110	0	Anyone with a bottle of olive oil and access to a supermarket produce aisle might easily prepare an heirloom tomato salad that surpasses the one I was served at Le Cirque in August.
520	1	There are still chips and onion rings; divine, both: crisp, golden and greaseless.
679	1	a breast of pigeon is beautifully cooked, but the plate is splattered rather than sauced, and it looks like someone has used a centimetre ruler to carve the cubes of underwhelming black pudding
449	1	And the turnip number is a delicate barnstormer, the crisp root stripped of its bitterness, yoghurt set into something like savoury panna cotta, hint of sour-sweetness, a bravura balancing and layering act.
88	1	It’s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries.
383	1	Some of his signature dishes have made the journey, the best of those we tried being oxtail brioche with its ‘secret mayo-based sauce’, weird and delectable enough to make you want to unravel the mystery.
755	0	And when the waitress asks if you want her to put in an order for a chocolate soufflé, you will say yes. Because you are a sport, and because that is the way it's done.
690	1	The curried crab — one of the 10 specialties — had funky, bitter overtones that also were a bit too much.
794	1	lamb's-tongue salad, curried mussels, marinated cucumbers, everything — which makes sense for cheese-crusted roasted brussels sprouts with hazelnuts, which you might expect to be cooked in cast iron, but doesn't for something like bland slivers of raw hamachi draped over spoonsful of pureed avocado
719	1	Fresh Fries (@FreshFriesLA on Twitter), where they serve Qs by the sputtering coneful, and where you can close your eyes and ignore the presence of Stinky Pinky, Hummus Fries and wasabi mayonnaise.
561	1	Meat is superb; the contrast between the leaner, more mineral Argentinian and the lusciously marbled, almost suave Finnish is quite something.
375	1	At £12, the main-course-priced  salad of roast cauliflower, chickpea, cucumber, tomato and chermoula (a North African mix of spices,  lemon and herbs) is praised by my companion for its nuttiness.
177	1	The pizza at Barbuto is generally upstaged by the fresh pasta, particularly if your definition of pasta takes in the splendid potato gnocchi — even though they are not boiled, but pan-fried in butter and olive oil and then scattered like throw pillows across a plate with sautéed romanesco or some other seasonal vegetable.
680	1	A plate of stone bass with squid, braised fennel, saffron and fennel purée and a red pepper butter sauce reads like a love letter to the French Mediterranean coast; it tastes like it was cooked by someone who went there on their holidays, but didn’t enjoy it at all.
424	1	the fritters so insanely light — ricotta perhaps? — that they vanish on the tongue to leave nothing behind but the pungency of the cheese. I nearly said cheesy length — length like hardcore, fine old wine — but fortunately stopped myself just in time.
413	1	Equally fine are freshly baked gougères made with nutty Comté and pâté en croute maison with a crumbly hot water crust.
816	0	Day of the Dead tamale big enough to feed the USC football team.
761	0	the best churro is the freshest churro, and Salinas churros are always crisp, hot and delicious.
248	1	I remember that the avocado slices were the silkiest to ever touch my tongue, and I marveled at the salad’s layered citrus flavors.
491	0	A special of pressed potato with wild mushroom, jamon iberico, egg yolk and jamon dashi.
35	1	Then comes a beautiful sunset-colored strip of Arctic char under blistered skin that is blackened with pinpoint precision.
873	0	the grilled chicken and the bright-green “jade” noodles tossed with bits of Chinese barbecue.
603	1	The flatbread has lots and lots of layers — like a croissant. It’s basically a super-lacy paratha, also glazed with ghee and a thoroughly fine thing, especially when used to soak up the sauce from “Chettinad-style” veal shin curry, aromatic with fennel and lemony black pepper (very resonant, maybe Tellicherry?), rich from the meat’s bones.
402	0	The side dish of “warm summer greens” turns out disappointingly to be a small bowl of sugar snap peas.
517	1	But not just any old butter beans — those aristocratic Navarrico judion that cost a small fortune (worth it, for their luxurious creaminess). There’s a swooping rib of crackling and a caramelised pear-half too, rather than the usual apple.
866	1	An Attari sandwich is close to a perfect thing: a length of toasted French bread, a layer of main ingredient and a dressing that includes fresh tomatoes, a handful of shredded lettuce and a smattering of spiced, supertart Iranian pickles.
511	1	it’s satisfaction in a terracotta cazuela, the seafood mochi-tender, the broth abundantly seasoned and herbed, soaking wholeheartedly into the spuds and pulses.
903	1	crisp-skinned fried trout
601	1	The light, fluffy from yoghurt and fleetingly sweet buns, almost hollow; the pristine crabmeat rich and sticky with ginger and coconut, it’s an intoxicating few mouthfuls.
290	1	Mix and match it with a spicy salad of julienned radishes; potent specks of chile-stained dried squid stir-fried with peanuts; satisfyingly mulchy wild greens called chwinamul, fragrant with sesame oil; the wonderful white kimchi, its cabbage leaves slowly melting into milkiness; and a side of plain white rice for a complete, kaleidoscopic meal.
310	1	Gem lettuces with sprouts and radishes in buttermilk dressing, or pickled beets fanned between avocado slices in sumac vinaigrette, provide contrast and welcome acidity. A green tomato salad, full of tough squares of the unripe fruit, veers too far into sourness.
194	1	Cabbage is fried with pork and fresh chiles, but the appeal of the dish is the way the invisible presence of Sichuan peppercorns sets your mouth and lips tingling.
686	1	There are crabs fried with chile and garlic, translucent lozenges of bean starch with crab meat, broad beans sauced with stewed scallions, and local cod gently steamed with ginger and garlic.
849	1	water-boiled fish, which combines soothing texture with acetylene-torch heat; and great, multiflavored beef casseroles so spicy they attack the nervous system like a phaser set to “stun.”
519	1	Sweetest scallops complemented by the earthier sweetness of Jerusalem artichokes; salted caramel custard tart with a filling that trembles under the weight of its own richness.
952	1	You may have chashu, fat pork simmered until it nearly falls apart of its own accord, or a special egg simmered at low temperature, which droops from your chopsticks like a Dali painting of an egg and whose yolk is liquid and impossibly orange.
512	1	Scallop and pea risotto comes with the almost Persian pairing of saffron and dill: the scallops good, plump and bronzed, but rice a little bloated.
728	1	But it is mostly a gooey thing with the Catalan pepper-almond sauce salbitxada; bits of pork belly; crunchy, porous cubes of what Centeno calls beef carnitas
969	1	duck meat simmered in fat until it nearly collapses, perfumed flesh arranged atop crisply fried sopes, a shotgun marriage of traditional and European cooking techniques of the sort that has been going on in Mexico since the conquest.
917	1	samgyetang, a soothing chicken-in-the-pot stuffed with ginseng and sticky rice, and those pig's feet of course, boiled and pressed into a terrine.
340	1	Truffle gravy is heated with a held-back tablespoon of butter; bitter leaf salad including the beautiful leaves of Castelfranco gets dressed with calamansi vinaigrette and zhuzhed with sunflower crumble.
760	1	So your idea of churros is brilliant — long, crunchy sticks of fried dough dusted with cinnamon sugar, a pastry that layers the mandatory Hanukkah use-of-oil motif with contemporary Los Angeles pluralism. Hats off!
123	0	The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren’t the temperature of a kiddie pool.
303	1	Next in the stack: scrambled eggs, folded into a plump envelope; white American cheese melts lazily down the sides. A spoonful of strawberry jam completes the assembly. Somewhere in the tumble of flavors, the jam happens upon the meat and the sweetness ends up making a strange kind of sense.
880	1	bacon-wrapped bacon, a dish I suspect began as a joke, and Fig, the lobby-level bistro in the Fairmont Miramar hotel, couldn't seem less like a penitential palace of righteousness
741	1	what you are going to dream about tonight are the bacon-cheddar-buttermilk biscuits, palm-size creatures that have the gravitational pull of the sun.
644	1	A glass of honeyed Pieropan Soave Classico in hand, a plate of properly grown-up food on the picnic bench tables: chicken liver parfait on a rubble of gingerbready crumbs, Barbie-pink rhubarb adding astringency; or the stoutest spears of Sevenscore Farm asparagus with a ball of immaculate burrata, nuttiness and contrast from crunchy sunflower seed almost-butter.
190	0	A close second is the baby cabbage, sliced into threads and braised with chestnuts in saffron sauce.
102	0	Stars I am giving it: zero.
657	1	Even crisp fennel salad had maple roasted pecans tucked away beneath.
569	1	what’s described, baldly, as “Eel, potato, crème fraîche, roe” is a sensation: a confit potato cake, crisp and golden, hiding the alluring funk of smoked eel in its many layers. There are jewels of glittering orange ikura; a little salad that includes edible flowers. It’s a dish that juggles delicacy with butchness, brilliantly.
857	1	the brick-red muhammara, with its fragrance of pomegranate and red peppers.
426	1	There are always Cantabrian anchovies, pungent little sods, in rosemary and lemon, for draping over thickly buttered sourdough.
961	1	And the best dish here may actually be the spicy fries, topped with the mince of cilantro, fresh chiles and garlic you usually find on Vietnamese-Chinese fried crab or squid.
296	1	Shiku’s dosiraks are straightforward and soothing: slices of kimchi-braised pork belly; thin, chewy strips of galbi; chicken thighs marinated in doenjang (fermented bean paste that imparts a complex, miso-like sweetness); or battered puffs of shiitake mushrooms splayed over rice, with three small servings of banchan nestled into one end of the to-go container.
470	1	The pal has, obviously, avocado toast. As avocado toast goes it’s fine and comes with poached egg, a dandruff of micro-herbs and edible blossom. Both dishes are art-directed for the camera, image more important than content, style literally over substance
990	1	burning-hot huitlacoche quesadillas — fried turnovers stuffed with musky, jet-black corn fungus — made on weekends by the stone-faced woman who mans a fry cart outside the entrance.
224	1	My crew plucked out a few rosy slices, cooked to the medium-rare we requested; I relished the meat’s visceral tang and funk. When we returned to the skillet for more, the steak was a toppled stack of faded gray dominoes — cooked to literal hell in the skillet’s residual heat.
693	1	The pan-fried pork buns, sheng jian bao, are nicely browned on the bottom, sprinkled with seeds on the top, and both crunch and gush hot juice under your teeth
236	1	Butcher’s steak (a.k.a. hanger steak) grilled over vine cuttings with a silky celeriac dauphinoise on the side
353	0	Fay Maschler surrenders to the senses at Sessions Arts Club – the culinary hotspot on everyone’s lips. Where judges once droned, now diners can savour the sensual in art, food and wine. Tatler’s resident restaurant critic delivers her verdict
238	1	The team swaps out romaine for endive, eschews croutons for the uniform crunch of scattered breadcrumbs and, though Parmesan remains integral to the punchy dressing, showers the salad with nutty Mimolette before it arrives at the table.
566	1	Pork belly comes scented with fennel seeds, tiny black olives and slivers of orange peel, the meat glistening with its melted fat, like a Brit twist on Italy’s beloved porchetta. Roasted — nearly confit — fennel on the side and it’s the richest harmony.
991	1	where a special of pan frattau, a kind of Sardinian chilaquiles made with flatbread instead of stale tortillas, is fried with a butcher's bouquet of lamb's innards; and the bruschetta may be smeared not with olive paste but with ciccoli, a paste of lard puréed with pigskin.
448	1	But the juice is an alive-tasting emerald shot, vivid, verdant.
995	1	I'm afraid the dough is going to win every time. Compani's pizzas are unlike anything in Los Angeles, or in Naples, come to think of it: soft and elastic, made from long-risen dough, paler than you think they should be, not quite crisp but freckled with bits of char.
227	1	Casarecce (a grooved, tubular pasta) was cooked to gumminess but otherwise wore a coordinated trio of dill-cashew pesto, fried Brussels sprouts and bacon.
540	1	“Crab à la Rochelle”, a dense pink dollop of crabmeat, mushrooms and béchamel bound up in pastry.
981	1	The surface of the maize cake was smeared with a kind of masala paste, both tart and hot, and dotted with yogurt and bits of chewy, pungent mango pickle.
743	1	appealing saltiness that welcomes but does not require the sweetness of soft maple butter; and the smoky, animal pungency of bacon, lots of bacon, achieved without the slightest sensation of smokiness.
432	1	Gorgeous, though, the prawns sweet and tender, not mealy or rubbery as large ones can often be, the sauce addictive after the first brutal onslaught.
221	1	Make a sundae out of the flurry of available toppings (salted doenjang caramel, puffed rice, chocolate rice cake, mochi, bingsu toppers), but be sure to excavate a few pure spoonsful: The gentle sweetness of the ice cream is a treat unto itself.
702	1	But that pljeskavica, more or less like an enormous Balkan-spiced hamburger spun out into two dimensions instead of three? Hell, you can just point. And get a Turkish coffee for the road.
390	1	plateau de fruits de mer astounded, Provencal prints delighted, the leaping freshness of simply prepared sea bream seduced.
902	0	stands out as an Ethiopian bistro, which is to say a homey, soft-lit dining room that looks at least as French as it does African.
9	1	The dish is like a minivan with a Ferrari engine.
554	1	We have plates of thick wheat noodles — slightly flabby but generously laced with prawns, scallops and squid and pungent from belacan (fermented shrimp paste).
665	1	The initial flavor was bland, quickly followed by a fetid, ammonia-like tang. It was an aroma that recalled room-temperature hamburger meat from a grocer that lost power. I felt my eyes water up as I chewed. I tried to swallow. I felt my entire GI tract prepare to purge
26	1	After two pleasant if unremarkable salads we were on to the “spaghetti steak,” strips of very tender seared steak gleaming with melted fat
22	0	Luger is not the city’s oldest, but it’s the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City.
31	1	Inside, from the bottom up, is a foundation of truffled rice, crisp shards of pickled mountain yam and kimchi, and finally a spoonful of chopped raw short rib, slippery with sesame oil, just beneath the roe.
325	1	He directed us to a gentle, homey combination of soft tofu, shrimp and squid, shot through with crisp slices of celtuce and scallion greens. Each bite was a shifting collage of textures.
923	1	there's that A-5 Kobe steak: richness upon richness, smoke and char and animal dancing across your consciousness like sunlight rippling on a pond.
104	1	Beef carpaccio, the chilly maroon flesh stretched out below a scattershot application of radish and celery slices that had started to curl, tasted of refrigeration and surrender.
605	1	These include a dark emerald slump of spinach in which bob chunks of bouncy paneer; “Gujarati kadhi” — cooling, yoghurt-laced, gram-floury sauce hiding delicious crunch in its depths; pale broad beans with coconut and tempered curry leaves.
234	1	The boudin sits on a square of brioche, its amorphous form covered by a delicately fried egg dripping yolk. Custardy but dense with mystery, charged with spice and sweetness and a telltale hint of iron, the dish is a thundercloud of texture and flavor.
996	1	the pizza with prosciutto and arugula feels fresher and lighter than pizza has any right to be.
738	1	The spicy maize cake supports three or four cubes of pork belly, cooked sous vide with duck fat to a melting softness and crisped a moment before serving.
272	1	Floating atop the stew, melting but also astonishingly intact, is hilba, a scallion-flecked condiment made by soaking ground fenugreek in water and then beating it to the fluffy consistency of Cool Whip.
456	1	It’s fascinating to watch: choosing the most perfect petals of Brussels sprouts for dotting over bubbly mussel sauce with steamed plaice; dunking shiitake into a boiling bath of beef dripping.
712	1	But the pizza? Nicely crisp, medium thin, and brawnier than you might expect, probably because the dough is made with whole-wheat flour
2	1	That’s za’atar dusted over the labneh arranged around two meaty slices of duck breast; another spice blend, baharat, seasons the red piece of grilled Duroc pork beside puréed and pickled squashes.
785	1	a small specialty in ochazuke served with raw tai, bream, imported from Japan's Inland Sea, and sea urchin shooters that may provide the most intense three seconds of pleasure you will ever find in a champagne flute.
780	1	the juices stirred with Worcestershire sauce and melted butter — that would be poured over the steak as it rested on thin, crisp slices of toast. I worried that nobody would eat the bacon-wrapped kidneys
622	1	Smokily tender pork “coppa”, a hard-to-access cut that’s more usually cured; here it’s grilled (of course) and dressed with tamarind jeaw, another tongue-startling condiment. This has a side dish of shaved kohlrabi with peanuts and candied tomatoes, like a designer som tam — brilliant and perfect with the pork.
443	1	Our beetroot tarte tatin is a beauty, the shocking pink rounds of root almost as sticky and sweet as the more usual apple, a flourish of sharply dressed frisée on top for contrast.
399	1	Our Sweet Plate is carrot “halwa” with cardamom ice cream and toasted pistachios, where earth, spice and sugar have a hug, even though tragically hugging is no longer allowed.
855	0	the steak here — the braised pork belly, the glorious pot roast and the duck-fried rice are just too compelling.
914	1	cha gio — fried Vietnamese spring rolls — in the observable universe, as its many Caltech regulars may tell you, and its fans will do anything for a crack at the burnished, bubbly, deep-fried cylinders.
29	0	It was rare in patches and medium-rare in others, but apart from that it was terrific.
499	1	Pomme puree is more sauce than side, a tiny slick of buttery goop, sloppy and over-rich — like the bloke behind us bellowing his travails to the cheap seats.
96	1	Price of yellowtail collar left on the grill until it lost the silky, puddinglike richness that is the whole point of this cut: $28.
214	1	Some dishes on display — radish pickles, or mushrooms paired with gently chewy bracken ferns dressed in nutty perilla oil, or tangles of acorn-flour noodles — bring to mind an uplifting array of banchan.
807	1	deep-fried pork chops with honey, a concoction sweeter than a bag of fun-size Milky Ways
388	1	Desserts are a definite strong suit and while we are obviously tempted by pistachio macaron with raspberry compôte, the sight of devilishly dark shiny hot chocolate sauce being poured on to profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream guides us to share that — to our utter satisfaction.
667	1	Did it have ‘a simple flavor with a touch of sweetness’? It was hard to say after half of it had been simmered in soy sauce to a bony mush, the other half grilled in salt until chewy and served with its head still on, propped up with a wooden stake like a Big Mouth Billy Bass about to sing
483	0	A special of “cabillaud avec haricots” brings snowy cod with the silkiest puree of celeriac and comically retro mangetout.
460	1	My prejudice extends also to initially dismissing the pasta dish — fettuccine with buffalo butter and parmesan — as “basic”. This is turning into a wallow in mea culpas: it’s anything but.
779	1	At a beefsteak, enormous affairs thrown in inelegant basements, revelers feasted on lamb chops, kidneys wrapped in bacon, and profoundly aged New York steaks, grilled rare, sliced and served on monstrous platters.
507	1	“hare bun”, a mini, glossy Japanese milk loaf that splits to reveal a kind of hare ragu, resonant with offal.
120	0	Salty croutons undid crisp leaves of escarole dressed with anchovies and lemon.
261	0	The bacon-wrapped dates are listed there, as is the gratifying, always-changing “farmer’s plate” of roasted vegetables and spreads with grilled toast.
64	1	The New York version has been rubbery, as dark as beef bouillon, and strangely bland.
782	1	I'm not sure halal-cart chicken or lamb exist here in that exact form — they would have to be flavored with diesel fumes and taxi exhaust and eau de subway grate to make an exact match.
821	1	an edgy, grown-up restaurant serving an Asian-ized, farm-centered, technique-oriented small-plates menu,
867	1	The most notorious Attari sandwich has been stuffed with soft, fragrant beef tongue, and it is sometimes possible to get one with brains, but one of the sandwiches here, the sosess, is filled with something closely resembling (if not verifiably) hot dogs, a hot dog sandwich with the taste of Tehran.
582	1	a bruiser of a Tamworth pork chop, juicy and with just a touch of blush at the bone, beautifully paired with the caramel squelch of slow-roasted garlic cloves and the sting of preserved lemon.
137	0	Javelina’s traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalapeños and roasted poblanos.
