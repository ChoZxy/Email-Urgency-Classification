The monkey replies, "Smokin' a joint, come up and have some."  So the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they smoke a few joints.  After a while the lizard says his mouth is 'dry' and he's going to get a drink from the river.  The lizard is so stoned that he leans over too far and falls into the river.  A crocodile sees this and swims over to the lizard and helps him to the side, then asks the lizard, "What's the matter with you?"

The crocodile says he has to check this out and wanders into the jungle. He finds the tree where the monkey is sitting finishing up a joint.  The crocodile yells up to the monkey and says "Hey!"  The monkey looks down and says, "Fuck man! How much water did you drink?!?"

"Let me prove it to you." He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets toward the street below. As he nears the 10th floor, the high winds whip him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar.  He meets the second man, who looks quite astonished. "You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke." "No, I'll prove it again," says the first man as he jumps again. Just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it. "Well, why not." the second guy says, "It works. I'll try it."

Back upstairs the bartender turns to the other drinker and says, "You know Superman, you're a real jerk when you're drunk".

328	PC	What is Politics? A little boy goes to his dad and asks, " What is politics?"    Dad says, " Well son, let me try to explain it this way:  I’m the breadwinner of the family, so let’s call me capitalism.   Your  Mom, she’s the administrator of the money, so we’ll call her the  Government.   We’re here to take care of your needs, so we’ll call you the people.   The nanny, we’ll consider her the  Working  Class.   And your baby brother, we’ll call him the  Future.   Now, think about that and see if that makes sense,"    So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said.  Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him.  He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.  So the little boy goes to his parents’ room and finds his mother sound asleep.  Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny’s room.  Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny.  He gives up and goes back to bed.    The next morning, the little boy says to his father, " Dad,  I think  I  Understand the concept of politics now."  The father says, " Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."  The little boy replies, " Well, while  Capitalism is screwing the  Working  Class, the  Government is sound asleep, the  People are being ignored and the  Future is in deep shit."

While sipping his wine, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, the smell was wonderful.  He asked the waiter, 'What is that you just served? They look like Spanish oysters!'  The waiter replied, 'Senor, you have excellent taste! Those are not oysters... they are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A rare delicacy!'  The cowboy said, 'What the heck, bring me an order.'  The waiter replied, 'I am so sorry senor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. Tomorrow, if you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy.'  The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed his order, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.   After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, 'These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.'  The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, 'Si, Senor. Sometimes the bull wins and the man loses !' 😂

111	AP	Three legged chicken.....   It was Spring Break and several friends arranged to spend the week in a cabin in a remote, forested region about 3 hours from school.     There was nothing noteworthy about the first two hours, but it was as if we’d entered a strange new world once we’d left the interstate highways to proceed on farm roads with odd names and/or numbers. No other cars.   These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.      Then, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.  What was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.     I was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.  I accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I’d never match it’s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.    I screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, ‘you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!’  I was curious, as well, so that’s precisely what I did.  I cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!  “Oh, yeah”, responded the old lady.   “That was one of our three legged chickens.”  My buddy reacted, “three legged chickens?”  She continued, “well, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr’s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that’s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!’    Jr’s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!  “Sounds like a great idea!”, I said.  I continued, “So…..how do they taste?”  Jr’s smile evaporated as Maw responded, “don’t know.   Can’t catch ‘em.”

The British guy says, " Obviously they were both British, observe how Adam offered Eve some of his apple after he received it from her, true British manners".  French guy says: "Non, non, monsieur they were both French. First of all they were both NAKED, and Eve was so feminine and seductive and drove Adam nuts".  Russian guy says: "Both of you are wrong.

192	PI	Have you heard the one about the Australian Aboriginal, the copper and the mud crab?   There's an aboriginal man who's been hunting for crabs in the mangroves and he hadn't been having much luck. All of a sudden he spots the biggest juiciest mud crab he's ever laid his eyes on. He throws it in his bucket with a bit of water then throws the bucket In the trunk of his car to go home and cook up his grub! oh boy he was licking his lips thinking of that crab with a bit of melted butter and lemon.  He's driving. he hears a siren and sees the lights of a police officer insisting he pull over.   "Here we bloody go" he's thinking.   So the copper raps on his window and says "excuse me sir, are you aware of your car dripping water from the boot?".   "ahhh naaa mate... not sure what you're talking about officer".  "Sir, please open the trunk".  "yeh no worries".  And so this aboriginal man opens the trunk and the officer gasps when he sees the size of the mudcrab.  "Sir are you aware it's illegal to be fishing for mud crab at this time of the year?" says the constable.   The aboriginal fella looked genuinely confused.   "naaaa brother you got it all wrong. this is my pet crab, Larry. Owned him for years. I was just taking him for a splash down at the mangrove".   "yeah bullshit mate! you must think I'm an idiot"  "come back to the mangrove. it's not far away and I will prove to you this is my pet" says the aboriginal while stifling a smile.  The officer entertains the idea because what harm can it do. they both make their way a short distance to the mangrove edge. the man pulls his pet from the bucket and lowers the crab back into the murky water where it slowly scurried away and disappeared into the mud. And so the aboriginal man slowly stands while dusting off his hands and turns to the officer who's patiently waiting. the officer asks..  "well mate you said the mud crab would come back to you when you called his name???"  The aboriginal man looks the officer in the eyes and with only the slightest twitch in his upper lip says..              "WHAT MUD CRAB!!!"

24	PI	A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears ripped off...   Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing rugby for good.   His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.  One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business.   He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business.   He decided to employ someone to run the shop.  The next day he set up three interviews.   The first guy was great.   He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic.   At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”  And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.”   The rugby player got angry and threw him out.  The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy.   He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”  She replied: “Well, you have no ears.”   He got upset again and showed her the door.  The third and last interview was with the best of the three.   He was a very young man fresh out of college.   He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.  The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”  To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”  The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”  The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”
