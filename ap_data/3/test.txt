Welcome! I'm having a crazy day right now, can you please hand the phone to my wife?'  'I would but she just locked her room and went in with another man!'  'What!! That's a disaster!

492	PI	Mr. Pott was an average man, with an extraordinary skin conditionOne day  Mr.  Pott (legend says his first name was  Arthur) went to the doctor to get his skin checked out.  He said " Doctor,  I have a very odd skin condition.  Multiple times a day, my skin will puff up and get all red almost instantly, with no warning."   The doctor thought this was very odd, and wanted to have  Mr.  Pott wait with him in one of his rooms for a while to see if he could catch the odd phenomenon.    They waited...   And waited...   T H E R E!  No, that was just a trick of the light...   Hours went by...   Finally it was time for the doctor's office to close.  Mr.  Pott left the office, and as soon as he got into his car, his skin got all red and puffy.    He called the doctor the next day, and said that it happened again as soon as he got into his car, and asked if he could come back into the office.  The doctor said sure, since he wasn't busy that day.   Again  Mr.  Pott and the doctor waited to witness the described symptoms, but again, nothing happened all day.    That night, as  Mr.  Pott was getting into his car, he broke out in a rash almost instantly.    Mr.  Pott again called the doctor and asked to come in.    Every day  Mr.  Pott would go see the doctor.  This went on for days, weeks, and finally months, to no avail.    In fact, the doctor never did see the odd skin condition, because a watched  Pott never boils.    Edit:  A name

275	AP	Grasshopper   Every day, Jim gets two six packs on the way home from work. When he gets home, he sits in his living room until they're gone. One day, just as he's getting to the end of the last beer, he hears a knock at the door. He goes to answer it, and sees a six foot tall grasshopper. Before he can say a word, the grasshopper punches him in the face as hard as he's ever been hit! Floored, he can't respond before the grasshopper leaves. He decides he'd better be in better shape, so the next day he only gets one six pack. Just as he's finishing the last beer, he hears another knock at the door. He gets up to answer it, a bit more wary this time. Not that it does him any good. The six foot tall grasshopper is there again, and this time hits him twice, each one as hard as he's ever been hit! Again, the grasshopper leaves before he can do anything. On the third day, he decides he'd better just skip his beer. He's sitting in his living room, stone cold sober, when he hears a knock at the door. He checks his peephole. It's the grasshopper. But he figures this time he hasn't been drinking and he can take him, so he opens the door. Before he can do anything, the grasshopper knocks him down and kicks him until he can't move. Again, the grasshopper leaves when it's done. Obviously he's in bad shape after that, so he goes in to see his doctor. He describes what's been going on. The doctor nods knowingly, "Yeah, there's been a pretty nasty bug going around."

310	PI	The Ant and the Grasshopper    CLASSIC VERSION:   The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.   Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.   MODERN VERSION:   The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.   Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.   CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?   Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with "green bias," and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism.   Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings "It's Not Easy Being Green." Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the "Temperatures of the 80's."  Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government.   Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled.   The ant loses the case.   The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it.   The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of "fairness" has dawned in America.

She was tossing and waving her arm around...just going crazy! I ran outside and the cops had put her on the ground. They were putting the fire out with a jacket. I go back in to get my chips(forgot to grab em) and turn to see them handcuffing her. I'm like what in the world is really going on?! So me being the concerned citizen that I am (aka nosey) asked the cops what they were arresting her for; already figuring that catching her arm on fire was punishment enough . Nope!  One cop looked dead at me and said "FOR WAVING A FIRE ARM"

483	AP	A man thought his wife was losing her hearingA man thought his wife was losing her hearing.  He was going to the doctor for a check up one day, so he decided to ask the doctor for advice while he was there.  He said to the doctor, " Doc,  I think my wife is hard of hearing.  Sometimes when  I ask her questions she can't hear me.  What should  I do?"  The doctor replied, " Here's what you need to do.  Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner.  If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again.  If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time.  If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time.  If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing."   So the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night.  First, he went into the bedroom and called out to his wife, " Honey, what's for dinner?"  No response.  So he moved into the living room.  He called out again, " Honey, what's for dinner?"  No response.  So he moved again, this time into the dining room. " Honey what's for dinner?"  Still no response.  So finally, he moved into the kitchen where his wife was making dinner and asked once more, " Honey, what's for dinner?"  His wife turned to look at him with an angry look on her face and said, " Chicken.  I told you three times, dumbass."

261	AP	The french note   A guy was going on a vacation to France. He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. "Hi, I came for the french lesson today" our guy said. "Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week." "So there is no one that know any french here?" "No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine" "Uhm ok. What does it say?" "I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone." Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.  The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. "Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it.  "That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!" our guy thought, and so he did.  Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. "Let me see" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry
