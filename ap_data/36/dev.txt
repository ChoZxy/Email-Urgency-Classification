882	objective	82: "These are legitimate concerns for most the most part, but are not the most likely case.\\n\\n1) Russia is currently 1.8% of Chinese trade. So far China is making no moves to get closer to Russia because they aren\'t going to expand that 1.8% if it risks the massive amounts of their economy tied up with Western trade. China may well love to be the near sole buyer of Russian natural resources at a steep discount, but they have to play this carefully.\\n\\n2) A slightly more powerful China with a neutered Russia is a trade some people will make. China is much more involved in economic competition than military, and they are a true threat to the US + EU dominance of the economic sphere, but that\'s a competition many are more willing to have. Especially because the economic ties between China and the West is beneficial for both. If China goes too far into creating a Asian hegemony it likely loses its place as a trusted trade partner and all they did was change trade with the west with trade with poorer parts of Asia.\\n\\n3) Already started (China and Russia both have their own systems), and may be accelerated. But as long as you want to trade with the other economic powers you need to connect to them. China isn\'t going to choose economic growth with Russia over economic growth with the actual world powers.\\n\\n4) Over the long term Russia can try to build up its ability to directly supply oil to Asia, but if global oil demand starts to wane oil will plummet and Russian oil is ridiculously expensive to to drill and refine, meaning it gets squeezed hard. Short term their economy isn\'t going to get nuked, but it\'s going to go into a serious recession (north of 10% decrease in GDP in the next year seems to be a common assessment).\\n\\nSo yes, there are some very intelligent people that are predicting some version of what you are saying above.

739	objective	39: "# The places that chose to pursue elimination suffered less overall. Unfortunately, few had the determination to do so\\n\\n&gt;It was the alt-history, the policy that didn\\u2019t get enacted. No-Covid, zero-Covid or elimination aimed to stamp out community transmission of Covid-19 in a given area, rather than just reduce it to \\u201cmanageable\\u201d levels. Most of the world eschewed it, and it got bad press from the start. Only autocratic regimes could pull it off, one mantra went. Countries like China and ah, New Zealand and, oops, that notorious police state Davis in California.\\r \\n\\r \\nThere was something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about this. Many people thought No-Covid was impossible, but the handful of places that embraced it proved them wrong. Now that some of those places are themselves shifting to a reduction or mitigation strategy, countries that opted for mitigation from the beginning are enjoying a \\u201cwe told you so\\u201d moment. But No-Covid\\u2019s early champions had to shift in part because other countries let the virus rip. Even if their strategy didn\\u2019t remain the optimal one, it bought them time to prepare others. It\\u2019s important that we remember that when the next pandemic sidles along.\\n\\nThe \\"reduction and mitigation strategy\\" is a zero cost and zero effort for public health.\\n\\nIsolation field hospitals to keep the hospital staff and other patients from getting infected, costs money. Quarantine hotels for incoming international travellers costs money.\\n\\nIf we had implemented quarantine hotels, it would have easily cost a million dollars per hotel per month! Multiply that by the number of international airports we\'re talking a billion dollars per year! \\n\\nNot implementing quarantine hotels instead cost trillions of dollars . . . so far.\\n\\nChina didn\'t implement \\"draconian\\" pandemic measures. All China did different for the pandemic was add international quarantine and field hospitals. They were doing \\"draconian\\" shit before the pandemic. CNN, FOX and the NY Times keep referring to the current lockdowns in various Chinese cities as \'draconian\'. That the first time those cities are experiencing any \'pandemic\' public health protocols since the start of the pandemic. The rest of the world had intermittently imposed quarantine PLUS mandatory mask, mandatory vaccine and other public health restrictions on their entire populations but that\'s not draconian?\\n\\nThe difference between China and the rest of the world is that we have utterly fucked our economy by trying to do as little as possible to impact an airline industry that we should have nationalized from the outset.

I already have some ideas that I shall describe.\\n\\nFirstly, I decided that there is not going to be WW2. France and half of Iberia go red in the 1920s but are crushed by the GRI-EU. Iberia is absorbed into Italy in the aftermath of the intervention while a compliant pro-GRI regime in installed in France. French nationalism and communism are kept under a tight lid. Expect France to be slowly assimilated into the European project. In Britain, there is political turbulence but stability is maintained. The British elites decided that having bad blood with the USA was the worst choice in British history and fix it by joining the American Commonwealth. Expect the British to be American states.\\n\\nIslamism and communism in the third world shall be major sores for the great powers of this world. The the sake of having a bigger USA, I had Mexico fall under a communist regime similar to Castro\'s Cuba after the Second Mexican War. After trade conflict, violence towards Americans, and skirmishes, the Third Mexican War takes place. The Americans easily win, annexing Veracruz and Yucatan, Guatemala taking Chiapas, the remainder of Mexico an American protectorate. The USA shall also take in Haiti, Colombia, and Venezuela as clients and eventually absorb them.\\n\\nThe GRI-EU will have to deal with Islamist and colonial uprisings after WW1. These uprisings will take place in the 1930s-1940s with the acceleration of European settlement after the finding of oil. After the rebellions are crushed, expect mass Arab deportations and assimilation. Italianization off all of North Africa, Russification of Muslim regions in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and mass European settlement in the empires.\\n\\nNow onto the topic of European federalization. I know for sure that the Italians and Germans will form the EU and bond closer though i\'m not sure for Russia. For sure Ireland, Scandinavia (with Denmark after WW1), Hungary, and Croatia join. It might take longer for Russia to join but they shall do it. Now, i\'m not sure what this EU will encompass. Will it include clients in the Middle East? I\'m also not sure about Africa, probably as associated states to the GRI-EU of some sort. Southeast Asia is another good question in the future of this TL, the GRI will not remain there forever.\\n\\nI changed the situation in China after WW1. Occupation zones are divided up again with new spheres of influence under Japan, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The CCP launch a Boxer-style rebellion in Central China but are crushed yet again by the GRI-EU, Japan, and anti-communist Chinese. In the 1950s, the pro-West Chinese negotiate with the GRI and Japan, promising free trade and to accept foreign companies to remain in China. In exchange, GRI and Japan will cease their spheres of influence and withdraw troops. GRI agreed, mostly to focus on their massive empires. China is modernized with American, GRI, and Japanese finance.\\n\\nDo you have anymore ideas of how this TL will look by the year 2000?", ',

You would have been doing me a service by updating my information on it if you knew something I did not.\\n\\nI\'m not OP. For some numbers, it sounds like if we only consider the carbon footprint offset for battery production, you need to drive:^[1]\\n\\n* on the cleanest energy source (Norway, mostly Hydro) about 8,500 miles\\n\\n* On the most carbon intensive source (China, Poland, mostly coal) about 75,000 miles\\n\\n* On average, it\'s about 20k miles\\n\\nTypically, EV batteries don\'t just \\"stop working\\" one day, their capacity decreases a bit with each use, just like we see with out phones. Maybe one day the range won\'t be enough for your useage, but that doesn\'t mean the car needs to be destroyed. For some numbers from Tesla^[2] (because they have the most vehicle-miles, so they have a lot of data available) they say to estimate about 90% of their original capacity after 200k miles. Short of some catastrophic failure, the average EV in the average country will produce a lot less emissions than an equivalent ICE vehicle, and even in the worst it\'s much better.\\n\\nI think some people responded pretty negatively to your comment because it\'s a long discredited narrative about hybrids that keeps getting repeated because it sounds good. In 2007^[3] there was a report \\"commissioned by an auto industry trade group insisted that when you factor in the waste generated during production, the notoriously gas-guzzling Hummer is actually greener than the Prius\\"^[4] However,\\n\\n&gt; But do the environmental impacts of hybrid vehicle production outweigh the long-term benefits of driving a cleaner running automobile? That answer is a resounding \\"no.\\" If you drive both a conventional and hybrid car for 160,000 miles (257,495 kilometers), the conventional vehicle requires far more energy to operate and emits far more greenhouse gases over its lifetime, significantly canceling out any imbalance during the production stage [source: Burnham et al].^[5]\\n\\n[1] https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/when-do-electric-vehicles-become-cleaner-than-gasoline-cars-2021-06-29/\\n\\n[2] https://insideevs.com/news/525820/tesla-battery-capacity-retention-90/\\n\\n[3] https://www.thetorquereport.com/news/toyotas-prius-is-less-efficient-and-environmentally-friendly-than-a-hummer/\\n\\n[4] https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm\\n\\n[5] https://www.osti.gov/biblio/898530", ',

While at first glance it may seem strange and counter intuitive, I do not believe the chain of cause and effect is as unbroken as we like to think. \\n\\nIn order to explain why, I have to take a brief detour into quantum mechanics and talk about the concept of virtual particles. Now, quantum mechanics something beyond most people\'s understanding, and I am writing this post to debate religion not mathematics. So here is the layman\'s version.\\n\\nBasically, in a vacuum subatomic particles of matter and antimatter are being contently being created which then interact and destroy each other. These virtual particles pay a role in all sorts of quantum theories. The most famous one being that they are part of the cause of hawking radiation. \\n\\nIts complicated, but the point is this. Here we have something that comes from nothing, that is measurable, and can be shown to exist though the scientific method.\\n\\nHence, the idea that things that exist need to have a cause might not be as true as it appears at first glance. If something can come from nothing can come from nothing, this is a huge hit against the Cosmological argument.\\n\\n&gt;In his book; The Grand design - Steven hawking, he declares Philosophy \\u201cDead\\u201d and then proceeds to write a 256 page book about Philosophy. The main argument in the book is that the laws of gravity caused the Big Bang out of nothing. My Objections start with the fact that he says \\u201cThe laws of Gravity caused the Big Bang\\u201d \\n\\nI\'ve heard about Hawking\'s idea of a self creating universe before, though I\'ve had issues with it myself. Personally while I think Hawking was a genius, I don\'t think he was correct on this one. So I am going to move on, as we both agree that Hawking was wrong on the big bang\'s cause. \\n\\n&gt;I see many atheists claim that many atrocities have been committed in the name of religion, and I do not disagree. But when atheists say this, the way the statement is formulated makes it seem as if all religion says to commit atrocities. Whilst some religions do (I won\\u2019t name and shame) The religion I defend (christianity) Does not say to \\u201ckill infidels\\u201d but to \\u201clove thy neighbor, and pray for those who persecute you\\u201d This is said throughout the new testament. The old testament is where things get tricky. There are stories from the old testament that talk about Genocide and many other questionable things. The general consensus among secular scholars today is that a lot of the stories in the old testament were written as stories and not accounts of things that actually happened, EG: Genesis, Exodus\\u2026 But jesus later condemn\\u2019s such acts as Genocide, rape\\u2026 \\n\\nI had to rewrite this a couple of times, because to be frank, I have a very low opinion on christanity. I have developed this view both the lens of my personal life, as well as seeing its effects on society at large. \\n\\nChristianity claims to be about love, but it has defended bigotry time and time again. I have seen the bible used to justify all sorts of oppression. In my own lifetime, I have seen the bible used as a weapon against homosexuals, transgender persons, religious minorities, and women. This is not even a modern event either.\\n\\nDuring the age of colonization, horrible crimes that destroyed entire cultures were justified under the name of \\"Christianizing\\". Even in America, the genocide of the native Americans and slavery were both justified for this very reason. \\n\\nChristianity has a long history that is very very bloody. Which is a huge mark against its claim to morality. Actions speak louder than words, and Christianity\'s actions send a very clear message. \\n\\n&gt;This is where I find a lot of atheists do not realize that far more people have died in forced atheist states such as The Soviet Union, Communist China, North Korea, than any other religious war (Conservative estimates say around 95 Million) This Proves that when such dictatorships have removed religion, they lose any moral accountability from religion. I am not saying that to be moral you have to be religious, but I am saying in the absence of objective morals people can justify their actions as moral as everything is just socially and culturally relative. \\n\\nFirst, it is most certainty true that communism is anti-religious and pro-atheism. This is very clearly laid out in the communist manifesto itself. Marx had a lot to say about religion and none of it was positive. Second, it is also true that all of these nations committed atrocities against there own people. Third, while, it is not as true today in China. In the early days of the rise of communism, state atheism was enforced. \\n\\nI have no issue with denouncing communism, because I am not a communist. Sure, I do hold very left-wing views boarding on socialist, but I personally see communism to be at its core, to be a very flawed and dangerous ideology.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the problem with communism is not its atheistic characteristics but its black and white and militaristic beliefs. Communism at its core has very important beliefs. 1) All the worlds problems can be seen in terms of the working class vs the rich (aka capitalism is bad). 2) The only way to fix the world is though revolution (aka peaceful means won\'t work, only violence works).\\n\\nIts this combination that makes communism bad, not its atheistic components. It sees only one cause of the worlds problems, and sees violence as the only solution. So when things go bad under a communist system there is always one problem and one solution. (The capitalists are the problem more killing is the solution). This leads to an endless cycle of bloodshed. This is why in my opinion, nearly every communist state has a history of genocide against its own citizens. \\n\\nBut I am going from \\"Debate religion\\" to \\"Debate politics\\" here. My point is this, communism is bad but not because of atheism.", ',

Russia has massive reserves of energy, giving it shared interests with other energy-supplying countries. The most important of these energy-supplying countries is Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are who effectively established the petrodollar. Saudi Arabia has recently begun plans to start trading oil in Yuan. If that happens, the petrodollar is dead, and that means America can no longer run $1 trillion trade deficits, and its financial system will collapse. But you are correct, Russia cannot destroy the west on its own. The United States seems to be forcing a Chinese/Russian, and possibly Indian coalition. That is more than half the world\'s population, and China is the largest trading partner of most of Africa as well. The West is losing the game.\\n\\n5) Most of the world hates the United States. They only tolerate us because we have money. The United States is racking up massive debt, with an economy built almost completely on stock and real-estate bubbles from 0% interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which is causing massive inflation, which will only accelerate because of the energy, fertilizer, and food price increases resulting from this war. The United States is trying to force Europe to pay the cost of America\'s Ukrainian proxy war, which is causing a lot of resentment across Europe. If the petrodollar collapses, I think it will not only break America, it will also break the West and the transatlantic alliance.\\n\\n6) All of this is why Joe Biden is talking about a shift in the world order. After WWII, the disproportionate strength of the United States established a world in our image. But America\'s power is waning. American oil reserves are dropping even while consumption continues to rise. The United States is also a very divided country, filled with people who hate each other, who only tolerate each other because we are rich. If the world begins to come crashing down, America could come apart.\\n\\n7) Putin is not an idiot. He is far more intelligent than anyone in the US government. Putin did not wake up one morning and decided to invade Ukraine. He did it only after getting assurances from China, India, Iran, and others. Everything was calculated. This is why the West has been going insane trying to stop Putin at all costs. The future of the entire world depends on what happens in Ukraine.", ',
846	objective	46: "&gt; It\\u2019s still in their economic longterm interest to take territory of Ukraine\\n\\nI\'d be curious to see how that math works. China seems to have figured out a \\"post colonialism\\" strategy of just buying natural resources rather than trying to conquer territory, and it seems to work well for the 21st Century.\\n\\nBy the time you figure the costs of conquest, costs of rebuilding, costs of occupation, costs of resistance, costs of international sanctions, etc., it\'s not obvious that it ever pays off, even in a simple \\"video game\\" style economics that considers zero cost of human suffering. And whatever natural resources are being claimed in Ukraine\'s territory may or may not be particularly valuable in 50+ years when they supposedly start paying off. On that time scale, stuff like asteroid mining literally might not be science fiction any more. And people may be using fusion and solar powered LED\'s to grow food in cheap underground tunnels dug by robots and vertical farms in repurposed skyscrapers. That sort of thing sounds silly in 2022, but it\'s gonna take a long time for the supposed payoff in Ukraine, and I genuinely don\'t know that sort of stuff will sound so silly in 2072. I certainly wouldn\'t bet my nation state on it.", ',

287	objective	87: "A more simplistic take: Those treaties were signed when Russia in the form of the Soviet Union was America\\u2019s main planetary competitor. It is no longer that. They still compete. But it\\u2019s China who has the drive, demographics, and economics to actually supplant the USA. These treaties restrict the USA while not restricting its main foe. That would be like if the US agreed to swear of Nuclear weapons of North Korea did too. It helps to disarm North Korea, but North Korea is no longer the big picture and neither is Russia. If the US reverses the trend in the future it won\\u2019t be because of Russia, it\\u2019ll be because of analogues development in the PRC where they reach or even surpass Russia\\u2019s level and this may be enough to convince the United States to return towards reduction since it will be parallel by its main rival.", ',
773	subjective	73: "1)I\'m not siding with Russia, I would like Ukraine to join us too and I agree with your principles but they are not based on reality. I\'m from the EU, I understand Putin\'s reasoning. The US does not allow its neighbors to form military alliances with their enemies. Like Cuba for example.\\nSo it seems like respecting SOVEREIGNITY is only valid when it benifits the US...\\nIf let\'s say Canada or Mexico would form a military alliance with China/Russia then the US would not allow that. You call it the Monroe doctrine. I call it hypocricy concidering recent events. \\n\\nYou must remember that there is no world government. But the US acts like it and has been \\"policing\\" the world for it\'s own benefits and that of it\'s allies with no respect for the SOVEREIGNITY of its adversaries. Like Iran, Syria and Vietnam to name a few. \\n\\nIt gives the US a bad name. And in the long run that will be way worse for your people when halve the world hates you. It also gives our adversaries a reason to do the same.

14	objective	14: "This is complex. And, sorry for the long text.\\n\\nAs you might have already seen the results of sanctions on Russia. India fears this situation if it will happen to her in sometime in the future. So, all it\'s trying to do is just balance things out. \\n\\nThe Indian dependency on Russian equipments has fallen drastically from above 70% to about 46% or so after Modi has taken office in India. Talks are replace many Russian equipments with home grown equipments which will have some technology sourced from multiple countries like UK, USA, Israel, France &amp; Russia. The best example I can give is Tejas LCA (Light Combat Aircraft). Meanwhile, India will work on reducing this technological dependency in the future. Or, buy defense equipments from USA and western allies. Eg: Licence manufacturing of k-9 Vajra (a portable artillery unit) which is basically a South Korean weapon system.\\n\\nMuch like USA, Russia and China, India too wants to export defense equipments and multiple talks with multiple nations are on, so India and USA are already a competitor now. Which will and should benefit both of our nations.\\n\\nSimilarly not only in defense, but also in the energy sector India wants to maintain a balance as it is importing about 85-90% of the oil that it wants. Russia plays a very small role in this. About 2-3% of oil India purchases from them and Europe is the Russian oil\'s biggest importer at this moment. India on the other hand gets most of it\'s oil from the so called \\"pro-US\\" countries. Eg: OIC block and even USA. The import of oil from USA has also increased from about 5-6% to about 8%. Fear of sanctions made India to not import oil from Iran, who are geographically closer to us and the oil would have been cheaper as well when compared to US oil. So, the Indian public is bearing the burden of this for about the last 5-6 years now. We are paying exorbitant prices for petrol and diesel and therefore things are not easy to manage financially either as every other commodity gets affected with higher fuel prices. So, on this basis India wants to buy Russian oil as they are offering a heavy discount at the oil prices right now. I read somewhere that it\'s about 25-30%.\\n\\nIt\'s not that USA and India are enemies. But it\'s just that there are some legitimate Indian interests that the USA could &amp; must accomodate. Else, it is more like bullying India and making it do exactly what the USA wants it to do and have India sanctioned if it does otherwise. This is called as the western hegemony which many are against in India for obvious reasons. \\n\\nFor example: China made a deal with Iran for buying oil from them in Yuan instead of Dollar. Things worked out for them and they also import oil from USA. While India tried to do the same thing USA threatened with possible sanctions, which is just completely unfair in my books and I believe the Indian govt also believes the same. At last it\'s not the Indian govt who is going to bear the additional burden. It will be the Indian public.", ',
