In this regard it bothers me that we supposedly have more say/freedom in what our government does yet we bare no responsibility for the atrocities our government has and continues to this day to commit globally, and at the same time Russian people are 100% responsible for theirs? We should either be sanctioned to the same degree or the russian people should not be punished (but the oligarchs absolutely should, remember we said they would be \\u201ctargeted sanctions against oligarchs\\u201d initially, yet that is CLEARLY not the case and ordinary civilians are suffering as a result.

It can bully any country it likes without intervention from other countries, if the leader appears mad enough to use their nukes.\\n\\nIn the modern world where sanctions exist, wars are simply less frequent and bloody than before.\\n\\nI can guarantee that Putin regrets this war and would take it back if he had the chance. However, he is now stuck in a war that he lied about and politically cannot withdraw from. Of course much of this regret is political, but do not be mistaken, these sanctions are a huge reason he regrets this war. It is a shame that these sanctions were not imposed when Crimea was annexed, because if Russia understood the level of sanctions that could be thrown at it, it would not have invaded the rest of Ukraine.\\n\\nThis level of sanctions in unprecedented, and if their was any chance that China was considering invading Taiwan, it now has an extra con to add to the pro/con list.

My country only has like barely 400 years of history so Japan is considered Ancient by our standard haha, but it is certainly a relatively young civilization by Asian standard. \\n\\nSometimes when people say a country had very long history, the term is used loosely and not in a strict academic sense. Japan has been inhabited by people since 30,000 BC and iirc the earliest potteries we found on the archipelago can be dated to as far back as 10,000 BC which is incredible. So you are not wrong to say that Japan is old in that sense, only that the notion of Japan didn\'t exist so we study those stuffs in archaeology as opposed to in Japanese history. \\n\\nAnother thing that might mislead people about the longevity of Japanese history is that Japan\'s historical records of its own history traces it back to mythological roots and almost 1000 years before its actual origins. All East Asian countries (Japan, China, Korea) are guilty of this as they mention about some ancient era/dynasty/emperors that are purely mythical with little or no archaeological evidence. \\n\\nBut honestly though it is hardly surprising that Japan\'s history starts quite late given its geography. Historical development is inseparable from contacts and cultural exchanges between different groups of people. Had there not been any influxes of migrations of people from the Asian mainland, or later contacts with Chinese and Korean, Japanese society would have been completely different (probably would never have developed writing, agriculture or metallurgy, all of which were learned from the Asian Mainland) and might not be too far off from those secluded tribes we find in the remotes locations of the world that have had very little contacts with the outside world.", ',

777	objective	77: "Looks like the Navy is going to be struggling for a bit, going down to 280 ships by the mid-late 2020s. This seems to directly contradict the service\'s aims for a larger fleet of somewhere around 355 ships (the numbers keep changing so thats what I\'m going with.) \\n\\nTo be frank, the Navy needs to get its shit together fast. Shipbuilding is not going to get any easier, with the Columbia-class submarines taking up a lot of building + budget capacity along with the CVNs. Many Flight I and II Burke-class destroyers are also beginning to enter the last leg of their service lives, with the Navy building Flight III ships but not at a fast enough pace to keep up with the rate of decommissioning older vessels, not to mention the Burke is a 40 year old design at this point.\\n\\nThere also needs to be an honest conversation about the roles CVNs would play in a conflict with China. As much as everyone (especially Congress) loves aircraft carriers, is there really a need for the US to have 12 of them? Obviously we need them, but CVNs are extremely expensive assets that take forever to build and costs large amounts of money to maintain. You also need to factor in the costs of the airwing, escorts, ammunition, etc. CVNs would play a role in a conflict with China, but they\'d have to stay *at least* hundreds of miles away due to the threat posed by China\'s hundreds/thousands of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. I think going down to 8-10 CVNs instead of 12 would make more sense and free up capital that can be put into getting smaller hulls into the water.\\n\\nAs for the LCS: scrap them all. While the program has made some headway in recent years, it has overall continued to under-deliver in all categories and has produced subpar vessels. Take the money and crews from those ships and put them somewhere else. An even better idea would be to develop a cheap corvette-sized ship based on a design from Europe/Asia that is already in use and is proven. There is a role for small ships like corvettes, such as showing the flag/diplomatic visits to foreign ports, patrolling the ME, anti-piracy, operating in low threat environments, etc. \\n\\nIn general, the Navy needs to learn how to advocate for itself in Congress as well to get the funding it needs.

With the world\'s largest population, a strong army, a growing airforce, and access to nuclear weapons, they could cement themselves as a regional power. The major problem for them is power projection.\\n\\nBoth the UK and France have powerful navies (including aircraft carriers) and are ex-colonial states, which gives them a massive amount of power projection. Both are economically strong, though relient on the rest of the world for resources.\\n\\nGermany is a powerful economic state, but with no navy and a massive economic reliance on exports, would be pretty screwed. If they could ally with the UK and/or France, they could their navies to protect their shipping allowing them to dominate.\\n\\nSouth Korea would lose the US\'s protection and access to nuclear weaponry. As such, war with North Korea would be imminent. Unless, South Korea could forge alliances with Japan and Taiwan, and get get backup from a nuclear state, the entire peninsula is going up in flames. \\n\\nSpeaking of Japan and Taiwan, without access to the global shipping system, they would be screwed. As such, they would have to rebuild a trade system in order to get the necessary resources. Luckily, as the strongest East Asian nations, it would be difficult for them to use their navies to build an alliance with the other asian nations (again), though as none of the east asian nations are food secure, they would have to find someone to trade with.\\n\\nSouth and Central America is very reliant on the US system at the moment, so would need to rebuild their trade system. They have access to a lot of resources though, so could be self reliant. There would be too much infighting to become a superpower though.\\n\\nWithout access to American aid, Israel would be screwed and would be in a massive war with their neighbours. The rest of the middle east would need to import everything except oil, so would need to work with the superpowers to protect their shipping lanes, which would constantly be attacked by each other. Egypt would also be powerful due their control over the immensely important Suez Canal. \\n\\nAfrica would pushed back into colonialism. Only a few nations are food secure so most would be reliant on imports even to survive.

But alas, after doing the math, SG is no doubt the place that can provide a reasonable job opportunity (unless you count being a factory packer as one), a decent income after tax and etc. For work purposes, I lived in Guangzhou and Auckland and did some comparison.\\n\\nWhere on earth...\\n\\n1. Can you find a government who would give you angbao, e.g. Gst package, skillsfuture, housing grants etc? Before the argument comes in on the high GST / income tax. How much income tax are you paying such that you had rather forgo the above to keep your tax money? I mean seriously, 10k for choosing to live near your parents??\\n2. Decent house quality and layout. I won\'t say they are perfect. But compared to the places I went, I feel safer with the tighter regulations in place here. In China, you face your neighbour\'s kitchen when you open your window. Your house will forever be in a evening feel even if its bright and sunny out there because no natural light will come in when your house is wedge in on all four sides. \\n3. Job opportunity. In Auckland, the younger ones are going over to Australia in droves for better income and opportunities. Not that there isn\'t in NZ, but lesser. And with a population of 5million in such a huge land area, running a biz is not as feasible / efficient compared to SG. In China? Make sure you don\'t get swallowed alive by the unscrupulous agent and fake job listings first. \\n4. Safety. Singapore\'s well lit environment and ironically, the cctvs that covers every inch of your movements, makes SG a very secure place for females. I don\'t worry when my partner, a skinny female who probably will lose to a fight with a sick chihuahua, goes out for supper with friends midnight.\\n5. Most important point. Low income tax. We wanted to get married and shift to maybe an European country, I did a reverse very quickly after calculating the possible income that we can earn (lower than in SG) and almost half of it going to tax...\\n\\nI\'ve seen some argument on not being able to move out before 35yo and thus can\'t enjoy independence / learn to be a mature adult. Really?? No one is stopping any one from doing household chores, or contributing to the finance of the house. All in all, SG is a heaven for the rich and single middle income, a place that you won\'t suffer as much for being a destitute, life on easy mode I dare say.\\n\\nAlthough my entire post is praising SG, the hypocrisy of the local political scenes do grate on my nerves all the time. We claim to be a secular state, then wtf are we still consulting religious leaders on the repeal of 377A? Grow some balls already la!

More importantly, he banned all fracking on federally owned lands, which eliminated a vast majority of our domestic energy production and single-handedly ended our energy independence.

661	objective	61: ".The Sino-Russo relationship is rooted in strategic &amp; tactical geographic consideration.\\n\\nGeographically Russia is the largest country in the world. It accounts for 11% of the world\'s land mass, and is almost twice as large as the next biggest country, Canada.\\n\\nThat land mass is important to CN as it stretches across Eurasia. It abuts the USA across the Bering Straight (a mere 4km if you include the islands in between.) \\n\\nXi Jinping is not gambling power on Putin or Russia. Putin is a direct means to an end and Russia has been that end of geographic security since the CPC took over CN, bar the 1950\'s Stalin threat of nuclear war. CN security is mandated by RU as a buffer state. As long as RU is authoritarian and at odds with the West CN policy and security is satisfied. That is no debate about that. The issue of Xi Jinping being personally threatened by Putin\'s poor judgement is easily countered in CPC forums, assemblies. The counter view CN is dependent on the West for economic survival is mostly true but it is not a singular, inflexible, diametrically opposed point to relations with RU or Putin. All Jinping need do is tone down Putin, raise up RU. Play the game somewhat appeasing western powers. And CN has done so. \\n\\nRussia\'s landmass secures China\'s northern and Western borders. Geographically in the north and politically over the \'Stans in the west. \\n\\nThe importance of land mass is that RU is a buffer state for CN. Whilst no occidental strategist I have ever read even suggests Europeans would venture east across RU or the \'stans to attack CN, the physical impossibility of it, the logistical &amp; transportation difficulty, the political absence of intention, make without doubt such an idea absurd. From CN\'s perspective it does not want a pro-western entity on its northern border or western liberalisation/orientation with the \'Stans as it would be encircled.\\n\\nOf course the idea falls away if there is a change of political structure. If with political collapse the Russian state changes course. What chance is there of political change that repudiates authoritarianism and somehow Russia decides it does wish to align itself with the Occident? That is unlikely, historically inept and doesn\'t appear to have a kernel of truth to it. There are no indicators let alone identified groups within Russia who express a sentiment of statehood similar to the EU nations. Those who have read Navalny the leading Opposition figure to Putin realise he is anti-corruption, not anti-Russian in its historical form. Ask what he thinks of Western sociological developments he argues he\'d do to the LGBT community what Putin does to him\\n\\n&gt;Amnesty says that it took action because of past comments made by Navalny that \\u201cmay have amounted to advocacy of hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, violence or hostility.\\u201d Navalny is a traditional Russian nationalist first and maintains views rooted in what Westerners might consider belonging to the 1950\'s.\\n\\nThus China needs Russia to stay intact*, to maintain authoritarian rule, to maintain reasonably friendly relations with RU. One has long thought the litmus test of RU/CN relations are the 19th C Unequal Treaties imposed by Russia on China\'s north and north-east of the Amur river. [What is now Russia see map in article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manchuria) China one suspects harbours an irredentist claim of this area for all the obvious reasons, prior control, nationalism, 2000km of Pacific coast, controlling land mass over the length of Japan, ICBM routes, wider coastal distribution of submarine bases, control of the whole ice free Western Pacific, trade to the USA &amp; Canada. CN cannot aggressively retake this land for fear of RU acting like North Korea. RU can\'t field a mass army in Europe and the far east concomitantly (as we are now seeing.) So RU has no recourse but to rely on the nuclear threat to keep China from reasserting its land claim, no matter how debatable that claim may be. As we have seen with the SCSI CN will say anything to justify territorial acquisition. Yet, CN cannot afford to weaken RU if that results in a two pronged attack on the RU state. The chance of RU collapsing might be too great from reactionary forces within if unpredictable outcomes arise. The uncertainty lies with, as the USA has been training secretly UA military for 6 years, and Germany shipped Lenin back to Russia to topple the Tsar/government: what political figures, what forces could be unleashed in RU we are not aware of that have western support? Doubtful, sure. Certain, no. Nonetheless one cannot see RU giving up the land highlighted in the Wiki article as there is too much nationalistic association and threat construction tied up in it. Add in the demographic utility of conscripted peoples.\\n\\nChina needs Russia intact as its northern buffer state and guarantor of political securitisation to its west with the \'Stans. The * earlier is a caveat that if RU does break up or the \'Stans do obtain greater independence and look to the West CN will try to intervene here whether on its own behalf or to reinforce RU control. CN policy formulation is based on the State and its leadership. If Putin is assassinated tomorrow the CN government will without hesitation declare \\"The King is dead. Long live the King.\\" CN will reaffirm its support and in all probability would welcome the removal of a leader who created instability on its border - even if that is thousands of kilometres away, it is still RU. Until that happens CN/Xi Jinping will support by ways and means, some direct, some indirect, Putin and Russia. It is not a gamble, it is national self-interest. It just requires some sleight of appearance, subtle tempering.", ',

Why is that so widespread? Seriously, \\"Green car\\" does not rule out \\"Subaru\\". \\n\\nThe term \\"Republic\\" refers to any government type that is represented by elected officials. Other terms on the same scale would be \\"Monarchy\\" or \\"Theocracy\\". There\'s also an element of \\"where does the power come from\\" here, be it from \\"the People\\" in case of a Republic, tradition or God in case of a Monarchy, or any higher power in case of a Theocracy.\\n\\nThe term \\"Democracy\\" refers to the internal processes of the legislative and the government. You can have a monarchy that\'s also a democracy (e.g. the UK), or a republic that\'s a democracy (such as the US). You can also have a republic that is an \\"Autocracy\\" (almost every strongman dictatorship) or an \\"Oligarchy\\" (China). Theocratic democracies are, admittedly, super-rare, though I think the LDS church has been advocating for something like that.\\n\\nI\'m simplifying of course - there are some modifiers here such as presidential and parliamentary republics, or autocracies based on different aspects (charismatic, traditional, or legal as defined by Max Weber), elective monarchies which are kind of an oligarchy but not entirely, and so on.\\n\\nWhat\'s more relevant here though are two factors. One: the United States are by design a confederacy because, as I said, states as actors are values higher than population. Secondly, the fact that it\'s a *presidential* democracy instead of a parliamentary one and was designed at the time to replace a monarchy, not to develop an entirely new social order. \\n\\nThe latter leads to a problem of legitimation - the president and the house are elected separately. This means that the two tend to work in an adversarial relationship but can both claim to have a mandate - even if they represent opposing positions. The Senate serves a different purpose (to represent the states), so it\'s a bit weird that the President, too, is elected by a mode that serves the same purpose and the House (via gerrymandering) also tends to - in practice - not really be set up in a representative fashion.\\n\\nBoth are not unsolvable problems, mind - for example, the German system combines state interests in form of an upper house (much like the US senate) but then weighs the lower house via a combined system of electoral districts (which are based entirely on population and impossible to gerrymander) and a proportion of the total vote as an adjustment in case the two don\'t match up. The issue of differing legitimization bases is easily solved through a parliamentary system, where the government acts entirely on behalf of the parliament, with - in the German system at least - state representatives, the judiciary and a possible head of state acting as veto players if needed.\\n\\nIt\'s very much the same idea, only that it had three reboots which could implement the learnings of the past centuries - something the US notably has not had.", ',

Then your waste is mix of uranium and plutonium, minor actinides and a final fraction of fission products. \\n\\nUranium and plutonium can be used for mox fuel replacing U235 we need to get from mining. \\n\\nMinor actinides are a bit harder but those can be fissioned in nuclear reactors to, they however are harder to control because they have less delayed neutrons and nobody thus far has designed a nuclear reactor to the nitty gritty detail necessary to build a reactor that can handle them. Mainly because we still have so little of that stuff. Minor actinides do have niche uses in the real world like neutron sources for research in a laboratory or in smoke detectors. We do have rough designs for accelerator driven fission reactors that use a particle beam like a spark plug that could run on fuels made from minor actinides.\\n\\nFission products are 99% \\"short\\" term radioactive. I will use the definition of short that means it takes 300 years of letting it decay until it\'s less radioactive than uranium ore. Something that can be handled less safety precautions like gasoline or lead. At that point fission products can be refined again and the isotopes that have already stopped being radioactive can be used for industry. The 1% leftover that stay radioactive for long times can either be stored because stuff that is radioactive for a long time gives of very little radioactive particles per second and isn\'t that dangerous if you prevent inhalation or it being eaten or it can be put in a nuclear reactor to be bombarded with neutrons to make it either a really radioactive isotope that quickly decays into something stable or immediately upon neutron capture is stable.\\n\\nIt\'s mainly greenpeace and oil and coal companies fearing that nuclear without incredible amounts of red tape would have replaced electric power generation for a large part. Thuss a imaginary enemy had to be created. So they made a myth that we didn\'t know what to do with nuclear waste and then kill of every solution the sector gave to dealing with the waste. Because if nuclear power ever succeeded they believed their profits would end and yeah greenpeace has a subsidiary that sells russian gas called greenpeace energy, now called green planet energy.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Planet_Energy\\n\\nIt\'s plausible to dig it back up in 10 years if russia or china seize kazakhstan that europe start reprocessing it\'s spent fuel more because kazakhstan has the cheapest uranium reserves in the world.

Without getting into details (as this is not the venue for it) it seems that there\'s a small but loud and active female fans in Korea that expresses their opinions openly about girl groups\' wardrobe (the stereotypical \'they would look so much better in jeans and a white T-shit\' comment - you might have heard it before). LOONA\'s all white costumes set alarm bells for me because their wardrobe is exactly what those comments want. It looks nice enough, but LOONA desperately needs to expand their fanbase right now, not just make their core fans happy.\\n\\nWith that said, they have the most members so they have a huge performance upside AND the size of their international fanbase is probably second only to Kep1er. Queendom 1 saw all the artists lean strongly into their strengths, so I\'m sure my reaction to a 90 second opening act is unfounded. I hope.\\n\\nKep1er: Speaking about my reaction to a 90 second opening act, Kep1er probably had my least favorite opening performance. I hate hate hate hip hop. But even taken that into account, the marching band intro and the \\"ambitious young girls struggling to realize their dreams\\" trope in the lyrics that they sang is was really corny and cliched coming from a rookie group. I might have let one of it pass, but two in 90 seconds? I was cringing in my seat.\\n\\nWith that said, Kep1er had a really strong presence in episode 0. Just watching their scenes in their practice room was casting a drain life on me. That\'s something that comes naturally and can\'t be faked, and it\'s one of their biggest advantages. Kep1er also has the largest international fanbase. So as long as the adults around them do their jobs (and if MNet - a fellow CJ subsidiary - keeps their dirty paws off of them), Kep1er will probably come out looking like a million bucks.\\n\\nViviz: Gfriend probably had the most intense and difficult choreographies among third generation girl groups this side of Dreamcatcher. They were still holding that title until Lightsum came out with their Vanilla choreography (Lightsum: When do we breathe? Choreographer: At the end). While I didn\'t appreciate the 90s Eurovision eurobeat laser show lighting, but their performance was solid, especially how they built up to the last 30 seconds. The last 30 seconds was the best performance in the cast pound for pound. \\n\\nI don\'t know if Viviz is carrying over enough of the Gfriend fandom, but they still look like they can go.\\n\\nHyolyn: Her opening performance had zero originality, and everything was what I\'ve seen countless times before. But her absolute talent and stage presence ate originality for lunch and overwhelmed everything. \\n\\nThe key to Hyolyn in Queendom would be if this appearance would be enough to make the public forget about her bullying scandal, especially since she carried a lot of haters even before then. Hopefully she can become another G-Idle instead of AOA or April (yes, apples to oranges, but I\'m only referring to the outcomes, not the details).\\n\\nBrave Girls: As a card carrying Fearless, I\'ll just mention one thing that didn\'t really come up that often. But first, I need to say I LOVED the lighting in their opening performance. It\'s just my personal taste, but those lights are my favorite stage lights and I never get tired of seeing them.\\n\\nAnyway, my one thing. Brave Girls opening performance was basically a 90 second Michael Jackson tribute. Sure, Michael Jackson is textbook for dance music singers, but at the same time, he carries a LOT of baggage, especially for American audiences. It made me think that as Brave Girls are trying to expand their international fandom, it might have been better if they avoided ANYTHING that might trigger an international audience member watching them.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of people don\'t seem to recognize the Michael Jackson tribute. But that\'s their problem, not mine. LOL.\\n\\nWow, that came out way longer than I intended. So here\'s an obligatory tl;dr: some groups are carrying some issues into the show with them, but in the end, I really like them all and hope everyone succeeds in the show.", ',
