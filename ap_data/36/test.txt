Ever wonder why some years vaccine for the flu are better than other years? Because of variant matching. As far as vaccines and side effects - pretty minimal already, the truth is that it is rarely a deterrent for people in the US/Europe (where a majority of vaccine profit comes from). With Pfizer and Moderna there is *some* cross-reactivity to the current variant. Delta was more deadly and serious than the quite infectious Omnicron (Current), so people are less afraid of it, herd immunity will happen sooner (notice how China easily contained Delta, but cannot contain Omnicron), and world governments are now actually encouraging travel. Could another variant pop up? Definitely! However vaccine efficacy (and partial cross over), herd immunity, and people and governments quite frankly no longer caring as much, will heavily decrease future vaccines\' profitability. \\n\\n***Regulation, not science, right now is preventing the omnicron specific booster.*** \\n\\nGodspeed!\\n\\nDr. DD", ',

712	objective	12: "The Hong Kong curlers are all amateurs with day jobs. At most one might consider becoming a full-time curler if given the chance, but it\'s really a different situation. That\'s really the biggest gap between the big 3 teams in the Pacific-Asia region where significant national support and funding help the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese stand out. \\n\\nAs for USA and CAN, they shouldn\'t underestimate the so-called Tier 2 PACC teams (New Zealand, Chinese Taipei, Kazakhstan, Australia), but I don\'t think they are that concerned about them/us as much as they are the Tier 1 teams of Japan, Korea, and China. It has nothing to do with connection to China or not because there are no indications of any intent to link other member associations to the Chinese program anytime soon (and I am not sure if WCF would permit this). \\n\\nAs for an upset to get to Worlds, I would say on the men\'s side it is very possible that New Zealand or Chinese Taipei (depending on who gets sent) could play spoiler and, if all cards fall well - could get one of the 5 direct berths from the PCCC to Worlds. Both teams have beaten the Tier 1 teams in the past. In 2019, Chinese Taipei and Japan were closely matched in their game. In 2021, Korea and Chinese Taipei were closely matched in their game. The challenge will be doing it both in the pool play and again in the playoffs. The better consistency of the Tier 1 teams is their advantage. Chinese Taipei can be really good when on (some team members have a lot of experience), but then we can have real stinkers the next day.\\n\\nSo, long story short, an upset is absolutely possible - but it wouldn\'t be because of a relationship to China.", ',

399	subjective	99: "The Quen were a way to make social critique of China without mentioning China.\\n\\nHowever, if they really did come from China, they\'re completely unrealistic. Chinese population was still huge by the time the Faro Plague happened, so why did ELEUTHIA-01 reseed China of all places with mostly Western people? Granted, we haven\'t seen most of the Quen yet, but the ones we\'ve seen in high places resemble Americans, not Chinese.\\n\\nNot to mention the Quen are fairly liberal in their behavior despite their control over information, which does not resemble modern day China very much, and probably does not resemble how China would have evolved in these matters either. Considering the tribes were all influenced by their environments, it\'s unlikely the Quen would be so supportive of same-sex marriage for example. Unless something else happened.\\n\\nI like to see the Quen as a take on Abrahamic religions, which do not accept additions to their scriptures that contradict their established religion. I could see a parallel between Sobeck and Mary Magdalene.", ']

It is entirely true that people are disappeared here.\\n\\nWhat makes it even more dangerous is that you never know who has connections. Many people - including teachers - are members of the CCP.

388	objective	88: "This is the flag of the Egyptian Empire. It comes from a world where Ancient Egypt continued its trading expeditions and continued to expand its territory. As a result, even the gold mines in Egypt began to dry up, the empire continued to remain strong. In time the Egyptian Empire would stretch from the Nile Delta to the Cape of Good Hope. Egypt would also go on to establish colonies in South America and Australia. Egypt continued to practice its traditional religion of many gods. It went through a brief bout of missionary fever, but for the most part Egyptians aren\'t too pushy about religion and have a live and let live attitude. \\n\\nEgypt has maintained good relations with the kingdoms of Tartessos, Etruscan and Albion; as well as the empires of the Hellenes and Etruscans. Nevertheless, many of these European kingdoms have expressed interest in forming a political union in order to curb Egypt\'s power. Historically, China has been Egypt\'s primary international rival. In more recent times, however, Japan had begun to give both China and Egypt and run for their money. Egypt and Japan are currently competing to see who can construct the first space elevator.\\n\\nEgypt\'s government is a constitutional monarchy. The Pharaoh is technically still the head of state, but has largely become a symbolic/religious position, and the Pharaoh is no long believed to be a living god. The real power is in the hands of the House of Life and the House of Peoples. The House of Life is composed of experts in various fields that have been hand-picked by Pharaoh; while the House of Peoples contains representatives that have elected by the people. The leader of the House of Peoples is the Chief Lecter, a prime minister of sorts. \\n\\nThe blue and black represent the ancient view of Egypt as a slab of clay afloat on the sea. This view has obviously been disproven, but the symbolism is still often used to represent Egypt. The gold eye is of course the Eye of Horus. A symbol since ancient times, it\'s represents the gods watching over Egypt and her peoples. \\n\\nLink to the original flag on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2017/02/flag-of-egyptian-empire.html?m=0", ',

Bear in mind, we still have troops in Germany and Japan 70 years after WW2. We held an airbase in this volatile region as well as being in proximity to Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan, both then potential war theaters. I think the withdrawal was executed as poorly as possible. The result has been as bad as possible. We\'ve armed the Taliban beyond their wildest dreams having left the airbase and billions in American military equipment. Just announced today, Afghan women are now again forbidden by law to be educated beyond the 6th grade. Nobody will ever trust the US again for protection, which will result in more armed nuclear powers.
