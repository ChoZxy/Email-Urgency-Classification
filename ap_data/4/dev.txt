801	10	The G.O.P. is already hemorrhaging Trump-skeptical, independent-minded officials at all levels. Just this month, Charlie Baker, the popular Republican governor of deep-blue Massachusetts, announced that he would not run for re-election. If Georgia Republicans take the bait and throw Mr. Kemp over for Mr. Trump’s preferred lickspittle, it will send a clear message to the party’s dwindling pockets of principle and rationality: Get out. Now. While you still have a soul.
792	8	Is Build Back Better perfect? Of course not. But it’s the best legislation we’re likely to get for years to come. And claims that we should let this opportunity pass out of concern over fiscal responsibility or inflation are uninformed at best, dishonest at worst.

611	7	I’ll let her have the final words: “I started to think about the parallels between climate change and this war and it’s clear that the roots of both these threats to humanity are found in fossil fuels,” Krakovska said in the interview. “Burning oil, gas and coal is causing warming and impacts we need to adapt to. And Russia sells these resources and uses the money to buy weapons. Other countries are dependent upon these fossil fuels; they don’t make themselves free of them. This is a fossil fuel war. It’s clear we cannot continue to live this way; it will destroy our civilization.”
46	2	As I tell my students, remember to play your whole movie — not just the clip of your latest stumble on repeat. I hope that will lessen failure’s sticking power as they inevitably encounter a bombed exam, a botched job interview, a breakup. Those things won’t matter nearly as much as their willingness to try again.
882	1	From a recent visit to the Lincoln Memorial. Two kids, posing for pictures. I really like the framing on this one. Taken using a Yashica medium-format camera and Kodak film.
283	5	Overall, the Russian shock to the world economy will be nasty, but probably not all that nasty. If Putin imagines that he can hold the world to ransom, well, that’s probably yet another fatal miscalculation.
468	5	But the virus doesn’t care. The desire to get Omicron over with is a desire to exert a measure of control in an uncontrollable situation. This interregnum, of waiting to see whether the rest of my family is going to get sick or not, is a reminder of how little control we really have. Right now I feel good. It’s terrible.
976	7	Apologies to any stand-up Republicans who got overlooked this time around. And here’s hoping that in the months to come, even more officials at all levels get fed up with licking Mr. Trump’s anti-democratic, filth-encrusted boots.
659	3	Many of the people I spoke to said that it was no longer possible to make plans more than a few weeks ahead — perhaps only a few days. For them, Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine marks a clear rupture with the past, an end to everything familiar. The future has been foreclosed. To help change the course of Russian history for the better, the United States and Europe should offer Russia’s exiled opposition another future, as they once did for Soviet dissidents.
577	5	Americans of all backgrounds are being asked to decide what kind of community they want to live in. New York doesn’t have to accept a reality in which only the city’s very wealthiest residents get to enjoy the peace of mind that comes with secure housing.
302	3	A memorial will not solve these urgent problems. But New York will be a stronger city if it can confront its grief instead of trying to outrun it.
827	8	If and when Democrats lose one or both chambers of Congress — and when we all face the consequences of their failure — I am confident that we’ll hear, once again, how it’s everyone’s fault but their own.
273	7	These efforts won’t magically increase the vaccination rate in America or keep your uncle from taking on some very strange beliefs, but they seem to be the only viable solution to a problem that looks designed to exploit the American traditions of inequality and mistrust.
83	8	I’ve called today’s newsletter a post-mortem on Trump’s trade war, but, in fact, that trade war isn’t over. Trump’s trade policies were foolish and costly — they failed by any measure you choose — but it may be a long time before any president is in a position to undo the damage.
579	2	There are lots of complications, though, including the difficulty of measuring the value of illiquid assets (like horse farms). Taxes on gains in illiquid assets would not be assessed annually — although that leads to other complications. Zwick said, “There are other ways to raise this that seem simpler,” such as increasing existing tax rates and closing loopholes.
229	5	Either they collaborate to oust Putin or they will all share his isolation cell. The same for the larger Russian public. I realize that this last scenario is the most unlikely of them all, but it is the one that holds the most promise of achieving the dream that we dreamed when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 — a Europe whole and free, from the British Isles to the Urals.
804	1	When it was time for Bobby to leave, we took a family picture. Because for those few days, Bobby was part of our family. He hung in there through all the petting and rubbing and sponge baths. He had no hair. I never sneezed once. I love him for that.
584	5	When you’ve been fooled once, you can’t be so sure you’ll never be fooled again. And my mother’s long, unhappy grift taught me this: Every one of us is vulnerable to the right con.
713	1	And finally, the utterly charming Sohla El-Waylly has a gingerbread cookie recipe that is fun to cook and eat. (You can also watch her participate in this delightful gingerbread challenge on NYT Cooking’s YouTube page.) My colleague Jamelle Bouie also always has a recipe idea in his newsletter. We’ll take next week off for New Year’s festivities, and I’ll see you in 2022.
739	4	But now that there is an actual threat of schools closing, I’m realizing that this mantra was wrong. It should simply be, “Schools should never close.”
910	6	There was no mistaking the message of Wednesday’s arguments: There will be a day when there is no longer a right to choose abortion in the United States, and it is coming soon.
117	5	The Jewish tradition asks me to guard my tongue, to be careful of what I say, of promises I make. If these promises are said with God’s name, I must carry out the actions promised by my words. In this time of social platforms that influence millions, pausing before we speak and taking words seriously might not be such a bad thing. Indeed, it might do the work of repairing the world.
349	7	Second, if you’ve raised your kids amid economic adversity, you most likely will understand and even support having those circumstances taken into account in their evaluation by a university, even if you’re not part of a racial minority. But suppose that those aren’t your circumstances, that you’re middle class or above and aren’t Black, Latino or Native American. How would you feel about your kids being admitted to a university because of their “diverseness” from other kids rather than, well, their selves?
718	1	I look forward to reconnecting with you in 2022. And I thank you for spending time with me in 2021.
150	5	This prosecution and even new laws are no guarantee that schoolchildren won’t continue to send frantic text messages to parents to say, “I love you. There’s an active shooter here.” But in an era of permissive gun ownership, the prosecution of parents may provide one of the few available paths to keeping our children safer.
389	7	The best rationale, in the end, came from a member of the band itself. George says, in an interview on the TV show “West 57th Street” in December 1987: “It’s Beatles this, Beatles that, Beatle, Beatle, Beatle, Beatle. In the end it’s like ‘Oh, sod off with the Beatles,’ you know?”
74	3	I wonder if a few years from now we’ll say that when it came to anticipating the future for Big Tech, we weren’t thinking big enough.
416	5	Loathsome: The Beijing Olympics next month may come with a giant dose of digital surveillance. Chinese authorities are trying to create a zero-Covid bubble for the athletes, but, one report noted, “researchers at the University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab said a virus-monitoring app all attendees must use was found to have a ‘simple but devastating’ encryption flaw that could allow personal data including health information and voice messages to leak.” Count me a fan of The Citizen Lab, despite The International Olympic Committee and The Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee saying the software problems have been fixed.
40	5	And yet the world is not jumping at the chance to be bossed around by the world’s largest surveillance states, either. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the fate of the world depends on our ability to get the response to this “axis of autocracy” right. Americans have to stand up for our values and our allies without ending up in a catastrophic war. No matter how testy relations become, we should remember that the biggest threats we face today — climate change, the pandemic and nuclear proliferation — threaten Russia and China, too.
724	6	Until proven, the thousands of allegations that agents field each year are, of course, simply that: allegations. And the last thing Uber should be expected to do is play judge and jury, but by choosing to turn a blind eye, that is, in effect, what it is doing. If riders knew that from the get-go, perhaps they’d be more leery about riding around with strangers.
684	1	Core inflation looks less scary lately by the Cleveland and Dallas measures than by the one used by the Fed’s Board of Governors in Washington. The Cleveland Fed’s median C.P.I. measure was up just 3.5 percent in the 12 months through November, versus 4.9 percent for the C.P.I. excluding food and energy. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean version of the personal consumption expenditures price index was up just 2.8 percent in the 12 months through November, versus 4.7 percent for that index excluding food and energy (and 5.7 percent for that index including food and energy).
800	1	Wishing you and your loved ones a wonderful holiday season, and happy giving!
593	1	These projects reminded me that legacy matters, and that mine is largely about illuminating the legacy of the culture that made me. It gives me hope for a future with the confidence to hold the past — to protect it and preserve it, to explain it and elevate it, to keep its light shining brightly even as it drifts out into the sea of time.
668	6	And even if technological fixes emerge, from industry and from private investment, governments — especially rich governments — must drive the response, lest they condemn their citizens to an unsustainable future. But first they must face squarely what is happening before their very eyes. That is one purpose of these Postcards from a World on Fire. They are not a comprehensive account of climate change. They are not even a representative sample. They’re a collection of snapshots of the ways in which climate change is already here. They’re evidence that we need to do more.
500	7	It’s understandable that people are tired of Covid-19. Health workers are, too. But leaning too heavily on us and our hospital beds is foolhardy. A highly contagious variant like Omicron, even if it causes milder illness, can still risk precipitating the failure of our health care system. Collective actions over the coming weeks — the distribution and use of high-quality masks, staying home if not feeling well and getting vaccinated or a booster if eligible — could help prevent hospitals and health care workers from sliding into crisis. It’s not March 2020. But it shouldn’t have to be for us to take this seriously.
618	4	Dissent, the Bush-era left often proclaimed, is the highest form of patriotism. That may be overly dramatic and self-flattering. But at the very least we can say this much: In a context where elite mistakes and hawkish temptations could have atomic consequences, to read dissenters out of the debate makes the path to destruction much too wide and smooth for comfort.
656	2	I’ve arrived at my own lazy gardening philosophy: Try your best to reciprocate the contempt and indifference that nature has for you. When your bougainvilleas refuse to offer up their blooms despite your halfhearted efforts, regard them with the same mild, healthy disdain that you reserve for things that disappoint you, but are not really your problem.
298	5	Instead of benefiting fully from a free flow of ideas and data and genuine insights, too many of us volitionally make do with an unrepresentative trickle. If the result isn’t an alternate reality nearly as comical and tragical as Russia’s right now, it’s a distortion nonetheless, and a dangerous one to boot. We are only as good as the information we seek.
765	8	Cherian, from Switzerland: “Every sensible person knows that the uncontrolled availability of guns is the main ground of frequent mass shootings in America. Prosecuting parents in the case of minors isn’t the right answer for this. Whatever is done without taking into consideration the root cause of the matter, i.e., the misunderstanding and the misinterpretation of the Constitution with regard to the possession of guns and rifles, will not bring any positive results.”
348	4	The good news is that most people who read the original article instead of just scanning the headline and image will understand that those desks weren’t intended as a comprehensive fix for the systemic obstacles that parents in America face. The small things do help, and do matter, though. And I hope the attention this design is getting — good and bad — inspires more public agencies and facilities to think about who is using their services, and how to make their lives a little easier.
346	4	The point I want to make here, both in the essay and in this addendum, is that we should not think of the slave system or the slave trade as somehow about racism and hatred. It was about profit. That’s why — and how — it lasted so long. And historical analysis aside, to see chattel slavery as part of a system of labor or profit — to see it as part of a larger class system — is to better understand the ideas, ideologies and institutions it produced over the course of its life and the ways they shaped, and continue to shape, our world.
376	6	On the right, even if you’re wary of critical race theory’s effect on the way many kids are taught, it is both backward and unnecessary to institutionalize the sense that discussing race at all is merely unwelcome pot stirring (and if that’s not what you mean, then you need to make it clear). On the left, illiberalism does not become insight just because some think they are speaking truth to power. Resistance to this kind of perspective is vital, no matter where it comes from on the political spectrum.
778	1	Hassenfeld told me that it’s helpful to think of giving in the way you might think of an investment portfolio — to spread your donations among more than one cause or region of the world. I find that advice wise but somewhat difficult to carry out, because it’s difficult to find the sort of detailed cost-effectiveness measures for local charities that GiveWell maintains for overseas groups. And so, other than donating to my local food bank a few times a year, I’ve come to direct the bulk of my giving to GiveWell. It’s the best way I know of to have some certainty that I might be doing some good in the world.
740	7	Between the police commissions, city councils, state legislatures and courts, there are ample state and local avenues through which to change policing for the better. We need not wait for congressional polarization to dissipate or for a more liberal Supreme Court to begin the arduous and necessary process of reining in the police. And we should not need to wait for the death of another unarmed Black man, like George Floyd or Eric Garner or Michael Brown or Walter Scott, to galvanize the public. There’s a lot that state and local governments can do now to improve policing in the United States.
809	2	Even as we remain vigilant against the coronavirus, we need not remain in a state of paralyzing hypervigilance. Returning to the sound basics of public health, continuing the progress of medical innovation and ratcheting back the societal anxiety around the pandemic could make us all a lot healthier.
922	5	While I’d like to keep an open mind about the future use of psychedelics in treating depression and other mental disorders, their purveyors in today’s unregulated environment raise serious concerns regarding safety and accountability. Caveat emptor.
274	7	If policymakers really want to prevent suicides like Mr. Slone’s as well as overdose deaths, addiction and pain must be treated with compassion and science, and the assumption that we can solve either problem merely by slashing the medical supply must end.
959	4	If progressive Democrats want to do more, they should demonstrate what Lincoln called “a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people.” If the people stand with them, Democrats will eventually — just not immediately — prevail.
898	3	“Prior to World War II, during a more multilateral era when the U.S. was one power jostling with others, American drug policy relied on taxes and tariffs, not crime and punishment,” Frydl writes. “We used to stop the drug flow through trade negotiations. It can work again.”
170	6	What does good pandemic policy look like for a low-trust, high-dysfunction society?
173	4	The persistence of donor-backed Republican hawkishness remains an obstacle to national development — of industrial capacity and widely shared solidarity — that would strengthen America’s defenses and ennoble its culture. The monsters that menace us don’t lurk abroad.
136	4	And by the way, around two-thirds of the people who graduate from regular community colleges leave without any debt. The figure at for-profit schools, at the most optimistic assessment, is around 17 percent. Come back, Jill Biden!
86	4	That next severe winter storm will come whether we plan for it or not. There’s no reason to cower in the dark when we can instead be a good neighbor and make money by investing in a better future.
41	4	I imagine I’m not the only one who found it harder to concentrate on a page during the past two years of Covid. As we slowly return to some semblance of normalcy, part of my “recovery” has been taking up deep reading again with a newfound joy and fervor. I soaked in Clint Smith’s “How the Word Is Passed” and Alan Jacobs’s “How to Think.” I’m now reading Natasha Trethewey’s “Memorial Drive” and Makoto Fujimura’s “Art and Faith.” I am feasting after a fast, drinking words down deeply after a time of drought. After these blank years of stress and sorrow, page after page is just waiting to be savored.
66	6	There is never a good time to lose someone like Walter Dellinger. It is especially gutting right now, as a turbocharged right-wing supermajority on the Supreme Court gears up to obliterate decades of precedent that had pointed the way, however imperfectly, toward a fairer, more equal and more inclusive America. But Mr. Dellinger, a fierce liberal who spent much of his life deep in the former confederacy, was always keenly aware of the forces he was up against. Thankfully he trained a generation of lawyers to think, and to fight, the way he did.
240	4	In fact, I can imagine Donald Trump — the ultimate scenario is in 2024, Donald Trump running against Joe Biden talking about how Biden betrayed the hero Zelensky and made a deal with the evil Vladimir Putin, who Trump would have treated more toughly. I can totally imagine that kind of insane reversal happening. So all of that’s to say, the Biden administration could do a good job generally, and this is a difficult enough problem that there might not be any political rewards for it.
545	2	And if after diligent planning, you still fail? In the view of Tish Harrison Warren, a Times Opinion writer, that’s just fine. “I’d argue that the chief value of resolutions is not found in our success or failure at keeping them,” she writes. “Instead, they help us reflect on what our lives are like, what we would like them to be like and what practices might bridge the difference. There is hope in the idea that we can change — that we can keep growing, learning and trying new things. This hope of renewal is the point of resolutions for me.”
968	2	Humility is a trait often in short supply among policymakers and economists. It’s absolutely essential now.
547	8	But for now, she’s like that massive traffic accident on I-95 in Virginia — inescapable, bone-chilling and, most of all, an enormous waste of our time.
783	9	And it needn’t diminish his presidency. George H.W. Bush accomplished more in four years than his successor accomplished in eight. Greatness is often easier to achieve when good policies aren’t encumbered by clever politics. Biden should think on it — and act soon.
560	5	Our debates about election reform this past year have been misdirected in ways that have rendered them more divisive than they have to be. By beginning from shared concerns and real dangers and from a proper understanding of the strengths of our system and not just its weaknesses, Congress can do better in the year to come.
986	3	So if you ask why monetary doves rule the Fed roost, it’s not just a matter of personalities — or ideology. The past couple of decades have highlighted the downsides of hawkishness, and the Fed doesn’t want to repeat what it now, quietly, views as past mistakes.
98	2	Now, he needs to find that voice by telling the story of the ordeal so many Americans have shared, honoring their resilience and painting a credible, realistic picture of how we can all reclaim control of our lives.
970	1	And we all have more experience with forgiving than we sometimes give ourselves credit for. If you’re looking for a 2021 holiday miracle, here’s a big one: At every dinner table, there are people who have managed to look past all kinds of wrongs, people who engage in a voluntary amnesty that marries an acceptance of our own flawed ordinariness and the truth that every last one of us is more than our most unjust behaviors. At every table, people are breaking bread, raising a glass, letting go.
218	2	We will start again — and we will start now.
439	9	Even lawmakers who hew to the straight and narrow understand that America is facing a crisis of faith in its political system and elected leaders. Lawmakers can obsess about making money once they leave office. Until then, they need to stay focused on the public interest — which includes taking steps to reassure the public that they aren’t all a bunch of corrupt, self-serving, money-grubbing, power-hungry crooks.
347	4	“My boy, my little boy, come home to us, my little boy,” she keened over the body. Tough cops dropped their heads, their faces wet with tears.
138	4	They also need to use their best judgment to estimate the level of public outrage if outbreaks occur in these settings — and balance that against continued dissatisfaction with mitigation measures. And then it’s up to all of us to hold these leaders accountable at the ballot box.
576	6	And that, if you ask me, is what real decadence looks like.
335	5	Back in November, Mr. Johnson was musing aloud about the fall of Rome. “When things start to go wrong,” he said, “they can go wrong at extraordinary speed.” He had no idea how right he was.
940	5	If Washington and its allies don’t organize a strong response, Mr. Xi will succeed in commanding the heights of future global power.
160	4	The real tragedy in Tennessee, and across the red states, is this existential threat to public education, which is the very foundation of a functioning democracy. And that’s where our outrage should lie — not at school boards whose decisions are formed by parental concerns that simply differ from our own.
748	2	Every wave of the pandemic has posed its challenges, but Omicron offers the vaccinated a preview of one of the more frustrating aspects of endemicity: regular breakthroughs.
288	2	Forgetting some of this fear will allow us to more clearly recall the details we want to remember. For me, those include the astonishing resilience, bravery and sense of collective spirit that emerged two years ago this week as my hometown became an epicenter of this pandemic. Those memories make me hopeful for the future.
411	4	Of course, the last thing a political scientist — or, for that matter, a liberal columnist — would tell you is that you should totally tune that noise out. It is depressing to live in a dying empire whose sclerotic political institutions have largely ceased to function; this is a collective problem without individual solutions. There’s an awful dilemma here. Any way out of the gloom of our current political situation will almost certainly involve even more politics.
626	5	What he really wants to do is end the Western alliance as we have known it since the Atlantic Charter. As for the United States, two decades of bipartisan American weakness in the face of his aggression has us skating close to a geopolitical debacle. Biden needs to stand tough on Ukraine in order to save NATO.
333	3	A lot of you wrote in last week to say that you have been a bit embarrassed about not understanding what cryptocurrency, NFTs and blockchain are exactly. That shame is not for regular people to carry. Speculative financial technologies like these derive a lot of their cultural power from being hard to define. Clear definition is usually a sign that an instrument is well regulated. As we will discuss next week, the ambiguity around what crypto is or how blockchain works or how to buy an NFT is part of what makes them seem “too big to fail.”
890	1	You can listen to the whole conversation by following “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts. View a list of book recommendations from our guests here.
908	7	The Jew as the stalking horse for anti-immigrant racism, as the voice of its normalization in public discourse, is a new, frightening development. The results of this are unforeseeable, but they bode no good.
823	8	What happens to abortion rights in the United States will continue to influence what happens to them elsewhere. Across Latin America, for example, the signals that the Supreme Court is sending in the Dobbs case will most likely energize local opposition to the recent wave of abortion law reforms there. In Brazil, my own country, where most abortions are a crime, restrictions may grow even more severe. More than ever, abortion rights must be viewed and bravely fought for as a transnational, interdependent and nonnegotiable feminist claim.
925	2	Thankfully, in rock ’n’ roll I’ve been proudly telling racists to go to hell for decades now, so I think I made the right choice.
978	1	Change is happening. At my hospital, our lung transplant team is working to identify recipients from underserved communities who can become “ambassadors” to educate others and build trust. Other centers are considering creative solutions, like volunteer programs to offer social support for patients who do not have their own. There’s also a push to rigorously track people who are disqualified from transplant to increase transparency around how nonmedical criteria affect various demographic groups. Perhaps most important, transplant teams are openly discussing and challenging their assumptions about who makes a “good” transplant candidate. And in doing so, more lives may be saved.
681	3	The #MeToo movement has shed light on the interlocking relationships that protect sexual predators. By speaking up, victims have sought to hold even the most powerful men to account. In the same vein, we can all do our part. If people intervene when they see or suspect abuse, this culture of complicity surrounding predators will begin to unravel. And that will amount to meaningful progress.
106	2	Jotham and I have a 6-year-old son now, and I still don’t quite know how to talk about how our relationship began. I suppose I’d say that I did something horribly unprofessional, that was definitely a fire-able offense. And that it was a brilliant mistake, one I will forever be grateful and relieved that I made.
504	6	Which of course we can’t. In this moment, when so much hangs in the balance, it’s a dangerous delusion.
198	4	Even if they understood each other better, their feud would still be impossible to resolve. Unlike sharp policy disagreements that can end in grudging compromises, Mr. Trump and Ms. Cheney see any concession in their feud as dishonorable. Mr. Trump cannot concede defeat in 2020, and thus Ms. Cheney cannot de-escalate her war against him. And because that’s true, Mr. Trump can’t ignore Ms. Cheney. They are wed to each other, captured by rival codes of honor that are remaking the American right.
966	1	I will be cooking Thanksgiving dinner again this year, a much smaller affair, just me and Mom. I’ll borrow the penknife from Danny and take my time cutting away the foil from the Martinelli’s bottle.
977	5	It’s time, we argue, for the government to modernize the nation’s internet privacy rules, and to do a far better job of safeguarding the internet’s youngest explorers from harm.
587	2	And that’s where the fun really begins.
831	6	While that isn’t quite how I would put it, it is true that the next mayor, Eric Adams, will inherit a city that is still recovering from a pandemic and that has real problems, including crime, homelessness and a mental health crisis. Also, no one should ever light a Christmas tree on fire, even if it is tacky.
101	4	And so the Games go on, in largely vacant stadiums where the few locals who manage to attend are prohibited from cheering, to avoid exhaling contagious particles. It makes me think of the request of a Japanese amusement park to guests at the beginning of the pandemic, which would be a worthy slogan for Beijing 2022: “Scream inside your hearts.”
355	6	For those of us who eagerly awaited the approval of vaccines for kids over 5, the timing of Omicron has been particularly cruel. For almost two years, many of us told our children that once they were vaccinated, they could reclaim many of the ordinary joys they’d had to sacrifice. Omicron postponed that reclamation. It shouldn’t be postponed a moment longer than necessary.
205	3	Testing and sequencing virus samples found in sewage or the air is not a singular solution; it is best used alongside other data sources to construct a broader, more holistic view of a pathogen’s spread across a community and around the world. But because it is the quickest way to detect variants, it can help leaders prepare for and potentially prevent the next coronavirus surge, and hopefully, the next pandemic.
387	3	It would require a much deeper analysis to understand how anthropological, cultural and historical contexts have played into the various response measures around the world and their effectiveness. But for now, we know that an effective, science-based message has helped Japan keep deaths lower compared to the numbers in peer countries and could be an example of how to move forward in a world where Covid-19 will always be with us.
703	3	Pakistan is simultaneously important and complicated. There is no magic bullet when it comes to reimagining a new policy, but the United States now has an opportunity to steer the relationship in a potentially more productive direction. Washington should give it a shot.
521	6	It’s a tall order. And even if such efforts manage to temporarily tamp down the situation, mutual suspicion will linger. The reason is simple: For as long as Mr. Putin holds sway, his grand design will never be far away.
637	6	If Putin’s plans A, B and C all fail, though, I fear that he would be a cornered animal and he could opt for plan D — launching either chemical weapons or the first nuclear bomb since Nagasaki. That is a hard sentence to write, and an even worse one to contemplate. But to ignore it as a possibility would be naïve in the extreme.
175	4	You’ve got to be intentional about that. I don’t want to force, “Hey, you have to do this.” I do want to force the intentionality of being open, honest, transparent and getting to know somebody that’s a little bit different than you are.
471	3	So far, then, we seem to be looking at an extraordinarily quick economic recovery from a devastating economic shock, coming at the cost of an unpleasant but probably temporary surge in inflation. And given what could have happened, that amounts to a policy triumph.
826	4	In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 entered a human population that had no immunity to it. In December 2021, the Omicron variant is entering a human population that has a large amount of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. That immunity in and of itself will lessen the disease severity of the variant. But in people with limited or compromised immunity, such as the unvaccinated, the elderly or the immune compromised, SARS-CoV-2 may still be able to cause severe disease because they don’t have protection conferred by pre-existing immunity. Covid-19 becoming a milder disease is not a decision the virus will make; it’s a decision that all of us can make if we take advantage of the vaccines that can control spread and reduce the burden of this disease.
222	5	Global integration and development since World War II have dramatically reduced famine around the world, but conflict remains a main driver of hunger and supply disruptions that can upend the security of nations. The international community should act now to keep food prices down and ensure that grain supplies reach vulnerable countries. We must take action to prevent hunger and famine from being used in the 21st century as a weapon of war in Ukraine and elsewhere.
604	3	Time, in other words, is the tribute a court pays to diversity. It’s an acknowledgment that five elite lawyers can never, and should never, be too sure that their vision of the law is right, and others wrong. There may be no way to stop the Supreme Court majority from having its way, but if Judge Jackson can help make sure it doesn’t happen all at once, she will have made the promise of her appointment real.
38	3	It’s also worth asking yourself who’s putting the pressure on for an immediate response. Perhaps it’s not the message sender, but you. A recent study found that we tend to overestimate how fast our colleagues expect a response for nonurgent work emails outside of work hours. So instead of beating yourself up for not getting back to someone right away, consider slowing down and letting yourself off the hook.
832	9	Sure, but the industry is also rife with scams and fly-by-night operators. Remember Mt. Gox? Congress needs to keep pressing ahead on this.
8	2	It wasn’t easy. But at his urging, I did the thing I thought I had mastered years ago, the thing that I have had to relearn in order to regain my lost equilibrium, in order to feel safe in the world once more. I did it in order to do the work I need to do, in order to take the next step forward. I stood.
133	4	After the national eviction moratorium ended in August, eviction filings began to tick up, and many state-level renter protectionshave fallen off the books. The Treasury must act now to prevent a potential wave of evictions in states where renters are struggling the most.
258	4	O’Leary cautions against declaring premature victory, even as many of us are happily shedding our masks in many situations. The virus has been unpredictable, and we may need to mask again some day. “Enjoy things while they’re low,” and get your kids vaccinated when they’re able to be, O’Leary said.
578	6	What would you call that? A slum.
934	4	The bottom line: “Do not take Omicron lightly, but don’t abandon hope either,” Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist, writes. “Our immune systems are incredible. None of this changes what you can to do right now: Ventilate spaces. Use masks. Test if you have symptoms. Isolate if positive. Get vaccinated. Get boosted.”
162	3	Looks like we’ve got our subject cut out for us for next week, Gail.
769	2	But that future is not assured. It must be created, and the Humane League, Mercy for Animals, the Good Food Institute, New Harvest and the Material Innovation Initiative are trying to do just that.
317	4	The pandemic might yet prove to be the disruption needed to trigger big political shifts, comparable with those triggered in the arena of jobs and work. So far, it seems to have driven people further into their corners. The next generation will have to find a way to fill in that hollowed-out middle, just as they will have to bridge the ever-growing chasms in wealth, which in turn drive so much of the political divide.
78	4	But a war with Ukraine would be different and not just because it has a fratricidal feel to it. Ukrainians, who sacrificed millions of lives to save the Soviet Union from the Nazis, are masters of partisan resistance. The conflict would be protracted, the victory Pyrrhic and the consequences for Russia as a nation disastrous. “Rus, whither are you speeding to?” Gogol writes in “Dead Souls.” It’s a good question.
833	1	I’ve also noticed that just as I know when Frankie isn’t enjoying a game, she can tell when I’m going through the motions. But when we play, say, Yoshi’s Crafted World or Mario Kart, we’re both present in a way that’s difficult to find in other parts of our very structured lives. And so my hope is that by playing video games with me at a young age, she will at least get used to the idea of a virtual life that still involves her old man.
313	4	As Hamlet said, the oppressor’s wrong.
48	3	Still, once you recognize the divisions that Young prophesied, you see them in some form all over, as a novel class war that constantly raises the old question: Which side are you on?
217	3	And the more we assume that prenatal diagnoses of Down syndrome will result in abortion, the more we will send a message to all our children that their worth depends on their ability to achieve. Instead of reinforcing structures that welcome only homogeneous bodies and minds as units of production, we need a system that supports and welcomes a diverse range of humans with their particular limits and struggles and gifts.
128	3	These nascent efforts pose a challenge for Mr. Trudeau, President Biden and every other leader searching for ways to restore a degree of normalcy while maintaining defenses against a disease that still has the power to fill hospitals and kill in large numbers. Effective leadership in this stage of the pandemic means finding ways to confront the understandable frustrations and legitimate protests engendered by the pandemic without stoking more strife, compromising the rule of law or succumbing to unreasonable demands. With populists like Mr. Trump primed to attack any Covid-19 action by the government as an assault on “freedom,” safely exiting the pandemic will be that much more treacherous. Allowing nonviolent, even if disruptive, protest is an important tool for maintaining social cohesion in a polarized society.
305	5	If we can do that, to save lives and ease suffering in the future, it will not make up for all the loss and hardship we have endured in the last two years. But we can at least say we did our best to learn from it, and let that be the one positive legacy of all this.
60	4	Nobody, she said, “has come out of the last two years unscathed. Everyone’s affected in some way. It’s just which direction do they choose to go.” And how far.
920	3	I have no idea what Omicron will bring, and very slight hopes that we’ll be able to exercise any effective form of control over it. But it shouldn’t be beyond asking that we stop being beastly to others. We are all riding out the same storm.
646	6	The contours of digital conflict are slowly emerging from the shadows, as digitally upgraded intelligence operations at the edge of war: espionage, sabotage, covert action and counterintelligence, full of deception and disinformation.
845	8	Democrats have a narrow window now to “recognize the existential threat not just to their party but to the country as a whole,” she said. “But if they don’t do that, then the ship is going to hit the iceberg.” And then we’re all sunk.
328	3	These might seem like utopian, even naïve, questions. But the history of Europe suggests otherwise. In dire circumstances, bold and creative thinking has produced a better, more humane world. It can happen again. Will anyone rise to the challenge?
589	1	“This is your birthday gift,” Tanya told her mother. “Your daughter and your grandsons survived.”
691	6	With King and Archbishop Tutu as our guides, we can reclaim moral ground and preserve our humanity while achieving the highest form of justice possible. Archbishop Tutu sweetly reverses the usual hierarchy of the West over Africa in colonial thinking when he argues for a conception of justice rooted in his beloved motherland. “Retributive justice is largely Western. The African understanding is far more restorative — not so much to punish,” he said, “as to redress or restore a balance that has been knocked askew.”
404	2	The one big advantage, though, even if you must move, is that homes are real assets. As such, they should maintain their real value during periods, like now, of high inflation.
962	7	Americans who carry high-risk mutations represent a large and vulnerable population, but their predicament is, in many ways, only the beginning. As genetic testing expands, doctors will gain the ability to make increasingly sophisticated risk predictions for larger groups of people. Health care policy must keep pace with the science. Health insurers should not be able to treat sisters differently on the basis of a genetic coin toss.
664	1	In his final interview with researchers at age 26, John said, “The most important things in life to me is my family and my relationship to God.”
536	1	I find myself consciously relaxing everywhere, anytime — in the checkout line at the supermarket, say, or while on hold with my insurance company. And now that I’m done singing the praises of relaxation, I suppose I’ll go off to relax right now.
228	4	Biden ought to send Zelensky the same message.
461	6	Reasonable people can disagree about how much aid the United States should give Afghanistan after two heartbreaking decades of blood and treasure. It is tempting to walk away entirely. But self-interest dictates that Americans think clearly about long-term costs. Small efforts now could avoid big problems later — such as another mass migration in Europe. They could also preserve a toehold in the country. The war has been lost, but that doesn’t mean every institution that Americans worked with is destined to disappear. There’s still time to save Afghanistan’s central bank.
528	4	What a difference a decade makes. National organizations like the Faith & Freedom Coalition and the Ziklag Group, which bring together prominent Republican leaders with donors and religious right activists, feature “Seven Mountains” workshops and panels at their gatherings. Nationalist leaders and their political dependents in the Republican Party now state quite openly what before they whispered to one another over their prayer breakfasts. Whether the public will take notice remains to be seen.
711	7	Like his Democratic predecessors, Mr. Biden needs to get tough.
645	3	This is not a simple problem. Our desire to punish Mr. Putin for the evil he has unleashed in Ukraine must be carefully balanced against the lives that will be lost the longer this war lasts, the real risks of military escalation, the long-term security needs of Europe and the second-order effects a new iron curtain might have on other parts of American foreign policy — such as U.S. security commitments in East Asia and the health of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. To meet this challenge, we must keep our policy firmly rooted in the “logic of consequence.” Americans living generations from now will be grateful that in this moment of crisis, our policy was guided by careful calculation instead of emotional reaction.
225	6	So conquest is a losing proposition. This has been true for at least a century and a half; it has been obvious to anyone willing to look at the facts for more than a century. Unfortunately, there are still madmen and fanatics who refuse to believe this — and some of them control nations and armies.
557	3	We strive to offer careful guidance when it comes to our own areas of expertise. Even so, some D.Y.O.R. enthusiasts may reject our cautions. If they do, we hope that they will nonetheless heed at least one piece of advice: If you are going to do your own research, the research you should do first is on how best to do your own research.
830	3	I asked a pastor what he says to people in pain. One thing he says is, “I want more for you.” I repeat that sentence to you not with any illusion that the world does what I want, but simply as an expression of good will, an acknowledgment of how we all sit with our common fragility, and a recognition that life is unpredictable. It changes. In many pilgrims’ progress, the slough of despond gives way to enchanted ground.
694	8	Happy New Year, all. Here’s to a more boring 2022.
518	2	Whether they saw Jan. 6 as “just another day” or like “the Civil War,” there was one abiding through line of unity between the groups: care and concern about the future of America, and uncertainty about what the 2024 presidential election would bring for our democracy — one of many issues that we’ll explore in future focus groups.
721	7	But leaders need to make sure people understand what a negative rapid test result means. You may not be infectious in that moment, but you may still have an infection and could be contagious later. It means you should still exercise caution to prevent spreading the coronavirus. If you want to maximize the benefits of rapid testing, take your test immediately before going out, not the day before.
971	3	That work is harder, and it’s slower, but maybe one day my clients will not be called “bodies.” Maybe they will be afforded the same dignity and deference given to Mr. Rittenhouse.
164	6	Would a new prime minister be able to heal the party after the alpha male antics of Boris Johnson? Has British politics become addicted to strident, provocative rhetoric and the emotional appeal of the big leader? Or is there, perhaps, even at this late moment, a way of walking back? That’s the dilemma confronting Conservative lawmakers right now. The answer they choose will echo far beyond the Tory Party itself.
736	4	Sorry, but no. America — not a senator who’s taking heat for a broken promise — is the victim in this story.
36	3	Boy, did this get dark. Happy Presidents’ Day, America.
149	3	The system isn’t perfect, but it’s certainly safer than it was a century ago. Freedom of expression remains intact and the market works, and it probably works even better. This gives us hope that a new strategy can emerge for combating today’s pseudoscience peddlers, just as one did for their predecessors.
406	2	An explanation that, like, floats the most boats the most handily is preferable.
18	5	This illusion was shattered this week as millions of Ukrainians woke up to sirens and explosions as Russian missiles hit critical targets across the country.
230	4	Manchin went on to say that “we must commit to once again achieving complete energy independence by embracing an all-of-the-above energy policy to ensure that the American people have reliable, dependable and affordable power without disregarding our climate responsibilities.” I do not claim to know what Manchin truly has in mind here or what he will vote for when the roll is called. But it is a door ajar, and Biden should step through it.
21	5	But it’s about more than Ukraine. It’s a contest between democracy and autocracy, freedom and dictatorship, whose implications will scatter across the world. It’s not our fight alone. So please don’t leave us alone to fight it.
442	6	Derek Major, writing for Black Enterprise, points to polling data on racial and sexual minorities’ investment in cryptocurrency. A lot of readers have sent me articles about how crypto is the new social justice movement. Most of those readers want me to debunk that narrative. I am not there just yet. But I am generally skeptical of any new tool that promises to solve centuries of systematic marginalization through loosely regulated consumer tools.
620	2	My child is going to have much bigger problems in her life than a lost library book — not to mention that a lost book is a tiny problem to have in a world where families are fleeing their homeland and losing everything overnight. She’ll probably handle some of her problems badly, as I have. But I have endured, and I have to have faith that my daughter will, too.
984	1	Clark, for her part, believes the best way to mix up Thanksgiving this year is to focus on the side dishes, “the heroes of the holiday table.” Her top three recipes at the moment are a cheesy potato gratin, roasted carrots and squash pizza. As she told Bloomberg, “Everyone will remember the Thanksgiving they got to have pizza.”
522	7	When your house is on fire, drop what you were doing, and put it out. Maybe finally Democrats will do that.
747	1	It wasn’t easy to find a landlord willing to rent to an Afghan refugee with nine children, so initially, the family moved into the church rectory. Eventually, volunteers from the church leaned on their own personal network and found a place for the family to live. The family had arrived with only two small suitcases, so volunteers had to procure everything from furniture to winter coats. They enlisted a local Afghan to help with translation and prepare a welcome meal. Mr. McVay walked the children to school on their first day. Others helped procure prayer rugs for the new family at the mother’s request. Mr. McVay said that it’s a way for parishioners at St. Raymond of Penafort to live out their faith of welcoming the stranger.
259	4	Consider this a glimpse into my process. If I don’t know, then I won’t write. And if you’ve noticed that I haven’t commented on something important in the news, you can reliably assume that I’m either uninterested in the subject or more interested in learning and listening than I am in speaking.
111	1	My husband’s bringing me my giant mug in the morning is an act of deep love and knowledge, but it is also mildly self-interested, in that it makes me less terrible for him to talk to. Acknowledging that all of our actions within a marriage have multiple, complicated motivations — and that that’s a good thing, because it means we are allowed the full breadth of humanity — might be the most romantic thing of all. Happy Valentine’s Day, I guess!
264	3	What will it be, Xi?
192	5	Lauri, 72, from Massachusetts: “Listening to Joe Rogan, which I do every once in a while, is a good thing. However, it is disturbing to hear him state misinformation. … Require him to have a bigger fact-checking team. Provide a simple way for experts and scientists to reach him. And above all, make sure everyone understands that they are listening to a guy shooting his mouth off with friends.”
431	7	But the status quo — in which the very tools available to get around the filibuster encourage policy uncertainty — is no recipe for sustained, consistent policy, either.
351	2	The challenge in scientific publication is to keep out all of the bad stuff while blocking none of the good stuff. It’s not easy. Fortunately, lots of smart people are tackling the problem.
395	6	Across the Great Green Wall there are communities that are already working together to eke out a living. Having hundreds of thousands of hectares of restored land, with trees, water and a thriving landscape, affords the chance to develop a more diverse and productive set of economic opportunities tailored to the different groups of people who live amid the wall. But regreening the Sahel will mean little if the gains will be reaped only by a lucky few.
319	5	But those leaders will still need real wisdom to navigate a new age of nuclear-power rivalry that will probably be quite different from the Cold War era, and at times more like the distant 19th-century past.
24	3	In the last few weeks, my congregation and I received an outpouring of love and support from strangers the world over. If we begin with that love of the stranger, but offer it not in response to violence, but encouraged by empathy, we might just change our world.
116	4	And while conventional economics isn’t always right, any people attacking it now should ask themselves whether they’re doing so in a constructive way. In particular, I’m seeing a lot of denigration of monetary policy from people who don’t seem to realize that they are, de facto, giving aid and comfort to politicians who don’t want to invest in America’s children and the fight against climate change.
485	7	We’re beyond calming platitudes, admonitions to do yoga and promises from politicians that there will be a reasonable fix during the Covid surges that are now predictable parts of our lives. “I think there was all of this fire and anger that the parents are blah, blah, blah and all this talk, and I think early on made us feel something might change,” said Ellie Erickson, a pediatrician and mom of two children under 4 in North Carolina. “And now it’s pretty clear that it absolutely isn’t.”
508	2	That’s the thing. You can always start over. And then, one day, what was once a goal is just your life. A life that’s different from the way it was, and hopefully, better.
329	3	When someone tells me that a book should no longer be read — or a film should no longer be screened or a painting hung or a play performed — because of some problematic history attached to the work or its creator, I think of the girl I was in 1980, discovering a truth I desperately needed to find, in just that moment, from a story that might or might not be true about a human being who might or might not be good. A human being who, I know now, was almost certainly both.
891	7	Will Justice Kavanaugh and those of his colleagues who glorify a recently manufactured version of the Second Amendment allow New York City to keep going its own way on gun safety in the name of “letting the people decide”? That’s about as likely as the chance that those very same justices will decide to keep the right to abortion on the books. In both cases, we know what they’re going to do. The only mystery is how they will explain it.
465	7	Still, at a time when Republicans denounce as destructive “socialism” any effort to make America less unequal, it’s worth knowing that the economy of France — which isn’t socialist but comes far closer to socialism than anything Democrats might propose — is doing pretty well.
301	5	Putin brought this humiliation on himself and on his country. Speaking as one who deeply admires so much in Russian culture, I think it is a great crime that a nation with so many paths to dignity and greatness chose the path that leads so viciously to degradation.
919	2	In today’s episode, Jane Coaston explores two opposing views on whether breaking up the company might help. Sarah Miller, the director of the American Economic Liberties Project, argues Meta engaged in anticompetitive practices by buying its rivals. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, is a champion of big business who lauds Meta as an “antimonopoly” engine.
663	5	Slower growth, weak stock markets, a tougher housing market, stagflation and possibly a recession may be on the horizon. But that is the price we must pay for bad fiscal and monetary policies as well as a meritorious effort to keep Ukraine from Russian domination.
279	2	But our genetic code is just where it all starts. Dr. Zatz’s neighbors both did well, ultimately. The man recovered while the woman still has not been infected, at least not symptomatically. Was this because of their genes? Scientists might never know. Ultimately, our genes are just one piece of the impossibly complex story of this virus, a story that we will tell and retell in the years to come.
672	1	If you like these pieces, there are two fantastic aggregator sites that bring terrific essays to my email inbox every week. The first is The Browser, founded by Robert Cottrell, which links to quirky, profound, philosophical, literary and just plain fascinating pieces of writing. The second is Recommended Reading by Conor Friedersdorf, which lands every Sunday morning with links to essays that range from the latest advances in science to the deeper problems in our public sphere. I’m grateful to Robert and Conor for helping me find Sidney nominees and for generally raising the quality of the stuff that goes in our brains.
861	5	This is all for the future. For now, we can say with surety and surprise, history will record that any of this was possible in 2022 because of a very unexpected figure, our 45th president.
949	10	The audacious position taken by these New York public defenders should give pause to anyone tempted to understand, and maybe even discount, the Rittenhouse and McMichael defenses as essentially conservative arguments playing to conservative juries in conservative states. If we start to think of guns only as a problem in the hands of the Other (white supremacists, the far right, criminals), we will miss the simple fact that unregulated guns escalate violence across ideological lines. Their presence tends to create a need for self-defense on both sides of the trigger, about which the law has very little to say. If Mr. Rosenbaum and Mr. Arbery did indeed reach for those guns, weren’t they, no doubt, acting in self-defense? More guns, no matter in whose hands, will create more standoffs, more intimidation, more death sanctioned in the eyes of the law.
799	4	In this conversation, Kara Swisher discusses the perverse relationship between personal wealth and climate survival. They chat about sulfur guns, earth suits and the need to ramp up the space race for human survival. And they lament that politics and sluggish government action to rein in climate change may mean human survival will be left to the benevolence of future “carbon capture trillionaires.”
163	5	This particular dust-up won’t be a decisive battle in the struggle for a better America and a better planet; in fact, there may not be any decisive battles, just a long series of skirmishes that must be engaged by the young but also by the old. We may be nearer the exit than the entrance, but we’re in this fight for the long haul.
171	6	That’s not a heroic view of how democracies are stabilized and demagogues finally retired. But if the choice is between this unheroism and the mentality that gave us Jeff Zucker and the brothers Cuomo, for now I’m inclined to bet on Susan Collins.
71	8	But it is a rare elite that is willing to think in the long term. Most, like those all across Europe in the aftermath of the plague, instead choose to hold more tightly to what they have, to try to keep a lid clamped on the shared prosperity of others — and by clutching everything to themselves, in the end will push their nations into crisis and be left with nothing but riot, mourning, fear, flame and misery.
297	5	Then I looked around the train car, trying to enlist the help of other riders. But they all shuffled their papers or stared into their phones. Nobody met my eye.
850	5	The coronavirus has sickened nearly 50 million Americans and killed over 788,000. New mutations continue to appear, and the winter’s chill will bring flu season along with it. Personal choice cannot be an acceptable reason to endanger other people. With cases and deaths continuing to rise and antivirals in short supply, time is not on our side. A widespread vaccine mandate may be the only thing that can save our hospitals and our patients.
189	4	What’s more, the rules need to apply to everyone. This may seem like common sense, but in too many cases, companies look the other way for high performers or senior management. High-profile scandals garner the headlines, but less visible pairings are far more common. Office romances have existed ever since offices were invented. It’s about time offices figured out how to deal with them.
639	5	We will remake Russia, of course, slowly and patiently, just like the generation before us. But not before this one crumbles first.
112	4	Stephen Dedalus, Joyce’s self-portrait, captures our incomprehensible politics in a remark that burns brighter than ever: “History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.”
846	1	That, sadly, didn’t come to pass. But thanks to Mr. Jackson’s masterpiece, we can watch the band play together again, offering an inspirational peek into what made the Beatles the greatest pop-culture creative force of them all.
255	3	Compared to this type of practical problem-solving, “black” or “Black” just isn’t as interesting.
287	5	In an essay he posted on Monday, “The Nuclear Threat Is Back,” Mohamed ElBaradei, the recipient of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize and the former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, argues that “beyond the bloodshed and needless destruction, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also increased the risk of radiation leaks and even nuclear war” — events, it is almost needless to say, that would create mind-boggling suffering, throw current electoral calculations into disarray and raise the stakes of every political decision we make.
773	8	At the beginning of the pandemic, when social distancing came into force, a lot of the journalists interviewing me about my book asked about the importance of touch, now that it was being taken away from us. My answer was that distance would make us a little more cynical. We humans need to touch and be touched; we don’t know how to love without it. Distance makes us cold; it makes us care less about one another. I have spent half my life struggling against this coldness, and I know how much effort and self-awareness it takes not to end up turning into a raging little Stalin. I can’t not be a monster, but I can control my tendency to bite and lash out.
772	7	Finally, democratic judging recognizes that deliberating over the meaning of laws is part of how courts participate in the democratic process. Using some preferred method of interpretation to yield an implausibly unequivocal correct answer is not enough. We should expect judges to give us reasons to agree that their interpretation is the best one for society.
14	4	As Americans enter this new phase of the pandemic, mitigation efforts like masking, testing and avoiding gatherings will remain important tools to manage the spread of the disease, especially when there’s threat of another surge. Changing the way we use these tools — when to pull them out and when to put them away — is a critical part of managing a pandemic effectively. The C.D.C.’s new guidance does just that by focusing on the metrics that matter most at this point in the pandemic.
463	3	Personally I like these schools. I think they produce amazing research and education. I interview economics professors from the 568 group just about every week and I even attended one of the defendants (Go Big Red!). But I think the schools need to brace themselves for a world where they face the same antitrust scrutiny as anyone else. On that score, the issues are remarkably similar to those in the Supreme Court’s decision in June that the N.C.A.A. could not ban relatively modest payments to student-athletes. In that case as in this one, schools argued that competition would be ruinous. But is it?
17	3	But an argument about relative magnitudes isn’t the same as a fight over fundamentals. At this point, as I see it, there’s far more consensus about inflation among serious thinkers than many people, including some of the participants in this debate, may realize.
85	6	Now it’s time for bugs. Whether you regard them as agents of filth or sources of nutrition, integrating more of them into your diet, this video argues, is among a suite of dietary changes that we urgently need to consider to deal with food insecurity, biodiversity loss and climate change.
72	3	On the plus side, in this troubled age of mega-decibel ideological shrieking, it’s kinda soothing to see everybody behaving like the sneaky, pragmatic back-room pols of yore. I know that’s a pretty desperate reaching for good cheer. But we do what we can.
689	3	The choice is ours. But I think I know what Private Cooperberg would have us do.
33	3	But the climate surrounding higher education was so different due to the legislature and all of that stuff. I think that when higher education gets connected to the advancement of racial minorities and women and people of color, I think that it becomes more open to attack. I think you’re right. I don’t know. I think it’s complicated. But I think there’s something to it.
993	7	If there is any hope that last week’s not-guilty verdict might do any good, might bridge the divide so many seem to prize and which every day gets an assist from the press, it is that we realize we need not continue this battle, that we can make Mr. Rittenhouse the last example of this particular war. Some on the right have sought to valorize Mr. Rittenhouse with in-your-face theatrics. Yet there has been little to no violence since the verdict; protests in Kenosha have been peaceful. I hope that this might be the moment we admit that our fear of the other birthed the events we claim to despise, that we created them and they have brought misery, and that we might now summon the courage and curiosity to look toward one another and say, we see how this happened, what can we make happen next?
