564	8	Above all, we should stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren’t serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously? The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger.
93	4	The path toward solving the disinformation problem should go toward broadening access to education and fixing income inequality instead of trying to persuade tech companies to remove a few notorious accounts. The focus should be not so much on how Big Tech acts but more on trying to create a resilient public that can spot truly harmful disinformation. This will require a relatively narrow but functional definition of what disinformation entails. One clear dichotomy: We should think about how to educate the public effectively about vaccines, but we should avoid the temptation to ascribe all political difference to the brainwashing of everyone who disagrees with us. The more disinformation is used as a bludgeon to beat down everything we don’t like, the less we will understand how it actually influences people’s thoughts.
185	5	Put simply, the people and institutions behind the bans on “critical race theory” are fighting a rear-guard action, and they know it.
598	7	No one should have to choose between their devotion to their spouse and their duty to the nation. But Justice Thomas has shown himself unwilling or unable to protect what remains of the court’s reputation from the appearance of extreme bias he and his wife have created. He would do the country a service by stepping down and making room for someone who won’t have that problem.
563	1	I want to try something in this list that is hard for me and to try something that fills me with hope and possibility. As we begin 2022, these friends inspire me and dare me to believe that things can be made new — even me, even us.
181	7	The ugly freedoms in American politics today increasingly justify minority rule, prejudice and anti-democratic governance. If we don’t push back against their growing popularity, we will have ceded what freedom means to those who support monopolistic rule and furthered the country’s downward slide toward authoritarianism. Creating and supporting democratic alternatives to ugly freedom, both in legislatures and on the streets, are urgent tasks for all who value equality, community health and the shared power to construct a free society that truly values all its members.
650	6	We should all want to end this senseless war, protect Ukraine and avoid nuclear catastrophe. The hard part is striking the right balance. To reduce Russia’s leverage in the future, we must face the fact that nuclear weapons are more useful to Mr. Putin than they are to the West. The bomb is a weapon of terror, pure and simple, and we must do all we can to keep it in check.
235	6	We’re not going back, though, to the old normal, despite some employers’ desire to do so. “Between the Great Resignation and the talent wars, we can’t go back to a broken system that was never built for us,” said Saujani. She added that our workplaces need to “stop trying to fight back to the old way when it wasn’t working.” Employers have an unusual opportunity to change the culture, she said, and they should take it.
28	4	“Is this potentially a problem for people with addictive personalities who may be prone to gamble?” he asks. “Perhaps. But welcome to America, where the economy is designed by multinational corporations to suck every last dollar out of the pockets of working folks. How about all those ads with cute groundhogs selling lottery tickets?”
614	8	She deserves better than this.
469	3	Mayor Adams has a chance to create a legacy of making New York safer and more affordable. New Mannahatta can help ensure that the city thrives in the 21st century.
339	4	Only when we disentangle the concepts of whiteness and maleness from the concept of power can we see the damage the association has done. Only then can we truly accept and celebrate the power of inclusion, diversity and equity. Only then can representative democracy in a pluralistic society begin to live up to its ideals.
627	3	The party that is able to express the values of a multiethnic working class will be the majority party for the next generation. As we continue to watch the country’s culture war increasingly divided by education levels, it is quite likely that Latino voters will continue to trend, even if marginally, into the ranks of Republican voters. The country stands on the precipice of a significant political shift. As President Ronald Reagan once quipped, quoting a Republican nominee for sheriff, “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party; the Democratic Party left me.”
805	3	Even as we remain vigilant against the coronavirus, we need not remain in a state of paralyzing hypervigilance. Returning to the sound basics of public health, continuing the progress of medical innovation and ratcheting back the societal anxiety around the pandemic could make us all a lot healthier.
638	3	Right now, with the kind of antagonistic political binary we’ve set up, none of that is happening. So one underrated thing that I think a whole life approach really helps us to do is have actual disagreements — real, authentic disagreements, getting to the real nub of the matter instead of dismissing each other across this antagonistic binary.
553	8	Jan. 6 demonstrated that the choice the country now faces isn’t one between disruptive changes to our political system and a peaceable status quo. To assume that choice is to indulge the other big lie that drew violence to the Capitol in the first place. The notion that the 18th-century American constitutional order is suited to governance in the 21st is as preposterous and dangerous as anything Mr. Trump has ever uttered. It was the supposedly stabilizing features of our vaunted system that made him president to begin with and incubated the extremism that turned his departure into a crisis.
551	3	These lives threaten the communal narratives currently in place. But what is a threat to some can be to others a glimmer of a new world coming.
1	4	Perhaps that’s the upside to so many terrible public apologies: the urge to better apologize in our own lives.
354	7	As we learn from new data and new methods, it is paramount that we keep the truth of their essential humanity at the forefront of our efforts. We must have awareness, care and respect, lest we recapitulate the objectification of the slave trade itself. It is possible, after all, to disturb a grave without ever touching the soil.
896	6	And I hope the rest of us haven’t lost the ability to be properly horrified at this spectacle.
365	6	From France’s “yellow vest” protests to Kazakhstan’s recent unrest over fuel price hikes, it is increasingly clear that if climate ambition comes into tension with energy reliability or affordability or the security of energy supplies, climate ambition will lose. As energy prices soar, preparing for crises in which state-controlled energy suppliers are able to exert outsize geopolitical and economic clout must be a priority for Western leaders.
496	5	The point, then, is that while there are real economic issues associated with cryptocurrencies, their rise has a lot to do with the broader political madness that has American democracy on the brink.
423	2	And the rest is history.
516	4	Looking at the inflation measurement issue, I was reminded of a line from my former teacher Charles Kindleberger about the balance of payments (a subject nobody discusses anymore, but that’s a story for another day): “The existence of a variety of balance-of-payments definitions makes it possible for an observer always to be grave, or optimistic, according to his temperament.” Well, for the next few months inflation will be like that — and I, at least, will try to keep reminding myself not to emphasize only the numbers I like.
856	10	I’m not entirely sure why this has happened; the degradation probably began decades ago, maybe as early as the Vietnam years. But there’s no question that it has happened. At this point there are no grown-ups left on one side of the political aisle.
567	8	That’s right. The technology is here. We can now put Putin over a barrel. It is just a matter of leadership and national will. What are we waiting for?
583	1	But there are days when we leave the trails exhilarated, having seen something extraordinary or beautiful. Once, on a familiar trail, a small flood the week before left a new waterfall behind. Once we came across a natural pool where 100 baby frogs, each one as small as a thumbnail, were gleefully trying out their new legs. And my children swear they found a Bigfoot track once. (I cannot confirm this sighting.) It’s always a risk heading out to the trail, which is why I’m glad it’s a habit that we formed. So I hope we keep this up, even now, when it’s more safe to be inside with other people again.
373	6	I don’t know. I don’t have a lot of hope that this will go smoothly. But the frightening possibilities suggest the importance of seemingly abstract inquiries into the nature of reality under V.R. We should start thinking seriously about the possible effects of virtual worlds now, long before they become too real for comfort.
492	7	“Without a strategic plan for the ‘new normal’ with endemic Covid-19, more people in the United States will unnecessarily experience morbidity and mortality, health inequities will widen, and trillions will be lost from the U.S. economy,” they write. “This time, the nation must learn and prepare effectively for the future.”
57	5	Conservative censors and their allies see, in the present moment, an opportunity to reshape society to their liking and squelch the views of those who disagree. It is up to those of us who believe in the First Amendment and free speech to take a stand for American liberty, while we still can.
436	5	So here’s my suggestion: Give Biden and his people a break on their antitrust crusade. It won’t do any harm. It won’t get in the way of the big stuff, which is mostly outside Biden’s control in any case. At worst, administration officials will be using inflation as an excuse to do things they should be doing in any case. And they might even have a marginal impact on inflation itself.
210	6	Where the rubber meets the road for Spotify is a market backlash, a principled stance from bigger names like Taylor Swift, as some have suggested, or a slew of artists, not the trickle we’ve seen so far. So, for now, Mr. Rogan is untouchable and our health is at risk.
574	3	Each party is therefore left pursuing a losing strategy and saved from disaster only by the fact that the other party is doing the same. The first to realize that this is not working will face a real opportunity. The party that grasps that it has been losing for a generation will have a chance to make itself the next big winner in our politics.
796	4	As this project makes clear, climate change is already underway. At this point, we can’t stop it. But we can all work to limit the damage. We must.
531	5	The regime won another round. Whether it learned any of the lessons of Trumpian democracy is a different question.
132	2	The big question about Facebook’s massive V.R. bet is whether it can rekindle the company’s early innovative spirit. Facebook has coasted so long on other people’s inventions that it’s really hard to see where it goes now that its mimeograph machine is jammed. Perhaps it’s time for a new inspirational corporate slogan: Move fast — and make things.
828	6	At the summit, heads of state from around the world emphasized the importance of a free press for democracy. They’re quite right: Without access to trustworthy independent news, populations are left in the dark, governments grow corrupt and democratic institutions soon become a sham. But it will take more than speeches — or indeed Nobel Prizes — to save independent journalism. It will take a plan and a new more equal partnership between practitioners and their supporters in the prosperous North. It will take a renewed sense of mission. It will also take hard cash.
524	4	Yet most of Marche’s narratives seem more imaginable than a future in which Jan. 6 turns out to be the peak of right-wing insurrection, and America ends up basically OK. “It’s so easy to pretend it’s all going to work out,” he writes. I don’t find it easy.
758	1	A mutual aid community will make your corner of the world better this holiday season. Giving to the Night School Bar, the Carter G. Woodson School or Mother Health International will increase their capacity to provide vital services to others. Happy holidays and conscientious giving to you all.
802	2	We should worry about whether or not we are at an inflection point for an age of regression.
392	5	Mr. Biden has promised that Russia “will pay a heavy price” if any Russian troops cross Ukraine’s borders. If Mr. Putin invades Ukraine with no punitive action from the West and the rest of the international community, beyond financial sanctions, then he will have set a precedent for future action by other countries. Mr. Putin has already factored additional U.S. financial sanctions into his calculations. But he assumes that some NATO allies will be reluctant to follow suit on these sanctions and other countries will look the other way. U.N. censure, widespread and vocal international opposition, and action by countries outside Europe to pull back on their relations with Russia might give him pause. Forging a united front with its European allies and rallying broader support should be America’s longer game. Otherwise this saga could indeed mark the beginning of the end of America’s military presence in Europe.
5	8	The stakes couldn’t be higher. If progressive prosecutors and professional Democrats fail to execute a coordinated approach that blends effective, targeted law enforcement with robust social policies, violence will continue to rise. Persistent fear might lead to a clamor for aggressive policing and incarceration. If that happens, professional Democrats might find themselves once more in a political wilderness, and all the marching in the streets and voting for reformers in defense of Black lives would have been for naught.
746	1	The world is often a dark, scary place, but your generosity can provide light and hope. What better gift is there than that?
623	5	The Biden administration urgently needs to telegraph strength. An Iran deal that leaves us even weaker and meeker than the previous deal accomplishes the opposite at a moment when we can’t afford another reversal.
854	8	Is that what we remain now? Or have we forgotten — much as we’ve all but forgotten Pearl Harbor?
675	1	I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall on Tuesday after his death, listening to John’s conversation with those greats, with other coaches like Don Shula and Bill Walsh. John was definitely blessed with a unique gift when it came to football, and the impact he had on the game and on all of those who love it will live on for generations.
275	7	The future of American democracy in the cheap speech era is hardly ensured. We don’t have all the solutions and can’t even foresee political problems that will come with the next technological shift. But legal and political action taken now has the best chance of giving voters the tools to make competent decisions and reject election lies that will continue to spew forth on every platform that can be built to threaten the foundation of our democracy.
937	1	Still, I applaud the effort to use U.S.-Europe differences as a tool for understanding where we are and where we’re going.
361	3	Young — and whoever is next — needs to think hard about how he can find other homes beyond the big platforms and support them with the gift of his music and allow his work to last into eternity. After all, I heard, rock ’n’ roll can never die.
591	1	Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and serve warm, with tartar sauce or hot sauce if desired.
352	7	John Adams and his colleagues didn’t heed her warning, but we can. And that means treating the Constitution not as a sacred text from another era, but as an adaptable framework for an ever-growing and changing society. The founders expected this. They knew they were far from perfect, and they intended their creation to be updated on a regular basis, even if they failed to anticipate how polarized the country would become. That polarization may seem like an intractable fact of modern life, but remember: 40 percent of the Constitution we live under in 2022 consists of amendments. That is to say, the American people — those living today and those yet to come — are the authors of the Constitution no less than the founders are. It is not their document anymore, if it ever was. It is ours.
526	6	What works better is a broad tolerance for all forms of speech, including misinformation, since that comes with the right to correct and criticize people who spew harmful lies. Cheering on the dismissal of toxic politicians, celebrities and thinkers, and arguing that private companies like Twitter can do whatever they want so long as they can produce the right ToS, give social media companies license to do just that: whatever they want.
414	2	The English historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote, “The imagined community of millions seems more real as a team of eleven named people.” Watching these Afcon matches, played by these prodigal migrants, international superstars and talented youngsters together, makes Mr. Nkrumah’s vision of the continent seem real, or at least possible.
237	4	Every chink in the armor of racial and gender exclusion produces outsize opposition precisely because of its potential to destabilize existing norms and systems. Judge Jackson surely recognized this when she honored Judge Motley in last week’s news conference announcing her nomination, when she stated that she shares Judge Motley’s commitment to equal justice under law. There will be inspiring moments, and there will be ugly and unwarranted attacks during Judge Jackson’s confirmation hearing. But she will be confirmed. And something on the court, and in our expectations of it, will change.
892	3	None of this is happening behind closed doors. We are headed for a crisis of some sort. When it comes, we can be shocked that it is actually happening, but we shouldn’t be surprised.
552	5	That’s a problem that can’t be legislated away. It can be resolved only by the parties themselves committing that demagogy will stop at the election’s edge. Until that happens, American democracy will be in crisis, no matter what laws we pass to protect it.
204	4	For my part, I will begin by telling my own story differently — by discarding that fashionable old fable that reduces any tale of success to one of grit and diligence. I will admit that, to be frank, it was an easier time, and things were better. Our institutions were better. Perhaps that is what the story is about, inasmuch as it is about anything. There is the one thing I learned when I cashed that check: that people cannot always be resilient, but a country can.
789	10	When a woman is pregnant and doesn’t want to be, the right to abortion is fundamental. When a woman wants to prevent becoming pregnant, the right to contraception is fundamental. Both rights are inextricable from each other, both face opposition, and both are nonnegotiable pieces of a free life for anyone with a uterus. Which is exactly why they’re both controversial.
12	4	“There were times in the past few years that I felt like soon normal life will return,” my aunt told me on Friday, as Russian troops moved toward Kyiv. “But now I know it won’t.”
232	2	So far the Biden administration has met the test of this war’s outbreak quite impressively, both in rallying support for Ukraine and in letting events unfold to our benefit organically without taking outsize risks. But those benefits are provisional, contingent on how the war ends and what kind of peace follows — and those tests are yet to come.
514	2	Now, whenever I face a roadblock, or even my own doubts, I remember the phrase that my “dinner dad,” maybe one of America’s dads, etched in my memory: “But I really want it.”
172	4	But as long as we have the Electoral College, the process needs to be as clear and as foolproof as possible. Making it so will not guarantee that things run perfectly. After all, a political movement that is categorically unwilling to accept electoral defeat can do a lot of damage. But just because we can’t plan for everything is not an excuse to do nothing. When you make the perfect the enemy of the good, you get neither.
174	3	So, bosses of the world, please learn from Mr. Johnson’s blunders. Office parties are not for you. They are for you to fund, certainly, but after a few sips of warm champagne, you should leave your employees and let them carry on.
662	1	“It’s a lightweight straw,” Mr. Knope said, “but it’s also a very encumbered camel.”
403	2	I didn’t put it on a wire hanger.
592	3	It may just take time, effort from pediatricians and trusted community members, and the release of vaccines for younger kids before more parents are reassured. This is supported by the number of older kids who’ve been vaccinated, with 61 percent of parents saying their 12-to-17-year-olds have received at least one vaccine dose as of January, compared to 49 percent in November, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But as the months tick by, the information remains muddled and the efficacy appears less than fantastic, I have growing concerns about a smooth vaccine rollout among the majority of little ones.
607	5	So my message for those intoning dire warnings about the return of ’70s-type stagflation — which some of them have been itching to do for years — is that they should look at their history more carefully. The inflation of 2021-22 looks very different, and much easier to solve, from the inflation of 1979-80.
629	5	The goal, plainly, is empire. And the line will not be drawn at Ukraine.
868	2	But it is not yet the time for celebration. Tennessee has set its next two execution dates, the first since the pandemic began. Alabama’s new nitrogen gas execution protocol is complete, and Oklahoma’s next execution is set for Thursday.
720	8	Mr. Garland has long been a highly principled public servant focused on doing the right thing. But only by holding the leaders of the Jan. 6 insurrection — all of them — to account can he secure the future and teach the next generation that no one is above the law. If he has not done so already, we implore the attorney general to step up to that task.
315	5	And this virus is not going away; there will be more surges. And there will be other pandemics. Our system has proved to be unprepared to deal with them. Investing in rebuilding sources of information is the only way forward.
44	2	And the arc of the unbecoming plot thankfully does not bend toward doom. Indeed, redemption of a different kind awaits the woman who makes space in her life for less conventional priorities. Sam finds it in friendship, and in the community of theater nerds and L.G.B.T.Q. folks at Joel’s weekly “choir practice.”
480	2	Medical providers need to help their immunocompromised patients make challenging decisions for their daily lives by gauging and mitigating their risk. But we need the tools and guidance to do so. Only with a better understanding of the science, and clarity from health authorities, do we have any hope of protecting our vulnerable friends, family members and neighbors and allowing them to live fully.
30	5	So here’s a plea to my fellow wonks: Evaluate economic ideas on their merits. You don’t want to endorse bad policies because they’re popular, but you don’t want to reject policy ideas simply because they are popular, either.
750	2	Even though Hong Kong people are silenced, they persist in their passion to stand up for democracy.
501	2	His place in the history books, however, is secured. He will forever be the libertine whose pursuit of personal freedom and “control” saw his countrymen robbed of theirs.
379	5	We must embrace the reform we can achieve — and continue the fight for the important reform work of the future.
905	2	And some not at all. I never rise to the occasion. So this is an apology as well as a thank-you. Right now I’m taking more from my little corner of the world than I’m putting into it. But I get the sense that no one around me is keeping score. That’s the big-heartedness I’m talking about.
860	7	The point here is not to write an exhaustive explanation of what happened among Hispanic voters in the 2020 presidential election. The point is that our constant battles over language are more distracting than not. The whys of American politics have much more to do with the ever-changing currents of race, religion and economic production than they do with political messaging. And no message, no matter how strong on the surface, will land if it isn’t attentive to those forces and the other forces that structure the lives of ordinary people.
533	1	You might worry that stocks are headed for a fall if a handful of companies have been disproportionately responsible for the market’s advance. It’s true that since April, the cap-weighted index has outperformed the equally weighted index, thanks, in particular, to gains by Alphabet (parent of Google), Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. But for 2021 as a whole, there’s no difference. The stock market doesn’t look more top-heavy than usual. (Whether it’s fairly valued is a separate question.)
167	3	We called in her adult children and told them that their mother was dying. They cried and questioned, and I asked myself whether I should have waited, but they ultimately understood. If there was no way that doctors and nurses could make their mother better, then they would focus on her comfort. They gathered by the bedside. We waited for a chaplain. And late that night, in the last of our many rituals, a nurse disconnected my patient from the ventilator, ensuring she had enough medications so that she would not struggle. It was a final act of compassion, at once for the patient, her family and for us, too.
797	2	Bret: Always good to remember that soon the days will start getting a little bit longer and that another joyful year of arguing lies ahead.
110	5	One thing I’d like you to consider, and this is something I will return to in the future, is the extent to which racial distinctions and racial divisions are rooted in relationships of class, labor and property, even when they take on a life and logic of their own. And if that’s true, I would like you to think about what that means for unraveling those divisions and distinctions, and consigning the ideology of “race” to the ash heap of history.
520	7	The arguments on Friday — and the broader trends of which they are a symptom — underscore why it would be worth revisiting the other part of Roosevelt’s court reform plan. Reasonable minds will differ as to exactly which cases should go to such panels, but it’s increasingly clear that many should — and that the increasingly manic status quo is unhealthy, unwise and, from the courts’ perspective as well as ours, unsustainable.
679	2	The publisher looked at me with a surprised expression. “A column!” he exclaimed. “What would you write about?”
449	7	This may not be the presidency Biden prepared for, but it’s the one he got.
88	6	That’s where America was with slavery. That’s why our actual Civil War has been called the impending crisis. I’m not sure there’s anything in American society right now that plays the same role that the conflict over slavery did. Whatever our current challenges, whatever our current divisions, I do not think the United States is where it was in 1860. We have enough problems ahead of us already without having to worry about war breaking out here.
383	6	The right solutions aren’t quick, easy or conducive to political touchdowns. But they will make New York a safer, healthier and more humane place to live, work and visit. With new leadership at City Hall, in Albany and at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, New York has an opportunity to get this right. A weary city is waiting.
755	1	Finally, I’m a huge fan of A Better Balance, a legal organization that works to protect and advance the rights of workers who are also caregivers. It has a free and confidential legal help line in English and Spanish that helps workers understand their rights. The Center for WorkLife Law does similar and important work.
690	5	For all their specific differences, these politicians share a project: to fortify national resentments, at the expense of continental cohesion. If successful, they could conceivably end the Western model of liberal democracy as we know it. And unless it can settle its nervous sovereignty into democratic collaboration, Poland may have shown the way.
794	1	These problems will only get worse without a meaningful intervention that requires the full attention of federal, state and local governments. But on a personal level, a contribution either to NAUDL or any of the local UDL chapters would help give more kids the opportunity to learn all the vital skills that debate teaches.
719	6	Forget resilience. Forget silver linings. Right now, it’s time to decide: How do we mourn everything we’ve lost? Once we do that, hopefully at some point, we can attempt something even harder: moving on.
561	2	In this past year of profound loss and grief, it is hard to find comfort. No matter how many philosophers or theologians seek the answers, the meaning of death remains a mystery. And yet silence in the face of this mystery is not an option for me, as it wasn’t for my father, perhaps because we know that, while we may find solace in our rituals, it is also in the seeking that we must persist.
375	6	Let the games begin.
177	4	The biggest takeaways right now should be: First, Covid vaccine efficacy is not a binary “works” or “doesn’t work” — it’s looking more like an ascending scale of protection. Second, nothing has happened yet. Authorization hasn’t occurred but when it does, ideally, the data that it’s based on will be public by the time shots are actually getting shipped for the littlest children, so we can see for ourselves. And third, kids of all ages having regular contact with a trusted pediatrician is among the best things parents provide for their own health and their families’ health.
680	3	Many of the Democrats’ problems in the legislative process are not of their own making. But, fairly or not, Democratic leaders will need to think differently about how power flows through their coalition if they want to see their successes in electoral politics turn into policy achievements.
424	5	Most of what has happened to Mr. Biden has been very normal. But if Democrats take their own fears about the opposition party seriously, they should be very worried about the consequences of the normal cycle of overreach and backlash, and try harder to surprise the country by doubling down on normalcy.
413	2	I cannot help thinking about sweetness born of the violence of slavery as a metaphor for New Orleans, which is a cradle holding together the South and its strands at the root. Like its native drink, a Sazerac, it’s sweet and strong enough to knock you out. And, of course, as often as people try to cut it off from the rest of the South, it functions like a phantom limb, one that we feel everywhere, even when we don’t see it right there on us. The graves in New Orleans sit aboveground because of potential flooding. And so the dead are raised and decorated with stunningly bright mausoleums and abundant flowers. The spirits hear the music and might be swaying, too.
816	1	Even if employers are able to mitigate labor shortages, growing anti-work sentiment and widespread voluntary unemployment among members of Generation Z suggest that the character of work will continue to change. During the Great Resignation, employers have managed to retain some blue- and white-collar workers with higher wages, flexible hours and remote work options. In the event of a prolonged labor shortage, more sweeping changes — a minimum-wage increase, more paid vacation days, the formal enactment of a shorter workweek — may be needed to lure workers back.
761	2	Right now the Fed is betting that this dilemma won’t arise. Let’s hope it’s right.
248	4	The stories embedded in our genes beg to be told. They tell of ancestral diversity that stretches back thousands of years and ultimately underscores all that we — despite superficial physical differences — have in common.
491	2	Plenty of people will prefer other, more contemporary musical forms and performance styles or would find a story told from the minority point of view more interesting or worthwhile. Quite OK. But in deciding whether “West Side Story” amounts to a mistake, we might consider that among the reasons Spielberg says he remade it is that “divisions between un-likeminded people is as old as time itself,” adding that given our current discourse, the story is “more relevant to today’s audience than perhaps it even was in 1957.”
35	1	By being a dog, Finnegan showed me the richness of the world that I had overlooked, and I am forever changed. In life, animals are rarely treated with the respect due these fellow travelers on earth; when they die, we have one last chance to do so.
873	4	Whether Roe v. Wade falls or is significantly diminished, it will raise the question: Which rights are next? Presumably, many others could be vulnerable.
603	1	“We don’t believe any of it is a coincidence,” Mrs. Torres said. “Even though it’s been such heartache and such a heart-wrenching trial God put us through, I believe we were chosen for a reason.”
402	7	I think we should at least consider the temporal hurdle I’ve described a kind of supermajority requirement that, once met, entitles a governing party to using a simple majority to pass its legislation. Between bicameralism, separated powers, the diverse and fractious nature of the parties themselves and the simple passage of time, we already have the forces that prevent whiplash and chaos. We don’t actually need another.
517	7	The heated ongoing debate over the use of the N-word is rooted in the word’s past and present as a term of pitiless abuse. To extend this approach to the antiquated but at one time acceptable word “Negro” amounts to a kind of language policing — recreational, sanctimonious or both — that distracts all of us from real work in the real world. To wit: What do you think Rosa Parks, Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph or Mary McLeod Bethune would have thought about people deeming it social justice to crusade against any instance of the word “Negro” instead of combating actual racism?
866	2	I was in grade school in the 1950s when my teacher asked the class to write down what we were thankful for. My parents had fled from Stalin’s army and secret police, taken a boat to Nazi Germany (that was their best option at the time), walked to the Allied zone and finally established a new life in America. I wrote down that I was thankful that I had not been captured by the Russians.
511	9	This is not a moment for punch-pulling.
903	3	These studies have been buried in academic obscurity, but they deserve a wider audience. The research convincingly establishes that every dollar invested in safety net initiatives for children — whether in high-quality early education, Medicaid or food stamps — can change the arc of their lives. That’s the surest way to break the cycle of poverty.
601	3	He is right.
290	4	And if realism didn’t anticipate everything about the current situation, it still has this fundamental insight to offer: The revolutionary moments in history are also the exceptional ones, and the most important task of statesmen is to prevent moments of great crisis from yielding tragedies too terrible to bear.
310	6	Mr. Putin’s savage invasion of Ukraine has shattered the post-Cold War project of interlacing Russia with the democratic nations of Europe. As the West once again finds itself pitted against Russia, it is worth remembering that the Cold War was won by those who took better care of their own people and held out the prospect of a better life to those on the other side of the divide.
194	4	Also in The Washington Post and also on the subject of Johnson, George Will wrote: “With his carefully tousled hair that looks as though his barber used pruning shears, his shambolic manner of an unmade bed walking, and his louche lifestyle, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson — Eton; Balliol College, Oxford University — brings to mind Dolly Parton’s quip ‘You’d be surprised how much it costs to look this cheap.’” (Susan Reigler, Louisville, Ky., and Jeannie MacDonald, Portsmouth, N.H., among others)
686	8	It is fulfilling to be able to introduce myself as a reporter to the same institutions and companies that tried to profit off my collapse. After months of fighting to keep my credit score in good shape, I am back to prime. But my anger remains.
849	4	The Biden administration is, in fact, pushing an agenda of economic investment and expanded health care, but the public is not yet responding. Part of this failure lies with the administration’s suboptimal messaging. More threatening to the party, however, is the possibility that a growing perception of the Democratic Party as wedded to progressive orthodoxies now blinds a large segment of the electorate to the positive elements — let’s call it a trillion-dollar bread-and-butter strategy — of what Biden and his party are trying to do.
519	7	One could pessimistically say that the fact that we even need to have this conversation about fair elections and rule of law in the United States in the 21st century is depressing and shocking. One could simply retreat into complacency. Or one could see the threats this country faces as a reason to buck up and prepare for the battle for the soul of American democracy that may well lie ahead. If Republicans have embraced authoritarianism or have refused to confront it, and Democrats in Congress cannot or will not save us, we must save ourselves.
952	6	All this requires leadership and a global outlook. Unlike in the terrible days of early last year, we have an early warning, vaccines, effective drugs, greater understanding of the disease and many painful lessons. It’s time to demonstrate that we learned them.
512	1	As I head into another frigid weekend of trying to avoid Omicron, I’m stocking up on craft supplies and kid-friendly recipes we can make together (the pizza recipe from J. Kenji López-Alt’s book “Every Night Is Pizza Night” is a family favorite). But I’m also accepting that my kids may just become really, really good at Mario Kart this winter.
728	4	It is essential that everyone is maxed out on their vaccines. People who are eligible for boosters should get them. Those who were infected previously need to get vaccinated, given the high rates of Omicron reinfections. All children age 5 and older should get vaccinated.
969	2	Happy Thanksgiving weekend!
917	6	“I am deeply, deeply aching for something that is bigger than just Roe, good people,” Ms. Simpson said, speaking with a pastor’s conviction. In front of her, thousands of people cheered and waved hand-drawn signs. “If you want something that you don’t have, good folks, then you better be willing to do something that you have never done.”
340	4	A chief thing that the church has to offer the world now is to remind us all how to be human creatures, with all the embodiment and physical limits that implies. We need to embrace that countercultural call.
760	7	At the gathering in Ohio, Weingarten said that she saw the problems in public schools as a microcosm of the toxicity of American politics right now. “If we actually could deal with the vitriol nationally, this situation would turn around soon,” she said, adding, “This constant sense that we are alone, and battling this by ourselves, I think that’s really deflating.” It’s part of why the pandemic has driven so much of this country mad, and was so distinctly corrosive to public schools. Isolation is terrible for solidarity.
123	4	So I hope people will remember what we almost lost in 2017 and understand that even if Republicans aren’t currently talking about it very much, health care is still very much on the ballot.
303	2	Oof, especially as it came after Chapek’s immediate predecessor, the much-respected Disney C.E.O. Bob Iger, tweeted his opposition to the bill on Twitter. That’s called leadership, which Iger, who vacated his chairmanship in December, talked about eloquently in a recent live Disney exit interview I did with him on Sway.
880	1	Actually, I wanted to tell her, I think he did mean it. But then, she wasn’t really talking about the man before her; she was talking about a better version of him, a self he had not been able to become, but in whom she had not lost faith. He was not yet that man. But, she felt, in receiving the gift of kindness, and of grace, maybe he still had a shot.
741	4	As the larger spending bill shatters against Mr. Manchin’s unyielding opposition, the re-entry proposal should be rescued and revived for another day. Maybe in a pared-down version of Build Back Better to be hashed out in the new year. Maybe attached to a different vehicle entirely. The plan may not be flashy, but it could make a big difference to the masses of sick and vulnerable people who emerge from America’s jails and prisons each year — and to the communities to which they return.
644	2	So those state checks shouldn’t be too big. States that have big budget surpluses should use some of the money to replenish their rainy-day funds, catch up on contributions to public pension funds and invest in infrastructure, Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, wrote last year.
190	4	So Democrats will need more than an improving economy to survive the midterms. They’ll need to get receptive voters to perceive that improvement, and then get enough of those voters to the polls to match the sizable minority determined to believe that Joe Biden’s America is a Mad Max-type wasteland.
102	2	So let us meet the change ahead by joining together in small acts of mutual humanity, embracing the strategy of gritty hope that Black culture and history make manifest.
657	4	Courts have long affirmed the propriety of jurors drawing on their experiences, about everything from how guns work to knowledge of the banking industry. In a society in which so many of us have direct experience of sexual violence, why ask a question that separates us from our peers and could keep us from sitting in judgment with them?
569	6	And yes, I’m aware that it’s mixing metaphors to say that the economy is cooling down because we’re hitting the brakes. Deal with it.
857	4	Unable to sleep one night, I slipped past my dozing son and emerged from our tent into the surreal soft light of a midnight sunset as a rainbow arced like an heaven-sent bridge over the river. In times like this I could only think about both of my sons and how they and all of our future generations will be left to face the uncertainties of an overheated planet.
426	1	Complicating matters, people in cities such as San Jose tend to be paid more. The question is why. An October paper by David Card and Jesse Rothstein of the University of California, Berkeley, and Moises Yi of the Census Bureau finds that two-thirds of the difference in the observed wage premiums for working in places such as San Jose and New York “is attributable to skill-based sorting” — that is, people with higher skills tend to sort themselves into cities that pay higher wages.
961	6	Meta signals Mr. Zuckerberg’s investment in the “embodied internet,” but it is ultimately a technology that keeps us apart, making us ever more alienated from our bodies and one another. Being disconnected from my body fed the self-hatred and perfectionism that facilitated my eating disorder. We don’t need to swap out our bodies with holographs and avatars. We need to nurture our sense of touch. A firm hand squeeze during grace, a cuddle with the dog on the couch, a hug like you mean it. In other words, the tactile joys of being alive.
296	6	Simplistic, knee-jerk solutions like prosecuting more 16- and 17-year-olds in the adult court system with the threat of permanent criminal records and lengthy time behind bars are not the answer to the crime problem. We need to rehabilitate young offenders, not shackle them with adult criminal penalties that will create lifelong barriers to work and school. We’ve seen the carnage that caused and should not revisit it.
470	2	I’m going to stop this answer right now and apologize to you. I’m a bit tired. Ha-ha.
990	1	That makes the correct reading of intentions even more crucial. If both sides can look at each other with sober eyes, some limited cooperation and effective messaging would be possible. The alternative doesn’t bear thinking about.
224	6	Becoming a historian requires the ability to develop a sense of periodization. I sense a period ending. I am now deeply afraid that Mr. Putin’s recklessness may cause the years between the Cold War and the Covid-19 pandemic to seem a halcyon period to future historians, compared with what came after. I fear we may find ourselves missing the old Cold War.
693	9	The A.C.A. was no shield for Mr. Obama and Democrats in 2010. But if, through a retooled Build Back Better Act, Mr. Biden can achieve significant and durable progress on some major priorities that will benefit children and families for generations, Democrats would be wise to celebrate and tout those gains instead of complaining about what wasn’t possible
236	5	Standing with us today and helping us is the only way to achieve peace for all and ensure that history does not repeat itself — so that our future does not echo Europe’s darkest time.
353	4	But this time is different, even if some house prices are starting to look like the 2000s bubble. I wouldn’t say that everything is fine, but a housing bubble probably isn’t in my top 10 list of things to worry about.
238	3	The U.S. should also remind Mr. Putin that we are willing to negotiate any serious security concerns on the part of Russia, once the aggression has been brought to an end. Mr. Biden may have enjoyed the standing ovations, but we may find that there is little to celebrate in the coming days and weeks.
566	5	This alternative analysis of Putin’s performance could be wrong. Then again, in war, politics and life, it’s always wiser to treat your adversary as a canny fox, not a crazy fool.
991	9	Given the bleak trajectory of American politics, I worry about progressives retreating into private life to preserve their sanity, a retreat that will only hasten democracy’s decay. In order to get people to throw themselves into the fight to save this broken country, we need leaders who can convince them that they haven’t already lost.
448	3	Play the rests. Guard the margins. They matter.
995	1	In that spirit, I thank you for reading this newsletter. Please send me your favorite story about gratitude using the email address below. I will share one of them in my Dec. 3 edition.
227	3	Lulu Garcia-Navarro: The next day, Nataliya wrote us as a huge Russian convoy approached Kyiv. She said she was OK, but that people are rushing to try and send their children out of the city, while they still can. This is Lulu Garcia-Navarro from New York Times Opinion.
540	7	Authoritarians don’t just want to control the government, the economy and the military. They want to control the truth. Truth has its own authority, an authority a strongman must defeat, at least in the minds of his followers, persuading them to abandon fact, the standards of verification, critical thinking and all the rest. Such people become a standing army awaiting their next command.
981	7	It may be hard to keep track of the many ways China is cracking down on Hong Kong. But this latest move cannot be ignored. The stakes — future leaders, freedom and accountability — are far too high.
743	2	If we as individuals do our part by getting vaccinated and being smarter about social gatherings, and the government does its part to protect schools, hospitals and nursing homes, we can make this pandemic moment safer for as many people as possible.
432	4	If history fails to explain his fate, he could turn, finally, to theology: to the English translation of the Bible that his ancestor James I commissioned. He could read Matthew 5:29: “And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.” I can’t really put it better than that. If you didn’t think they had it in them, it’s almost cheering.
221	7	The founders themselves imagined a new constitutional convention every few generations; perhaps every hundred years is also a good time to come up with new binding national political rites. We could do away with the speech entirely, and simply give out more civic medals for ordinary workers — the supposedly essential Americans whose daily, unseen labor makes the country run even as they are steadily alienated from mass politics and the highflying economy. Otherwise, the speech will continue to be more tendentious, reality-show entertainment. Will Sam Alito mouth offagain? Will Nancy Pelosi do another ironic clap? Who will leap to applaud which lines, and who will sit on their hands? Enough is enough. Make the State of the Union boring again. We have been sufficiently entertained.
702	1	Ketamine didn’t do the trick for me, sadly. But I’d be ready and waiting to try anything else the scientists have up their sleeves. (Psilocybin, anyone?) I have, at the very least, learned an important lesson: no jokes during hallucinogenic trips. And no clowns, either.
390	4	And a tree’s shade belongs not to us, but to the furtive bobcat making its shadowy way through our cacophonous world.
902	4	The metaverse may have been born in science fiction, but it’s up to us to write a future grounded in cleareyed reality.
9	7	It will be even scarier after I’ve written this. But I have to say it: Russian should not be a language of war. This war is not in my name.
554	9	And the success of destructive vaccine politics is itself deeply horrifying. It seems that utter cynicism, pursued even at the cost of your supporters’ lives, pays.
665	4	Remembering that the Constitution was written in significant part to weaken and undermine state governments is, I think, the first step toward asserting the power of Congress not just over the states but also over institutions, like the courts, whose power has run far ahead of our system’s checks and balances.
26	4	Jamelle Bouie is a columnist with Times Opinion and resists the idea that it’s possible to forge a unifying sense of patriotism across the country. America is simply too large and too diverse to unite on a baseline of meaning. Patriotism, he argues, rests at the individual level: “I think all you have to do is identify ‘What are the things that are valuable to you? What are the things that are important to you?’ And you pursue them,” he says.
22	4	The purpose of changing the rules is not to destroy Long Island but to allow more people to enjoy its amenities and opportunities. Most homes would remain single-family homes. And developers could begin to build more of the housing that New York so desperately needs without spending decades begging for permission.
31	4	The situation facing Ukraine has demonstrated how quickly the dynamics of energy dependency can be turned against Western interests. To set the United States and its allies on a path of long-term national security, America must focus on supplying the energy it needs today while rapidly building out a renewables supply chain that is beholden to no single nation.
325	3	Thank you for these prayers. I am praying them with you.
923	1	Further, with the prospect of an energizing adverse ruling on Roe v. Wade, as well as Stacey Abrams’s entry into the Georgia governor’s race, there is reason to be hopeful about the Democrats’ prospects.
104	6	Some of these treatments, like the vaccines, can be lifesaving. They still might not improve things enough here in the United States. That’s not because the medications don’t work well, though. It’s because our health care system doesn’t.
605	5	It is a tragic dilemma. And far from approaching resolution, it seems to be just beginning.
234	3	I hope others can help keep Ukraine alive. Learn the history. Light a candle on Holodomor Remembrance Day in November. Mourn the dead. Remember Ukraine.
996	5	What the outcome of The Arkansas Times’s lawsuit will be is unclear. One thing, however, remains crystal clear: These anti-boycott laws, allowing government to use money to punish dissent, will encourage the creation of ever more repressive laws that risk strangling free speech for years to come.
738	3	Profit-seeking is good. Profiteering is bad. But who gets to decide which is which?
272	3	Bret: He already has. With the invasion of Ukraine, we’ve had our century’s version of Sept. 1, 1939 — after another “low dishonest decade,” to borrow a phrase. Now it’s up to Biden to save us from another Dec. 7, 1941.
456	2	Today, I am grateful to be in recovery from addiction. I have made peace with the idea that I am the kind of person who should not drink, at least for today. But I do not need to consider it a disease to do this. I believe that waking up to addiction is a tremendous gift, because it points us toward universal human struggles with self-control and working with our pain. In that sense, addiction is profoundly ordinary, contiguous with all of human suffering. We cannot end it, we certainly cannot cure it, and medicine alone will never save us. But if we drop the idea of disease and open up to a fuller picture of addiction, it will allow for more nuance, care and compassion.
712	6	Setting this constitutional project on a firm foundation — or to a “safe harbor,” as he put it on Tuesday — is the key to Mr. Boric’s political legacy. His greatest challenge, beyond making it past his honeymoon with voters and responding to specific demands, will be to show that he’s the president of not just the here and now, but also of Chile’s imminent next founding — the first chief executive who’ll chart the nation’s future course based on the first charter ever written by Chileans themselves.
2	6	Mr. Putin’s attempt to rewind the geopolitical clock by 30 years will reverberate for the next 30. There is no time for moral complacency.
785	3	Horowitz has taught me to listen to Black classical music as what the most American of classical music is. His lesson should resound.
780	1	So, this week Jane Coaston invited Ross and Jay to the show for a lively debate over how the press should cover politics in a democratic society.
622	2	The second thing is even more important: It would be for America to demonstrate that it’s not just good at forging alliances abroad but that it can also build healthy coalitions again at home — to deliver good government, growth, uncontested transfers of power and a more perfect union. Our ability to do that in the past is what earned us the world’s esteem and emulation. That used to be us — and it can be again.
443	6	That’s what she should do.
399	7	When it comes to abortion, both the right and the left converge on an individualistic and reductive view of choice. This has fostered a culture where women who are facing an unexpected pregnancy too often feel left on their own. But to be empowered to make a more difficult choice, women who want to continue with a pregnancy need to feel that their sacrifices are seen, valued, applauded and supported in practical ways. They need advocates to help foster a society where women do not feel they need abortion for financial security, opportunity or equality.
855	10	I’m guessing that some will think I’m oversimplifying. But my response is to ask: Are race issues so tangled that we can’t straightforwardly point ourselves toward some measure of general agreement — or even just peace? Are we dealing with complexity or just a kind of synthetic confusion? Confusion in race politics that — whatever it yields — is a new rather than classic version of The Struggle.
914	2	Nela Richardson, the institute’s chief economist, writes: “These drivers could be switching jobs to pursue more rewarding opportunities, given the relatively low pay of school bus drivers when compared to national averages. In a world where more people are ordering online, workers with a commercial driver’s license have more options than they did before the pandemic.”
29	1	Many people feel deep grief at his death. Speaking only for myself, I find it hard to imagine a world without him in it, especially in this moment when cynicism and cupidity seem to have become cardinal virtues, and compassion and decency are deemed a sucker’s pursuit. But Paul’s plans and dreams live on in the minds of thousands of people, who are equipped and eager to follow his example. I like to think he died happy.
499	8	To stop.
96	4	Come to think of it, the only members in Congress who might not want to reform this menacing law are those planning its imminent exploitation to overturn the next presidential election.
214	2	Were these stronger today, the obstruction of Senators Manchin and Sinema would look like the actions of reactionaries with nowhere else to turn rather than an intractable stranglehold on any reform efforts. And while we might hear less about stakeholder capitalism, we would have a public realm that could make real the idea of the common good.
807	2	A stronger, wealthier, democratic Indonesia won’t always agree with the United States — but it will add a critical counterweight to China in Asia.
388	8	Bret: I like having choices as a voter. I’d never vote for Trump or a Trumpian, but if the Democrats can’t get their act together and learn how to govern, Felix the Cat sounds like the right write-in candidate for me.
667	5	As the party’s draconian rules begin to cancel each other out, they also take their toll on young people, choking off the very vitality that is the true basis of national rejuvenation.
483	9	Do the nation a solid, Wisconsin: Commit to helping Mr. Johnson stick by his original promise to serve only two terms. After everything it has been through lately, America shouldn’t have to suffer through another six years of his twisted take on truth and freedom.
460	7	Poor us.
779	8	One way or another, that adaptation will be fraught and painful. But this is the moment when the Democrats need to do it — when the Hispanic realignment is still more hypothetical than real, still more visible in issue surveys than electoral results, still only a harbinger of an epic political defeat rather than the thing itself.
507	2	The Seneca Village story was largely lost to civic memory until 1992, when Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar resurrected it in their book, “The Park and the People: A History of Central Park.” The task of reconstructing the story of the village and its residents is just beginning. Nevertheless, historians have already moved this once-forgotten episode to center stage in the 19th-century drama that was New York City.
120	2	It would make me feel deeply loved if the Christmas tree were not there in the morning.
261	4	But we are defiant. With every act of bravery and courage, Ukrainians show that we are ready to pay the highest price for democracy — ours and the world over. In this battle, we will not surrender and we will not capitulate. Because our freedom is immutable.
64	6	When all the narratives about the recall of the three board members and what it means for Democrats wind to their end, that foundation of organized Asian Americans will still be there. In San Francisco they provided a glimpse of reality amid all the theorizing on wokeness, Covid fatigue and red waves in the midterms and beyond. It’s hard to imagine that any result in a blue city within a blue state will tell us all that much about what’s coming in 2022 or 2024; not all politics take place on such grand, national stages. A lot of times, it’s just angry citizens organizing out of pure self-interest — in this case in opposition to equity efforts at a magnet school — and then drawing in others who might be mad at the same people about Covid closures, school renamings or whatever else. The San Francisco outcome should remind us that politics is still local.
782	3	The ability to determine whether particular tornadoes bear the signature of the changing climate will be important not only to understanding the shifting dynamics of our warming world but to our ability to predict these storms with greater precision.
821	3	Yes, the pandemic could take us down a darker path. But there is no reason to expect that it will.
867	7	All this is history, I guess. But it’s not hard to see how what happened around this site in the past informs the encampment that’s here today. The Panthers, for example, gave out free breakfast to disadvantaged children in Oakland and provided social services in the city in the 1960s and ’70s before they were violently repressed. In the ’80s, during the Reagan years, public housing was stripped away. And over the past decades, thousands of poor people have been processed through that courthouse into incarceration, many of whom have eventually found themselves living on the streets. Standing by an encampment makes you aware of these narratives, but I’m not sure what knowing all that does for any of the people who live in the tents.
582	7	DeSantis is Trump 2.0.
137	3	It is. We should do more to live up to his example.
