5030150	3	Doesn't FAST charge on Samsung S8
5035260	3	This is a very inconsistent charge. I have a Galaxy S6 and it does not like to maintain a charge once it fully charges. once the phone is fully charged, it stops charging and lets the phone drain. Sometimes, it just randomly stops charging and lets the phone drain. I bought another brand and love it.
5036988	3	Never worked, I threw out packaging so I feel like I can't return it!!  At least I can use the plug!!!
5030932	2	Will not work with my phone
5037737	2	I have the same problem as other note 5 or s6 edge plus owners but I may have a solution. I'm not quite sure how I figured it out but I messed with the placement of the phone a bit and found tha it has worked 100% of the time (at least for me) to place it on the side away from the light. That means, the phone has to be perpendicular to the cord attached to the pad, and the note 5's side away from the light should line up to the outer circle away from the light where the cord is attached. If that works for other note 5 or s6 edge plus owners, then that is probably how the wireless integration is built in for those phones and not the same as the s6 or the s6 edge. Any other orientation of my note 5 other than what I have explained has been a total failure and will pause the charging and it will start blinking. I know its a pain to not be able to put it in any desired orientation for the new phones but I really don't want to spend double the amount for the fast one coming out in a bit. Samsung should've fixed this problem before handing out the phones. I want to send it back so bad but I didn't want to get in all that hassle, but we definitely deserve some credit back for a faulty item.
5037578	3	Working ok. Does charge through my Otterbox Defender Case which was an area of concern and great debate amongst others. Charges rather slow and has a problem with the trickle charge option for my battery. Keeps cycling on and off with the trickle, rather annoying, but I can't say if another brand/type would be any better.
5033856	3	This is a very nice and sturdy looking charger.  When I first placed my Galaxy S6 on the charger, the first thing I noticed that the charging light only works on half of the charger.  The phone had 34% battery and it quickly went up to about 44%, then it stopped there.  Ok, did some research  and put on daydream mode, set he phone on the charger and went to bed. Woke up with 57%.  Not so good.  Looks like I either have t shut the phone off to charge or go back to the cable. Oh well, can't return since I threw away the box and everything, and it was only 20 bucks on cyber Monday.
5036026	2	Can't charge through a case
5036257	2	Not what I was expected! wireless for the phone... but to charge the phone the pad have to be plugged ... so same sh*t.
5030328	3	I have problems with this thing. I leave it plugged up all day expecting to be able to throw my phone on it at night and go to sleep but I end up messing with it for a few minutes beforehand. It does work with the defender series case though.
5038059	3	Do not bother spending the money on this Samsung branded recharge pad.  There are less expensive, far better functionioning recharge pads out there.  Samsung's is very finicky, often stops charging and flashing blue, and does not trickle charge once fully charged.  In addition is come with no instruction manual - in fact, one does not even exist.  When I called Samsung directly NO ONE had a clue how to use the recharging pad and had no idea what the various LED lights (specifically the flashing blue) meant.
5036597	2	Use it with my note 5. It is extremely sensitive to phone placement I usually have to reseat the phone several times. Don't buy this thing.
5037206	3	I was pumped about making this purchase because I had recently purchased the Samsung S6 Edge+. Received the product on time and opened it immediately to try it out. My phone was at 17% and the estimated time to charge was 2 hrs 30 mins, which I was okay with since it was wireless charging. I come back 30 mins later and my phone charge dropped to 15% and the estimated charge was now 3 hrs. Sent the product back. Don't think I will be using wireless charging ever for my phones. BYE FELICIA!
5032935	3	Returned never could get it to work
5037776	2	Does not work.. is there some kind of app to make this work?
5034890	3	I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 and I've had this charger for two months.  Yesterday, I threw it away.  Last night was the 2nd time in two months where somehow instead of being charged, my phone was drained of all power.  I will say that the phone charged fine the other days that I used it.  However, last night I swear that when I put my phone on the charger i saw the visual queue that indicated that I laid it on OK.  Then I didn't get up for work on time this morning because my phone was a brick.  The thing is, the phone had about 70% power when I put it down on the charger for the night, so there's no reason that the thing should have drained in 6 hours.  I can't explain it, but it had to have sapped the power.  Since it's the second time this happened to me, I threw the disc away and am going back to charging with the micro usb.
5035273	3	Convenience is awesome, but strength of the charge is kind of disappointing.
5035506	3	Stops charging phone randomly
5035511	2	Kind of hard to find a connection
5037539	2	I love wireless charging but sometimes the connection gets lost. I have to keep checking to make sure it's still charging :/
5034176	3	Stops charging when phone vibrates n moves the phone.... If not placed exactly, doesn't charge
5035818	2	Didn't seem to work well with my samsung galaxy 6 edge +.  It would start charging but then it looked like it turned off and it took a day  to complete 100% charge.
5033461	2	Keeps disconnecting when charging.  Keep having to move the phone around to get it to connect and charge
5033017	2	doesn't work with otter box  commuter case. If you take it out of the case every time it works great.
5037451	2	Doesn't stay connected, and not that fast recharge as advertised.
5035437	3	It's not working properly I'm really sad
5031926	2	You have to find the sweet spot on the phone when you place it on the pad in order for the phone to charge.  It is not as simple as placing the phone on the pad.  Charging is slower.
5034503	2	Does not charge unless plugged in.
5033908	3	My intent was to locate a product that would provide fast charging but this item did not deliver. In fact, it took longer than the traditional charger that came with early model Samsung devices.  I would not recommend purchasing from a third party; only from Samsung directly.
5034162	3	Bought this one for my son's Galaxy 5 but charges slower than with the direct plug. Spend the extra $$ and get the speed version. I use that one and it works great
5031539	2	Just get the newest charger. this one is hard to use and if the phone is lined up JUST RIGHT in the center it will not work well.
5037477	2	It works if after putting the phone on it you hang around long enough to make sure that you have hit the sweet spot.
5033377	3	Very slow charging, if your a turtle go for it. It does work though.
5034128	3	does not charge any faster
5030194	3	This works well, however you need to make sure that it connects to wireless charging after you put the phone on it.  A couple of times it did not connect and now I make sure that i see that the phone is charging
5037511	3	Its really slow...the phone slides off easily or can be on the unit but not in the correct spot. If I use it at night in my bedroom if the phone lights up for a text or email, then it lights up the bedroom, since it is face up on this charger, so I don't like that either.
5034935	2	Product does not work with the note 4 as claimed
5033753	3	Complete junk. Bought to put on night stand for overnight charging but it'll stop charging pretty often. Stopped using it completely
5038031	3	It DOES NOT live up to the hype.  With any kind of case on the phone at all you have to slide/move/shuffle/preposition the phone to get it to sit in JUST the right place for it to actually charge.  Then on top of that you have to put your phone in "Airplane mode" to charge it because if you don't when you get a text or email or notification while its charging it will STOP CHARGING and then proceed to drain what was left of your battery.  I still use it but only because I already bought it.  It is actually far easier to just plug your phone in and  not have all the hassle.
5035094	3	Worked for a month then stopped working
5030080	3	It worked fine for a week, then it stopped working.
5029973	3	You have to make sure the light stays lit or it is not charging
5032240	2	When I first got this charger, I LOVED it.  Just set the phone on it and it charged fast.  But now, I am not so happy.  I've had it for a about a month and a half, and you have to put the phone in EXACTLY the right spot, or it doesn't charge.  And sometimes, even when you get it in the right spot, and it says that it is charging, it doesn't charge.  Disappointing.  I am hoping that I just got one with a problem and they will give me another one, but I've had it more than a month, so I don't think so.  :(
5037397	2	in concert with this charger these two units do not work together well...i have to place the phone EXACTLY in one position or it won't charge...and flips back and fourth all night long...INSANE
5038078	3	Maybe for phones that were made before the fast charger (included with the Note 4(& Edge) and now the S6 (& Edge) this would have been fine.  Why lay it on a trickle charger that takes hours when it can be ALL charged up in 1 hour or so?  Also, I like my room dark.  If I charge it at night this thing lights up around the edges depending on what its status is.  No option to douse the lights.
5036100	2	have to position phone just right and wait until the blue light appears to start charging. If I just set the phone down without checking it doesn't always charge and my battery dies overnight.  I prefer the oblong shaped wireless chargers .
5037237	3	Its really convenient to be able to set your phone down and pick it up without having to find the cord and get it plugged in.  I use it at my desk at work and it makes it nice to be able to set my phone down and have it charging as well as pick it up without having to unplug anything.  The major downsides for me are that it is picky about how the phone is placed on the charger.  I rarely get it to start charging the first time I set the phone on the charger.  The other downside is that once the phone is charged to 100%, the charger shuts off.  Typically only takes an hour or two to charge and then the rest of the night its off, so when I wake up, the phone is only at 90% or so.  You have to pick the phone up and place it back on the cradle to restart charging.  Pros: looks cool, good conversation piece, convenient to pick up and put down phone for charging.  Cons: picky about phone placement, charges to 100% and then stops charging.
5033285	3	Not a good charger. Ive had a lot of problems with this not charging my phone. I even unplugged the charging disk and plugged to cord directly to the phone, it will start to charge but it stops charging at some point for no reason.
5037738	3	Loved the convenience, design, and style but maybe I didn't do something right! After leaving my Samsung Note 5 on the pad for 4 hours I only gained about 27% versus 20% on a wall charger in less than an hour. Guess if you use the charging pad before going to bed you won't notice it's a slow charge.
5033174	0	Love the idea of it but I stopped using it  because it would only charge my phone to 75 %. It could be something I was doing wrong but it's just as easy to plug my phone in and charge it that way.
5032742	3	I had two of these that worked perfectly with my Galaxy S5 with the wireless charging flip case, Then I left one in a hotel.so I ordered two new ones and neither one works.  Remaining old one works fine with my S5 but not these new ones.
5031953	0	ok
5034850	3	I have Galaxy S6 Edge. Sometimes when i rest my phone on this thing it doesnt charge. I have to unplug and re-plug it in for the charge effect to work. Its convenient but i find the phone charges much faster if i just plug the phone in. Not sure i would purchase again
5035179	2	Didnt know there was a quick charge dock as well. Spend the extra money or u will regret it.
5037794	3	It stops charging when is full ( in the middle of the night) and doesn't start back up once the battery starts going down. So i wake up to a half charged phone all the time :/
5034219	3	Waste of money. Your phone has to be put down at a certain way and it still disconnected a lot. My phone started going berserk with notifications of charging/low battery because of all the disconnects.
5034767	3	I ordered 2 of these and neither one of them charge my phone. It connects, disconnects, connects, disconnects, constantly which drains my battery faster than it not charging at all.
5036058	3	This would be a great product if it worked.  It takes a much longer time to charge your phone than a plug in charger, but more importantly , it is unreliable. Sometimes it would charge to 100%, sometimes to 40%. This with the light on the unit at green (meaning fully charged)? I even tried what another reviewer recommended and shut the phone off at night while charging and that didn't make a bit of difference. I spoke with Samsung and had been doing everything correctly. All they could do was offer an exchange, but based on so many others having this issue, it's clearly a product defect and I'm returning it. Very disappointing.
5035183	3	I know that this is not the fast charge model... My Samsung Galaxy S7 wasn't even charged to %50 after 6 1/2 hours. Not even worth the trouble of returning it. Very satisfied with other Samsung products, I MAY order the fast charge model.
5031103	3	I understand that Wi-Fi charging is NOT nearly as fast as wireless charging, but really? I charged my note 4 with this and it took 5 hours to go from 15% to 100%.  I guess this is not a problem if you leave your phone charging over night, but if you are in a hurry, this product is not what you want. Also it doesn't work well if you have a thick case on your phone.
5036466	0	not worth the money
5036834	3	This thing does not charge reliably.  In the words of Forest Gump's Mama...Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.  This charger is like that one time you can put your phone on and it charges great and the next time not at all.  I am careful to check that it the phone shows it is charging before leaving on the charger but still this charger has a mind of its own.  It is a good idea, if only it worked everytime.
5033214	3	Works as promised however charges much too slow to be effective. I often got impatient while charging and would use the standard wall charger. Unfortunately, the S6 does is not compatible with the quick charger wireless charging pad.
5036630	3	Doesn't charge as quickly as the wall charger, but that was too be expected. It does well charging even through my case, which makes the option of setting it down super convenient. At times the charger seems to stop charging and when I pick the phone up in the morning it's only at about half to 3/4 charge. I have to pick it up and put it back on for it to start charging again.
5035892	0	It's ok..takes forget to charge my phone.
5036320	3	If you are simply out for the cool factor,this has it.  I'd be lying if I said I don't like just setting my phone on top of the charger and  letting it do its thing. However, if you are looking for a reliable, consistent, quick charge... Look elsewhere. There still some kinks that need to be ironed out before this becomes a great product.  Sometimes this charger does great, I'll set my phone on it and pick it up at 100%. And then other times I wake up to a 34 or 68% charge (I  always make sure it connects before leaving it). I personally would rather hook it up to the charger that came with the phone, it's super fast and I know I can count on it to finish the job.
5033689	3	Terrible. Doesn't work. No fast-charging on the pad, only with the wall/wire charger. I have a Samsung 7Se. I plugged it in at 37%, phone said it would be 4 hours until fully charged, woke up 8 hours later with 40%. YES, it was on the worthless pad the whole time.
5034830	3	Love the concept.. but does not charge on a consistent basis. Replace with the Samsung fast charger and love it
5036622	3	If you use this charger to charge overnight, it will stop charging once done and never re-start charging, therefore you wake up with a partial charge on your phone. Not happy with this
5035439	3	Worthless, don't waste your money. It's so slow.
5032695	2	Nice gimmeck but just using the cable plug is easier and faster.  Have a SS G-7 and though it works with a plastic cover, if you want to place a call you have to remove it, dial and place it back.  If you use the cord, you pick it up and remains connected and charging.  Not a necessary item IMHO.
5036399	3	I purchased this for my Note 4 but soon found that I also needed to purchase a wireless adapter for my battery. I then bought the 1A Output 0.5mm Ultra thin Qi Standard Wireless Charging Receiver for Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910 for my phone to use with this charging pad. I find that when I can get the two to connect, the charge is very slow. I had it one there for 2 hours and my phone didn't charge half way. When I place my phone on the pad and it does not connect right away, I have to keep moving my phone around or re-positioning it on the pad until it connects. I will most likely give this away because it really doesn't work like I wanted it to and now is wrapped up in my closet taking up space.
5037157	3	Only works some of the time. Starts flashing blue and quits charging. If you can get it to work, it will fully charge then stop so your phone will sit there and drain instead of charging up again. It's nice when it works which isn't very often.
5035164	3	So many problems with this charger. 1) You have to place it in exactly the right position otherwise it doesn't charger. 2) It will randomly stop charging 3) Sometimes it'll start blinking and you have to unplug plug it back in to reset the charger. I have 3 of these (bedroom, living room, work), all have the same issues. I would get one of the vertical standing ones, seems to work better.
5033945	3	does't work but 15% of the time and for speed I couldn't tell per the not working . It only would show charging 2 time out of 10 times I set 5 differen qi phones down and it would work only when it wanted ! \ I respectfully ask that you send me a new wireless charger I don't  care what name brand it is I have a droid turbo an lg g4 droid turbo 2 and moto z force with tumi battery qi charging
5030241	2	You have to position the phone exactly right, and it's doesn't really charge that fast...
5036390	3	Having a lot of issues with this charger. When I first got it; it worked great. But now months later it takes about 12 hours to charge 40 percent. It keeps shutting down after about 30 minutes and then picks up charging again.
5033124	2	Designed to resemble a fast charger, but it's not a fast charger.  Returned.
5035930	2	not charging unless it aligns properly... thinking about returning it..
5035718	2	I'm less than impressed with this thing. It's completely unreliable. I have no clue why they made this thing so shoddy. The biggest problem is that if the phone is not perfectly centered, I mean PERFECTLY centered, it won't completely charge your device. This happens to me even when I center the freaking phone. I constantly wake up and grab the phone of the charger, only to find out half charged. Get a better one than this.
5029638	2	Problems with way the cell phone is placed on the disk. If it isn't just so, it stops charging.
5029704	3	Four months later it  only charges for a total of 4 seconds before it turns off.  It's a piece of junk!
5030640	3	Even though I bought this back in December, I just started using this week.  It does not charge at all.  It makes the initial sound as if it's charging but the battery percentage goes down as it charges, not up.  I bought a second one for my son-in-law.  His was working fine.  SO maybe I just have a bad one.
5038241	3	Works well but did notice it getting to 97% then it stopped charging.  Had to replace phone and then it continued charging.
5032209	3	Does not always charge my cell phone.
5037468	1	Didn't get this item in the package, instead I got valerian root pills.
5036240	2	works great no more plugging the phone in but I have to take it out the case to charge it and it a pain
5037929	0	Very nice to be able to charge without plugging in. I charge my phone at night and sometimes it doesn't  charge fully
5033714	4	Not Genuine! Fake Junk
5030173	2	Too sensitive to phone position
5035290	3	Defective... does not charge my phone... only super heats up the battery...
5037082	3	It doesn't charge that fast and not really that practical unless your phone's charging port is damaged. The only other use case is if you have a phone or tablet that can charge wirelessly but may have different charging ports. For example, I believe the Note uses a different port. If all your devices use a mirco usb, then just get a standard cable/charger.
5033462	0	It's ok if you have patience, my phone takes about 4ish hours to charge full with this. Also, caused my phone to overheat easily. Not all phone are compatible, but there is another device you can buy to make your phone compatible. Overall I would recommend just sticking with regular USB charging. You do have to have your phone on a certain way, but it became pretty habitual to place it down on the right spot after a few attempts.
5037487	3	NEVER FULLY CHARGES MY PHONE AND WHAT IT DOES CHARGE IS VERY,VERY SLOW. PRODUCT NOT TO GREAT.
5032392	3	I bought this charger and it is very slow charging.
5034189	3	Takes forever to charge my phone
5033751	3	This product didn't work at all . Would like one that does work !!!  Had put a star and should have had half or nothing
5034669	3	I wanted this to work, but half the time it doesn't charge my phone even if I put it carefully on the center. I have also put my phone on "dream mode" while charging so my phone doesn't stop charging while wireless, but it hasn't helped...
5032540	3	Takes FOREVER to charge our galaxy's
5035416	3	It charges my phone but very slowly
5029641	2	You have to play around to find the right spot for it to start charging and even then you have to keep an eye out on your phone because it will stop charging.  I'd set my phone down leave it and come back to a 50% charge and it not charging at all anymore and have to move it around again to get it to start again.
5030142	3	Failed in less than four months
5036742	2	I have a note 5 with Otterbox defender case. When i place the phone on top of this to charge, it keeps making the beeing sound signifying in and out of charging mode. Not exactly sure why this is so. My phone is less than a week old. I will update once I find out what's going on
5037430	2	I own a Samsung Note5.  I also own an Otter Box Defender cover/holster for the phone as a protective cover.  That said, the charging pad works great - as long as the phone is NOT in the Defender cover.  But, since I keep my phone in the Defender, using the Samsung Wireless Charging Pad is tricky - at best.  Before I purchased these devices, I went to the Sprint corporate store (you know, the one at their World Headquarters) and asked if the wireless charging system would work in the Defender.  Their answer was an emphatic "Yes".  So, I purchased the Defender holster and the Charging Pads.  Well, the wireless charging works - barely - only if you place the phone in just the right spot on the pad.  If you are able to find the right spot, the wireless charging is fast.  Really fast.  However, half of the time, the wireless charging looses it's "contact" with the phone and charging stops.  The only way that you know that it stopped is that the blue light on the pad goes into a slow flash which is hard to see with the phone sitting on it.  I called Sprint, and they said that as far as they know, the phone should work with the Defender case.  So, I called Otter Box.  They also said that it should work.  They sent a replacement case, and the situation did not get any better.  So, I called Samsung.  Their "official" position is that if I am using anything that is third-party, Samsung will not warranty or guarantee functionality.  So, I'm stuck with a device that barely works.  But, when it does, it works well.  If you have a protective cover for your phone, probably best to avoid spending your money for these devices.  If you don't have a protective cover, these work great.  Caveat emptor!
5036015	0	Lost for words
5035835	3	Well I finally got it, put it on the charge to make sure it's fully charged before use. After an hour or so I took it off set my phone on it, waited 30 minutes before I gave up on it. Yeah I know it's self explanatory put phone on it and it'll charge but 30 minutes and nothing???
5037208	2	This product requires YET another product to function. I bought it for my Samsung S5 for which it was advertized only to find that it does not work with the S5 UNLESS you purchase a new back to the phone which adapts it to the charger. That extra item cost another $42, so just not worth it.
5033378	2	The device is not wireless.  It needs to be plugged in to charge the phone.
5036323	2	Have to place your phone on it exactly right. Not as fast as plugging it in directly. Stopped using it.
5035395	2	It works for the new galaxy S6 and up. If you have any older Samsung phones it won't work. Didn't work for any other brands either. The phone has to be sitting on it just right to charge, or it won't. It works, but that's the only thing.
5033928	3	This product is alright...but I am overall dissappointed with it.  It never works consistently, takes a while to find the "sweet spot" to have your phone take a charge.  After about 2-3 weeks of using this (only at night when i go to bed) it stopped working completely.
5034787	3	good product but glitchy will stop charging randomly and will turn green indicating charge is complete when it is not fully charged
5033718	2	It was stated that this would work with a Galaxy S5(with the Qi charging back from Samsung), but it doesn't work. But I tested it with the Galaxy S7 with a case on it and it worked. Instead of sending it back I gave it away instead.  Link to the Qi charging cover I'm using >> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ITI24NG/ref=twister_B00JLFJAJM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 <<
5033312	2	At the end of the day, while it may "look cool" it's not practical (which I wish I'd thought about before I bought it). If you're like me and always on your phone, this isn't the charger for you. Also, this thing only works if the phone is in a certain type of case or has no case at all. So every time I try to use it, I have to pop off my protective case to charge it. I basically have unplugged it and use the USB and plug that directly into my phone. The disc just sits on my table collecting dust now.
5035452	2	No. I actually returned it..In th ought you could use it like a power bank. To me it's no different than plugging in my phone for charging.. Why call it wireless if you have to have it plugged in to work..
5035762	3	A few months later the charge isn't as good
5032567	3	The item did not work. I returned it and try another and nothing.
5037483	3	Product worked properly for 1 month then just stopped wirking. Would not recommend purchasing.
5032894	0	Works ok.
5036651	2	Doesn't charge phone to 100%.  Very touchy about the placement - unless I play around with it and move my phone around, it doesn't connect.  Disappointed.
5038404	2	[Using for a week] It works, lights up so you know when you're charging... Which it has to be dead on balls accurate (it's a industry term) when placed, otherwise it won't charge. If you leave it charging over night, expect to wake up with your phone at 80% + Not sure why this happens but it stops charging over night at some point.
5035401	3	It's a long tome.to charge phone and dosnt keep charge like using a wall charger.
5034977	3	Has problems at time charging , had to use my stock phone charging cable to get it to charge my phone, galaxy s6. Otherwise it's definitely cool.  It's been a few months and I'm having even more problems. Once a week at least the charging pad will turn off and on making the phone go in and out of charging mode which kills the battery while not charging. You then have to unplug and plug it back in. Sucks when it starts doing this in the middle of the night.
5035889	2	Did not work with my phone, returned for a refund.
5038441	2	Awesome. Until you have a case. It charged slower, then not at all with a case. Its a great idea but needs to be stronger.
5032968	2	Nice but it does not stay wireless doesnot charge my phone unless its plugged in.
5032577	2	its a neat tool, but you have to have the phone on it just right,, too many mornings my phone wasn't charged because it said charging  when i put it on and the next morning ,, nothing
5033739	3	SLOW!!!  Just plug it in.
5034047	2	it doesn't seem to always recognize that the phone has been placed on it...I have to re-situate the phone several times for charging to begin. Also disappointed in how extremely long it takes to charge my phone.
5031053	3	Charges slow
9221028	3	Some reason it stopped charging my phone..which is an S8+... phone charges plugged into a reg cord...
5033076	2	Doesn't work well at all with my Verizon Droid Turbo 2. Even without a case on it, it's hit or miss if it actually will charge.
5034101	3	It charges pretty slow and I have a hard time positioning my phone just right just to get it to start charging. But it's not too big a deal. I bought it for work so I'm not on my phone much there so I have all day for it to finish charging . If I buy another one for my house, I'll buy the fast charging one
5031613	0	Ordered the wrong device
5032583	3	1st one did not work blue light wouldn't stay on had to keep unplugging and replug it and changed outlets so had to return it to get it replaced. To be honest the 2nd one I got is doing same thing. Blue light did come on but every time I took off phone and place it back on it wouldn't charge and when it did charge it is very very slow so I got frustrated and went back to my lighting USB cord and it charged it to 100% in less than an hr. Guess I'll keep looking for a better wireless charger.
5033053	0	most pointless thing i ever bought
5035503	3	Ehhhhh... it's OK... if you set your phone down perfectly and it's 100% charged the next day. But too many times I have found it 60% charged, etc. Maybe it wasn't perfectly set down? Dunno. I went back to the high power charger.
5035326	3	Neat but not practical for me. This really only comes in handy if  you plan on leaving it on the charger for multiple hours and if you're gonna do that I do it at night when a cord doesn't affect me. It charges really slow. Still neat to see your phone charge with no cord though.
5034448	2	Kind of delicate need to put the phone on just right and even then phone might disconnect.
5033415	2	It doesn't work with a Google Nexus 7 tablet 2nd gen. The write up said it works with all QI device's. The charger maybe defective, I have no way to test it.
5033811	3	Takes along time to charge. Takes about 8 hours!
5036846	3	Worst Wireless Charger I have owned. It was always fussy. I am using it with Samsung's own add on back charger for the Note Edge. It will start flashing after a few minutes and not charge if the phone is not placed perfectly.  It turns off when done, but doesn't always turn on so I would wake up with a phone already at 80% vs 100% The morning after my last day to return it.  I find it won't even start charging at all.  The wall plug and cable are fine.  But the plate no light, no charge Thanks to Amazon bending the rules, which is why we spend so much with them.. It is going back anyway. I will probably replace it with a Pleson which I have on my desk which always works.  I mention it by name because it looks a lot the same, round, blue light etc.
5033286	2	You have to get your phone on there just right for this to work. Unlike my Verizon stand. But if you're careful it seams to work fine.
5036166	2	This wireless charger didn't work for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I'll rate this 3 stars because of that, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
5033701	3	Does not support fast charge
5035851	3	I usually wake up in the morning to a mostly charged phone usually 85% or so and a flashing blue charge pad. It's annoying that it dosent work all the time
5036040	3	Its a struggle to charge my note 5, when it does charge it over night sometimes i wake up with my battery at a lower percentage. Takes all night and morning to charge when it wants to work. However it does charge my spouses S6 edge however it takes six hours for a complete charge sometimes longer.
5029770	3	Disappointed. I bought this a little over a year ago still to this day it doesn't work case or not.
5034873	2	It doesnt like to charge through my otter box case:/
5034290	2	not a fast charger with newer phones but works for overnight charging
5036731	2	box was a little beat up but the item works perfectly.  i can put up with a smashed box (which i'm going to just throw in the recycling bin anyway) for half off the product!  Update: dropping down from 5 stars to 3 after using this for a few weeks. we found that it's very annoying trying to get the phone perfectly centered on the charger. If it's off by even a half inch, it won't change.  Quit using this charger and bought the "itian" brand phone-shaped wireless charger for about $9. Now it's much easier to just drop the phone on that charger and it will actually charge.
5037409	3	Sometimes will stop charging in the middle, if i receive a text or email...so have to keep checking to be sure my phone is charging.
5033710	3	First a caveat: I am not using this charging pad with a Samsung phone but with a Microsoft Lumia 950XL.  The charging pad charges the 950XL fine without any issues with the blue charging light indicating charging and the green when charging is completed.  However, if you I do not remove the 950XL when the green light comes on when charging is completed it appears that the charger in some unknown fashion switches gears and starts draining the battery in the phone.  I fully realize that none of this makes any sense but it is nevertheless my experience and I've tried this numerous times to the point that I've given up and switched back to using a started charging cord.  Really like the device but it does not work for me.
5029623	3	Very slow charge....
5031013	3	This was bought in 2017 it do work for a while stopped working as of today. It beeps & doesn't charge.
5033397	3	charges very very slowly.
5034198	3	I do not use it. It does not work.
5035765	3	I really want to like this. It's nice to walk in and just set down my phone instead of fumbling with a cord. Sometimes I don't have to, but the majority of the time this thing doesn't work. Randomly it stops charging, could be right after I set it down or an hour late when it's nearly charged. Only once has this ever charged my phone fully.
5035031	0	Very disappointed!
5037625	2	Have to make sure your phone is on the sweet spot to get it to charge, would have thought Samsung would have engineered that better.
5038110	2	Got tired of waking up and finding out my phone wasn't charged.  It doesn't work well with any type of case  I tried 3 different ones including the one Samsung sells. I gave up and went back to plugging it in.
5032056	3	Works but it's slow charging
5034019	3	it takes to long to charge the phone
5035781	3	I think not all wireless chargers are created the same. I purchased my first of this product, set it by my bed and loved it. The blue light is annoying - why does everything have to glow - but, as I mentioned, everything glows these days. My phone charges quickly. I can pick it up, set it down and not think about placement. It's fully charged when I get up in the morning. I can even charge it face down.  Then I bought a second one to use at work and it is terrible. I have had my phone on it all day and it won't keep charging. Every time I get a message either through email, twitter or apps on the phone, it stops charging. I then have to notice that it's stopped charging then pick it up and set it down again.  I'm not sure how this technology works but maybe Samsung should start with some quality control and then work their way through why some items of the same product works wonderfully while another barely works at all.
5032576	4	doesn't work. samsung tech support offers no support they are awful
5033769	3	Charges verrrryyyyy slooowwwwllllllyyyy but it works.
5034942	2	is ok but the phone has to be sitting on it just right for it to work
5034228	2	Does no lt charge unless phone in specific position. Even after charging all night, phone still not charged
5036339	3	First time using this & the blue light started flashing when the phone reached 71% so I took it up the phone & put it down. It started charging again so I will monitor it to see if it does reach 100% or if stops by itself again. I'm charging a S6.
5032781	2	I bought this one because a friend had one at work that charged my Kyocera phone, but this one does not charge my phone. Lost the return date, can't even return it... Sucks!
5038455	3	These look nice and yes they do charge but they charge VERY slow.  Maybe im doing somethign wrong but i lay my S6 on it at 11PM when i went to bed at 10% battery and woke up at 7AM and it was only at 66%.  If i hook my S6 to the fast charger that came with the phone it takes about a hour to charge the phone fully.
5032480	3	I received the products (2 pieces) July 15.  As of yesterday they stopped working.  The lights come on upon plugging in, but when I put my Samsung SG7 on top, nothing happens.  I hope these get replaced.
5037944	3	kind of tricky to find the exact spot where the phone needs to be in order for it to start charging, sometimes it will charge and then stop suddenly in the middle of the night; sometimes doesn't charge completely it stops at 94% even when the phone has not been touched. makes no sense at all how this thing works. honestly like using the normal plug in charger better. only good thing is that I didn't pay $60 for it, like they charge in the store.
5036120	3	This charged very slow the cord by itself was much faster and better
5035382	2	It's alright. Phone has to be placed on the charge pad a certain way so it's not as convenient as you would think. But does save the hassle of plugging in a cord
5029906	3	This product works fine if it is being used in an environment which is at room temperature. However, from my experiences, if the room or car becomes hot, the device will stop working. Very disappointing.
5034936	1	I was promised two A wall chargers and I only received one
5034811	0	It's ok, I did think that it would charge faster than connecting the charger directly to the phone. It is convenient to have to just place the phone on top, you just have to make sure it's centered right to make the charge happen. I'm keeping it, but I think I would not have bought it had I known there is no difference in the charging time.
5036126	3	It is practical and usually functional. Sometimes it will be sitting there and the charging will stop for no reason. And if I don't catch it, it will sit there for an hour or more (or all night) not charging. This is frustrating and not sure if it is a design flaw or a flaw with this unit specifically.
5031132	3	I was hoping that this was going to work with my Galaxy S7 Active.  I've had it for a couple years, and now the charging port is getting worn, and many cables don't make a positive connection, so I thought I'd give wireless charging a try in order to extend the life of the port.  When I place the phone on the wireless charger, It looks like it's going to charge, but then immediately my phone displays "Wireless Charging Paused", and will fail to resume.  I left my phone, with about a 60% charge, on the wireless charger last night, and woke up to a phone with a 30% charge.  I've tried all the troubleshooting methods I could find online, but none of them worked.
5036867	3	It charges great.  But it cuts of power once fully charged and start discharging.  Poor design by Samsung in terms of discharge.
5030300	2	Seems to be really finicky about "engaging" with phone to  charge.  I also have the Samsung stand up model....no issues with it.  I just sit the phone on it and it starts charging.  This one, I sit the phone on it and sometimes it starts charging and sometimes it doesnt.  I then have to pick phone up and sit it back down and then it will charge.  Sometimes I have to do it 2 or 3 times before it will start charging ??.... annoying..!!
5035584	2	Here's another one that don't have enough instructions???
5033469	3	I was expecting the phone to charge at the same speed as i f connected directly. It probably took 3x as longer. Ok if you set it up at night and have 8 hours to charge it but not if you have drained the battery and need to charge the phone in a short time. Rather disappointed with how long it takes to charge.
5034570	3	Slow charging and won't completely charge it sometimes. It's a pain when you wake up in the morning to find the phone was not charged. it's just faster and more reliable to plug it in!
5035621	3	It fails to consistently charge the phone. Many times it will discharge to less than 50%. I have a Galaxy 6s and have tried the various fixes; turn off notifications, put it day dream, turn off screen lock  all with intermittent success. But many times the blue light is flashing in the morning and the phone has discharged. Back to plugging in the phone. I know that will work.
5037190	2	This product does not work with the 56 edge only the s6 I got mine today and it was not working with my phone and so I went into AT&T and they told me it only works with the s6 not edge :(
5037455	2	Don't let the large size of this charger and the fancy lights fool you, it is not easy to place your phone on this correctly. It is especially hard to put it in the correct position if you wake up in the middle of the night and grab your phone to check the time. The rubber ring that is supposed to help keep the phone on there actually makes this process even worst, rather than being able to simply slide the phone to re-position it on the charger you have to pick it all the way up and hope you place it in the correct spot. All in all I would never recommend this to a friend. Just get the cheap $15 versions from third parties. They work 100% better. But you lose the fancy lights.
5036152	3	This thing frequently charges for 5-10 minutes, then stops working out of the blue. Tired of starting my day off with my phone battery at 30%. Going to ask for a refund.
5036162	3	This is such a great idea but it works sporadically. It will light up with the blue light to indicate it's charging and then minutes later for no obvious reason, it will flash instead (meaning charging has stopped). It will turn green indicating a full charge, even when the charging is not at 100%. The days it works, it's great. Otherwise, not so much. Unfortunately, I'm returning it.
5035438	2	The add doesnt say it will only work when you buy a specific case that is made to work with it. I already spent $30 on a case now its worthless
5038393	2	Hard to find the spot where it charges my S6
5038230	3	This sounds like a great concept but it is garbage, It takes forever to charge and even when I wake up I don't have a full battery. it also takes a while to get the connection between the phone and charging pad. I am extremely unimpressed.
5035518	2	I'm sure it's great without a phone case, but with an Otterbox it's very temperamental.  It can really tick you off when you grab your phone in the morning with no charge even though it indicated it was charging. Happens about 40% of time to me.  I'm using my charging cord again....
5030644	3	I have a Samsung S8 and figured this would be a great accessory.  Should be really easy to just set up and throw the phone on to charge, right?  Wrong!  I plugged the charger in and put my phone on it and it gave me the current charge percentage and then "Charging Paused".  What???? I couldn't find anything on the Samsung site to troubleshoot this problem so I went outside of Samsung and found various outside support with all kinds of suggestions to correct the problem - download this update, try sliding it up and down against the phone, try this or that.  Sorry.  That's way too much work.  I returned it the same day for a refund and am happy to go back to a cable that I know will charge without me having to do headstands to make it work.  (Kudos to Amazon for the free return and shipping, however).
5035566	3	Pretty awful. Randomly stops charging and starts blinking blue for no reason. I used to try and use it to charge my phone overnight but when your phone is done charging it never starts recharging and your screen turns on. So if your phone is done charging 3 hours into your sleep, it'll be at 80% when you wake up. Not to mention sometimes when you put your phone on it the screen comes on and never shuts off (Yes, I have screen timeout set to 5 seconds).
5038249	2	Not as convenient as I'd hoped for: 1. The phone must be placed in just a certain position or no charging occurs. I expected it to be easier to use, as in simply being able to place the phone on the charger for it to work. I frequently have to keep adjusting the position before charging occurs. At night when I am tired I don't want to fiddle around like that. 2. It has never fully charged the phone despite the phone sitting on it without being moved all night long. It seems to stop at about 86% charge. 3. No charging occurs if the phone is face down. I prefer not being awakened by the phone lighting up as notifications take place, which is why face down is how I like to charge it overnight. All in all, the idea is great but not yet fully developed. I do not believe it is worth the price.
5033355	3	Slow to charge:( plug in much faster
5037729	3	So I have had the Galaxy S6 for close to 3 months now. I have had amazing battery life with the phone and in some cases on days where I used my phone very little I could have around 60% battery left once I went to bed around midnight. On heavy usage days I could have my battery around 30% at midnight without charging my phone all day.  I decided to get this wireless charger because I like cool and new things. The first few nights it did charge the phone to 100% but then, it started what a lot of other users are seeing is it would stop charging in the middle of the night once it got to 100% leaving me with a battery around 90% when I woke up. I also found you could enable airplane mode while charging and this would keep your phone at 100% when you wake up. This is not a real solution because if I needed to be reached in the middle of the night for an emergency then no one can get ahold of me.  I also noticed my battery was dieing much faster faster now. Before on days of heavy use I would be left with around 30% battery right before bed. Now all of the sudden my 5% battery warning comes on at 7pm. I was thinking it was some app that was going fubar and I constantly rebooted my phone. No such luck. I then decided to stop using the wireless charger and switched back to a wall outlet charge during the night. The several days after I made the switch my battery life has increased drastically and I do not have to put my phone in airplane mode in the middle of the night. I do not have my 5% low battery indicator hitting me at 7pm.  Now I do not know if this is an issue with the phone or with this wireless charging unit. But, my wife has a Galaxy S6 Edge and she experienced the same problems as I when using this wireless charger. So I am inclined to think it is not a phone issue.  I did also purchase the Verizon wireless charging station and although the issues are not as bad as this Samsung pad I am finding out the wall charger is still the best way to charge my phone.
5029684	3	Even when I carefully place the phone in the center of the pad, 80% of the time, it slides off! You have to be very careful and make sure you keep your eye on it.
