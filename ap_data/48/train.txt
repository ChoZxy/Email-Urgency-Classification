5035220	3	Looks nice, but charge is real slow. Also, cellphone must be completely centered on charger for it to charge.
5033806	3	Charge doesnt last too long.
5033456	0	Did not work for my phone at all
5037995	3	Regardless of how long my device is on it. It never fully chargers. Will even disconnect from charging after a while even if its not charged fully ir touched.
5036932	3	Miserably disappointing item. I bought it and found it would charge my s6 edge but slowly. So I replaced it with another of the same item and it's even worse. I can cleave my phone on the charging pad for 8 hours without disturbing it and it cannot got from 20% to 100% . It will barely get it above 65%.  Two strikes and it's out. I plan on complaining to Samsung as well.
5033333	2	Returned because it does not work with s5.
5036270	2	Has to be positioned perfectly to work
5037040	2	Had no idea that this does not work for the Samsung Note 4.
5032815	3	Charges too slow.
5037894	1	Does not come with a cord which is just stupid.  The first one I got just straight up didn't work.  For an alternate get the Mini Wireless Charger which comes with a fast charging wall plug and cord.  The mini makes you wonder why they made the other one big and oddly shaped.
5032881	2	First of all, it's really, really small and even after a charged it as recommended. It didn't charge my galaxy note 4.
5034803	2	Does NOT charge quickly at all...The wall plug does a better job and it does NOT work w/my Galaxy 5.  Only my Galaxy 6.
5036656	3	Does not seem to work well with samsung galaxy s6 edge. Will do a full charge maybe 1 out of every 5 times I use it. Most of the time the screen will blin on and stop charging. I will lay the s6 edge on the charger all night and wake up to a 40% battery charge.  Multiple people seem to be  having this issue and I've tried a few workarounds. Sending the product back for a refund.
5033742	2	Does not charge my Note 4.
5032569	3	The charging pad works, however, it does not charge fast at all. After docking my S8 on it at about 1030pm, my phone still won't be fully charged at 6am. Without buying the fast charge pad I didn't expect the hour and a half charging time, but I definitely expect my phone to be charged before 8 hours.
5035873	2	I've lived with this for about 5 months now. It is very picky about the way you place it on the charger. It needs to be placed carefully to work. It also has randomly not charged my phone overnight. I think when it reaches 100% charge it shuts off. Sometimes I've woken up in the morning to find anywhere from a 5% to 50% charge. It should maintain a full charge, which it doesn't. Cool in theory, but not reliable. And it does not utilize the quick charge feature that the Samsung Galaxy S6 has. It's a long, slow charger.
5033800	3	Paid all that money for it. Didn't know it wasn't fast charging. Been in the drawer since. Unless I left my charger at work. You also have to close out of all apps or it won't even get a full battery.
5037257	2	Yes it does its work and charge the phone. But the purpose of me buying this was to be able to "plug in" the charger faster to the phone that the regular cable charger and because the phone has to be very well centered on the pad it takes me a while to get it in position to charge. It just defeats the purpose of me buying this item.
5030975	4	Completely unacceptable for an obviously used item to be sold as new
5034308	3	Is the Galaxy Note Edge a QI device? My charging pad came in tonight and it's not doing anything.
5036083	2	Not impressed. The Edge screen protector is hard enough to keep on even with a case. This pad requires you to take off your case each time. Waste of money!!
5033011	3	Did not charge fast at all! only charged fast when used card with out charging station.
5037174	3	This charger didn't work from the begining. I didn't return it because I threw out the box. It charges my phone for less than a minute and stops.
5032610	3	Stoped working after less than a year.
5037983	3	Eh... It was nice having it at first but then I soon realized that it charges very slow and that it will stop charging and I'll have to pick my phone up and place it back on the pad for it to start charging again. Kind of annoying but I do love the fact that I can just put my phone on it and not have to worry about plugging it in all the time every night and trying to reach for the charger underneath my bed somewhere. And lastly what I'm upset about is that it doesn't light up all the way. Only 25% of it lights up blue and ONLY blue.
5029851	0	its alright, recomendations are not to leave it plugged in, so that kind of defeats the purpose
5035717	3	It works but the charge is very slow.
5031684	0	Great while it works
5034468	2	Was far too sensitive.  Had to have my phone perfectly set on this for it to charge. Use it a couple of nights to find that my phone had not charged at all. I'll be sticking with the standard cord chargers until this technology gets better and less specific.
5035902	3	I have a new Note 5 and I wanted this to be great, I did not believe it would discharge my phone and ordered it anyway. Bottom line, even when perfectly placed on the pad and charging, it sometimes stops charging, flashes blue, and I wake up to a dead phone. I am going to try the fast charger model. Update: If you have the Note 5 order the Fast Charge Modle
5037259	2	It's not wireless at all. Think you all should refund me.. (double)...false advertisement!!!save your money and don't buy
5035691	3	Doesn't fully charge my Samsung S6 Edge. The light turns green, indicating fully charged, but it's not - sometimes only 50% charged.
5035905	3	I bought this as a gift for my husband.  It doesn't always charge his phone.  He has taken all of the cases off of the phone so there would be no interference and it still won't take a full charge.  The indicator light comes on but it does not fully charge. Doesn't matter how long you leave it on.
5034724	3	Charges so slow and sometimes it won't even charge. I don't use it anymore
5037001	3	This thing sucks . Charges for 10min then starts blinking and stops . I have to be waking up during the night to lift the phone and place it in the charging pad
5036365	2	It looks beautiful! Yes, you need a wireless battery cover for it to work on the galaxy s5 and it appears to me that I should have seen that somewhere in big black bold print!
5038219	3	The worst left phone on pad over night and it only charged too 26 percent I will stick with the cord charge waste of money
5035610	2	They make this look like a wireless charger but it's a pad it has to sit on
5031737	3	Bought this for Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and its more like a trickle charger if you can find the sweet spot to get it to charge. Didn't do what I wanted so I returned it.
5035411	3	Only bad thing I have to say about it is, my phone charges faster plugged up.
5033784	2	Was not a super fast charger as advertised
5035744	2	Doesn't work with Galaxy note 4.  I believe there is an attachment  compartment that can be purchased for the Note 4 for about $35.  Once you have that, this will be a very convenient and sharp looking device.
5029764	3	takes 3 to 4 times longer to charge versus a regular charger... definitely not fast but it works.. Would rather have my money back.
5034905	2	Not worth the bother...doesnt charge correctly all the time if its not placed on the base exactly right. Charge light ia annoying at night
5034915	2	Garbage of a charger. Never worked as advert3.
5036841	0	It's cool. Def not an overnight charger and very particular on how it needs to be placed on there.
5037649	3	Not really worth it in my opinion charges too slow rather have a cord hooked up
5033941	3	Did not work after about a week.
5032962	3	Didn't work at all. I was excited to save money. I made sure my phone was charging when I went to bed, woke up and had less battery
5036161	3	Originally loved this charging pad.  Immediately bought one for my son for Christmas.  The problem is it will not always fully charge the phone.  If I want to charge it all night I have to wake up in the middle of the night and make sure it is still charging otherwise I have phone that is less then fully charged.
5035964	3	Originally gave this product a great review. Exactly 5 months after receiving it, it just stopped charging. Very aggravated!!!!
5036529	3	The a/c adapter that came with this didn't even work with it as it didn't have enough power... It wasn't even the same color as the cable so seems like this product may not have been Brand Spanking new...  I ended up just using another a/c adapter with it and it works great with that power adapter.
5037363	3	I'm still having doubts; I don't know if this is original Samsung. Plug goes off easy, and it won't change colours (red, blue, Green) depending the charging state. It's allways light blue. The box it came in is Green....not the Samsung black and blue.  Another thing...it heats!!! a lot!  I have another of this pads (Samsung store bought) and everything Works great.  This one? mmmmm....
5033983	2	Does not charge as fast as I expected!
5035066	3	It's great to not have to plug in wires when you sit down the phone........but this not a super fast charger
5033836	3	I bought this item due to the high positive reviews. I was extremely shocked when I put the phone on the pad and it told me five and a half hours until fully charged. For that reason I have to rate it a one star.
5036444	3	Unimpressed with this. Does not charge my s6 active for more than 5 minutes. Don't waste your money.
5037365	3	I was extremely disappointed with this product. It starts charging for a few seconds then the blue light starts blinking and it stops charging. I exchanged it for another one thinking it was defective but the new one is having the same issue. After researching on the internet and trying every trick and workaround I found I am giving up.
5032961	3	So slow....thought I would love the convenience, I really don't.
5033071	2	Its just like I rated it, "okay".  It doesn't always pick up that i have placed my phone on it, way more "sensitive" then I expected.  Usually have to place a couple of times before it registers and starts to charge, also not as fast as a straight plug in.  At least in my experience.
5035192	3	I'm nopt sure if the official Samsung wireless charger works better than this one but it gets the job done. the charge doesn't seem to last as long compared to when I plug it in.
5034053	3	So it works and the price is great instead of buying the expensive version from verizon but it charges sooooooo slow so idk.
5035783	0	easier to just plug in your phone
5037453	3	Phone charges to 100% then stops and never restarts. By the time I get up in the morning it's already down to 85%.
5037439	2	Works most of the time. Doesn't fully charge phone at times.  Hard to get on pod at times. Might be my otterbox.
5034660	3	Charges slowly.
5033244	3	I tried charging my Galaxy S5 with S-view wireless charging flip case and the pad won't even recognize it's there.  Yes, I tried troubleshooting steps (moving it around, etc.), but it will not charge on this pad.  I have a 3-coil stand at work and it works with it perfectly.  The coils are probably to far beneath the surface of the pad, but it just doesn't work for me.  And no... I'm not ready to give up my S5 yet.
5036500	3	Broke in less than 2 weeks. The charging pad no longer works. I want my money back or a new one
5034171	3	works well i wish i would have gotten the fast charge model
5035424	3	Works good, but if you leave your phone on it to charge overnight, it stops charging after full. It will not keep it charged after full charge.
5032087	3	Didn't work at all. Had to send it back.
5036812	0	I can't say because the case back/battery cover needed in order to this charger to work with my galaxy S5 has been on back order for 6 weekend
5034488	3	DOA.....
5032108	3	IS FAR FROM FAST CHARGING.  TAKES ABOUT 4-6 HOURS TO CHARGE MY S6
5036588	3	Slow at charging.. very slow
5033842	3	Just got this device and it will not charge my S5. I fiddle with it. I took the cover off. I placed it almost everywhere on the device. 1 hour later nothing. I don't have time for all this tinkering. I am sending it back
5036063	3	Slow charging and the phone has to be just right or it won't charge.  I sent it back.
5035533	4	This was returned - didn't work at all.
5030086	3	Works but takes forever to charge.
5032843	3	It's convenient to use but has a tendency to pause charging for some odd reason leaving you with a dead phone in the morning.  Sometimes I have position the phone a number of times before it begins to charge.
5038427	4	No reply from seller or Amazon on a replacing the faulty charger. It will just stop charging sometimes for no reason and others it won't even connect. When it does connect, it sometimes just stops charging and begins to blink again. I tried restarting it. I tried a new case, no case, amd everything i could think of. Then i heard that there are fake or non oem ones being sold on here.
5033864	3	Doesn't charge very fast. It's not a fast charge so unless you plan to leave you phone alone for hours it's not worth it.
5035938	3	Was a piece of garbage. The plug in wire broke after a few days of receiving. Would not recommend to anyone
5035603	3	It stopped working correctly after 1 month. It will only charge my Galaxy note 5 if I restart the phone first. Not worth the money.
5037182	3	First off, this does in fact charge my Galaxy Note 5 wirelessly and it is as fast as the charger that came with my phone. So it does what it's supposed to do. But, before I bought this I read a review that pointed out a small, important detail saying it stops charging when full and DOES NOT RESUME charging until you pick the phone up and place it back down on the pad again. I thought that was ridiculous and I was hoping he was wrong or had some other odd problem that I would not encounter, because why would they program it that way? It doesn't make any sense, right? But, it turns out he was right. And that small detail makes this charger basically useless to me. I want my phone to be fully charged when I wake up. But since my phone charges in about 2 hours it has a good 6 hours or more for the battery to slowly drain so that by the time I get up it's nowhere near 100%. So I've returned it and decided to stick with the normal cord that my phone came with because that will keep charging my phone all night.  Update: I have discovered a different wireless charger that does not have the same problem. You can find it here: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015O4EZHA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01
5029901	2	Does not state anywhere that you have to purchase a separate cord.
5037613	3	There is a problem with the black chargers.  I purchased two of them (one for office one for home) and both will stop charging after about 5 minutes.  After searching around the internet, there is a whole bunch of threads on Android Central with people complaining of the same issue.  Samsung should really do a major recall of this particular item.  I have a Note 5 and was really excited at being able to wirelessly change.  The promise is a wonderful thing, but when you go to pick up your phone after you think its been charging all night, it is disheartening to see it near on flat.  I have returned both units to Amazon.
5032203	2	Once you I got my phone in the correct position, the charger worked fine. The problem was finding the right position. Most times I had to move my phone on the charging pad at least 5 or 6 times, before the charging began.
5033957	3	Sometimes charges. Not always consistent. Would not purchase it again
5034834	2	The description didn't make it clear that this item was NOT  the quick charge devise.  It's not what I thought I was buying.
5034565	2	I thought this was suppose to charge your phone wirelessly, meaning no wire! But you still need to plug the disk into a charger and have it on the charger for your phone to charge. I may have misread but the whole point for me was to be able to charge up the circular disk and have that to charge my phone in the event I am in an area without outlets. I don't really see what this is for other than maybe a broken connecter on the phone where the charger plugs in. Is there something I am missing here???
5034705	0	IT's ok.  I have to keep putting it down harder.
5029944	3	does not work very well, having alot of issues.
5038037	3	Disappointed.  I leave my S6 Edge on the wireless Charging Pad before I go to bed and before I leave to work in the morning half of the battery already discharged. On the other hand, with the Adaptive Fast Charging USB Wall Charger, It is guaranteed to have a fully charged battery when I wake up in the morning.
5033267	2	Doesn't work with Samsung Note 4 Qi Wireless Charging Receiver, Built-in Module Card.
5036216	0	Joke...
5037263	2	works most the time, sometimes phone is sitting on it not charging for some reason?  Maybe its the thickness of the phone cover, although people say too thin or too thick can both be problems.  Had to move it out of my room though.  Kept waking me up with its flashing.  I don't know what the flashing means, but its too bright in a dark room.  Works fine as the charger in the living room though.
5037211	2	very slow to charge and is not compatible with my note 4. had to buy a back which made my phone too bulky for my phone case. its compatible with my kids phones but since its so slow they don't leave it on long enough to recharge.
5033560	3	Doesn't always provide a  reliable charge.  I've encountered multiple instances where it says it's charging but by morning I've only gotten a partial charge.
5036340	3	Weak
5030172	2	does not charge with case on, slow charging.
5032537	3	This is the slowest charger I have ever used! If you are charging your phone overnight then it MIGHT work...OR it will say "charging paused" and you'll wake up to a nearlu dead battery. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
5035537	3	Worked great, after I got the third one. Not sure why these things only work half the time but once you get a working unit, it's all good
5035777	3	Bought it on sale and works just fine. I wish it charged faster. Sometimes It took almost 2 hours to fully charge my Galaxy S5 when it was at 50%.
5035334	3	Doesn't always go into Fast Charge mode. Works well overnight.
5033020	3	Everything looked good and brand new when I got the device. But since the first time using it instead of it charging my phone it's drains my phone battery. Not sure if I got a faulty product or not. My phones brand new as well so that can't be the issue happens to both mine and my husbands androids
5035572	2	Whats the purpose of this? If I'm near an outlet, I can use the outlet to charge my phone. I thought this was a disk I could charge and then take with me for areas where I wasn't near an outlet. This is a money waster !!!!!
5037741	3	Not a mission critical solution. Charging indicator may or may not indicate that your device is actually charging. May stop charging without warning. Will charge to 100% then stop... allowing your device to discharge till you pick it up.  Over night you can lose most of the charge depending upon the active features of the phone. Best used as a desk side solution for very short charging periods. NOT suited as a bed-side over night charging option.  CONCLUSION:  Value limited to a small group of special needs users.
5037692	2	The charger itself works fine, but I didn't get a wall plug with it, even though it says it's included. Otherwise, it would have received 5 stars
5030996	3	OMG. So slow. If I leave it on the desk and have conference calls to take, it dies.
5036342	2	We haven't been able to use it because apparently you need another piece in order for it to work.
5034408	0	Don't waist  your  money
5033439	3	Phone charges very slow
5037103	2	Very sensitive to exact placement before charging begins
5034127	0	The product works intermittently on my Samsung edge
5037043	2	Not what I expected.  It chargers my new Galaxy 6 edge very slow.
5034691	2	I tried this charger with high expectations. I have to say this thing does not work as you would expect. You have to remove your case everytime you put it on the charger and half the time it still disconnects itself. it has made this charger almost useless. The Verizon Wireless charger is better than this one.
5037740	3	Charges intermittently
5035158	3	I have had this wireless charging pad for about 4 months.  I use it with a Galaxy S6 with Diztronic TPU case (awesome case by the way).  I only gave it 3 stars because it is very hard to position it so that the phone stays charged.  I will put it on the charger and one of 3 things will happen.  It will light blue and start charging then after a couple of minutes it will stop charging and blink blue.  Sometimes it will actually light up blue and charge all the way until the phone is at 100% turn green.  Lastly every once and a while it will turn blue start charging then turn green way before the phone is fully charged.  It is very frustrating.  Today I thought even though the case it thin it has to be a issue with the case so I removed it and tried to charge it with the same results where it charges for a bit then blinks blue.  For my desk at work I got a wedge shaped wireless charger that has 3 charging coils in it.  I will end up getting another 3 coil charger to replace this one.  I set my phone on it and walk away.  It has never stopped charging my phone it always works flawlessly.
5032984	0	Do not buy
5038366	0	Not that cool
5033897	3	Charges all the way then starts draining- i don't use it anymore bc of this
5034124	3	doesn't really charge the phone very well
5037320	3	Works, but sometimes doesn't charge phone completely
5036682	3	I purchased this product 2 months ago and with light use it is destroyed exterior  broken charge door fell off not impressed with this product
5033426	3	This item never worked for me!
5036814	3	charger is a bit slow
5031710	3	Takes forever to charge. But you don't need your phone for a couple of hours it works fine.
5035747	2	It only connects if you put it in the perfect spot and loses connection  without anything  touching it. I currently use it to lift up the front of my Blu-ray player so the remote will work, works great for that. I bought it even after seeing some bad reviews figured some people just got bad ones but now I know it's just what they are ....Beautiful Paperweights.
5034195	3	It works well. When it works. I notice that it takes usually 2-3 tries to get it to "take" when I put my phone on it. I have an Otter Box case. The other odd thing that happens is that it will simply stop charging and start blinking blue sometimes, and I have to pick it up and put it back to restart charging. This is particularly frustrating when you put your phone on the pad at night at 30% and it starts charging...and then you wake up to a phone at 31%.  Overall, it is convenient...but it seems to struggle to keep up when you charge through a phone case (which I'm guessing most people have).
5037132	2	I misinterpreted this product as something that could charge your device on the go without wires. The pod still requires a cable to be plugged into the wall, computer, etc. So I really don't see the point of this product.
5036808	3	placed phone on the charger that was on a night stand ... when i returned after about 10 minutes later, the phone was on the floor?? So I put the phone back on the charger and about 20 minutes later I saw the phone completely slide off the charger.  It seems that the charger "kicked off" the phone.  Must be something with the magnetic field that moved the phone off the charger.  I can't afford for the charger to kick the phone off the night stand and break the phone... I'm sending it back.
5037158	3	Piece of junk. Would not work.
5037871	3	Does not always work
5035641	3	Horrible! The device stops charging for apparently no reason. Place it on the charge before bed and in the morning the phone is not fully charged - have noticed that a lot of the time the device will flash three times and the stop charging. Had read that the charging would be slow but it is extremely slow. Don't waste your money!
5036660	3	Bought the item back in August.  It now charges inconsistently.  I have to constantly take the phone on and off to get it to charge. Sometimes it tells me the phone is fully charged and teh green light comes on, but it has not fully charged yet.  I bought a compatible unit that i use at my office which works much better.
5035834	1	It arrived disheveled as if it were a returned item, even though it was sold to me as new. Doesn't charge consistently. Even when I take the case off my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, it will stop charging and then start charging and does this cycle constantly until I remove the device all together. Sometimes it will work but there is no rhyme or reason for when it will charge as expected or not. I have unplugged the charger and stopped using it as it is junk. I don't trust this seller and will not buy an item from them ever again.
5033990	3	Doesn't provide fast charging.  Slow to charge my Samsung Edge 6+.  Stopped using it and now use it as a coaster.
5035658	3	I was expecting this to charge my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge) a little bit faster than it does. I realize the technology likely cannot charge a phone faster than plugging it in just yet, however for the price tag, it's not worth the convenience it provides; don't get me wrong, the convenience of setting your phone on a charging station on your nightstand is glorious, but for $35 I would have liked a bit more power.
5038185	3	The short answer is that it sort of works. It will charge the phone, but after charging the phone begins to discharge the battery and the charger never turns on again. This is a real problem while charging the phone overnight. You wake up with a battery at 30%.  The $15 Itian charger doesn't suffer from this problem. So, I ordered a few of them and I am going to take the Samsung charger to work .... since I am constantly picking my phone up and placing it back on the charger. I can also easily check my phone (since I am awake) to see what level the battery it at....  It's surprising that the off-brand works better than Samsung's ....  The one thing that is nice is that this charger comes with a power module. That's got to be worth at least $10. So, maybe I only overpaid by $10 ($35-$10 = $25 ... vs. $15 for the Itian charger)...
5030006	2	I was under the impression you can charge your phone on this pad for a short time without the pad plugged in. The pad needs to always be plugged in, not a portable charger. You also have to place your phone about 2 to 3 times on the pad to charge. It has to be centered perfectly to charge. Also, it will not charge through any phone case. I just plug the cord  directly into the phone  own to charge it, I don't even use the pad anymore
5035607	0	If you have all day for it to charge by all means buy it but I'm more happy with the fast charger it came with
5032349	3	It is NOT a fast charger. Though the shipping was great, I didn't care for the fact that it was almost 30 bucks and takes twice as long to charge my phone.
5031762	3	okay but slow... too slow for my high usage. sent it back!
5038227	3	Main problem I had with this is that it would stop charging my device after it reached 100%.  After charging overnight, in the morning I would find my phone less than 95% charged, sometimes down to 75-80% depending on what apps I had running I suppose.  Unsure if this is by design so that it preserves the total battery life but I can't start my day if my battery is already a quarter used up.  I returned this device.
5036243	0	Cord charges fast, but the pod takes twice as long.  But convenient for drop and go.
5030212	3	I thought I was buying a fast charger and I am still not sure what went wrong. This charger is very slow. Charging takes about 3 times what it takes with the regular cord charger. Be careful what you purchase when comparing products. I think I missed the fine print.
5031372	3	Does not charge fast and very sensitive to where you place the phone for charging to work.
5035639	2	Doesn't appear to be genuine Samsung.
5032342	3	Love the convinence of not having to plug the phone but it takes too long to charge. Thought it would charge quicker.
5036333	2	Very disappointed in the quality of this Samsung product for several reasons.  1.  I ordered it for the ease of not having to plug my phone in each time recharge is required.  However, according to the instructions, you need to unplug the device after each use which defeats the purpose.  2.  It takes a lot longer to charge my phone on this unit vs. plugging it directly into the fast charge cable.  3. I received a new phone case for Christmas and this device will not charge the phone while the case is on so I have to remove the case each time (and it's a thin plastic case!!).  Definitely not seeing the benefits stated in the description of this product.
5037060	3	I was looking forward to the convenience of wireless charging, but the connection required multiple re-positioning of the phone to the charging pad to sense the connection (with and without a protective case).  At times it will disconnect itself in the middle of the night and I will wake up to an uncharged phone.  It's so bad, I'm just going back to a wired charger.  I do not recommend.
5036858	3	seems to be a bit quirky.  a bit slow~ish to charge.  Sometimes when we put the phone on the charger all night it doesn't even fully charge.  Haven't read the instructions to see if we are doing something wrong, but for a quick place to lay down your phone, this is great.  We have it on our piano in the living room and I like the fact that I can just set my phone down quickly when I'm busy in the kitchen and it will charge.
5034441	3	I bought 'used - like new' condition and don't know whether it's because of that or not, it takes so long to charge. When it doesn't have any battery left, it takes about 2 hr 44 mins (it shows that when charged) which is way too slow compared to my previous charger. The only good thing is that I don't need to look for slot to put the cable in. Other than that, nothing stands out on this charger. I wouldn't buy it again nor recommend to anyone.
5036573	3	Very slow charge.
5034304	2	EXPECTATIONS FAILS
5033079	3	Disappointed in this.  Sometimes it doesn't detect my phone on it. Charges very slowly when it does. The phone gets very hot on it too.
5034982	3	I did not get the wall plug and it intermittently charges. It starts to charge and the it starts flashing. Not impressed with it at all. Stopped using it.
5038154	0	Its ok. Seems to charge faster plugged in.
5035206	3	I thought it would charge FASTER. Who cares about charging wirelessly if it isn't faster.
5033198	2	My husband bought this and hates it. You have to sit your phone on it just right to get it to work and it charges very slowly. We will be returning this to get a better one that has the fast charge.
5038260	3	it does charge, not to slow but make weird ticking noise when charging S6edge
5036077	3	It didn't last long.  Didn't collaborate with my Samsung 6 Edge.  It only charged for a week.
5035278	2	Does not work for the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge phone
5036251	3	I bought two of these for my phone and my wife's phone both are Samsung S6's.  They are convenient - just drop the phone on the charger and it starts charging.  But it doesn't fully charge the phones.  We put the phones on the charger a overnight and the following morning they are only 75-85% charged. The weird thing is that if I lift the phone off the charger and put it back on the charger, sometimes it will charge to near 100% .  Also, the instructions don't describe the indicator lights and their meaning.  It goes blue when it starts charging, but then the mysteries begin....  green, flashing green, flashing blue, or off. No idea what these are trying to tell me. Update:  Tried for a couple of weeks.  Still erratic - often just stops charging and lets the phone battery die while it sits on the charger plate.  Returning the chargers
5033039	3	Very slow charge.  I ended up unplugging from the pad and charging directly into my phone via the wire.
5035846	3	Takes forever to even go 5 %
5032513	3	This charges very slow about 10% per half hour. So over 5 hours for a full charge!
5032996	3	When I first bought it, it worked fine. However it only lasted for about two weeks. It will no longer charge my phone, it says it can't connect.
5038344	0	Annoying post-purchase harassment.
5035865	2	It charges more slowly than the cord and don't even try to use this if you have a big plastic case around your phone.  You'll have to take the case off to use it.
5030642	3	Does not fast charge your Samsung, even without a case. Its fine, if its your last option.
5038069	2	Works okay.  Have to center the phone for it to charge.  Very slow charge compared to wire charging.
5034074	3	Not as fast as they say it is .
5034470	3	Not a fast charger
5033798	3	This charger sucks. 1 there another charger which is the white one that is the one that charges quickly, this on actually charges your phone slower then using the cord. Not worth getting, so disappointing, also the cord that comes with this doesn't charge your phone that we'll either, I'm just going keep the original charger.
5033287	3	charges phone well, even works through my otterbox defender. however you cant use bluetooth while the phone is on the charger, it becomes very choppy
5030969	3	This is an okay charger but the light is just too bright to use in the bedroom. There should be a way to turn down or disable the LEDs while charging. Also, the provided charging cable is too short.
5030019	3	Use only three months and after that can't wireless charged anyone
5036193	2	It doesn't tell you that you need a type of receiver to go on the battery to pick up the charge from the pad. So I as of yet have to find the receiver then I will know how much I like the product.
5036253	3	Not impressed with product.  The company that sells it here is great and fast. But Samsung wireless charging pad is not very good.  I recommend this for my desk at work where my phone gets little use but can keep its charge all day.  It cannot quick charge which most of us have become accustomed to and it charges devices very very slowly.
5037909	3	Love this thing.  I don't know if it actually does, but it seems like this charges the phone faster than plugging into a usb wall plug.  Blue light when it's charging, green light when it's done.  I use it with a Galaxy S6 phone that has a Tech21 case on it.  edit...  After using it for a year, I've become to hate this thing.  You have to slam the phone down on it several times to get a charge connection through the Tech21 case.  If you don't shut the phone off while charging, and you get an alert of some sort, it interrupts and stops the charging.  Many times I get up in the morning to find my phone at 30% because it was interrupted during the night.  Also there is no fast charge capabilities.  The YooTech, is a much much better charger, costs less and has Quick Charge capabilities https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZQ9F4M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5030422	2	Very displeased in this product. Not only did it not work the way I had expected, it only worked for about two weeks. Took FOREVER to get a full charge ! I wish I could get my money back. I'm only giving it a star is because the review requires it.
5033328	3	works only sometimes and the cable fell apart after the first use
5037222	2	Would be a great charger but you have to place the phone just right on the base or it will not charge. Once the phone is fully charged the charger shuts off, so if you are using it as you sleep you wake up to a phone that is at 70 percent charge because it will not start charging against unless you take the phone off and place it back on.
5036105	3	1/5 Recieved quickly, prime ftw, and it seems to be a very high quality build. I generally don't have anything but great things to say about Samsung but I regret buying this for three reasons.  Cons: First and most importantly the charge time is just garbage.  With my note 5 if I am streaming Pandora or Spotify and put it on the charger it will power enough to not drain the battery, but you won't actually see an increase in battery life. Annoying.  Secondly when you toss your phone on it at night it will STOP charging once it reaches 100%. But if it hits 100 at like ten pm it will just sit there not charging all night. So you pick it up 8 hours later with like 90%. Minor annoyance but still an annoyance.  Thirdly, positioning. It's not as simple as if the phone is resting on it it's charging. Oh no. You have to put it on, wait a second or two, then position it a little more to hit the charging sweet spot. Oh you accidently bumped it a tiny amount? Yeah stops charging.  Pros:  Kinda cheap price? Ish. Build quality seems solid. So even though it hardly works I'm sure it's going to continue hardly working for five years at least.  Summary: Do not buy. Recommend shelling out the extra $30 or so and getting the rapid charge version. Hopefully it's been tweaked to fix the s*** charging speed, annoying tiny sweet spot, and auto shut off. A for effort Samsung but there are some things you can't cut corners on. Still love my note 5 though.
5032328	2	I bought this to work with my Samsung Galaxy S8+. It does not work through the Otterbox Defender case (it will work if you take off only the rubber exterior portion). It also takes about 2.5-3 hours to fully charge.
5036065	0	I have no idea. It was agift
5031680	3	This product works but with difficulty. The phone continuously slides off the charger. The rubber disc intended to keep it in place is lower than the charger glass.! Try another
5037657	2	It's ok but you have to be sure to position the cell phone correctly.  Make sure you see the blue light or the cell phone makes the 'charging' chime to be sure it's charging.
5036327	3	My Phone charges better without the wireless pad. I wouldn't recommend.
5038278	2	Does not charge a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.  Seriously, the Samsung charger does not even work on one of their phones.  The Qi charger I found that does work is CHOE Stadium Qi Wireless Charger ,available here on Amazon FOR LESS MONEY!!!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JA7HNZO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00
5033658	0	Good for the price
5031645	2	sometimes hard to find the sweet spot to get it charged easily
5030793	0	Don't know if it works yet. Nothing told me that this needed a receiver too for it to work. I made sure this listed note4. My advice if your phone isn't waterproof and you can still replace your battery then you must have a reciever to use this device.
5035993	2	The scoop:  Used with Galaxy S6  Pro: - saves wear and tear on the wired adapter connection  Con: - sensitive "set" spot to activate the charge, often takes 2-3 times repositioning it on the charger - will discharge after completed charge, meaning if you leave it on overnight, it'll peak and then start to discharge by morning - slower charge compared to the supplied AC adapter  Conclusion: would not buy again; wanted to like it, but it offers no added value
5036982	3	I'm not pleased with this item, it doesn't fully charge the phone.
5037081	3	It's very handy to just set your phone on this charger.  However, sometimes I pick up my phone in the morning to find that the battery is very low (5-10%).  Even though I make sure the blue light comes on indicating "charging", this still happens. If you absolutely depend on your phone being charged, the plug in charger is much more dependable.
5033954	3	Been using now for awhile at first charge was quick and pain less now its hit and miss says its charging and it doesn't or charges for awhile then stop but if I just use usb cable all is well
5032545	3	It charges really slowly. And I don't really find it very functional. It's cool that you can sit your phone down on it to charge, but you have to plug the pad into a wall charger that charges faster than the pad does anyway. So I just unplugged the pad and just started plugging it into my phone. When I sit my phone on to the pad it takes a few hours to get to 50% charged and when I plug it into the charger that came with the pad it takes an hour or two to be at 100%. The pad is not worth it.
5034462	3	Took too long to charge.  Returned it and bought the Fast Charging version which I LOVE!
5036943	3	My Galaxy S6 has been fully charged only once since I purchased this charger. It begins to charge, then, at some point it stops charging and loses power as though it is in use. It doesn't give any indication that it is no longer changing. That's very inconvenient when you expect to pick-up and go with a charged phone, but it's practically empty after being on the charger overnight.
5035882	2	Worthless crap.  I have a Galaxy S6 Edge (which is also garbage), this thing would charge sometimes and mostly not charge.  Aside from surgically placing the phone on the puck (trust me it's quicker to use a USB cable than this thing due to how specific the phone must sit on it), it would charge then at some point in the middle of the night it stops charging and you wake up to 40% battery life instead of 100%  Samsung should be ashamed of themselves.
5031137	2	Will not work with case on phone. Says works with otter box but mine will not. I ordered 2 of them.
5033103	3	slow to charge
5035659	3	I believe my product is defective.  Doesnt charge my galaxy  s6 edge plus as fast as the usb cord solo. Is that normal? I know  its not. MY WIRELESS CHARGER IS DEFECTIVE!!!!!
5037930	3	Only reason this device gets two stars is that it's convenient. The big problem i have with this device is that it charges to slow..
5037552	3	I like the convenience of the charger but it is not for overnight charging. They stop charging when the phone gets to 100 as the phone drains it does not automatically start to recharge so I wake up with a phone at 80 to 90 percent charge
5035168	2	I bought this Samsung charger, thinking the (more expensive) brand name would work better. Boy, was I wrong! I have since purchased a competitive item from yootech, whose less-expensive charger is much easier to use. The Samsung one is really finicky about phone placement on the pad. Even when it starts charging it sometimes stops for no reason I can see, though the phone has not been touched. This yootech item is the one to pick; I've had no problems with it.
5036195	2	It's cool. But if your phone isn't perfectly placed it won't charge
5038363	0	It can be difficult to place the phone correctly on this pad. After reaching 100% the pad turns off after a little while, meaning this is useless for overnight charging as the phone will be below 90%  Edit: I discovered turning on NFC makes the phone work better. I no longer have any trouble placing the phone in the correct position, but I have no explanation as to why it makes such a difference (Galaxy S6)
5033756	2	it sucks. What's the point being wireless.
5034854	3	randomly stops charging.  then you have to take the phone off then put it back on.  stopped using it.  will probably throw it away because it is usless
5038288	2	Works great.  I use this with my S6 Active on my nightstand.  The LED lights are very dim so they don't distract in the dark of the bedroom.  I like that there is non-slip rubber not only on the bottom but on the top.  That ring you see on the top is the rubber material.  When you set the phone on it and bump it the phone will not move.  Especially good when on the nightstand where you might be groping around at night and could easily bump the phone off the charger and onto the floor.  It is definitely not a rapid charge by any stretch, more like the old 1a chargers, but if you use it while sleeping it will definitely recharge you to 100% overnight.  I haven't tried to time it from a low charge yet to see how long it actually takes, but that's coming.  Update 7/10/15: Okay, after using it for about a month I have to say this thing is a pain to use.  With it's small size it is very sensitive to perfect positioning of the phone to be charged.  I have this on my nightstand with imperfect lighting when I'm ready to stop reading on the kindle app and put the phone on the charger before going to sleep.  I have to fiddle with it a few times to get it to actually recognize and start charging.  Once you get it aligned just so it charges just fine, so long as you don't happen to bump it at all while you are sleeping at night.
5032885	2	Doesnt go through a thin case, and takes forever
5034106	3	Do not buy this product!!!! It over heats so much it started to melt. This could be dangerous and cause a fire! I've had this for less then three months and will not be using it again!!!!
5034690	3	It works but it takes double the time to charge at least... for the price I would have bought 2 normal chargers
5032992	3	takes way to long to charge
5035345	2	You have to place the phone on the charger in a VERY specific location, otherwise it will not charge. Makes placing the phone down as long and as complicated as plugging in a cord, defeating the "set down and forget" vision of having a wireless charger.
5031618	3	Stopped working after 3 weeks, a waste of money.
5037595	3	Does not keep the phone charged and stops charging after it reaches full.
5035668	3	I purchased this for my Samsung S6 Edge and my wife's S6 Active.  We've both tried to charge our phone on it and have had horrible results!  After approximately 3 hours of charging with all apps closed and the screen locked, my phone charges between 3%-5%.  I've tried taking my phone case off, plugging into different outlets, swapping the USB cable, etc and have come to the conclusion that this product has been an absolute waste of money.  ThedGood morning Officer Shaw.  Mission has 4 trainees working on days.  Due to scheduling we were all testing at the same time last Friday.  Is there anyway we can stagger the testing today say 2 come in at noon and the other 2 at 1300 or 1330.  It's just that last week with 8 officers all out of the district at the same time.........put a lot of pressure on the remaining officers.  Someone may have spoke to the FTO office about this already but if not just wanted to let you know.  If I need to contact the Sergeant please let me know.  The disappointment is compounded by the fact that I even made sure to buy a Samsung product. Don't waste your money...you'll only regret it.
5035433	2	This was not what I was expecting.  I would return it but I use the charging cord. This is what I get for always trying to get the next best thing.
5035677	3	I've had this charger for about four months and have had spotty results at best. The charger constantly stops working and flashes the blue light. You then have to pick the phone up and replace it on the pad. Sometimes it will charge to about 90%, then like clock work, start flashing. Not reliable for overnight charging. When working, the pad will charge reasonably fast and does add the convenience of not having to plug in. But not worth the hassle of random disconnects.  I would recommend waiting for the next generation or try another brand.
5033754	3	Phone was on the charger for 10 hours, and only gained 60% battery. Rather have the cord.....
5035709	3	This works perfectly for my Samsung galaxy s6. We bought one for mine and one for my husband. For some reason his will start flashing and stop charging his galaxy s6. We even tried switching and the same thing happened.
5035532	3	Very disappointed. It never fully charges my phone. This must be a knock off.
5033863	2	Have to get the phone juuuust right for it to charge. If you breathe wrong and move it and don't notice, you have a dead phone waiting for you in the morning.
5029613	2	Did not charge our phones. Says its compatible with Samsung 8s
5037389	3	This is very slow in charging the phone.
5032575	3	Don't waste your money on this. It is the slowest charging imaginable.
5030421	3	Worked great but just shy of 1 year the circular light no longer covers the diameter and there when charging it will stop before it's complete. It looks like Samsung will replace it (I'm waiting to hear from them).
5035040	3	It overheat my phone in minutes
5035329	2	When it works it's great ! You have to make sure you have the phone on it exactly where it is supposed to be (could be because I have a cover on my phone) or after 30 minutes or so it will stop charging and start flashing . This morning all the lights were off . No blue or green .... nothing ! And my phone was just about 64 percent charged ! Which is not good because I depend on it to charge as I sleep  . Most of the time however it works fine .... Just a note to add , I upgraded to an s7 about 3 months ago , and have had no issues at all . I'm thinking the problem was with the s6 phone .
5037834	2	Sent back did not work with my phone. It is a very small disc my phone is a 6.3 screen barely fit on the disk is supposed to charge it ?? Not
5036347	3	takes too long to charge. Just use the Samsung rapid plug in. It works but once you hit 100% in the middle of the night it will no longer charge. I wake up with about 88% most mornings.
5037053	3	The design and functionality is great...the light it omits is not as great. I use this at night next to my bed, so the light is definitely an issue. The only upside (which could also be a downside) is that when charging is complete, the light eventually turns off. But that means when I wake up my charge is not at 100%. I like it well enough to keep using it, but for the price it's probably not worth it.
5035496	3	Works fine, but after few minutes will stop charging and you have to get up to move the phone so it starts charging again. I have 2 s6 edge and try to remove the case but it didn't help....
5033563	2	This didn't work with my Nexus 6. My other Samsung wireless charger did though so maybe this one was just a dud.
5037025	2	It gets off the charger if its not placed on right. I did and if it gets bumped its sensitive. My charger with the phone charges faster than this.
5036138	2	Will not charge my phone with my case on it. My case is thin... very disappointing!
5035464	3	Although it does charge my phone wirelessly, it's a very slow charge.
5037531	0	It's a nice charger. but I deducted 2 stars because once it charges 100%, it stops charging. Wouldn't be good for a person who wants to charge it overnight while they sleep. Unless they want to wake up several times during the night to pick up the phone and put it back on the charger to keep charging.
5037019	2	I wanted a charger that you can take anywhere, and be able to charge your phone without having to plug the charger in. With this charger, you still have to plug it into a receptacle. Very Poor.
5035041	3	A bit flaky charging.  Sometimes the phone charges up fine other times it starts the stops then starts again, very annoying.  I have tried removing the case on the phone to see if that was the cause but it still turns on and off.  I would not recommend this.
5037462	4	It did not work had to send it back to Samsung for an exchange, i did not know how to contact amazon
5036164	2	This is NOT for any phone other then the S6 and the S6 edge. I have an s5 and it does not work. Contacted samsung and they informed me it is not compatible.
5032803	3	It takes a long time to charge and of I receive a test or email notification it stops charging. So if I set it at night and receive a msg it will not be charged in the morning. So I turn it off and then my alarm will not work.
5031768	3	Didn't work at all and didn't offer a single sentence of troubleshooting. Garbage.
5033194	2	The device came exactly, and possibly even better, than expected. Obviously brand new, and everything was included.  Why only 3 stars? 1. From what I understand from the instructions, you're supposed unplug the device when you're not using it. If I still have to plug something in and out, then isn't it just as easy to use a regular charger? 2. I had a very thin caseology case on my Samsung Galaxy S7, and the device was very picky about the placement of my phone to be able to pick it up. There is a recommendation to take any cases off. Well, here we go adding another step, which now makes using a regular charger more convenient. 3. It charges super de duper slow. Perhaps I have just been spoiled by the S7's fast charger.
5033737	3	Works as described.  The light on the unit is obnoxious as all @&_#. If you like dark rooms at night sleeping this is like having a lighthouse on your nightstand. A lighthouse with high beams and fog lights that don't dim when headed straight at you. With the sun behind them. Holding flashlights and torches. I actually woke up first night and burnt out my retinas looking at it but I got better.  Better suited to kitchen island or living room charger. Because (this cannot be overstated for dark room sleepers like me) it's like having nuclear fusion and fission on your nightstand at the same time... Next to a space shuttle launch which is loaded with spot lights like Las Vegas would use to promote a boxing match or a free sandwich.  If that's not enough, when done charging: it turns from blue to green. I ran out of space on this review to fully describe and compare the green light, but it's like having the green lantern doing extremely inappropriate things to your eye sockets.
5033917	2	Charges. reasonably quickly BUT (1) if left on the charger overnight, once reaching 100%, it seems to discharge so that the next morning, depending on phone configuration, it may go down to below 50% in our case, and this has been noted by others, and (2) careful charger placement is very important if using a protective back, and some thicker backs and cases don't seem to let the charge through... we tried different cases and backs and some worked well and some didn't.  If you have no thick back protective case or use this charger to top off a charge conveniently and remove the phone when it is at 100%, this is fine but otherwise, not so much... check for these issues right away so you can return if not satisfied.
5030306	3	Cheaper than the stand/charger I bought earlier.  Does not seem to quick charge, not even a little bit.  Wireless is about all that saves it, better options out there.
5033058	3	Used this for about a week then gave it to my husband. Didn't charge quickly and made my phone flash throughout the night which would wake me up.
5037701	3	I have the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Love my phone and was SO excited to have a wireless charging capability. HOWEVER, when I got this, it worked, what I thought was great. But two nights in a row i used it by my bed and I woke up to a phone only 82% charged.  It sat on the charger for at least 6 hours. Disappointed with this. It's not as fast charging as the cord that came with it.  Still like the idea, but disappointed with overall product
5032677	3	Bought this an only used it once. I rnded up plugging the phone directly into the cable. Charges much, much faster that way.
5037770	3	Has to be plugged the entire time to charge plus takes forever to charge my phone on a perfect flat area
5032647	3	I had friends tell me that this product would change my life, based on the sheer convenience of just laying my phone down on the charger. With that being said my expectations were high. Know that when you are buying this you are not buying a fast charger. I should have read more into the product description... instead I read reviews... not my best purchase ever. I will be returning it.  As a side note this product would start charging my phone and then my phone would say "charging paused". This happened after only two uses. I could not find a setting on my phone that would alleviate the problem.
5031958	3	It was stop to work last 3 days of use
5034799	2	Very Disappointing.  The unit does not work thru my case, "Speck".  It takes more time to take the case on and off than it would be to just plug in the traditional charger.  The only redeeming value is that I paid $15 including shipping and it came with a regular 2A. wall charger that is worth at least $10 so not a total loss.
5035408	2	Read other reviews that said it works with case on phone....it doesn't. Works well as just a charger.
5037447	2	Was excited to get this then really disappointed when I tried to charge my S6 Edge+ only to see the flashing blue light.  I've tried with the cover on and off with the same result.  Like others have stated, it's a great concept but terrible application of the concept.  I normally read the negative reviews before I buy a product online but, Samsung is usually a solid product and I didn't this time.  I will not make that mistake again.
5037351	3	Bad one , Doesn't work
5034052	2	I plugged in the pad, the LEDs came on, i placed my Samsung Galaxy S6 on the pad, and nothing. i have tried every possible step in troubleshooting this, and im not sure whether its the phone or the pad at this point.
5033093	0	I received it but I did not know I needed a different battery cover in order for it to function properly. I'm currently in the process of purchasing one so I'll give 3 for the meanwhile
5036005	3	Stops charging in the middle of the night all the time. With a case it must be almost exactly centered for it to charge.
5030067	3	Do not buy this product. After 2weeks it was taking up to 4 hours to fully charge.
5032944	0	Easy to use takes a while to charge. Even using the fast charger plug
5035038	3	This one sucks, it changes super duper slow, you get a text, message , alert, anything,  your phone stops charging and unless you are there and move it to start charging,  your phone dies.  Never ever buy.  The triangle one by ya..... works amazing!
5036995	2	DO like the fact that it will charge wirelessly for my GS6 Active - BUT, you've got to make sure you position it EXACTLY in the right place, because I DON'T LIKE the fact that it may either not charge at all, or flash the screen constantly (as in trying to sync/begin charging perpetually, over and over again). Another very messed up problem that needs to be overcome with the wireless charging is that once it tops out (100%), it will start to discharge the battery, and not trickle-charge to maintain 100% battery life when taking off charge in the morning. Needs to be resolved to make this a solid solution!
5036501	3	charges very slow
5036532	3	This charger is slow!  Maybe I am spoiled by my Fast Charger- not impressed. I have a Fre Life proof case which may be slowing things down.
5037911	2	Very difficult to get it to actually charge my phone
5034362	3	It's so slow! I expected a little more from this charger. It's faster to just use the wall charger.
5037297	3	Doesnt always charge ur phone correctly.
5037810	0	Not as fast as I would like but it works :)
5038446	2	I purchased this charging pad thinking since it was a Samsung it would work with my phone Samsung S4 WRONG it will not work on my phone.  I must send it back for a refund.  Does anyone know which charger will work for a Samsung S4?
5032479	3	Worked great for the first month. Then slowly started having issues with the charging speeds. Now it won't charge at all. Don't waste your money.
5033570	3	dosnt WORK ...
5035204	3	I started noticing issues at 2 months. It would randomly stop charging. Now it won't even turn on.
5031153	3	Stopped working after a few hours and wouldn't power back up.
5030023	3	It charges my  Samsung S 8 very slowing
5032952	2	Useless.  If you have a fast charging USB, it won't work here.  Might as well plug your phone directly to the USB.  It looks convenient , but it really isn't.
5036702	3	Really bad connectivity, constantly stops charging all of a sudden.
5036122	2	This product need to be patterned so the the base came be unplug and use as a portable charger
5036973	3	What a piece of  garbage,  I threw it away, never worked, don't  waste your time or money
5036747	2	This product does not work for the Note 5 (brand new). I place my phone on the charger. The blue light goes on and it says it is charging. Within 5 minutes the blue light is flashing and the phone is no longer charging. ckick on the one star rating you will see a multitude of others with the same problem.
5035510	2	Its hard to charge with a case had to try a few times to make it connect to it but it works though. Works great without a case on your phone. And not as fast of a charger as i wanted the regular quick charger is way faster
5037085	2	This product will not charge the phone through a mophie case.
5036903	2	Use this charger every day for my Samsung Galaxy S6 which is in an OtterBox Defender Series Case.  When you place your phone on the charger it takes a couple seconds for the green charging light to come on and for the audible beep to sound indicating that charging has begun.  Since the charger takes a couple seconds to indicate that it's charging you can't just set the phone down and walk away so you have to stand there until you see the light/hear the beep.  If the phone isn't placed exactly where it needs to be it won't start charging.  If that happens, you can't just slide the phone into the correct position, you have to pick the phone up off the charger and put it down again to kind of "reset" the process.  Sometimes it takes two or three tries, sometimes just one.  This means you could be standing there for almost ten seconds for the phone to start charging.  Doesn't sound like much until you realize just how quickly plugging a cable into your phone is and that it works every time on the first try.  I imagine that the thickness of the phone's case is what's causing the charger to make it more difficult to connect with the phone, but it's not that thick and the delay that sometimes takes place when this happens significantly reduces the so-called convenience of this charger.  The technology is impressive, but I'm not terribly impressed.
5037078	2	The charging pad never really worked right with the cover I had on my phone.  Also the actual charging pad broke and wouldn't even charge after maybe 2 weeks use of it.  The port where the charging cable hooked in broke and it wouldn't work.  The charging cable still works, but not the wireless pad.  I'm very disappointed in this product.
5032511	3	This just simply doesn't work. My phone got so hot without any charge taking place I was actually nervous. Starting to think I got a complete dud. I've tried repositioning with no luck. Really disappointed because this seems so useful if it worked right. It's very small as well, I pictured it being larger for some reason. I'm giving it 1 star for my personal experience. If it had worked at all i would have given at least 4 stars for price and shipment.
5034700	3	I couldn't get the thing to work and I'm so busy, I don't even know if they will take it back, because its been so long since I got it.
5037106	2	Takes forever to charge phone, and if you move the phone slightly off center it stops charging.
5033096	3	When the phone reaches its maximum charge the pad shuts off and the battery begins to dissipate the charge but it doesn't turn back on.
5036872	2	The charger works, but it will stop for no reason. It continues after i re position my phone.
5034376	3	The light is really bright so it's hard to sleep when you have your phone charging at night.
5037337	3	So far, not so good. This worked well for a week then the last two mornings I awoke to a phone with about 15% battery life remaining. Fortunately I get up early enough that the regular charger did its job in time for work.
5033675	3	You're better off buying a charger that goes with the phone this is a REALLY SLOW charger it will take all night where as the phone charger that you can buy for the phone will take maybe tops an hour and a half. Not worth the minor inconvenience of having to plug it in my opinion
5035302	0	would like one that didn't have to lay flat all the time. So I could stand or hold to use while charging.
5032951	3	Item never worked. Necer charged.
5037835	2	Hello I bought this wireless Samsung charger because I didn't have a charger to go with my phone and when I received the wireless port it didn't come with any charger to charge the pad. So I went ahead and read the description once again and it clearly states that the pad comes with a charger for the pad.
5035016	3	I am not impressed by this thing at all. It doesn't charge very fast at all. I put my S6 on the charger last night when the phone was at 13% and by the morning it was only at 44%.....6 hours later....It doesn't matter if I charge it with the otterbox case on it or not.....If I plug the cord that came with the charger directly into the phone it charges in about an hour. Save you money!!!!
5037970	3	Seems to constantly be charging and pausing and charging and pausing. And each time it pauses, the screen turns on and makes the charging sound. You have to get it in the PRECISE position so it doesn't make that constant pause in charging. Would not recommend to a friend unfortunately.
5034035	2	It does not work. I found out that the Samsung Galaxy S5 will not work with it. I can get a special charger thing for my battery but even that isn't guaranteed. Non-existing instructions. Returning.
5034772	3	It works well just slow
5034480	3	charger doesn't work well when cell battery is critically low. when my cell phone is at about 5% or less, I had to pick up my phone every so often and lay it back down to get it to start charging again.
5036016	0	I thought it would be cool to have but i wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it. It's kind of pointless if you have to connect it every time you want to charge your phone. It has just been sitting collecting dust since I bought it.
5038261	3	Doesn't charge fast at all.
5032823	3	Worked great at first then a couple month later it started shorting out mind you I rarely use it because I always forget it at home so there should be no reason as to why it shorts out
5036022	2	Great idea, however it does not work well with the Samsung Galaxy S6. My phone kept giving errors that it wasn't able to charge fast enough. Never had issues with my fast charger so I decided to return these before my phone got screwed up.
5032983	2	I used a wireless charger with the same model number and it worked thru my Defender Otterbox.  I ordered two of these thinking it would work.  WRONG!!!  They only work when I take the entire phone case off my Samsung 6.  I don't have the time during the day to take my phone case off every time I need to charge my phone.  Please don't waste your money.
5038386	2	You have to have it plugged in to use it what is the point of wireless recharging?
5038076	3	As others have said, stops charging overnight so useless if you were looking for a nightstand charger. Sent back and went for a cheaper rectangle shaped one (TechMatte Qi Wireless Charging Pad) where it's also easier to clearly tell if the device is lined up correctly. (Galaxy S6)
5037946	3	Sloooooooooow!
5033610	2	Info states it will work with the Note Edge - but I can not get it to charge at all.  Will be returning.  Also, I have the incopio super slim case on it, and it will not charge through the case.
5036957	3	I was so excited to get wireless charging on my phone. When this device works, it works well.  The blue light is a bit bright (especially if you charge at night, the way most of us do).  It also charges slooooooowly.  I often times found myself plugging in to get a little more juice than the wireless charger would provide, especially when I was limited on time. The worst part is the charge would straight up stop for no reason at all.  I thought it may have been the placement of my phone. I was VERY careful to place the phone on the device correctly, then ensure that the light turned on and a charge was initiated.  Then, for no reason at all, the light would start blinking and not charge at all. I can't tell you how many times I woke up to this blinking light and no battery. So frustrating.  I have since moved back to the stock charger. While the convenience of wireless charging was appealing, the practical aspect of having a full battery was more more desirable.  Samsung phones may rock, but this accessory is a dud.
5037619	3	It work. The lady at the t mobile store said it charges faster than the 1 that came with the phone but it definitely slower.
5036335	3	Extremely slow charging. OK for overnight charging but not really useful any other time.
5032102	3	Unfortunately I didn't check before the return window was up so I'm stuck with a counterfeit model.  I tried to register it and it wasn't recognized, though it said some older models might not show up.  The real tell tale signs were the blue rubber ring and back rather than black (youtube has some examples).  After using it for a while I noticed that my phone didn't hold a charge anymore - going from 100% to dead in <12 hours with little to no use when it should last a couple days, at least.  I saw comments online of others having the same issue with counterfeit wireless chargers.  This didn't make sense to me that the charger could make a difference - 100% is 100%, right?  But after my phone started dying right away I went back to using the cable.  The phone immediately held a charge as normal and continues to do so.  Still makes no sense to me, but I'm not going to use this charger again with results like that.
5037426	2	If you have a thick case it will not charge also I live in the country and If wifi go on and off it won't charge.
5035060	3	The charger is super fast on it's own. With the wireless pad, it charges so slowly..it's so annoying
5031861	0	Piece of crap
5035845	2	This unit is convenient for charging, but most of time It does not work when the first putting the phone on it to charge, need to move until it's blue light turn on
5032630	3	Annoying light will keep you awake.
5038422	3	Works pretty well but doesnt seem to fully charge my s6 edge.  It may be fully charging and then turning off, but its never 100% in the morning.  Usually 80 to 90.  To be fair I'm unsure if it's the charging pad or the phone to blame for this.
5030455	3	Only charges for a few seconds then turns off, turns back on, turns off. Repeatedly. And does not effectively charge my phone. I want a refund please, I'll send it back I just want a working charger, however I am not being given the option of a return/refund
5038294	3	Works very well with no problems. However, the indicator light is extremely bright. It lights up the entire room at night and keeps me up when I'm trying to sleep. it gets worse when standby mode kicks in as it constantly flashes.
5033472	3	Used it for the past year with Samsung Note devices, it does the job well. Doesn't charge fast, and if you are the type to mess with your phone constantly, you won't get much charge from it. Some slim cases, even simple plastic ones I have bought made the phone too far away to charge. Slim cases only. Other thin ones work perfectly, so your mileage may vary.
5032284	3	Save your money! The cord charges quickly. This takes HOURS to charge! I had it charging for three hours and it didn't hit 50%!
5038129	3	I figured I'd buy the matching OEM solution and didn't read the reviews.  They later confirmed to me that I needed to return this.  It turns off when charged 100% so by morning you start the day with about 70%.  Not good.  And not necessary,  I returned this and bought a cheaper product that makes me happy.
5035832	2	I thought this would be great. Just lay your phone on the at your desk during the day or dresser at night and presto fully charged phone when you need it, right? No so much. If you have any kind of protector on your phone you had better make sure it is charging before walking away. The phone must be placed exactly correct or it may not charge. I have also experienced issues with it actually discharging my phones. I threw them away and went back to my $5 phone cords that work reliably every time. Even for the reduced price of $25 this product is definitely not worth the money.
5037450	3	My phone says it's being charged but actually it is not.
5035756	3	It didn't work. I purchased this to use at work so I could eliminate a few cords from phone PC, etc. I charged it up and put my phone on it and it wouldn't work. One day I went into ATT where I got my phone and the sales lady said they don't work with Samsung Note Edge so I thought maybe its my phone and not the charger. She even showed me on their wireless charger that mine doesn't work, then my husband put his phone on there charger and his began charging so I gave him my charger thinking it would work for but it didn't.
5030084	3	REALLY takes forever to charge.  Handy to be able to grab it and walk away when necessary, tho.
5033575	3	Broken upon arrival. Doesn't appear so, but it didn't work. I switched cords, outlets, and another phone, it didn't work. I can only use a wireless charger because my phone charge port is broken and it is cheaper to go wireless than repair it.
5036983	3	Charged for 15 minutes and stopped charging. Grand idea just not well executed.
5038035	2	This item should, have a  carring case/pouch
5033682	3	Would not work when I received it. What can I say worse than that, Could have ordered a cheaper one but decided to go with the Samsung since its their phone.
5035215	3	I put my s7 edge on the wireless charger at 50 percent and it said three hours to be fully charged. With the screen off I was playing music in the background, two hours later my phone was down to 40 percent. The charger is only useful if you play to put your phone on it over night.
5035699	3	Kinda  slownever really  use it! I would recommend the fast charge,  it's worth the money. I went with the three  deal combo that came with a car charger @ a wall fast charger., came out to same price
5036428	2	Doesn't charge AT&T Note 5 properly.
5036423	3	I've had this charger foro six months and it's a pain in the neck. I've given up using it and switched back to a plug in charger. It rarely charges as it's meant to, my phone will be on it all night with the light on indicating it's charging, then I take it off in the morning and it hasn't charged at all. It's too inconsistent. The light is bright, it flashes, it'a annoying. I've lived with it this long hoping it was ok, but I'm done with it.
5036147	3	The charging pad is not quick charging
5032573	0	Not the best thing I bought but it works
5035449	2	The description here says Galaxy 5, so I purchased 2 of them...turns out it's for Galaxy 6 only.
5033126	3	Doesn't charge well its takes overnight to fully charge and I've only had it about a month
5036075	2	I have a Samsung S6 Edge...you'd think these would work great together,  not at all. It's near impossible to find the right position to place the phone so I wont, after 5-10-30 minutes start flashing and stop charging. I thought maybe I got a bad one, so I returned the first one and got a second....right out of the box the same thing. I bout the Wireless Charger,Yootech Qi Wireless...for around $13 and haven't had an issue once. It's very rare it doesn't charge correctly, and if it does, it let's you know right away.
5032029	0	Easy to use
5034506	3	Item stopped working after 9 months
5035698	3	Its super slow at charging and it isn't wireless
5034017	3	The phone gets very hot. It charges very slowly.
5033841	3	I'm not sure how I could be using this charger wrong but my phone can sit on it all night and only be 20-30 percent more charged. I've never gotten a full battery from this charger.
5030332	3	The phone charging is a little slow with this product so I would suggest to have it as a secondary charger. Other than that good product in terms of design.
5035874	3	Charges faster than I expected, but sometimes stops for some reason.  When this happens, the blue light blinks, so I know to pick up the phone and place it back on the charger.  A green light indicates it has finished charging.
5037187	2	Got this in today. And a waste of money. I can not get it to charge my Note 4.
5038225	2	There is pretty much no instructions for this??? It only says plug in, charge it, put your phone on it! Gonna try it out. If it doesn't work,  it's going back!
5030598	1	Mine came with a cave that was all chewed up looked like a rat or mouse had gotten a hold of it.
5038263	3	Tried using this charger for about two months on my s6 in an Otter Box Commuter case.  I charge my phone every night, and make sure it is actually charging before I leave the room and go to bed.  Some mornings the phone is at 100%, other mornings it has been as low as 8%, no rhyme or reason.  More often than not I discover it has been starting and then interupting the charge cyle, every few seconds, all night long.  Got so agravated I tossed mine in the trash bin, which is where this product belongs.  You have been warned.
5033876	3	Wireless charging stations are a bad joke. They make my phone hot with a reduced charging rate. This is now used as coaster to avoid moisture rings on my table.
5037238	3	Hi i just received my charger but ive had a problem i used it the first day and it worked great and ive been trying to use it after that but after 10 minutes it blinks blue meaning not charging ive placed it serveral different ways so idk if im doin it wrong or its deffective any answers ?
5035961	3	This charger rarely charges overnight to 100% if at all.  If you are like me and use your phone as a alarm clock, don't risk it! It only take a second to plug the phone in. Dont waste your money.
5036254	3	It's convenient to use, but I find it extremely slow to charge.  Can't use it for a quick anything...it doesn't.
5035049	0	It works I am happy with it.
5031683	0	works ok
5034782	3	The charger didn't work
5030260	3	Slowest charger ever. Doesn't charge through a case, either.
5033210	3	Doesn't charge good
5034960	3	Don't waste your money if you have a Note 5.  Does not completely charge.  Stick with the original charger that comes with the phone.
5033571	0	I have one of these and it works flawlessly. So I bought another and it doesn't work. It goes into a rapid pulse of charging and charging paused. Before I realized this was happening, I left it on the charger overnight and woke up to a discharged phone. I tested cords and AC plugs. Result: my Galaxy S6 works perfectly with one pad and did not work with another. The latter has been returned.  So I give the one that works 5 stars and the one returned 0 stars. The web is full of people having similar problems and tricks to resolve it. My recommendation: if it doesn't work for you, return it for a new one. When the pad works, it works all the time.
5032129	2	Did not charge my S8.
5037092	0	I have issues whit the product, even when the person who sale me this contact me to suggest something about it...
5035693	3	Very slow charging and a few times I put my phone on the charger at one battery percentage, saw the little circle appear to let me know that it was charging and then came back latter to see the battery percentage was actually lower than when I put it on.  Not worth it. The fast charger that my son bought works much better.
5033564	2	Nice gadget and fun to have but its not "fast charge" if you use the cord that come with it and plug it directly into the phone then it does do a fast charge but not wirelessly. If it was a fast charge I would give it 5 stars.
5033420	2	No where in the item description does it mention that this product contains carcinogenic chemicals. I think that's something worth noting, Amazon.
5036581	3	Charges slowly.  I put a metal plate bt the phone and the case for my magnetic car holder and it wouldn't charge.
5032958	3	it keeps going off and on while charging
5038196	2	I purchased this because I have an S5 and figured Samsung would get the charging base right for their phone.  Boy was I wrong.  I purchased two of these, one for my office and one for my bedroom, and tested them both.  Neither one of them would charge my S5 with the Samsung Wireless charging batter cover.  At best, I could hope for from this base to hold the charge.  If I went to bed at 50%, I would wake up, 6-8 hours later, with the phone still at 50%.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't something I was doing wrong, so I tried charging my S5 several times in several positions.  Getting the phone to charge on the pad took an act of skill.  If not positioned on it, just right, the S5 would not recognize the base and not charge, or continuously buzz and switch between charging and not charging.  This would go on until I moved the phone around the base until the phone was positioned perfectly.  After two days, of no success, I almost gave up on wireless charging all together. Then I found the Tylt, and figured I would give it one last try.  The Tylt worked right out of the box.  No fuss and no muss.  Just lay the phone on it and it wireless charges.  So these have been returned to Amazon.
5032938	3	Seems to drain the batter rather than charge it.
5037398	2	Unfortunately, I didn't do any research before getting this, but I assumed an official Samsung product would be great. No such luck. It constantly stops charging for no reason, and many other people have the same problem.  I thought it would be a good match for my Samsung Galaxy Note 5, but I have to stick with the quick charger that came with the phone. It works just fine.
5035275	2	Makes no sense to me! If I have to keep the pad plugged in while charging, I might as well use the charger for my phone!! Sending it back in the morning!!
5033428	3	Just keeps turning on and off every 10 seconds when trying to charge phone.  Returning for a refund.
5032681	2	This was purchased for a Samsung galaxy s5. It doesn't work. We tried it on other Samsung products in the house but none of them worked on it either. The only product that it worked for was my Samsung galaxy s7. It charged very slow. It would have taken hours to fully charge the phone. I will be returning this product.
5036346	2	Was disappointed it did not come with a fast charging cord like the one I bought in the store.
5034435	2	This pad would not work with our samsung S6 phones and had trouble keeping itself charging. Looks like a cool concept but don't believe the hype. This product needs some more work before you waste your money on it.
5036446	2	Horrible AND Embarrassed. Bought this as a Christmas present and it doesn't work.  I just paid 30 bucks for the cord that came with the wireless charger. Very disappointed. Not compatible with the S5.
5035318	0	This works as described, but if you are used to the "fast charging" you get with the default cord that comes with phones now, you won't be impressed. I only suggest using this if you can, for instance, set it on your desk while you're at work and pick it up often. That will save your cord input from becoming damaged. If you want to charge your phone and don't need to move it much while you're doing it i highly suggest the cord.
5033694	3	It didn't work so i sent it back..
5029905	3	Oh my goodness. It was slow slow. Horrible.
5037135	3	I like the concept of this item but the charge is really slow. Most of the time I just don't have all night to get a full charge. Plus one thing I didn't think about is you can't use your phone while it's charging. I plug the cord straight into my cell most of the time. In my opinion, it's not really worth the money. I should've sent it back.
5038315	3	does not work. Spent the extra money because it was a Samsung product for my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge device. A dud. On the bright side I returned it for a full refund and found a much better and much less expensive alternative.
5037149	3	It works but it takes a long time to charge!
5032990	2	Works alright, but your phone has to be sitting just right on the device or it won't charge.
5029948	2	While I am aware that the charge pad itsself is the standard, non-fast-charging version, the description states that the "Fast Charging Wall Adapter" is included in the box, which is the reason I bought this item, since it can also be used on its own to fast charge with a cable. The adapter I recieved was NOT the samsung fast charger, just a slow charger.
5029604	2	Does not work when phone cover/protector is on phone.
5031348	3	Doesn't work. Nothing happens when I put my phone on the pad :(
5035406	2	I don't like it, it doesn't work how I thought it would .
5034726	4	sent product back, did not work with my phone.
5031956	2	You have to sit the phone on it just right to charge.
5035748	3	worked but not very quick charging my note when it is very low. Good as a trickle charger.
5037630	2	You have to find the perfect spot or it won't charge.
5037562	2	uable to charge when you have any case on your phone.
5034185	3	I purchased this for my Galaxy Note 7. It doesn't charge the device although it indicates it's connected. I'm disappointed. The charge goes down while connected. My phone was at 36% when I connected it. The next time I checked,  it was at 16%. Preparing to return it.
5037383	3	Mine didn't work. It would charge for 30 seconds and stop working
5036840	3	Did  not charge or even light up went in trash right away. Not worth the time to return. Thanks samsung
5035944	3	This is a great idea and pretty simple to charge your phone without having to plug anything in. With that being said, it is sometimes difficult to get it lined up right to charge correctly. Also if you're planning on using it to charge overnight, it automatically shuts off when it gets to 100% and by the time you wake up it is around 80%.
5033910	2	read the description wrong, it won't work with my Samsung s5...had to send it back
5031271	0	It works but I don't understand why I got the plug without the USB cord.
5037015	3	The first couple of days I was very happy with it.  After that, not so much.  I would place my phone on it at night, it would say wireless charging, and when I got up the next morning, my phone was not charged.  It had stopped charging and my battery life was much lower than when I put it on to charge.  This happens more than not.  I am actually considering sending it back.  Very disappointed.  When it works, it's great.  Just doesn't happen much.
5035441	3	It takes too long to charge
5036413	3	Slow charging which is ok use it while I am sleeping or sitting around, Does work fine on our Note 5's but it depends what type of case, my wife has a five and below case and mine is a Evocel which both charge while in their cases. After it fully charges it shuts off which is fine, but wish it would turn back on if the phones battery drops below a certain %, After that said and done I did order a second one for myself.
5031595	3	3 star review because of the slow charging time on this. The standard plug charges about 3x faster. However, it is still nice to just set your phone on it and go. Attractive style overall.
5034043	0	Its faster actually plugging my phone in
5034574	2	Phone needs to be placed EXACTLY right in order to charge. It takes longer to get the placement perfect than it does to just plug it in.
5034246	3	does charge faster then the AC adapter. and it doesn't read the phone unless its in the middle only.
5035144	3	Either it charges slowly or the Qi patch isn't where it needs to be on the battery.
5034120	3	It works just fine with my s6 in a otter box.  It just seems to take a while longer then with a cord plunger right in your cell. Would be nice to have a rapid charger
5036818	3	Good concept but you will find that you have to fiddle around with the orientation of the phone on the charger to activate charging. Kind of a pain.
5036853	3	This is the worst product ever!! It charges so slow if it even works at all. If you charge your phone on a night stand like most people do, it has an obnoxious blue light blinking at you all night.
5032486	3	it charges very slow so I use the wire jack more often
5037624	3	This device takes double the time to charge my note 4
5035139	3	I depend on my phone being charged first thing in the morning so I love it when my Samsung 6 gets charged without having to plug it in.  However, sometimes the charger connects and disconnects every few seconds so I do have to plug it in.  The only consistent factor I have been able to associate is if the phone is above 50% charge.  It's not worth returning because I like it a lot when it works as it it supposed to.  Maybe it's just my unit so take your hance if you're feeling lucky.
5033923	4	Absolute waste of money.  Did not work to charge phone and attempted to return but never received shipping/return labels even after working with an agent online for over 30 minutes.  Very disappointed.
5036067	3	is slow to charge - better off using regular cord
5035442	3	It charges very slow , in my opinion not a good quality charge or something I would buy again , I am returning this .
5032859	3	Didn't work properly.
5033389	3	85% of the time this charger will not work. I have tried several different samsung cords that meet the spec for charging my note 5 with this device and it will work for a few then my phone will go to pause mode. It is very frustrating and it mainly sits on my desk and collects dust.
5037352	0	Its alright, it works as described, wireless charging is a little too hyped IMO
5037568	3	Horribly slow charging waste of my money!!
5033104	3	Charges fine when new, after a year or so, it slows down considerably. I've had this charger close to two years, it no longer charges my phone overnight, it takes 10-12 hours from 15% to a full 100% charge. (Faster to disconnect charging cord from the pad and plug directly into the phone)
5036475	2	Doesn't work well for us, seems like you have to position so exact and it doesn't stay connected. Could be the Lifeproof case, but regardless, disappointing.
5035219	0	I just got it and work very well
5037057	3	Never works. Comes on and goes off. Not good technology.
5038406	3	Didn't work through my Otter box and turns off when it's finished charging so you wake up in the am and your phone is already @ 80% battery life. Returned it. Cool idea but not there yet on functionality.  Galaxy S6
5036186	3	Does not charge very fast
5036194	3	I bought this one first then I went and purchase the fast charge one and neither one is worth the money. The charge with this one and the fast charge is very slow, so save your money
5037071	3	Charger was complete garbage. Never worked and when it would connect, it would disconnect 10 min later. I returned it and purchased the CHOE Circle QI Fast Charge Charging Pad.  The CHOE product works amazing. The Samsung version is garbage.
5036197	3	Shuts off at the end of the charge and will not auto restart if the battery gets depleted. As per instructions your are supposed to unplug the round coil from the charger once the charge completed. That defeat the purpose of wireless charging.
5034540	3	Very Slow to Charge My wall Charger works better
5036580	3	Beware that this charger turns off at 100 percent charge, and will not work well for an overnight unit. Also it's very picky about how I put my note 5 on it. Very disappointed.
5033525	2	My S6 Active seems to get really really hot laying on top of this. It doesnt happen every time but enough times I stopped using it. However, it did charge properly every time regardless of how hot it made my S6 Active. My wife has the new S7 Edge and it works great, never makes her phone hot at all.
5037667	2	It's just ok. The only thing is that only have to put it right on the center, if I don't I wake up to a phone not charged.
5037195	0	Terrible! I ended up just using the cord it comes with to charge - the wireless feature is nearly useless! Don't waste your money!
5036351	2	gotta set the phone down just right on it. and sometimes the cord falls out in the middle of the night making me quite sad in the morning.  phone doesn't seem to hold the charge as long even when it's 100% charged.  nice though that it stops charging when it's at 100%.
5037811	2	i need to place my phone in an exact position to detect the phone
5035671	3	I really like the convenience of it, but it does not charge as fast as I thought it would.
5030777	3	Very convenient but had two of them stop working after a few months. Phone would sit on charger overnight and fail to charge after 3-4 months. Nice idea, needs reliability.
5033430	2	Seemed ok at first, didn't recognize the phone being on it unless you push down or try over and over, due to the phone case possibly...? A few months in it has some sort of short, if you touch it it restarts and the phone gets little to no charge
5038414	2	I was excited to learn that the Samsung Galaxy S6 had built in wireless charging.  I acquired this charging pad since is was maid by the phone manufacturer.  It does work as documented, just find that where you set the phone on the pas is quite critical.  Slightly off center and it seems to stop charging, or gives up charging early.  I have also tried a 3rd party unit, and it seems to have more tolerance on where the phone sits on the charging pad.  The 3rd party unit uses the Qi standard of charging.  The Samsun unit also uses the Qi charging standard.  The Samsung unit also costs more than most 3rd party units.
5036857	2	it has to be plugged in to the wall as it charges  so it kind of defeats the purpose  and it charges alot slower then with a normal charger
5034952	2	Doesn't work with a case installed on the phone had too upgrade too the fast charge dock
5038134	3	Sometimes it charges and sometimes it does not, even though the icon on the phone shows that it is charging wireless.  I have woken up several times, leaving the house for work, grab my phone and the battery is at 89%.  I am disappointed.
5032840	3	This product quit working within 3 months of using. Just like all crappy Samsung products, the port you plug into somehow loses connection and it is rendered useless. I have to buy another one simply because - well, you can probably guess, the port of my Samsung S6 has the same exact port problem as this wireless charging pad so I have no choice but to charge my device wirelessly. Spend the extra money on the inverted wireless charger that charges your phone while it is upright.
5036671	2	Should had read the description more carefully.  My daughter will be able to use with her S5, I'm sure she'll love it.  Received this in the mail today and was excited to use. Did not come with a manual so I had to go online to see that this charging pad does not support my S Note 4, it clearly says it in the description, but if you read further it states (The Samsung Wireless Charging Pad is Qi certified by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) and is compatible with all Qi-enabled devices including from Samsung: Galaxy S 4, Galaxy S 5, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy Note 3 (these Galaxy smartphones require Wireless Charging Battery Covers, sold separately)  What's the point?
5032154	3	This charger doe not work. It says its charging with the indicated light however it does not charge. The power cord is white not black.
5037855	3	Lasted a little over a month and then I noticed the charge rate going down.  2% increase in one hour is not enough to like this.  Pretty disappointed that a name brand wireless charger made for your phone is worse than a no name brand that has been working for over 3 months now.
5033338	3	Waste of money!! This takes forever to charge my phone, doesn't matter if no case or case, I've tried both. I'm use to the fast charging aspect that came with my original charger but this does not have that and it is a waste of my time. I have only had this product for 2 days and I've emailed to return it. If you want the convenience of just setting it down, fyi you cannot set it down just anywhere on the pad, I have to sit there and move it around for the charger to start. Not happy, had much higher expectations!
5035365	3	It's cool and all that with this you can charge your phone wirelessly, but it takes forever to fully charge your phone. For example, if you charge your phone with this product at a battery rate of 20%, it'll take 8 to 10 hours to fully charge your phone.
5031540	3	Failed to charge my phone on day 2, this is the second Samsung brand wireless charger I've ordered and they both failed in less than 24 hours.
5036909	3	doesnt charge fast at all. Sometimes I notice that the phone sitting on the pad actually doesn't even increase in charge. Its only good if you gonna put it on the pad at night when you go to bed so it has all night to charge. Certain times I can't get the pad to light up at all for some reason.
5033870	2	Did not work with my Samsung 7 Edge
5036182	0	I use it at work and it's handy to just set my phone on it rather than dealing with the microUSB.  I think calling these devices "wireless" is still a stretch.  But I get it.
5032340	3	I love Samsung. The problem with this is that it doesn't stay on and you have to keep unplugging it and plugging it back just to get it to work!
5036353	3	Very disatisfied with product. Very poor quality, it takes forever to charge my phone, also very tiny.
5035552	3	This product started out as a good idea for nightstand use.  Unfortunately, the charger is intermittent causing my phone to beep at random intervals. Worked okay the first few nights, then in the morning my phone would only be charged between 40-60%. Do Not Purchase!!
5033868	3	This seems just to be a tad slow at charging.. otherwise its a cool gadget
5036955	2	I hate how you have to precisely put the phone on the pad, even slightly off and it won't charge.  Also, since I have this by my bed stand, i hate the bright blue LED light on it.
5030265	3	Takes forever to charge...im done smh
5033171	3	Works with my galaxy 6... but it is super slow at charging.
5035305	0	Not all that impressed.
5033289	2	does not work with accessory charging cases, such as on an iphone.
5034159	3	First of all I had to purchase an adapter for my s4. Secondly it worked really well for about two weeks then stopped working at all. It could just be my phone. Not user friendly while charging.
5037752	0	Hated it.  But  I was given a full refund.
5035384	2	Samsung didn't get this 100% right.  I have to find the "hot spot" on the pad in order for the phone to charge.  This would have been better if it had been an upright vertical/horizontal charge which would have eliminated the need to search for the hot spot.
5032515	3	Blue light on all nite. No charge.
5034150	0	Buy the fast charger instead
5037486	0	Nt happy with the product. I will be requesting a return label
5035575	3	I think I waisted my money on this.  It charges.  Sometimes.  I charge my phone at night.  In the morning, it's not always charged.  Very frustrating.
5030991	2	Though it was a fast charger. Its not.
5037242	3	This item was actually defective and would only charge for a few moments before powering off. I should receive a full refund and not have to pay for return shipping.
5033681	0	dangerous with the lithium battery!
5031566	2	Samsung EP-PG920IBUGUS Wireless Charging Pad  Works.  Not a fast charger.  Great for overnight charging or maybe desk charging my S8.  My biggest issue is that the phone has to be centered on the pad.  Like really centered.  Just a little to far left, right, up, down, and it won't charge.  It does have an indicator for charging / done charging. The stand charger "Samsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Stand W/ AFC Wall Charger" isn't as position sensitive for phone.
5037527	3	Worthless charger! It won't stay charging on my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. I've tried it with and without a case. Sending it back!
5032393	2	BE AWARE that this charger will NOT work if you have a battery charging case on your phone (Mophie or Samsung or any other manufacturer).  The inductive battery inside the phone cannot charge through the battery that is in the charging case outside of the phone and that is the item that is in direct contact with the charging plate.
5037812	2	I gave this item a two star rating because I thought I could charge the pad and then take it anywhere in order to charge my phone. Turns out I have to leave the pad connected to an outlet and it takes about 2.5 hours to completely charge the phone. It is excellent if you want to charge your phone over night since it stops charging your phone once it is fully charged. You have to pick up the phone, which halts charging, if you receive a text or want to use the phone for anything at all. It has a nice design and seems futuristic but not practical unless you want to charge your phone overnight.
5036708	3	Shipping was very fast. Great dealing with the seller. The pad will not fully charge the phone at night and it goes into an error mode. other than that its a great product
5035270	2	The convenience of the charger is wonderful.  However,  it has to be placed a certain way for into recognize the phone.  Not to mention the incredibly slow charge rate.  Overall, not the extra money.
5033323	3	Worked a few times, now just connects and disconnects non stop.
5029740	2	Got this one for my wife, she has the S9, for some reason it take a long time to charge.  Even though the description says it will fast charge the S9"s.
5037330	2	Just did not work with my S6 Edge. It would shut off before it reached full charge. Always around 70 to 80 %.
5037219	3	The charging is inconsistent at best.  Very disappointed in the product.
5038194	3	Charges fast. Works as advertised. Only complaint is that it doesn't do top off charging once your phone is fully charged. This means that once your phone's battery achieves full charge, the charging pad will shut off, and your phone will slowly start to drain it's battery. If you're charging through the night, you can wake up with a battery that's less than 100% full as a result of this.
5037563	2	EXPENSIVE COASTER. DO NOT PURCHASE. All the negative feedback here is completely accurate. It fails in all respects. You must keep readjusting it to keep it charging, if you are lucky enough to get it to charge through the night you'll be lucky to see 90% in the morning (I made it there once with my S6 Edge+). The directions actually require you to unplug the unit after use, completely defeating the purpose of the product. This junk was not ready to be released.
5038114	2	It's ok to use in a pinch but one slight movement and your phone is knocked off charge.
5037366	3	It is junk never works...it always says wireless charging paused  on my phone after 39 seconds of use. I'm returning it asap. Don't buy it!
5030364	3	I have an Otterbox Defender (screenless) case for my iPhone X. Its thick rubber. If you're running an app that uses a non-trivial amount of battery, your charging will almost be negated.
5035109	3	These are such a disappointment. Not only are they really 'tall', you have to fiddle with the phone to get the charge to start. I bought two, and both of them require me to pick up and put my phone down repeatedly before the wireless charging FINALLY kicks in. Another brand I have works much faster, with less hassle, and is more like a coaster and less like an ashtray in height.
5033122	3	did not work,waste of money
5030528	3	Did not work, straight of of the package. Do not trust this seller...
5033455	2	didn't charge through my outer box strada case. It did work with the phone without the case and it charge good. Gave it 1 star as most people put cases on the units.
5037831	3	Doesn't charge very fast, I've left my phone on it twice over night at approximately 60 percent and it never charged more that 90 percent with no phone case on it. Neat yes but it should work better
5035595	2	Very crappy product. Have 3 different Samsung phones (galaxy note 4 & 5, galaxy lite)  and it does not charge any of them.
5037987	3	It takes too much time to charge the S6 Edge, with regular charger S6 Edge takes 1 hour from 1% to 100%, with this base, it takes 4 hours,
5033727	2	It doesn't work for phones Samsung Galaxy S5 like the vendor tell us in order to work we have to buy a Ultra-thin Qi Wireless Charging Receiver NFC Module for Samsung Galaxy S5. Please don tell customer that the wireless pad works for all the Samsung devices because it is a big lie to customers. the wireless pad work only for Samsung S6 and Samsung S 7 period.
5036355	3	Like other reviews, it's faster to just use the plug than the pad,  get the bigger one that charges 1.5 times faster,  worth the price difference
5035173	2	Let me begin by saying I love all things Samsung...that is until this charger.  My phones, dishwasher, washer/dryer, TV, tablet, child monitor - all made by Samsung. First off, this charger has a single coil and what that means is you must place the phone on this cradle perfectly to get it to charge.  Couple that with the design of the device - a puck that does not cradle your device but provides just two points of contact and the charger being smaller than your phone allowing the phone to hang over on two sides.  If it is bumped even slightly, you are likely going to lose charging. Second, I own a Samsung S6 Edge+, which is, according to Samsung, a compatible phone for this charger.  I'm telling you, it's not.  When my phone is placed on this cradle, the phone continuously cycles from wireless charging to wireless charging disconnected which turns the screen on and off and on and off, etc.  This drains the battery instead of charges it.  I contacted Samsung and they assured me that my phone is indeed compatible and that I am not placing the phone on the charger correctly.  I tried so many different phone positions.  I read online about placing a thin piece of cardboard between the phone and the charger and many other techniques that never worked.  You can read in other reviews how to correct this by having your phone in Daydream mode which turns on a screensaver and stops the cycle of charging/not charging.  I gave it a shot and it worked but you end up using your phone in an unintended way with a night light.  I feel a product shouldn't force me to change what I do to get it to work, so I went a different way.  I returned the Samsung charger and bought two 3-coil chargers...the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MoKo-Qi-Wireless-Charger-3-Coil-Charging-Pad-Stand-for-Samsung-Galaxy-S6-S6-Edge-S6-Edge-S7-S7-Edge-Note-5-and-Other-Qi-enabled-Devices-AC-Adapter-Included-BLACK/dp/B00OXR1QRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MoKo Qi Wireless Charger 3-Coil Charging Pad Stand for Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge / S6 Edge+ / S7 / S7 Edge / Note 5, and Other Qi-enabled Devices (AC Adapter Included), BLACK</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iDOO-3-Coils-Foldable-Qi-Wireless-Charger-Stand-Dock-for-Samsung-S6-Note-5-Nexus-7-and-All-Qi-enabled-Devices-Black/dp/B012F1Y96M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iDOO 3 Coils [Foldable] Qi Wireless Charger Stand Dock for Samsung S6,Note 5,Nexus 7 and All Qi-enabled Devices - Black</a>.  My favorite of the two is the MoKo by far.  I place my phone on the MoKo charger upright, sideways, a little off to the side, case off, case on and guess what...it charges my phone and all without adjusting how I use my phoneand at a third of the price.  It also grips my phone so that my cat can't spin it off.  It looks professional and it doesn't feel cheap at all.  The other 3-coil charger, the iDOO, stopped charging my phone when I started using a case.
5032976	3	Charges very slow defeats purpose
5031927	3	Honestly it was cool to not have to plug in my phone but the charge is way to slow for my impatient self so, I kinda forgot I had this thing.
5037134	2	I thought it could charge without having the wireless pad connect to the usb
5036190	3	Takes forever to charge my phone using this device
5036810	2	You need to be careful on how you place your phone on this charger.
5034465	2	thought it was portable... i was wrong
5038015	0	It's good but it can be better
5033958	0	Great way to keep my Samsung S7 Edge topped off while I am at work. Not much else to say- works great!
5035342	3	It worked great for the first 3 months then stopped lol don't know why but maybe I just got a bad one
5036000	3	Its cool but it charge too slow
5032581	2	Its a super convenient way to charge your phone but sometimes my phone needs to be positioned on the charging dock a certain way for it to work. Maybe its my phone but if I slide it slightly, it stops charging or intermittently charges and uncharges. Still a good and better alternative than wires and cable chargers.
5036228	2	The single coil charging pads aren't anywhere the quality of a tri-coil.  Now I know this is the OEM one, and that's why i figured it would be worth a flyer, but there are far better options for triple coil chargers out there.  This one is pretty finicky (spelling) about how the phone sits on it to charge, and for whatever reason, even with sitting on this for 8 hours, i still only end up with about 85% charge.  The funny thing is, the charger itself thinks the phone is fully charged, as the light turns green, but the phone isn't fully charged.  I got some knock off triple coil one for my desk at work and thing works flawlessly.  Sometimes aftermarket stuff is actually better than the OEM stuff.
5035027	3	Doesn't protect the phone very well. I got dings and scratches at the edges of my phone.
5032086	3	Slow to charge.  Have to align perfectly.
5033105	2	Can't just lay your phone one it, you have to work at it and then its a slow charge
5032646	0	not really that great
5034693	3	I bought this charging pad in late February 2016 and it worked beautifully for a little over than 3 months and all of a sudden it stopped charging. When I place the phone on the pad, it shows as charging but then it drains the phone's battery instead of charging. if I connect phone directly to the charger, there is no problem.
5036826	2	Its not what i expected. Doesnt charge your phone fast it was just a waste of money.
5036081	2	Kinda of tempermental about placement of phone.
5037744	2	The first one I bought works perfect. Just drop the phone onto the charger almost anywhere and it starts to charge. The second one I bought from another business doesn't work well at all. I have to fidde with it and get it exactly in one spot to get it to charge which defets the purpose of buying something to make things easier. Instead it's just plain annoying.
5031532	3	doesn't charge, box was open.
5034145	3	Charges very slowly
5037553	3	Not sure if this is a charger or phone issue but a lot of times I'll put it on the pad and it'll start charging but when I return 10 minutes later it'll be flashing blue and not charging anymore.  An ok product, wouldn't necessarily recommend it
5036890	2	This  does not work if you have any type of cover on your phone.  So disappointed.
5035901	2	Charges slower, kind of gimmicky.  Also, it works through my case but hardly. Much easier and better to just plug it in with a cord.
5038103	2	If there are any cords involved at all...it is not wireless!
5032656	3	This Pad did not charge the phone. Company refunded by my money after I paid postage and returned this Charging Pad. Make note that I bought this as a backup/travel Pad. My original Samsung Pad has worked perfectly and consistently for two years.
5032542	3	It has to be plug to work. Not very useful. Doesn't charge fast at all.
5035172	3	Does not work that well.
5035443	3	Does not work.
5035555	3	My cell battery dies fast when charged with charger
5037655	3	I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and bought this thinking it would work since it is Samsung all around...  not the case.  The charger would work well until the screen turned off as the phone goes to sleep.  When the screen turns off for 5 minutes, the charger beeps, starts blinking the blue light, and no more charging.  I found online that you need to make your phone daydream in order for it to keep charging... I did this, but then the screen stays on... not ideal for nighttime charging.  When  the phone is fully charged, again with the flashing blue light.  No green light when charged as described.  All reviews say the S6 works great... I find it crazy that the note has this issue.
5034121	3	1. It doesn't work for every phone. 2. It takes like 6 hours to fully charged your phone. Returning and getting a regular wall charger. This charger is extremely dangerous, it keeps overheating my phone!!!!
5035784	3	Great concept but your phone has to be in the perfect position to be charged. If not you may come back to a dead or barely charged phone.
5037684	2	somewhat hard to connect
5033154	3	Worked great for a month, has now stopped working. I have tried switching out the cords but the unit will not fully charged my phone. I set my phone and get the red charging led for a few seconds but then it stops charging.
5034089	0	Not a fast charger but it gets the job done. The cord that is included with the phone is faster. It is very convenient for a desk top charger. Does not charge with case.
5036861	3	It didn't work. I ended just plugging the cord directly to my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy s6..so it is compatible just didn't work.
5030176	2	Its very finicky if my phones not on it just right it doesnt want to charge
5037658	3	Overcharged my phone, had to send the phone back in.
5034939	3	convenient for charging while not allowing it to over charge but sometimes will stop charging for no reason... that's annoying
5033772	0	I cannot argue that having a pad to charge on is very convenient at night - easy to pick up, and I need not worry about damaging the charging port in my sleepy haze. However, that said, the charger cord they provide is RIDICULOUSLY short. It is essentially useless for this purpose. I tried switching out a Samsung charging cord that came with my phone, but that really doesn't work - After 8 hours of charging, it can bring me from about 20% to 55%. Not acceptable. When used with all the components it comes with, the charging speed is decent, but doesn't rival the fast charging unit that came with my phone.  Benefits of having purchased this: 1) The very short cord IS very useful for Anker power bank that I use frequently on the go and keep in my pocket. In fact, the power port is quite sturdy. 2) The 2-prong charging port is also very high quality. I use it for charging numerous other electronic devices, and it works better than all the charging units that actually came with those devices.  Caveat: After reading through all the instructions, warnings, etc. I found that there is a small but real chance of catastrophic failure causing fires. Not what you want to see attached to a Samsung device. Especially unnerving since I purchased this to use as an easy way of pocket charging - my thought was that I could keep the charging pad in my pocket, and every time I placed my phone in my pocket, it would get a nice little charge. Not only does the unit generally not work well for this purpose, but given the warnings of fire/explosion, I'm keeping this out of my pants pockets...
5035809	3	not very consistent.  doesn't work on all phones
5031201	3	I ordered this charging pad for my S6 Edge and the charging time is ridiculously slow. You may want to consider an upgraded version.
5037289	2	Nowhere told me that I also need an additional item to convert my battery to be compatible with this charger.
5036645	3	Don't buy. Doesn't work..
5037051	2	Did not explain it was ONLY for the Samsung  6
5032578	3	I received this today plugged it in took 8+ out of case and placed on charger, phone indicated 73% 1hr 20 minutes until fully charged. Seemed rather long but I waited. 20 minutes later only 74%, came back in 30 minutes 75%, pluggedd phone into fast charger 91% in 20 minutes. I purchased an off brand less expensive one (half the price) it works much faster. Considering returning this one.
5029612	3	This product was nice while it worked.  After 7 months it just stopped working.  Tried all kinds of different cords with it and still doesn't work.  Very disappointed.
5033683	2	Didn't fully charge if even slightly touched-gave it away to a friend to use...
5037074	3	Good wireless charger.  Seem like i have to mess around with it to get it to charge.  Other than that it seems to be pretty good.  I wish i could turn off the lights at night.  I have to block it with something on my night stand
5037193	4	The charger pad does not work and I can not get in contact with the seller to exchange.  It was very temperamental since it was opened and now will not charge the phone for longer than 30 seconds.  I purchased another charging pad from another vendor and it works fine.
5036733	3	it s not charging properly. it charges then stop continuously and the phone battery will never be fully charged. Beside there are a lot of pop-up ads during charging process.
5036842	3	I bought two of these chargers, the first two days both of them works great! However on third day, it quickly went down hill.. One of them will charge for a minute or two and start blinking blue lights. I thought it was a feature but when I search on the net, no one can figure out why it blinks blue lights and stops charging. While my other charger has no problem yet. Just wanted to share my experience with you'all!
5030503	3	This worked great for a few weeks, which was nice.  Then it started flashing and not charging my phone. It does not work anymore. Not sure if it was just a bad egg or what but I am unsatisfied.
5032021	3	FYI Not fast charging. But it charges. So we're happy with it.
5032887	3	Slow charging.
5036416	3	Would never charge our New Galaxy Note 5's beyond 70%. I returned it for a refund and will try some other brand instead with a better review and cheaper cost.
5032970	2	difficult to keep phone on so it charges
5036986	2	You have to take the cover off of it in order for it to charge.
5036785	3	Works barely. Charges super slow
5037159	3	The OEM Samsung wireless charging pad (round disc) will charge to 100% then LED turns green for a short time before the charger powers off. Charger will only power on again if you lift phone off then return to the charger.  Unfortunately, Samsung did not include a "top up" function for their wireless charger. This charger is not the best option for overnight charging as you'll surely wake up to less than 100% charge. Keep this in mind when buying this pad
5033197	3	Charges like crap when the wireless function is on. Thinking about returning this.
5037369	2	Not what I expected. Phone has to positioned a particular way or it will not work. Waste of money, totally!
5035467	3	The new charger's light flashed on for a split second and then shut off. Is it defective?  I didn't even get a chance to see if my Galaxy S6 would charge with the device.
5033851	3	I just purchased this Samsung Wireless Charging pad and was totally disappointed when it didn't work at all. We tried both types of phones (S5 and Note 4) as it was stated they both would work on this pad. We even tried other USB cords and it still failed to work. Was hoping it would because this was just what we wanted.
5033192	0	Stopped working after a while. I think the connector was loose.  Also, would not charge phone if phone battery was very low.
5031849	2	Doesnt charge through my thin case unless the phone is placed perfectly.
5036965	3	Works fine,  gets fairly hot when charging Nexus 6 though. A lot of heat is never good for a battery.
5034785	2	Doesn't work on my Samsung Note 4. I've tried everything. Should have sent it back, but just didn't find the time.
5035397	3	Sometimes it loses the connection and stops charging the phone.
5035010	3	The charges okay but very weak. After picking up off the charger it does not really take long For the Power percentage to drop from 100% to 88 percent.
5035738	3	Quit working after 1 week.  Returned for full refund.
5037497	3	Errors in charging when to charge again will not turn the phone charge.
5032829	2	I have 3 different Galaxy mobile phones and NONE of them work on these contraption. Sad that they want you to BUY another case that will only fit 1 phone for an additional 20 bucks! NOT COOL
5037666	3	Charges slow, constantly removing case.
5035157	3	Didn't work half of the time I would place my phone on it. When it did charge it would stop charging at 100% and so the phone wouldn't be fully charged if you left it on there all night.
5032831	3	Why 2 stars... It tends to heat up the phone. You have to find the " Happy spot" when placing your phone on the disc. I ended up going back to the standard plug. I just use it as a paperweight now. I really don't recommend this product
5033867	2	Not happy I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy 5. And did not work..but it worked for my bf droid maxx..wth!..I gave it to him..I don't understand why it would not work with mine it's a Samsung Galaxy and it said it's compatible..I really wanted one of these.ughh
5033100	3	This is a fun item to have but I would never buy one again. I have to have my phone in an exact spot or it will not charge. The first night I had I placed it on the charger and the blue light came on. I went to bed and thr next morning my phone had not charged. Thankfully there was enough battery life left that my phone did not die during the night. Have had the charger for several weeks now and have decided to stop using it because it takes me several tries before I am able to get through phone in the exact spot so it will charge. Plugging it in and setting it on the night stand is much easier.
5036801	2	Waste of money don't work for my galaxy note 3
5030506	3	The product arrived quickly but did not work. It says "original' and box was sealed but there was only 1 cord not 2 as advertised. I tried every outlet in my house and even a cord I had, it still did not work
5033857	3	Very disappointing to see Samsung is selling something like this. Even Those very cheap ones in starbucks or airports work much better. This one either doesn't charge or a couple of minutes after starts blinking and stops totally. I was very excited about this but now I can't wait to return it asap
5032682	3	Charges so slow! Not worth the purchase.
5035105	2	Its good. It charges great, but the problem is that the most annoying part is that you have to take off your cover for the phone to charge it. if you don't it will actually mess it up. I had to reboot it twice one time because of that.
5029981	2	Requires too exact alignment. If phone is a bit off or get jostled, I wake up to a dead battery. I ditched this and went back to a plug, which I can confidently say will stay in overnight.
5036673	3	Doesn't work, stops charging half way through the night and you over sleep and miss your alarm because you phone died because it fails to charge the phone continuously.
5034147	2	Is hard to get the phone to connect to the charger.
5032880	2	Needs to be positioned correctly to function properly. Does not charge fast. If you leave it over night it does the job just make sure it's working right before you leave it.
5036316	3	Did not work at all. I have the right case for wireless charging yet it doesnt even recognize my phone. What a waste of money.
5035666	3	Takes hours to charge phone . Decided to stick to my plugin fast charger
5034993	3	It takes a long time to charge my galaxy s7 and it's really slow in charging
5038153	3	**UPDATE**  I have now had this charger for approximately three months and have used it nightly to charge my S6.  This charger has begun to make a pulsing high pitch whistling noise when not charging anything, almost as if it is trying to locate something to charge.  This gets annoying and old quickly.  Also, the charger has become much more picky about the position of the phone before it starts to charge.  The area where the phone must be placed to charge has gotten much smaller than when the charger was new (probably half as big) and I just hope that it won't completely stop working by the time another three months roll around.  It charges my S6 wirelessly.  However, once my phone is charged, the charger turns off and no longer will charge the phone until it is removed and put back down on the charging pad.  This is an issue because my S6 already has a small battery and waking up to a phone that is only 85% to 90% charged is irritating.  I though the Samsung Wireless Charger would work flawlessly with my S6 and I could wake up with a fully charged phone, this is not the case.  I expected this Samsung charger to keep my phone fully charged and ready to go at anytime.
5030477	2	Terrible product. Doesnt come with dongle, short cable. And worse, stops working periodically. Dont believe me? Google Samsung charger blinking. Piece of crap. Doesnt work on either android or iPhone.
