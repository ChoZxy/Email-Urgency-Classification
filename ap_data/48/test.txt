5037504	2	It wasn't the right charger for my cell phone.
5035244	3	I normally don't write reviews but this product has been frustrating! I've had this product now for a couple months and I do love the design of it plus the fact that it lights up when charging. Unfortunately, every morning when I wake up... my phone is not fully charged! When I first started using the product, it would charge it most nights to 100% but now it never does which is quite frustrating. I have tried daydream mode to help but that has not worked either. At this point, I would not recommend this product!
5036873	3	I ordered two of these and neither one worked.
5031155	2	The item did not work as it should only a Samsung phone
5035054	3	Some days it says it's charging,  when I go to get phone not charged.
5031457	3	It took so long for my phone to charge on this thing that we barely even use it. Now it just sits on the counter so that our guest can use it when they come over and forget their charger.
5033313	0	not impressed
5033492	2	It doesn't charge through the outterbox like the reviews said it would and even without the outterbox on, it charges really slow.  I would return it but my son threw away the packaging and stuff so.  Oh well I lost out on this one.
5033478	2	it does not appear to work for my galaxy note4, with or without my otterbox on the phone, am I doing something wrong?
5033325	2	Very convenient however if it's not aligned in the sweet spot, it will start charging and then stop charging minutes later. Can be a big problem if you start charging and then go to bed only to find it blinking blue in the morning. (Indicating it  wasn't charging.) Great for a desktop charger where you'll notice if it stops charging and can simply re-position it.
5030973	0	Thant was useless in my car. I have tried charging my phone on this several times in the car while driving and its useless
5033370	3	Not working
5034568	3	It takes longer to charge than just plugging it in
5035633	3	Great for the bedroom nightstand for a overnight charge. Otherwise a slow charge.
5033645	3	Was slow charging
5034216	3	Garbage! Stops charging randomly, doesn't work half the time at all. Buy the legit one from your provider or samsung. These are knock offs that can't handle the new phones.
5035373	3	Sometimes it doesn't work and flashing.
5035450	3	Didn't work for our Galaxy 4's.
5033036	4	I been waiting on the email to return this product it does not work for me
5032741	2	This thing is sketchy. It's like it needs to be perfectly centered to work. Very overrated item 2 thumbs down
5034560	3	Worked for a brief amount of time then no longer charged my Android phone. Lasted less than 60 days.
5036238	3	Charging overnight only charges phone 30%. Not happy.
5037260	2	Retarded... forced me to buy a special new back cover for my phone.... once I got that, my existing phone case would bot fit.... ridiculous.
5037186	2	The retailer failed to provide the required 2.0 Amp charger and substituted it for an Amazon 0.85 Amp charger which is not functional with the charging pad.
5034870	0	I wish it would charge as fast as the charging cord that came with my phone. I have a problem where randomly it starts flashing. I had already thrown away the directions when it started doing this so I had to look it up online. Aparently it means that it is not set down correctly. Problem is that sometimes it starts after sitting on the charger for over 15 minutes. Besides that it works as it's supposed to, to charge phones.
5033416	3	Didn't work
5029685	3	This wireless charging pad works, but it does not support fast charging which is a major pain since it takes hours upon hours for a phone to fully charge on this thing.  It is nice to have around to just toss my phone onto when I walk into the room and pick it up on the way out just to get a few minutes of charge time that I wouldn't normally get.  Although taking the time to put my phone on a real charger would be more beneficial, but the wireless charge is convenient which is why we use it, right?
5035965	3	I'm on my second one which at least completely charges the phone most of the time, but once it's charged it does not maintain the charge. If you like to charge your phone overnight you may find that it has been discharging for several hours by morning. The first one I had would not charge the phone completely. As some people are not having problems with the same phone I have, Galaxy S6, I suspect it is just a matter of poor quality control. I bought the similar Seneo charger for $10 less and it works perfectly.
5036769	2	This product description Implies it will work with samsung. ..it won't charge my galaxy note 2
5033664	2	I ordered 2 for 2 samsung galaxy s6, they do not charge either phone. Will be returning them asap. When I place my phone on the charger, I actually lose charge on my phone.
5036944	3	Worked once, then nnothin after that! Very unsatisfied & feeling ripped off!!!  Replacement sent, happy now.
5030032	3	Didn't work that long
5033895	1	Does not fast charge .. Does not seem to work for Samsung Galaxy S6. Waste of money. I cannot even return the box was completely spoiled when i received it.  Would never buy it from this seller.
5035772	3	I thought it would charge just as fast but honestly its so so so slow
5037434	2	Can't get this to work with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge +.  It begins charging and the puck has a solid blue light. However, after a few minutes the blue light starts flashing and charging stops. It has never charged my phone more than 25%. I've tried it with/without the case and with phone both on and off.  Same results each time.
5032709	3	Stopped working after 3 weeks
5033880	2	Great idea but does not work well with the Samsung S6. Tried with 2 phones and when the phones screens turned off so did the charging. Did not want to have to change settings every time the phone is put on the charger. Returned.
5034252	2	Just ok. I don't think it was worth the price tag. It's nice you don't have to fumble woth cords but is that really a pain anyways? It still has to be plugged in and in order for it to charge it has to be sitting on the device. I was hoping it would have an option to charge by it just being close to the device. The light is really annoying at night with no option to turn it off. I prefer to use this at night bc it's easier to grab my phone off of it sleeping when it rings or an alarm sounds. It also gets hot at times I've noticed and that worries me. All and all I think I'd just stick with a fast charging cord to save time and money. It take a very long time to recharge!
5035608	3	Finicky with placement, doesn't hold phone in place, and, furthermore, would go off-line periodically and require that the phone be removed and placed back on - very irritating to come back after an hour and see the phone still where it was when you placed it.  Returned the item, and bought one each of the RAVPower units:  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RGIK7P2 http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B016XHQ2ZU  Both are far better than this unit.
5037650	3	It takes about 45 min to charge my Note 5 via a cord and one hour and thirty minutes for wireless. Also I can put it on the pad then about five minutes later, the blue led indicaterror light will start blinking, so that means it's not charging. I think I'll just stick with the cord
5029822	3	Item stopped working after 2 weeks. Seller wouldn't respond to my emails.
5031891	3	Did not work .  too cheapb to return Don't waste $20 on this piece of junk
5034172	3	You'd be happier with fast wireless charger. Otherwise ok.
5035299	3	Very intermittent charging and some nights the phone would start charging when I went to sleep and I would wake up to a 20% or less battery. Seems like they haven't worked the bugs out of the wireless charging yet.
5033264	3	90% of the time it doesn't charge.
5035029	3	After a few months about 3 months, the charger won't work like new it really worked as if we were using it for decades instead of 3 more than very short on life, it charges very nice though. But you always gotta plug out and back in to charge.
5033605	3	Charges, kinda. On my S7 I have a very hard time with this charger. First I have to take my phone out of its case, and then, it charges VERY slowly. Also if I have an app running while charging, like my sleep app that plays ambient noises, my phone will actually die while on the charger. Not very happy with this product.
5037575	3	I normally love Samsung products.  This product is the exception.  This product is a very poor product.  I purchased one and sent it back in exchange for the same item.  The charger charges for a few seconds and then stops charging.  I constantly have to pick up my Note 5 and place it back on the charger only to have the charger stop charging after about 30 seconds.  If you get a notification on your phone, text message, etc. it just stops charging and doesn't restart.  The blue light flashes blue when it isn't charging.  When I put it in my bedroom and tried to charge my phone the blue light flashing kept waking me up.  I gave up.  I will be returning the 2nd one tomorrow and getting my money back.  If you google this product you will find that many people are having the same problem.  The charger will not charge their phones, just stops charging.  Don't waste your money.
5037235	2	Does not work if you have a OtterBox cover
5033783	2	It didn't work on my phone. I'm trying  send it  tho.
5037192	3	High expectations, low results.  I tried this charger with my Note 4 and my wife's iPhone 6 with the same results. Intermittently stops charging. No way to tell why. Could be a bad heat sensor on the unit. At any rate, when placing the phones on my wife's Pleson disc both phones charge quickly and completely with no shutoffs. I'm returning this one and replacing it with the less expensive, better Pleson.
5035570	2	The charger would work fine if you took the case off the phone....it just was not worth the hassle...sent it back.
5030029	3	This item stopped working within a few months!!! Disappointed. Would not recommend.
5035091	3	When you set the phone on the pad, the pad turns blue to show it is charging.  Then it turns green when charging is complete and stops charging.  Mine keeps turning green before the phone is even halfway charged.  Leaving the phone on the pad for longer periods does not fix this.  The pad stays green and does not charge the phone.  To restart the charging process, you have to lift the phone off the pad and replace it again.  After doing this 3-4 times, the phone will be fully charged.  Not worth the effort when I can plug it in for a couple of hours and have a complete charge.
5035536	3	Works ok.  Sometimes it doesn't register that it is plugged in and I have to plug and unplug for it to work.
5036205	3	This charger is very slow (maybe charges 2% in 15 minutes?) and the LED light is extremely annoying.  When charging, the charger lights up bright blue.  When fully charged, it turns green.  Sometimes, randomly through the night, the blue light would begin to flash.  I thought this was going to be such a useful charger for work or for home, but the light makes it too annoying/disturbing to use on the nightstand, and the slow charging makes it pointless to use at work.  Overall, I am disappointed with Samsung.  Smart concept/idea, but poorly executed.
5032338	3	I like the idea, but it doesn't seem to be working. It got my phone to 70% and that was it. Not sure why it stopped charging after 70%. Expensive investment for it to not work right.
5031123	3	Will not work on any of our phones  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
5030476	2	I bought this product for my galaxy s7 with an otterbox case only to find out this doesnt work with thick cases. I took off the outer shell to see if it made a difference and it would only work on a certian sweet spot on the case.
5033051	3	Did not work at all.  Was not happy with the product.
5036669	3	Works fine. I was concerned that it may not work with my thick otterbox phone case but it did.  The reason for three stars is that it takes a lonf time to charge. More than 2.5 hrs for a full charge.
5033882	3	This is trash.  Instead of charging, it totally depletes the critical low battery time left.  I didn't use the product right away so now its too late to return for a refund.
5031309	3	never worked or even charged didn't even come on i wasted my money
5034958	2	One more current electrical power device...it is not practical if you do not have any electrical plug closer to you!!!
5038072	2	Work fine but need to position the phone carefully to make sure it is charging.
5038298	3	Charges extremely slow and doesn't trickle charge. Once your phone goes to a 100% percent it drains leaving you to wake up to many mornings where your phone isn't fully charged.
5032327	3	Charges very slow.  I don't even use it, only use the power cord to fast charge.
5031929	3	I owned it for exactly 7 days before it stopped working. Don't waste your money!
5035627	2	Gets the job done.. Only dislikes: It IS specific on how you place the phone on top of it for charging. if it is off center, it will not charge. It will not keep the phone charged at 100%, once it reaches, it shuts off the charge.
5035684	3	Love how it looks but does not charge through the night. It charges for about 30min  then suddenly stops and won't fully charge my samsung 6edge.
5033996	3	didnt work well, I returned product
5030008	3	It does not work at all and is not returnable. I'm out almost $40.
5037350	3	This thing is terrible. It charges to 100% and then stops. No trickle charge. I bought it because it was Samsung figuring it would be one of the better options. The round shape is dumb you have to guess and re-position constantly to get the phone to sense where the charging coil is. It is also very bright and flashes when done. Samsung needs to start firing designers that design garbage like this. Get the Spigen. It is intelligently designed and costs less. I love that one.  Update 1/15/16 - After purchasing the Spigen wireless charger and being very happy with it (using it as the primary charger) I just use this Samsung one on the counter to charge the phone when I just set it down for a few during the day. I accidentally left it on this charger last night and it only charged to 75%! This is the worst POS I think I have ever used. I wanted to get this updated review out there so other people hopefully will not be fooled by the Samsung name thinking this is a good charger. It is garbage!
5033423	3	Does not charge the phone and I can't returned because I did not keep the box
5034063	3	Only if it was a fast charger.
5035043	2	was excited to get this wireless charger after getting a new Samsung phone....only problem is it doesn't work consistently with my Galaxy s6 and even worse with my Samsung Note 5. very disappointed. bought a wireless charger from Ikea that works like a charm.
5034672	2	Doesn't work with the Mophie charging case
5031149	3	I ordered 2 of these and they worked great... only complaint I have is that they died after 8 months.
5031565	3	Did not work!
5035858	2	Very finnicky as to where you need to place phone
5031619	2	Didn't work for my Galaxy S 5....not sure why.
5032916	0	I wish i hadnt bought this. It doesnt always connect and when it does it doesnt fast charge. I wish i hadnt spent money on this. I don't use it for fear that ill eake up to a phone thay didn't charge overnight... or not wake up at all because the phone died and left me without an alarm. I took extra care to see that i got the samsung brand to avoid any issues. But this technology just hasn't been mastered yet. Maybe soon. But this isn't it.
5036969	0	It's an ok product kind of pointless found that I us my fast charger more to save on charging time.
5029606	2	Its kind of a pain if you don't put your phone on the pad exactly just right
5029628	3	It doesnt work on my iPhone I tried to send it back but I was new at this and I waited too long so now Im stuck with it
5036098	3	It worked only for the first few days and now it won't charge it 1% horrible purchase.
5031797	2	Doesn't work for my Samsung galaxy
5038245	3	I'm still on the fence about this product. I bought it thinking it would be easy to use but it seems mine maybe defective. Every time I place my phone on it, its super slow to connect. Half the time it doesn't even charge so I come back an hour later and it's only gone up 2% (FAIL!!!). I'm not so sure I will be keeping this product much longer.
5033352	2	If its not on the charger perfectly it does not charge, so make sure you are a perfectionist when buying this one.
5032927	2	it charge it if i don't take the phone cover out.it not as good
5037473	3	It doest always charge after all nite issays please plug in charger now
5035358	3	Waste of money takes to long to charge..the charger that comes with the phone charger faster
5033054	3	I purchased this for Christmas and for the first month it work good but slow and now it won't work at all. I usually charge while I sleep and I wake up to a dead battery. The colored light goes off about twenty minutes  after I put my phone on it and hear the ding.
5035875	3	Charges REALLY slow.
5030245	2	Cant recommend them. Ive had 2 & sometimes doesnt  charge unless the phone is sitting just perfectly on it. Going to return this one also
5035838	3	Horible... I don't know if it's defective or if it's just it won't work for my phone? But I'm very dissatisfied..
5036477	2	I bought this charger because it specifically said it would work for my phone. But when I got it, the box said something different. Long story short it didn't work for my phone. I feel like there is something shady going on, because when I went back into the listing it no longer named my phone as being compatible.
5035325	0	Hoping it came with cover for phone
5030175	2	My Samsung cell phone wouldn't work with it. I had to buy an LG.
5032816	2	Did not work for my s7
5033944	3	Works fine for a while then stops charging.
5036372	3	So excited to get this. Worked twice and never again. I have Samsung phone. Changed plugs, locations, took cover off phone. Threw packaging out with Christmas trash so stuck with piece of useless equipment.
5033666	3	This charger never worked and wouldn't charge my phone
5032629	2	Doesn't work with my husband's OtterBox case over his phone, so he won't use it, works well with mine (it's a case mate clear glitter rubber, sort of thing case). It is nice to have in the living room when my other charger is upstairs
5033464	2	The unit looks nice and it lit up when I plugged it in but I couldn't get it working on my Nexus 7 2013. Even after cleaning the contacts and resetting the bootloader it wouldn't recognize it
5035456	2	The only problem that I have with this is that you have to put the phone on the charger in just the right spot or it won't charge. Otherwise it's pretty good.
5030110	3	thought it was the fast charger. It charges to slow
5033300	3	Was expecting my phone to charge faster, takes about 4 hours for it to fully charge! Best feature is the extra cord that I can use to charge my phone 100% in only 30 mins!!
5030525	2	Doesn't charge through my case. Very disappointed.
5035629	3	I have a Galaxy S6 and this charger would not fully charge my phone nor would it steadily charge.  It would keep turning off and on and off and on.  Didn't last for more than 2 days before the problems started.
5033573	3	Cool idea. Charges slower than fast cable directly to USB port. That's expected though I suppose.  It has BRIGHT blue and green status LED's which if you keep it beside your bed can be a bit annoying while trying to sleep.  Also it may be my imagination but when battery has been charged wirelessly it seams to discharge quicker.  It's also very positional in order to get my galaxy S7 edge to begin charging. I usually have to pick it up a few times and reposition it to start the charging process.
5035990	3	Love the cordless charging ability however I find that it will show green, fully charged, even though it's not. It isn't a replacement for a standard wall charger but 5 star for convenience
5035936	3	Still waiting to get the inside working. Having problems.
5034759	2	Wasnt the right product for my Galaxy Note 4
5038423	3	Simply doesn't work. I have a Galaxy S6 Edge, it would say it was charging and then I would check it in the morning and it hadn't charged at all and my battery was down to 48%! I have one of the rectangle shaped wireless chargers from Samsung that works great... This round "Puck" styled charger is worthless, would have expected better from Samsung.
5035134	3	Wish I did not buy this. It charges VERY slow. I had to buy the battery wireless charging card also (Galaxy 5S). When my phone charges the light stays on, and when the phone is fully charged it blinks making it not usable next to my bed at night. My phone also gets blazing hot. I will say it does function.
5035414	3	Takes forever to charge.
5035004	2	Fast charge doesn't seem so fast. Also comma it's easier just to put a micro Cable in during the day because when you want to use your phone you have to take it off the charger otherwise
5037727	3	keeps turning off.  would charge for a minute then a blinking purple light would come on and my phone would stop charging.  This is a disappointment as a Samsung product...  I'm not sure if my product is a defective one but would like a replacement first to see if that's the case.  Until then... well.. I definitely don't recommend buying this product.
5037634	3	Don't buy this charger! I tried to use it with my brand-new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, and it took forever to properly position it, then, inexplicably, it would stop charging without any warning. An absolute piece of junk. I went to the Verizon store and purchased their upright wireless charger *(the device sits in a cradle at an angle), and it worked flawlessly right away.  Maybe this is a first-generation wireless charger, I don't know, but I can assure you that you won't be happy with it!
5036759	0	Absolute Junk! The only thing that works is the light that tells you it is plugged in. Purchased this and a Samsung wireless charging case so you would think that it would work...Wrong!!! Purchased a Choetech , Anker, and a Tylt and all worked flawlessly. HArd to believe Samsung produced a pretty paperweight.
5032664	2	When it works it works well. You have to get the phone in the exact spot. Spend more money and get the mophie flat table charger.
5033911	2	Does not work well with S5 Note in plastic case.  Charging not consistent
5031615	3	Works when it wants to.
5035446	3	Much slower to charge than adaptive fast charging
5031044	2	DID NOT CHARGE MY SAMSUNG S7EDGE. light came on but it did not charge my device
5038262	3	Doesn't charge the phone to 100%, light starts blinking and it disconnects. Also the light is pretty bright if you plan on using it at night. There are much better chargers at lower prices.
5032025	2	Will not charge my s8+.  It will charge  the s6 however. ???
5029855	2	Did not connect properly to my brand new s plus 9
5034504	0	Complete piece of garbage. Don't waste your money.
5037720	2	It only works good with the fast charger. If not then it keeps cycling (charging then stop charging, then charging) which is bad for the battery. might as well connect it to the fast charger at that point...
5036578	3	Only charges for a few seconds and then quits charging. Have to continuously pick it up and put it on and off charger to even get a few percent of battery charged.
5033318	3	It's junkie. The adapter it came with was broke and didn't work so we used our own. And it takes forever to charge your phone
5031848	3	Returned used once and broke
5030020	3	Always stops charging
5038322	3	It's OK.  The design is great, but sometimes I'll put the phone on it and it doesn't start charging.  Other times it will start charging but later I'll look over and it will be blinking blue, what happened?  And I'm pretty sure once it charges to 100%, it shuts off, then the phone will drain down a bit yet the charger doesn't start charging again.  Also, pretty disappointing that it didn't come with cord. :(
5032879	3	slow charging, but extremely convenient. For the price I'd put one in all my important rooms,  bed, office and living
5034136	3	It didn't work.  I sent it back.
5034858	3	Charges very slowly through the Otterbox Defender Case. When using Mobile Hot spot with phone charging on Pad, phone still discharges down to about 60% in a few hours.
5036027	2	The description plainly says it works with Galaxy S5. But when I got it the packages tells you on the package that you have to have some other cover for it to work with S5. Needless to say, it doesn't work with my Galaxy S5. Very disappointed.
5034424	3	I really like the wireless charging "potential" (that's the key word here) this pad has, but it doesn't charge my phone--it simply maintains the percentage it was at when I placed it on there in the first place. I use it at work to slow down my battery decline, but if you're looking to actually charge a phone, just stick to plugging it in. My S6 Edge actually came with a "fast charger" that is true to its name. I would invest in one of those instead.
5036459	3	Sats fast charging an charges slow left it on charger over night an still did not finsh charging my phone
5032925	3	Doesn't charge your phone fast at all!!!
5032210	3	Charge very slow
5033317	3	This charges incredibly slow.  Tried using it with the S6 and S7.  I actually saw the percentage decrease when first placed on the charger.  Would have returned it but missed the return window :(
5033121	0	Have to mess with it to charge my s6. Remove my phone and replace a few times. Sometimes my phone doesnt read and pauses wirless connection. But overall its good
5034802	3	The part that comes with it that you need to attach to your phone is super small and doesn't work that well.
5036393	3	Charges way to slow but does work. I have a Samsung S6 and it  will not charge unless daydream is turned on.
5031199	2	you have to move it around to get it to work. but i'm using a leather case. when I take the case off it connects a little quicker
5033055	2	Phone needs to be placed in a particular position or will not charger. other then that item as describe.
5035829	3	Stop working after months!!!! Waste of money
5030177	2	The product works but I thought it was a fast charger and its not if I would have known it wasn't I wouldn't have bought this product, after charging my phone that battery drains really quick and doesn't last me a day.
5037922	3	The charging unit arrived dead. Would not work. If I had not thrown the packing away I would have sent it back>
5033565	2	It does what it says. It charges wirelessly. But... it's not a good product. If your phone is "bigger" aka the Edge Plus, then you have to move the phone around the charger until it says it's charging. Also, it's not a fast charger. It takes a few hours to get a full battery. You are better off buying a fast charger, and save money/time because this product sucks. I should be able to come home and put my phone on the pad and continue with my day, but no, I have to stand there for a little while to try to make the phone charge. Not worth it!
5038094	3	Doesn't work never charged my phone! Went to bed at 40% and woke up with us saying it was charging and it was at 20% :(
5038053	3	I find that when you go to sleep at night and put your phone on the charger it lights up and the base lights up because it's being charged. The phone light shuts off eventually but the charger light doesn't. Also I find that after charging the phone completely it doesn't keep it charged to 100%. Once the phone reaches full charge the charger stops maintaining the battery at full capacity so it just slowly drains the rest of the night and so when you wake up your phone is not fully charged anymore. I found my phone at 58% one morning, very unacceptable. The only thing this charger seems to be good for is living at my desk at work so when I return to my desk I can just set my phone down on the charger to give it a little more juice before I have to get up to go fix the next issue (I'm an IT guy).
5032516	3	I got this wireless charger for my fiancee and it WOULD NOT STOP BEEPING. so she stopped using it.
5030976	3	Seems to take a long time to charge my phone. I have the iPhone X and it works to charge it (just very slowly). I meant for this to be a present for my boyfriend- he has a samsung galaxy S8. However, he has a credit card holder on the back of his phone, and so it's too thick for it to be able to be charge (understandably I guess). But even when he took off the case and cardholder, his phone had to be positioned very precisely for it to charge at all...
5037877	3	Pretty disappointed in this charger. It works, however it gets extremely hot and makes the phone extremely hot as well. I had to take the phone off after about fifteen minutes since I could smell hot plastic from the phones case. I'm also disappointed in the fact the items description says it comes with the charging cord as well but didn't.
5037824	3	This is a rip off,  it's not the real thing,  I want my money back,  it doesn't even work.
5034927	3	Charges very slow
5038410	3	Charges extremely slow. Stick to your rapid charging wire.
5035780	3	i have a galaxy edge  plus this charger is horrible soon as I place it on the charger it starts to flash blue and will not charge the phone I will need my money back for this product asap...
5035226	3	The look, appeal, device placement, and general function all meet or exceed my expectations.  However, the lack of being able to properly trickle charge, or safely maintain the battery level at 100% means that I wake up in the morning to a battery at anywhere from 65-85% at best.  Heck, I'm a restless sleeper and have even disturbed the positioning, thereby causing the battery to drain and the alarm not going off causing me to oversleep.  I tried not using the Samsung charger cable, but that wasn't it.  An Anker wireless charger that I've switched to maintains the full charge.
5035039	3	I lovedon't it when I recieved it however it takes 3 x's longer to fully charged and the battery last a few hours and after 2 weeks of using it... it's no longer charging my phone so not wait your money on it .....
5035114	3	Wireless charging is slow.  I use the cord and not the wireless charging pad.
5036958	3	Very slow charge, but I guess its ok to have beside your bed or something if you don't feel  like unplugging your phone at night when its dark etc.
5029635	3	I thought with this charging pad I would have some longevity as the previous one did not last a year.  At first I was quite pleased with the pad, but a few weeks ago, with no warning or no obvious problem the device stopped working and is still unable to be used.  One would think that Samsung would not want their name attached to such an inferior product.  Now I have 2 useless charging pads that no one can else can use either.
5032683	3	The product doesn't work. I bought the Qi Charging Receiver for Galaxy S5  at the same time and they do not charge the phone. I couldn't find any help to figure out why it didn't work. What a waste of money.
5033309	3	I'm a bit disappointed. I order the black color because I have the black onyx color phone, the charger had a tacky white cable instead of a matching color to the hub of the charging station. I also had some trouble with the charging, it would pause randomly and not charge even tho the phone was at 15%... will see if this persists i will have to send it back.
5035723	3	There are slot of times I set my phone on it and it does not light up or start charging. Guess I should just go back to a wired charger.
5034851	2	Spot it didn't work with my phone
5035383	4	Can I return this. It is a very slow charger.
5032825	3	Total garbage.  Does not charge your phone.  Apparently, "Wireless charging paused" is a known problem with this unit.
5031921	3	The wireless pad worked great for almost a month. Today I woke up today to smell smoke the charge pad was smoking and burnt my bedside table.
5037216	3	Doesn't work
5034355	3	It was a great concept but takes well over 3 hours to charge the phone completely
5033155	2	Worked fine the first week, now you have to move it around to find the perfect spot to charge your devices, even though it say fast charger, it takes more that the normal to charge, (sometimes more that 5 hrs.) Nevertheless thats my review fot the charge. However, no complaints on the seller, 5 for him/her. Promptly communication and gast shipping. Thanks.
5036868	2	This charger does not work with my phone very well. I'm really not happy with it
5031158	3	Lasted for about 8 months and then stopped charging my phone.  You may want to consider a product with a longer life span.
5035378	3	I'm so disappointed in this product and also kind of in myself fo not paying attention to the negative reviews. It came yesterday and I was super excited about it. I plugged it in and it worked great for about 5 minutes until I realized that it kept stopping the charge. I kept placing it back thinking maybe it was just finicky but didn't think it was a deal breaker yet because it was still working. Today I put my phone on the charger and...it was completely dead. It wouldn't work at all in any position. I unplugged it and tried multiple outlets in the house thinking that might do it and also tried others' phones but nope. After one use (where it was already barely working) it was completely broken. The item itself wasn't dead I realized because when I would plug it into the wall I would see the LED light come on but it's functionality was dead - it would not charge the phone. Returned it for a refund and and might have sought a replacement if not for all of the negative reviews. I definitely am paying attention to the reviews this time around, will not be getting a replacement and instead  will be spending my $30 on a product that actually works.
5034461	3	I didn't even work.
5033797	3	After one year of used, the thing stop charging.
5034440	3	I'm giving a rating of 3 because the charging pad charges slow but the cord that came with it charges faster
5037321	2	Not compatible with the Note 5. Likely not the charger's fault, more like Samsung's handling of Note 5/S6+ fast charge feature not quite being backward compatible, but a sour experience none-the-less.
5037677	3	When it works, it works great. But most of the time it will stop charging my phone after the screen auto locks. I saw on web someone suggested using dream mode instead. Had no effect. The only thing that has helped is I've slightly increased the distance gap between the phone and charger using a piece of paper folded in half. Doing that increased my odds of it actually charging to 85%. I'm not sure who to blame - the phone or the charger - but both devices are Samsung so this should have got noticed in their testing since I've seen lot of other people have the same problem.  The whole point of this is quick and simple/just lay it down, but if I have to make sure paper is on pad and folded in half kind of defeats the purpose. I'm going to keep it just so I can keep the wear and tear of the USB port to a minimum but I'm not happy.
5030488	2	The delivery was great but the product isn't quite what I expected it is the slowest charger ever
5037690	2	Charging pad was white and cord was not in package
5034894	3	It works well, but be weary if leaving it over night, as it can make the charging base and the phone very hot. So charge it as you are paying attention so it doesnt overheat.
5032357	3	Doesn't charge my phone with or without the case on.
5032283	3	Will charge my phone for a little bit then drains the battery total waste of money unless u just use the charging cable with out the wireless pad in which case I just bought an 18$ cable ......useless
5034629	3	Did not work as a wireless charging pad.
5036895	3	Does not charge fast. Also after 30 min blinks blue. Went back to the cord much faster
5038299	3	Works pretty well. Light is not too obtrusive if it's by your bedside. The most annoying part is that once your phone reaches 100% it will stop charging until you pick the phone up and put it back down again. Very frustrating if you put it down at 95% before bed and wake up with a battery life lower than that.
5031594	2	cant count on it works sometimes and sometimes not and you have to take your phone out of its cover to me easier to plug the phone in
5032956	2	Will not charge Samsung galaxy note as the description says it will.
5030970	3	Didn't work well for us... you had to place it just the right way to charge and it took FOREVER to fully charge! I was so disappointed, really wanted it to work. =(
5037090	2	Will not work if your phone is waterproof.
5032999	2	doesn't work for my galaxy note 4 ..which said it would in the details! but I kept it for the wire charger part!
5038045	3	This charging unit does not keep the phone at 100%.  When you get up in the morning and find the phone at 75% or 94% or some other random % LESS than 100%, it is very disappointing.  I waited past by 30 days so was screwed for sending it back.
