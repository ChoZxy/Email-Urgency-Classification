eb137ff02d5289d3e74fde57a2a126d7	very critical	The Case of the Bizarre Bouquets by Nancy Springer opens with John Watson going missing. Enola, meanwhile, feels she must close up shop because her brothers have gotten to close to finding her. She has no desire to let them run her life. But there's a new threat she needs to think about, the mad house, where women are being sent who don't play by Victorian rules.   Despite her own fears and joblessness, Enola decides to investigate Watson's disappearance. With the help of the disguise shop she knows Sherlock uses, she creates a new persona for herself and sets out to befriend Mrs. Watson.   The Case of the Bizarre Bouquets takes its name from a strange set of flowers delivered to Mrs. Watson's home upon the disappearance of her husband. Although Enola had a rather Bohemian childhood, she and her mother did enjoy sharing messages with the language of flowers. That shared hobby comes in handy here and she sees a message that her brother first misses.   In so many of the books set in Victorian times I've read the women are presented in a very narrow spectrum. They are prostitutes, aristocrats, maids or flower sellers. Enola's London has many more types of women, up and down the entire social ladder. These women make London seem more real and certainly more interesting.   And sometimes, more dangerous. Enola's adventures in this third volume are more dangerous than the typical tween mystery I've read. Her life is threatened. She gets hurt. Much of what happens to her is her own misjudgment. It's both shocking and refreshing to find a tween protagonist who is vulnerable.

I don't like the lead (Elizabeth) and don't envision her this heroine that we're supposed to. This book has parts you cannot put it down. Other exist that you can put it down and not look at for a month. This book series has a lot going for it: unique setting, striking characters, tons of drama. But it lacks a better story arc.
aec3cef32cd7124653b4b8bf111ad6b0	critical	American Bard welcomes the reader into her life in Provence as she transitions to young motherhood in a small town in Southern France. The change of seasons and of societal and familial roles is scaffolded in culinary terms as we are treated not only to the author's insights into French life but also to her recipes. While at times her adopted snobbiness regarding the superiority of French cuisine (as opposed to American) and the culture surrounding it became insulting (may I be allowed to like my peanut butter, please, without feeling like an ignorant barbarian???), there's no arguing that the French diet is a wonderful one. Bard's explorations of family, culture, and life are honest and entertaining.

687345ffd51c74c09f5ee2410e24d93e	very critical	"I have been struggling for some time now to come up with an introduction for this review. I began by writing about how ridiculous the cover image of the orange paper crane is, as origami hardly figures into the book and seems to me like a stereotypical way to clue the reader into the fact that it features Japanese characters. But that seemed too negative a way to begin a review of a book I actually liked quite a lot. Then I wrote about how the internment of Japanese Americans after the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack has inspired such a wealth of excellent literature, but that struck me as a flippant way to talk about one of the worst crimes the United States has ever committed against its people. So in an effort to get things going, I will simply say this: When the Emperor Is Divine is a novel about the Japanese Internment, and it is surprisingly, heartbreakingly good.   In truth, I am coming to novel kind of late. First published in 2002, it has become a classic of Asian American literature and one of the National Endowment for the Arts' ""Big Read"" titles. Anyway, the considerable praise the book has won is justified. Most obviously, as other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is lovely. I know nothing about Julie Otsuka except that she is also the author of The Buddha in the Attic, another historical novel about Japanese Americans set in the first half of the twentieth century. But it is immediately clear that she knows how to conjure simple images that convey multitudes and how to express big ideas in just a few relatively simple words. When the Emperor Was Divine describes four years in the life of a Japanese American family, including the Pearl Harbor bombing, the preparations to leave home, the experience of living in the detainment camp, and the first several months after returning home again at the end of the war. It tells this story from the perspectives of the mother, the daughter, the son, the daughter and son together, and the father who could be anyone's father. It does all this while also describing unforgettable scenes such as the death of the family dog. Incredibly, it does all this in about 150 swift pages -- a hard slap or cold splash of water in the face.   As stirring as Otsuka's prose is, however, I think the book's power also comes -- how do I say this? -- from that fact that it has distilled or synthesized so many previous accounts of the internment into such a compact and relatable volume. Like a lot of people, I first learned about this devastating moment in history from Jeanne and James Houston's Farewell to Manzanar, which I read as a class assignment in my freshman or sophomore year of high school. Since then, I have sought out a few additional books on the same topic, including Yoshiko Uchida's Desert Exile, which I reviewed earlier this year. Just a few weeks ago, I picked up a copy of Lawson Fusao Inada's Only What We Could Carry: The Japanese Internment Experience, which collects a number of primary sources, memoirs, short stories, and other texts related to the internment, offering readers and teachers a huge amount of information between just two covers. Personally, I enjoy working my way through all these texts that offer different perspectives on the same circumstance, but I imagine that is probably not the case for most readers, particularly at the high school and undergraduate level.   When the Emperor Was Divine offers an answer to this dilemma by piecing together some of the best moments from the most memorable texts that came before it. The family's movement from Berkeley to an abandoned racetrack to the Topaz relocation center is loosely based on the events Uchida narrates in Desert Exile, as are many of the personal details about sandstorms and the internment schools. Like John Okada's No-No Boy, the book talks about the complicated feelings that ran through the detainees in these camps when they were forced to declare their loyalty to the United States by disavowing the Japanese emperor and (for males) agreeing to join the armed forces of the nation that had incarcerated them. If, on the one hand, When the Emperor Was Divine gives its characters nonspecific names (""Mother,"" ""Son,"" etc.) to let us know it is describing circumstances faced by many people, on the other hand, it synthesizes the archive of previous internment-related writings to create a genuinely representational reading experience.   I would never not say that you should read only one book about the internment, but if you were planning only to read one, well, this should probably be it. It has perhaps not replaced Farewell to Manzanar as the most commonly read novel about this sad, infuriating period in American history, but signs indicate that it is headed in that direction -- particularly if teachers such as myself continue to add it to their lists of required student readings. If you haven't picked this book up yet, I say you should do it sooner than later. Fold back that irrelevant cover and dig in."

4e8b1bc8fa2a57acf35a67a81e96f531	critical	"An absolutely thrilling memoir about a young girl getting caught up in the worst of situations. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering what convoluted turn is coming up next. The writing is clear and precise and the author is very easy to relate to, though most of us cannot even imagine her situation, the author does a good job of making it understandable. I would give this book a 4.5 if I could, it was a great read and I got it on my Nook for only about $4.50!   The only qualm I have about the book (and it is a minor one) is that you get the feeling the author is telling you every detail and then twice in the book she goes back and says that once her brother visited her while she was in California with John, and then says the same thing later about her father. I felt slightly cheated, like ""Hey, you didn't tell me that!"" but overall it was a minor blip on the radar of an otherwise awesome book. Highly recommend.   Oh, as an aside, this is mainly a memoir about her life with John Holmes and not a story about the Wonderland murders. So, don't go into it expecting a true crime book, it is definitely more on the memoir side, though the murders factor in toward the end of the book, of course."
ecc10df24e7a9c24ad7b8aa748e9e9bc	neutral	A good book with a lot of information, but I probably need to read this again somewhere down the line. I felt it read like more like a history book and there wasn't so much a main story throughout the book. I also want to read this slower next time with an old map of New York close to my side, or possibly while I'm visiting New York. If you think this book is like the movie, it's not. In fact the movie is VERY loosely based off the book. There was a Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis character) but how he dies is much different and much earlier than around 1965 like in the movie. If you like Asbury's Barbarey Coast about San Francisco around the same time period then you will probably like this book as well.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked this up, but whatever my expectations were they were not only met but exceeded.   It took me some getting used to the writing style. This is very much written as Alice's story, her voice is very clear, and the style is slightly old-fashioned. Alice is not afraid to tell it as it is inside her head, but perhaps not so much to other people, especially her brother. I think what I loved most about the writing was how superstition and fear was very much evident. It almost had the feel of a horror, but it was very subtle in its presentations.

ccba15738108487cc5f58468710a663b	very critical	"I have such mixed emotions about this book that I'm not really sure how to begin to put my thoughts to words.   One the one hand, this book was annoying. A girl who grew up filthy rich, with the finest of everything was spoiled, dissatisfied, and amused herself with morbid curiosities and negative-attention seeking behavior. The book rings of the ""Poor me, my plight is everyone's fault but mine"" sort of mentality that I dislike. You'll read other reviews that speak of the author's insensitivity and cruelty to other family members even as a full-grown woman that show that I'm not alone in my general feeling about the writers' emotional maturity.   On the other hand, I found myself relating to experiences she describes with her mother, who was obsessed with her own exterior appearance, the ""superficial"", and having a man. When she found a man, he had near omniscient status and determined how good or bad her children should be treated. The children in general were often her lowest priority, often left in a state of neglect while she herself was on her manhunt. When she interacted with her daughter she often was inappropriate in her choice of what to say and often would constantly remind her of how unattractive and undesirable she is. I guess most of us can relate to some level of dysfunction; this was the area that struck a few nerves for me.   It was generally well written, and often humorous. I'm not really familiar with the Vanderbilt/Burden families, but still found myself able to develop a basic interest in the memoir."

d6a83944fe81c8f0ac0669ed2ad88c1f	neutral	This book was ok. Set in the seventh century during the Roman Empire, so one strike against is that it's not really a favored time/place combination for me, historically speaking. I wasn't bowled over by the story, and found the large number of peripheral characters with similar-sounding names to be very confusing. Also the Roman terminology, which thankfully there was a glossary for in the back, but it was awkward using the Kindle. I think also the Kindle formatting was very poorly done which further distracted from the story itself, lots of misplaced punctuation and extra hyphens. I will give the series another try, most likely, but will try to find a print copy of book 2.

It's loaded with information and includes a nice bibliography. A must read for anyone researching this area of the Upstate.

745bc82b65edd6fd8e775862021ca356	neutral	This review also appears on my blog at http://www.thegoldenruleof666.blogspo...   A very sweet romance novella! This little story is absolutely wonderful.   Alexandra wants to find a husband so that she won't be married off to some foreign prince. So, she goes to Scotland to find herself a strong highlander. And, while she is stuck in an inn, she meets her future hubby-James Keith, the Earl of Kintore-who isn't as enthused about getting married as she is.   I really liked Alexandra. She was a tough heroine who knew what she wanted and did whatever she could to get it. And that included James. She was likable and a heroine anyone can support.   James was sweet, if a bit blockheaded. He blames himself for the death of someone he loved, so he doesn't want to marry and end up failing to save another person he loves. Which puts him at a conflict with Alexandra. While he is attracted to her, he is reluctant to marry. But, besides that stubbornness, which is eventually resolved, he was very sweet and adorable. I absolutely loved him.   James and Alexandra had sparks flying between them immediately and it never stopped. But, they were also very sweet together, a couple anyone could root for.   The plot is well developed for a novella. And the ending was very sweet.   I loved this novella. Romance lovers, if you want a nice, quick read, this is your novella.   *Thanks to Edelweiss and Pocket Star for a copy!

85c0d99dce1a3c61f01a6226dc9f7935	very critical	"Originally posted on Adria's Romance Reviews   * A copy of this book was provided by the publisher via NetGalley for the purpose of an honest review.   The Match of the Century isn't just Benedict and Elin's story, it is Benedict's brother Gavin's story too and that made the entire book stand out to me. Yes it's a love triangle but it's also a story about three people who live, learn and love over a period of time that isn't always rainbows and kittens. There is a huge amount of character growth because the story takes place over a long period of time. Close to two years I believe, and in that time the characters experience love, jealousy, betrayal and loss, but with all those strong emotions came a more broad viewpoint which included more consideration for others around them and of course a new found maturity.   The one character who underwent the biggest change in my opinion was Benedict. When he first came barging back into Elin's life he was an uncivilized, angry, and selfish man. I understood and sympathized with his position but it was clear he was fighting a losing battle to win Elin. If he wanted to be worth the scandal it would cause if Elin jilted his brother, Benedict had to change and it wasn't going to be easy or come overnight.   Normally such a long timeline in a romance would bug me, not because I want a fast solution but because it could drag an entire story into dullsville but with The Match of the Century, the lengthy timeline made sure that each character had a chance to grow, change and experience life altering events that would shock them into facing their own personal truths because all three characters, Gavin, Elin and Benedict were simply existing instead of living their lives. Cathy Maxwell pulled off something that I have only read and enjoyed once before and that's a long timeline in a romance.   For the first half of the book I found Gavin to be very one dimensional. I saw him as Benedict saw him and I didn't know what to make of the man who was Benedict's competition. It wasn't until the second half of the book that the author let me know Gavin the man and he was just as complex as his brother.   It wasn't until then that I began to sympathize with Gavin and think Maybe he isn't so wrong for Elin, if they could just fall in love with each other maybe it could work for them. I felt for this character, he was trapped in a role that he couldn't escape, he was estranged from his only surviving brother and he didn't really know how to treat his fiance. Gavin was an example of a rich, powerful man whom society respected yet who didn't have the simplest, most necessary things in life: A close relationship with his brother or mother, true friends or a woman he loved. The ""love triangle"" took on a different tone after that because most love triangles have that one character that is unlikable and will allow readers to favor the obvious victor but in this case, especially in the second half of the book, neither Gavin nor Benedict was unlikable or an easy man to eliminate. Maxwell created sympathy for both men, and they both deserved Elin yet at the same time they weren't fighting for her, they were competing against each other.   I could go on forever about how well developed The Match of the Century was in terms of its three leading characters but then it would turn into an essay so I'll just say that I was pleasantly surprised by how attached I became to Gavin, Elin and Benedict and while the ending was a happy one, the journey there was a difficult one for them but one that was far more interesting than I ever thought it would be.   Final Verdict: Lengthy and emotionally engaging, The Match of the Century is one of the most well written, character driven romance novels I've ever read. Pick this book up only when you have plenty of time to devote to it as it is a long story but well worth the time investment."

Not being a math person, much of the beginning was completely lost on me. Which is a shame, because math is the beginning. I don't know a whole lot about differential equations, but I now know that people disliked them enough to build the first computers to solve them for us. The rest, as they say, is history.   We travel from the birth of capacitors to the microchip, to the birth of the mouse to graphical user interface. It explores open-source software, collaboration, and the birth of the Internet. It digs deep into the world wide web. It does everything. I can just sit here and list things, and continue to be awed by the fact someone came up with all this. Bridging all the way back to Ada Lovelace, our proclaimed ""first programmer,"" who envisioned the way humans and machines would one day interact. It blows my mind.   Each generation thinks ""this is the best we've done."" We never believe that technology can get any better than this, and we have all we need. But then come these ""innovators""--the Charles Babbage, the Robert Noyce, the Steve Jobs--who know what people need before we know we need them. Who see things that we don't. And we have them to thank for the fact I'm writing a book review on my massively large computer screen, and that my computer pings when I receive an electronic message, and I can open up any old web browser and search for anything I want. (Google's origins are fascinating.)   Special shoutout to all the early programmers, who were primarily women, who didn't even know the impact they would have on the whole of history. Most of this book is a bunch of white guys, but I will cling to those early programmers whose names we don't even remember anymore."

20224def9148fc64a5cb143a39aacb22	neutral	Overall a funny read. I would have given it a bit higher rating if I could have completed it in a stretch. Was quite busy these days also so could not read it continuously, finding the story inconsistent at times(though completely agree to be the problem on my side).   I've started to doubt the classics. These are the books which have been hyped quite much and I'm not experiencing the kind of results compared to my expectations. The narrative failed to bind me to the story of the adventure otherwise I would have definitely made time to read it in a stretch.   I completely agree that the narrative had its ROFL moments which were quite realistic, mostly based on people's behavior and psychology. Four friends on an adventure trip onto an uncharted territory to get out of the monotonous daily life, that is everyone's dream and it has been portrayed comically. Every friend circle has its characters of amusement - the hardworker, the lazy one, the fool, the pompous one and so on. The narrative also had all of it and had explained humourous circumstances relating to the activities on the trip.

20866c3ef19c3a51853f931d2c295dd3	very critical	"Dennis Ross provides an interesting take on how all the U.S. Presidents dealt with the State of Israel, from Harry Truman and the founding of the Jewish State in 1948, all the way through to Barack Obama. It's fair to say that all U.S. Presidents have been supportive of Israel to a greater or lesser degree. One of the points made by the author is that the Presidents generally sought to strike some sort of balance in the region, between support for Israel and support for the Arab states, some more successfully than others. Some, like G.W. Bush, for example, tended to be more supportive of Israel's security issues and distrustful of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, while others, such as Barack Obama, tried harder to strike a more balanced approach between Israel and the Arab world.   Ross also makes a point that U.S. Presidents shouldn't be too concerned that outright support for Israel (whether through arms sales, monetary loans, or preventing condemnation of Israel in the United Nations) might harm U.S. interests in the Arab world. He supports this through examples in which the U.S. aided Israel, but the Arab nations did not react aggressively against the U.S., as several of the presidential advisors had feared. That said, I seem to remember oil embargos and oil price hikes in the past which make me question Ross's feeling in that regard. Ross also seemed to feel that the Palestinian issue (e.g., the need for a homeland for the Palestinians and the question of Palestinian refugees) isn't as significant a source of anti-Israel / anti-American feelings in the Arab world as many seem to think. That's quite a different impression as I have had, and I have to think that Ross, being Jewish and I believe also a co-founder of AIPAC (a powerful Jewish lobby in the U.S.), might not see things quite as impartially as he might want to believe.   Another interesting aspect is how each U.S. president has condemned, argued against, criticized, or threatened Israel against building further settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and how each was rebuffed and ignored by the various Israeli leaders. Continued settlement buildings have been identified as an obstacle to peace, and makes a two-state solution next to impossible. Israeli leaders have, at times, indicated a willingness to halt settlement building, and a willingness to work toward a Palestinian state. However, as settlement buildings continue, this seems to be a fading dream. I'm reminded of Netanyahu's quote during his most recent election campaign (even though he later backtracked from the statement), that ""... there will never be a Palestinian State"" as long as he was in power.   Another tidbit I found interesting in the book was, when Ross detailed each President's dealings with the Middle East, in only one case do I remember him speaking about the influence of any Vice President. As many would guess, that was Dick Cheney in George W. Bush's presidency. Many have discussed Cheney as being the most powerful and influential Vice Presidents ever, and while not an intended focus of the book, the prominance of this one Vice President seems to support this view.   I enjoyed the descriptions Ross provides of the issues and decisions the last dozen U.S. Presidents had to make regarding Israeli / Middle East events over the past 50 years. My main regret is the lack of a clearer historical link to the most significant events in Israeli / Mid East history during each of the presidential terms, and not adding a little more about how each of those events and wars also impacted U.S. policies.   The final feeling I was left with is that the relations between Israel and the U.S. are not always smooth and easy. Both countries have interests and needs, and often they may and do clash. Unfortunately, based on seeing the interactions between the U.S. and Israeli leaders as outlined in this book, the likelihood of smoother relations next year, with a new President and the same Israeli Prime Minister, probably won't be much different than now, no matter which Party wins the U.S. Presidential election."

7c6e5dcc848d6d0fb1fc3146328db63e	neutral	So, you've just managed to disentangle a massively complicated plot from your head and successfully gotten it onto the page. Not only that but you've managed to hang upon it some very well-researched material to give it a real sense of place, and a huge dollop of imagination to make the story your own. Heck, you've even received an award for your efforts.   Where next then? Get a clean notebook out for an all-new story?   Well, if you're Mark Hodder it appears you decide that the first story wasn't complicated enough and then go in again with a big spoon to stir things up some more!   Welcome to The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man, set in the bizarre alternative universe inhabited, amongst others, by Sir Richard Burton, famous explorer and agent to King Albert (yes, that's right), and his assistant, the poet Algernon Swinburne. Theirs is a time significantly altered by the unintended temporal shenanigans of one Spring-Heeled Jack, bringing about premature advances in assorted scientific and technological disciplines. Do you want to be flown here and there beneath giant eugenically-engineered swans? You got it, old bean. How about some autonomous steam men clunking about the place? Yeah, we got those too.   Now, if you haven't read The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack, then stop right now and seek it out. While many book series are comprised of largely separate stories, the events of both this book and its sequel, Expedition to the Mountains of the Moon, are tied more with its first book than other series I've read. Hodder provides some backstory in each of these follow-ups, but had I come to this story cold then I may have felt these expository parts a little tacked-on. And, anyway, the first book is rather good fun, so give it a whirl.   Anyway, what you have here is another inventive slice of Albertian England involving missing diamonds, contested estates and ghostly manifestations, which then descends into something else entirely.   There's no farting about from Hodder in this story. The action and intrigue kick in from the get-go - a benefit of having gotten a large amount of the world-building guff out of the way in the first book. In this story Burton and Swinburne follow the trail of a stolen collection of black diamonds. Burton discovers the stones possess a few special properties, chief among them a resonance with human brainwaves. Or they would have done were they not fakes.   Meanwhile, public interest is piqued by The Tichborne Affair, where the sudden return of Roger Tichborne, long considered lost to the sea, sees him pitch a claim for the Tichborne estate. The fact that the claimant doesn't resemble Roger Tichborne in any way seems no obstacle, particularly when many of those who see him in the flesh instantly vouch for him. The general public take Roger to their hearts, despite his social standing, seeing instead a penniless man deprived of what was rightfully his. Tensions mount across London when the claimant's lawyer takes his client's case to the masses.   Could the two stories be connected in any way? Oh, come on, what do you think?!   How these story threads come together, however, takes the story off in a completely different direction: one that doesn't auger well for the course of (this alternative) history, one that smartly ties in with elements of the first book and one that brilliantly sets up the next one. (Don't worry, there's closure to be found.)   The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man is, for me, a great follow-up to The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack, and one I feel somehow improves the first story. As mentioned earlier, the fewer diversions into world-building enables Hodder to get on with telling the goddam story, and as a result, he keeps those pages a-turning, which, of course, is A Good Thing.   Another Good Thing is the fact that the book is mostly clean of typos, something of a blessing when compared to the first book. It all helped to keep me in the story. (I can't heap praise onto a published book for being free of typos, however.)   What irritations I found in the story were relatively minor. Again the finale gets a little too silly for me. It's funny, yes, but you may be well advised to suspend disbelief before stepping in. The main characters once more fall into philosophical discussions that take the reader away from the story, though thankfully only for a couple of pages at a time. Then there was the rather OTT descent into carnage that teetered dangerously close to Stephen Hunt's The Court of the Air (whose message, I think, though I could have been wrong, even though it was rubber-stamped on nearly every bloody page, was that communism was bad). Thankfully Hodder uses such civil unrest sparingly and, in a way, eerily presages the Tottenham riots of 2011 that unfolded a month before the book's publication!   In all this is a great read, a nailed-on 4/5 from me. Be sure to pick up the next book as well as this one, however, as you will want to dive straight in once you hit the end of Clockwork Man.
24ffc07a73ad4841ab08a804dff23e37	critical	A little over halfway through, I just want to SHAKE Beth Howard. I was hoping this wouldn't turn out to be another memoir by a spoiled middle-aged lady, but that's exactly what it is. Usually food memoirs are written by people who are a little more grounded and humble, because people who work with food don't typically make a lot of money--they work with their hands, and their building blocks are very basic. For Howard, though, baking is more of a cheap form of therapy. And for the first 2/3 of the book, it's not really working.   Another thing that I hate is that, every time Howard mentions specific things she misses about her deceased husband, sex is either the first, second, or only thing. Then she usually paints him in a negative light immediately after that. I'm no psychologist, but it seems to me like a lot of her grief came from resentment that they were hours from a divorce when he died, but now she wouldn't be able to move on from him. So all the times she repeats how much she misses him, and how she didn't REALLY want a divorce, I feel like it's a little dishonest.   And meanwhile, while she's moping around the country, wailing and gnashing her teeth and relying on some seriously amazing friends to feed her, house her, and continually talk her off the ledge, we find out that THIS WHOLE TIME her brother has been fighting cancer and on the verge of death himself. But she doesn't even MENTION it until 170 pages in, and even then, it's just an anecdote that serves as a way for her to explain another emotional breakthrough that she had.
edcfa9c8595e775584d5145b8c809966	neutral	The events of the story are dark and tragic and tinged with magic and superstition. Will Shakespeare hears the story of events in Illyria from Violetta, Feste, and Violetta's kinswoman Maria. Much of the story is given over to those past events. The book is a little short on action as a consequence. The action sequences are fairly brief except for the final confrontation. There is lots of violence and bloodshed and no funny moments. Shakespeare fans and scholars will recognize situations, people and lines from his plays that the reader must believe influenced his works. What I really liked about the book were the descriptions of Illyria and the creation of the culture of that land. I also loved the depiction of Elizabethan England with one foot rooted in superstition. The author weaves in magic and superstition to create a fully believable world. I came to care about Violetta and her homeland but I wanted a bit more action in the story. I felt that it concluded too quickly. Fans of Celia Rees's other books will not be disappointed by this one.

ed6c4da2f846ed186a7d33d0e2e2e4ba	neutral	'Taken as a whole, the 1960s saw a greater number of significant and exciting films made in Britain than at any time before or since.' - as Murphy says in his conclusion. This is a good introduction to 60s British cinema, with chapters on 'Kitchen Sink' and realist film, the critical attitudes of the times, art cinema, the organisation of the industry, 'Swinging London', horror films, crime and spy films, comedy, and how the big (Hollywood) production companies worked in Britain.   Inevitably, with such a large subject, individual films are skimmed over (in his introduction, Murphy apologises for missing out any mention of some key films, directors, and actors), so the emphasis is perhaps slightly more on mentioning films you might not have heard of, or which have been unfairly disparaged, than in mentioning the obvious hits. (There is an appendix listing all the significant events and films, year by year, so those major films are all included there.) I certainly came away with a list of films to see, which is why I picked this book up to start with.

b38ba1f411607b0329b418f57657501a	critical	This book was mixed for me. I liked the beginning and the end, but the middle really bothered me. This is supposed to be an epic love story, and to me it just felt like Francisco Ariza was a borderline stalker and a little sad (not to mention a pedophile). I also didn't see what it was about Fermina that he was so in love with, but regardless of that, it's not a love story if only one side is in love. I did like their story, and how it developed when they were in their golden years.   Overall I don't know if I would recommend this book. It took me a very long time to get through b/c I could never get vested in the characters and their stories. I also did not like the writing style/translation of this book. The entire book felt like reading one long run-on sentence. The author jumps from thought to thought with little to no transition, and constantly digresses from one topic into multiple others, making it difficult to read. There just seemed to be too much information, and not enough organization of it all.
6a5ee88989c00506d1c447cfa0624045	neutral	A Russian Journal revisited   In 1947 John Steinbeck and Robert Capa made a journey through Russia - Moscow, Stalingrad, now Volgograd, Kiev and Tbilisi/ Tiflis and again Moscow - just in the time the 'Iron Curtain' closes.   Their quest is to discover 'the great other side' and show 'the private life of the Russian people' as they say themselves 'to set down what we saw and heard without editorial comment'. So they report about their trip in A Russian Journal, not The Russian Journal.   To John Steinbeck this trip and journal come at an interesting point in his carrier, after he has written his masterpiece 'The Grapes of Wrath' (1939) and before his most personal and experimental novel 'East of Eden' (1952).   In A Russian Journal John Steinbeck and Robert Capa capture a few of those individual Russian souls who endured in a system ready to smother all creativity. They capture those portraits with intelligence, compassion, humor and eye for detail.   If we look at the actuality of Poetin's Russia in 2014 we see a drawback to the times the 'Iron Curtain' closed. With people on both sides, east and west, having such different views. Would it not be very interesting to make the journey John Steinbeck and Robert Capa made over again. With the same quest to discover 'the great other side'.   As John Steinbeck puts it 'I believe one job of a writer is to set down his time nearly as he can understand it'.   Note the photo's I uploaded on this page are some of the beautiful pictures Robert Cape made during this trip.

I do not need to see his brother fall in love to follow along with that. Which means, yes it works as a stand alone, never read a HR that did not.   Murian is a widow after an ass of a Lord killed her husband and stole her castle. Now she robs people.   Max is a general and prince of his country, and he is bringing his grandma to the ass of a lord for some reason he does not understand.

His gaze sharpened upon her lips, making her heart hammer a panicked warning. ""Eat you like a ripe peach, all juice and sweetness. And lick my lips afterward.""   A sexy, gothic version of Beauty and the Beast, Seven Nights in a Rogue's Bed does not fail to bring fairy tail like qualities into a story filled with heartbreak and self-flagellation.   Beast: Jonas Merrick. Bastard, and monster because of the hideous scarring on his face, he lives his life in seclusion. His hurt and anger at the lies and injustices both he and his parents were forced to survive have left him a cold and bitter man. To get revenge on his hated cousin William, he blackmails William's wife. Rebecca, has accrued a huge debt that he holds the markers to. For revenge, in lieu of the financial repayment that she cannot make, he demands seven nights in his bed.   Beauty: Sidonie Forsythe. Sweet and innocent, Sidonie's experiences with the opposite sex has put her off men forever. Her father was cold and uncaring, her brother-in-law is physically abusive to her sister. She has no desire to ever marry, so when Jonas Merrick blackmails her sister, she sacrifices herself, and her innocence to Jonas Merrick to pay off the gambling debt her that's owed.   This book is amazing! Sidonie and Jonas take you to an adult version of Beauty and the Beast, where you can fall in love with the beast just as Belle and Sidonie did. Jonas broke my heart so many times. Having been treated as a monster from childhood, he had no choice but to build walls to protect himself. Sidonie's arrival into his life allows him to relax drop his guard for the first time in many years.   I love Jonas. His tragic, solitary life has turned him understandably bitter. His desire for revenge against the cousin who has caused him so much pain brings Sidonie into his life. He is amazed and intrigued by her innocence and her depth of love for her sister, that she would sacrifice herself.   Sidonie expected to find a true monster when she shows up to Jonas' home. Instead, she finds a man hiding his pain and loneliness behind a cold, distant facade. Although from the start she fights to keep her innocence, she soon falls under his spell and finds herself charmed by him and the real Jonas that he reveals only to her.   There is so much happening in this book, that I can't possibly cover it all. The characters are all amazingly well developed and the plot is brilliant. The story flows so easily that you find yourself so immersed in it that you lose all track of time, and may forget to start dinner for your family....oops.   Seven Nights in a Rogue's Bed is the second book I have read from Anna Campbell, but she has easily become one of my favorite Historical Romance authors. Her books are treasures that I know I will pull out and read over and over again. I cannot wait to dive into the rest of the Sons of Sin series and see where it takes me.   Seven Nights in a Rogue's Bed is a   Must Read   for all Historical Romance fans."
dc392eb682e9d2f6ad9aaddffdd1f295	critical	** spoiler alert **   I enjoyed this book. I thought about giving it 4 stars, but it definitely started to feel like it was getting kind of long just after half way through the book. It started to get weird and I felt a slight shift in the tone. But then I started to enjoy it more in the last few chapters of the book.   I loved the unreliable nature of the narrator and the feeling that you could never quite trust what he said, felt, thought, observed, etc. His constant use of drugs and the fact that he also was likely mesmerized the entirety of the story was an enjoyable aspect of the book.   The parts that were most interesting for me were the parts in which Wilkie and Dickens were interacting, or there was talk about Drood. As the novel got progressively darker and the narrator murders a young girl and plots the murder of Dickens, I found I was enjoying the book less.   I did really enjoy the way he wrapped up the novel. We get our Dickens murder without it actually happening,and Dickens explains all about the origin of Drood and what has been going on with Wilkie's mind (apart from the drugs). Wilkie also somewhat redeems himself in his treatment of Caroline and his feelings towards Dickens' abilities and friendship.   I also enjoyed the structure of the book, sometimes he would skip over periods of time, prolonging the mystery, and only coming back for explanation after a chapter or so.   I think part of the charm of this novel is that I love Dickens. I enjoy the references to his novels and I love the creative fictionalization of his life while keeping many aspects true to history. All in all it was a fun read, just a little long.

Such a unique story which, as always with Elton, was extremely well-researched. The historical references and understanding of Isaac Newton were superb. A man with nothing left to lose is sent back in time to correct one of history's most defining moments, but at what cost? It's a gamble, who knows what butterfly effects his new version of history could cause? I can't stop thinking about this, it has so much food for thought. A book full of action, intrigue, love, loss and history and one which I would thoroughly recommend."

25fa91fb465261962b39a47fda9ab7ca	critical	This book is a mind trip. I loved it! I think it is my first Stephen King ever. Definitely not horror like his other novels (I don't do well with horror), but enough creepiness in there to keep me on the edge of my seat at times. Dang, he's a great writer!   In a nutshell (because you really need a nutshell to summarize an 800 page book) this is a story about a man named Jake Epping who, in 2011, is shown a way to step into the past, to one specific day in September, 1958 - to be exact. I loved his curiosity and his thoughts about the new/old world because it matched my own as he compared and contrasted now to then. I loved his transition through the novel from an innocent bystander to somebody who knows his place in the world and will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if the world doesn't want him there making his mark. The story continues, spanning over five years because Jake learns he can change the past, and no matter how many years he is gone, he can come back to 2011, having only been gone for 2 minutes. Pretty sweet deal, except there are consequences...even if his intentions are pure and make all the sense in the world. My only complaints are that the middle part of the book could have been pared down some, and the language was a bit much.

The Duke waished to protect his precious only daughter, an heiress, from his scoundrel brother. Stokley's Papa From then on, Emilyann became Stokley's to cherish and treasure. From climbing trees to fishing and other unladylike pursuits, Emilyann followed her beloved ""Smokey"" anywhere. Before Emilyann is old enough to come out, her Papa unexpectedly dies leaving her a fortune and in the care of her ne'er do well uncle, his Puritanical wife and her idiotish son Bobo. When Emilyann's uncle threatens to marry her to Bobo, Emilyann knows she needs to escape but where and how? Smoky is off fighting the French with Wellington and who knows when or if he'll return. As luck would have it, Emilyann learns from Smokey's younger brother Geoffrey that Stokley is in London at that very moment. Emilyann runs off to her Smokey who promises to help. Emilyann adds the condition that after Stokley returns from the wars they can get a quiet annulment. Stokley agrees with the condition that Emilyann not spend her fortune on his run down estate. Never one to listen, Emilyann does exactly as she pleases. Emilyann, Geoffrey and his silly sister Nadine head off to London to take the ton by storm. When news of his wife's social success reaches Stokley in Brussels, he dashes off to London to take control of his family. Instead of the parcel of unruly children he expects to find, he discovers his wife is a lively, confident, caring, beautiful woman and he wants nothing to do with any annulments! Emilyann is a bit unsure of her husband so Stokley sets out to woo her. A series of unusual accidents makes Stokley reluctant to leave his bride's side. Alas, Napoleon is on the run and it's back to war for the young Earl. Will he ever win his bride? Will Emilyann ever get to cherish her hero as he has cherished her all these years? Not if Emilyann's uncle has anything to say about it. This story is vastly different from the usual marriage of convenience plot. Most of the book is dedicated to exposition. The exposition is cute and funny at times but goes on too long. The subplot involving Emilyann's uncle and his family is far more entertaining. For all he's a villain, her uncle is a comic villain. His wife, Ingrid, and stepson Bobo provide a lot of the humor in the story. Stokley's aunt and sister also contribute to the comedic aspects of the plot. Since the exposition is long, the story feels really long and doesn't have much time to develop the relationship. Emilyann is very young, spoiled and headstrong. She grows up nicely and becomes an appealing character towards the end. Stokley is hardly in the story at all except as a minor character looking back on their childhood games and then in the last third of the novel. When Stokley appears, he's busy lusting after his bride instead of actually trying to woo her he tries to seduce her. The two are NOT the same thing. I didn't really like him much but there wasn't a lot of opportunity to get to know him. I preferred his brother Geoff. This isn't my favorite Barbara Metzger novel. It's cute and sometimes funny but the lack of relationship between the h/h turned me off. That and Pug, the dog, doesn't play a major role in the story and only appears or is mentioned in a few scenes. Lady Cheyne (My Lady Innkeeper) is mentioned in one scene but doesn't appear on page."

Anna's a wonderful heroine, and her love story with Cole is perfect for the story. Exactly my genre too - essentially straight historical fiction, but luscious vein of fantasy to give it a twist.

It took a while to get used to her very specific style but I found it started to feel like a conversation at some point. It was hard to read the tortured words of her at 19 - in love with Harrison Ford and all that. Felt a little silly and precious but I understand the root of all that was to come in her life. Still sorry she is gone.
b80ce45f5181b45a30dcd4bb87dce20f	critical	Very good book. I kept looking things up about Galveston and hurricanes. Great detail about all the individuals involved and their actions. Odd juxtaposition, though, of chapters--some were snippets about the storm forming; one big chapter was about some woman's background. Great insight into the early 20th century and how little was understood about weather at the time.

Actually, it was because I heard it was really good and I kept on reading more and more, waiting for it to get better. I just found the characters to be ok but nothing special and it got really tiring to have them constantly defeated and broken down by the same people. I also really didn't need to have all those descriptions about chuches and how they were built. So defenitly not my kind of book(sorry Erica) and I am so happy to finally be finished with it.

This is a very well written story that probably did happen with no written confirmation.   It breaks their heart and hurts their soul.   How they learn to live this way is proof of the human strength and ability to adjust to any given circumstance.   That they even consider the day when they are free is not something they can share or even hint at.   God bless them all.
64e64d8ed67fa5a8906d17cac5bd24ca	critical	This is a mostly enjoyable book that is part history and part travelogue. The chapters on the history of The Great Wall are interwoven with chapters on the author's travels to the various parts of the Wall. The travel portions are entertaining in themselves, though at times they feel as if they are drifting away from the subject, especially the sections in Mongolia, which focus a little too much on the socio-political conditions of Mongolia, and a bit too little on the Wall itself.   The historical chapters are great, especially the way they incorporate the myths and legends surrounding the Wall. To someone like me, who has almost zero knowledge of Chinese history, the glut of names of Emperors, dynasties, and hundreds of supporting characters can get a bit overwhelming at times, but that's hardly the author's fault. History is complex, and Chinese history - given its length - particularly so. In other words, don't try this book unless you love history and are prepared for a crash course in Chinese history.   On the whole, this is a very good book on the subject, whether you read it as a potential tourist to The Great Wall, or merely as someone interested in it and its history.

Well written, but really a lot of very graphic sexual scenes that didn't necessarily add to the story and some unbelieveable turns of events. But I fervently hated every single character and felt compelled to keep reading, either to see their lives completely destroyed, or find some redeeming reason to like them a little bit. It made me pick up Wisconsin Death Trip, so that made it all worth while.
ff5864739ffa42de685873b14a93d631	very critical	"If you had told me (like I told many others), ""Hey, you should read this book about baseball and The Civil War,"" I would have looked at you incredulously. But then I would have thought about for a split second and with a quick Wikipedia search to confirm, slapped myself upside the head and said, ""Of course there was baseball back then, it's America's past time for godsakes.""   So that's how this book began for me and it was only the initial layer to peel off here. This book does an incredible job of showing baseball as it was in its early days, centered in the northeast but very popular and a very high scoring game regularly compared to today. But the one modern-world issue that Nostalgia does a great job at examining in the context of 1860's America is the psychosis that has gone by many names throughout the history of warfare: exhaustion, shell shock, cowardice or PTSD. Throw in a cameo by Walt Whitman and this is a powerful story that I was never quite sure how it would end.   I won't even reveal the other punches this book doesn't pull, but I highly suggest this unusual but needed, sad but humourous, historical fiction read."
4c60f77ae46405fb7061dafdf4609638	very critical	"Today Miss Chandler gave me this beautiful book.   Forced to quit school and attend to ""women's work"" by her father, Joan longs to continue her education and better herself. She runs away to Baltimore and goes to work for a Jewish family as a hired girl. Along the way, she begins to question a lot of her preconceived notions about religion and her place in the world.   I would best describe this book as this generation's Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret because of the growing pains and awkwardness Joan goes through, especially regarding religion. It was refreshing to read about a girl who has a very strong religious life, but has struggles with her beliefs and is nowhere near perfect. Oftentimes, religious fiction features protagonists that are superhuman characters when it comes to their beliefs and living a spiritual life. It really turned me off as a teen and I was glad to see this book addressing questions of religion in a similar way to the way Judy Blume did decades ago.   This book also made me happy in that Joan acts and talks like a 14 year old girl. The book is written in diary format and Joan's voice seems very realistic. She is extremely naive and young and that comes across well in the story. She is also very much a product of her time, which means she has beliefs and prejudices that are uncomfortable to modern readers. Although this has caused some controversy in the press, it is important to realize in historical fiction that there are going to be things that we don't agree with now and that are not reflective of the author's own beliefs.   I would recommend this book to those who enjoy coming of age stories and/or those who enjoy upstairs-downstairs stories such as Downton Abbey. If you enjoy reading religious fiction, this is a good read as well. It is also a fairly clean read, no language or sexual content which may make it a good choice for those who enjoy inspirational fiction.   2016 Book Riot Read Harder Challenge: Read a book about religion (fiction or nonfiction)."
9b71cb62e5665b2b36b1b8935681a3b0	neutral	"Exhaustive biography of the great Julia Child. Early on, the author states that while Julia did not give her personal interviews she did grant Fitch unprecedented access to her family letters and other papers. And out of that Fitch built what is probably the seminal biography on Julia.   So the good news is that Fitch was an experienced and well-known biographer when she came to the project, and she makes good use of the material to weave a mostly fascinating tale of an American icon--and not just a foodie icon, but a major figure in popular culture in the late twentieth century. The bad news is that often, especially in the latter parts of the book, the narrative breaks downs into ""then she went there and did that and so on and so on."" Way too much, for example, on the development of the American Wine and Food Institute, for me. Still, what emerges is a portrait of a woman who could have had an easy, wealthy life in California but her endless curiosity and drive to learn propelled her into very different worlds. The story of how she met her husband,Paul, and what a great, supportive team they were is very moving and, to me, worth the price of admission alone. Also, this is a biography, not a book of recipes so if you want that, look elsewhere but overall an informative, enjoyable read."
ee7c0be0bfc965dfdb8deedeb75c084e	very critical	"I thought this book was completely charming. I generally prefer Historical mysteries over historical romance, which this is, but I did enjoy the theme of this one and the epistolary style that it is written in. I felt that the various characters came to life more through their letters as opposed to a description written by a narrator.   What I found most affecting about this book is the similar array of emotions about the war that are expressed by the characters. Very similar to the post WWI feelings expressed by characters like Maisie Dobbs in that series, and others. As Americans, I don't believe we can ever truly understand what Europe went through during both wars, and how it caused such a change to their way of life. I've seen other amateur reviews of books like this that seem irritated at the characters for not ""just being able to get over it already."" I don't think we have that right to ask that of them.   The second section of the book, where the protagonist actually gets to Guernsey is more of the traditional ""romance"" section, and so the epistolary format doesn't work quite as well in this part. I found I enjoyed that slightly less than the earlier section. But I recognize that the arc of the story had to move along, and that is probably why the author chose to do it that way.   I also REALLY want to go to the Channel Islands! Any book that makes me really ""see"" the place in my mind is a success, to my mind!"

It begins with Peony as a 16 year-old girl who is head over heels for someone she doesn't know. Maybe I'm just cynical, but it's hard for me to really ""believe"" that sort of feeling. Overall, if you're looking for a book about Chinese culture that's got an interesting story behind it I'd say stick with her first novel, Snowflower and the Secret Fan."

e2e3f11b10e687eb9ffbb0d7d2ad8c02	very non-critical	"History of an attitude, studying its ramifications of through many complications.   Sincerity. Hypocrisy. Major issues in the era for Americans. For all sorts of reasons. For one thing, cities exploded in this time, and that meant that people kept on meeting up with people they didn't know. One person wrote in a letter that, shockingly enough, she has only twice met someone she actually knew while walking the streets of Philadelphia. And many people had to work with people they didn't know and couldn't know. Apprenticeships, even, became rare.   Worse, the spread of democracy meant that traditional authority was being upended, and people were rising in social status. Many advice books fulminated about how men could subvert the authority of fathers and clergy.   The old Puritan habit of self-examination to determine whether one could be saved carried over nicely to the role of examining one's self's for hypocrisy. Especially since being a hypocrite was the great fear of the Puritan conscience.   The ""confidence man"" was a major bogeyman in the cult of sincerity that arose as a consequence. A man who could allure the innocent young man to his doom by his false professions -- and worse, by his ability to read the unfortunate young man's feeling on his sincere and open face. One reason why the cult of domesticity emphasized the woman's role in the cult of sincerity was that it might prove fatal for the man's ability to manage, if he adhered strictly to its code.   And it produce interesting ramifications. Fashion, for instance. Godley's Lady Book -- a fashion book -- railed against fashion and the attention women paid to it and how the dress should simply express the wearer's heart. Make-up was frowned on; not only did the ""painted woman"" hide her true face, she hid the paleness and blushes that expressed her sensibility. Dress abruptly turned from ""romantic"" fancy and adorned, to ""sentimental"" which was plain, close to the human form, and simple. Well, close to the human form in theory. Women used corsets and padding to fit it more closely. That was not fatal to the theory that the dress a woman wore merely put forth her sincere heart. What really didn't work was the problem that as soon as you put forth dress as expressing sincerity, any false fashion seeker could put it on.   Etiquette was worse. Heavily complicated, demanding strict adherence ot many rule, stern in its demands for self-restraint -- and, in theory, the spontaneous overflow of a sincere heart. Etiquette books demanded a sincere and natural presentation, and scorned those who followed the rules woodenly.   Mourning was particularly changed. In the old towns, everyone knew the dead, everyone participated in the funeral rites, and there was no division of the bereaved and the mourners. But in the new cities -- sentiment frequently underlined how alone and isolated the bereaved were, and how hard it was to reach them, and talked of the private expression of grief. At the same time, the rules of wearing mourning were in force, and department stores had mourning departments.   Well, it did not last. The problem of hypocrisy and sincerity grew less morally earnest and more light-hearted. Fashion grew more convoluted and dropped its interest in expressing the wearer's soul. Etiquette started to demand only formal appearances. And middle-class America learned to love private theatricals.   That's the problem with cults of sincerity. Faking is particularly disastrous to the cult."

She mentioned once using cocaine and heroine, but nothing at all about her sexuality, (or Bea and not much about the plays she did with Bea). Instead she focused a lot on her early life. It was an interesting read, but not as amusing or as interesting as her reputation would lead me to expect.

f03b86865c4787920de105c2c1a95f1c	non-critical	A great introduction to HPB and Theosophy. But damn it got confusing a bit. She traveled a lot, many people played important roles in her life, and being told on one portable book can get confusing. Definitely a book you wanna take your time with. My one critic of the book aside from it's dizzying pace is that many of the people on her life went by different names and the author jumps back forth between the various names for the various people. This can make it difficult to keep track of who is doing what and a mental note must be made of the various names of each person. Aside from those two things, I feel like I have a basic understanding of Theosophy and I look forward to reading some of Blavatsky's own work.
7857e9236788884ee16a528454de0f1e	neutral	** spoiler alert **   Fiind la curent cu toate scandalurile din lumea literara, m-am bucurat cind am auzit ca Polirom o sa scoata cartea lui Lauryssens deoarece eram tare curios sa vad ce putea fi asa de monstruos scris in ea despre Dali si ce a facut autorul de a fost inchis si urmarit de Interpol, precum si de ce a trezit interesul unor producatori de la Hollywood si ce l-a facut pe Al Pacino sa vrea sa joace in ecranizarea romanului. Deci, am luat o pauza de Lanark si am citit Eu si Dali, Poveste suprarealista. In sase ore...   Tin sa subliniez faptul ca Lauryssens e un biet scriitoras (cel putin din acest roman asa pare) care a facut bani si cariera vinzind falsuri de Dali. Inainte sa faca asta, era un tip care gaurea cascaval. Mai apoi un gazetar ce scria pentru un tabloid interviuri imaginare cu diferite vedete. Totul se producea doar in mintea lui si facea acest lucru pentru a-si duce traiul de pe o zi pe alta. Nimic extraordinar pina cand a fost racolat de o firma ce se ocupa cu vinzarea de tablouri Dali in special, datorita faptului ca Dali era o comoara, o mina nesecata de bani. De aici incepe intreaga poveste.   Smecheras de cartier, Stan vinde Dali-uri ca piinea calda. Personajul este plin de sine, lucru care se poate vedea din declaratiile ulterioare date presei in urma proceselor intentate asupra sa. Dar acest lucru nu mira pe nimeni avind in vedere dezinvoltura cu care acuza parintele suprarealismului de fals si vinzare de fals.   Intreaga carte aduce a Dan Brown. O conspiratie la un nivel inalt, bine camuflata, interesanta si scandaloasa, iar pentru a o intelege nu trebuie sa ai un IQ foarte ridicat si nici nu trebuie sa ai habar de Dali sau de viata sa. Spumos scrisa, evolutia lui Dali este foarte abil manipulata astfel incit autorul sa fie the good guy in sfirsit, el fiind de fapt o victima a sistemului, nicidecum o parte a sa.   Concluzia e una scurta: o carte scandaloasa menita sa scoata bani, ceea ce a si facut. Un roman prost, o scriitura buna pentru cineva indragostit de Dan Brown sau altii de genul, de reviste de scandal si povestioare spuse la un pahar de bere. Daca vrei sa o citesti, mai bine o iei de la un prieten si daca, iti place, abia atunci sa o cumperi si doar daca esti un fan Dali.   Recenzie publicata pe http://razvanvanfirescu.wordpress.com/
b35acf70960cc38029bae7ba9f239d86	critical	"In ""Curses and Smoke,"" author Vicky Alvear Shecter creates a wonderful young adult romance in the shadow of the famous destruction of the city of Pompeii by way of volcano. Lucia has lived a privileged life even if it is under the shadow of her very tough father, who seems both cool and distant when it comes to listening what Lucia wants for her future. He's just not that interested if it doesn't fall into the plans that he already has for her. Tag's life is limited by the fact that he's a slave and he just might have a curse on him. Lucia and Tag know that they should not want to be together but love is a strange thing that hits you when you least expect it.   I loved the love story between Lucia and Tag. Both of them are great characters. Lucia wants so much more for her life than just what her father wants for her. She wants to be educated and she wants to educate others. She wants to be happy and marry who she wishes instead of the old man (who may be cruel) that her father wishes for her to marry. Tag was especially interesting to me because he's a healer and he is also a slave. For what ever reason, I really, really like reading about healers and medics in historical fiction and non-fiction. I'm endlessly fascinated by what they practiced and what they thought about what would heal or hurt. I also thought it was so interesting to read about his slavery. In this day and age, doctors are revered and they make a ton of money. This is most definitely a severe contrast from Tag's day. I didn't really know that a healer would be part of the slave class and you all know how I love learning something new! Shecter had a really good way of engaging the reader with these characters and really making you care about them.   The historical detail in this book was really good as well. Pompeii is still very fascinating to so many people today. Next time I go to Italy, I would really like to go to Pompeii (no time last time!) to see the site. It was a true tragedy and Shecter captures that through her writing. I loved all of the different details, which really helped me to understand the event in a different way.   While I liked the story, I wished that the end of the story had some more concreteness to it. I really, really don't want to give anything away so allow me to be vague but I sort of wanted to know what happened after the book ended. And that's all I can really say because saying anything else would be giving too much away and you all should read this book... so... yeah!"

I've never read an ending that so destroyed my goodwill for the rest of the book, though Poisonwood is unique in that its ""epilogue"" goes on for a good 150 pages. At first I thought the author was just not confident in the message(s) of the previous text and was just hammering home the same points again, bluntly. But no, as the book got even more preachy and the characters even further into caricatures (oh boy, Rachel), it reaches its pinnacle in the last few chapters where it becomes some sort of technology-makes-us-evil, anti-medicine ode to the noble savage.

d254f35dbd8312ad7362e5d96346b576	critical	"Among many reasons that made me stop watching cricket, the fact that I was not as much of a fan as I had a assumed was a significant one. Despite having watched a lot of matches, I felt out of place in discussions where people remembered a lone tournament, a lone match, or even a lone ""glorious"" shot. I had watched without watching. No wonder then that I found On Warne packed with information. Even otherwise, Gideon Haigh's writing would have kept me engaged. In this short 200 page book, Haigh praises Warne excessively, but only as long as he is describing Warne's bowling. The book quickly touches upon Warne's induction into cricket, his art, and the scandals he dragged himself into, and allowed himself to be dragged into. When needed, Haigh makes stinging remarks on people he doesn't think much of. Among this people, for some reason, Steve Waugh finds a prominent place. On Warne, despite its exaggerations, is as balanced a book you will get from a fan. What amazes me is the impact sports can have on its watchers. I mildly regret not being such a fan of sports, and it makes me envious. Read it if you love Warne. Even otherwise, read it if you like good writing. Read it because it is quite short. Read it for the well placed quotes used by Haigh. Read it."

eaa89ab929fa13ef516828952240c1f4	critical	At Love's Bidding by Regina Jennings is the second book in the Ozark Mountain Romance series and it is set in 1873. Miranda Wimplegate is used to staying in the shadows. She does not like being the center of attention and you can tell from the dull clothes that she wears in colors that will make her blend in with her surroundings. Miranda works at her family's auction house Wimplegate Auction House (not very original) in Boston, Massachusetts. The family sold a painting that was not supposed to be in the auction (so who put it there). Miranda and her grandfather, Elmer Wimplegate (who seems to be having memory issues) go to Pine Gap (where the purchases mailed the painting) to retrieve the painting which will protect the reputation of their auction house. In order to ensure that they get the painting, the purchase the auction house in Pine Gap (sight unseen). What they do not know is that the auction house caters to animals (and whatever else anyone wishes to sell).   Wyatt Ballentine is the manager of the sale barn at the auction house in Pine Gap. He has been saving up to buy it and is upset when he finds out that the owner sold it to outsiders. Wyatt is hoping he can convince Miranda and Elmer that this is not the business for them and get them to sell the auction house to him. Wyatt does not anticipate Miranda and her determined nature. Miranda will have her hands full with keeping an eye on her grandfather (who is getting worse each day), looking for the painting, and not letting Wyatt know what she is looking for in the auction house. I think Miranda and Wyatt are in for an adventure!   At Love's Bidding is a cute novel. I liked the main characters (especially Wyatt) and the setting of Pine Gap. There are some interesting people in this delightful little town. At Love's Bidding is fun and easy to read. I give At Love's Bidding 4 out of 5 stars (I liked it). I liked seeing Miranda grow and blossom during the course of the novel. At Love's Bidding can be read without having enjoyed the first book in the series. I look forward to the next book in the Ozark Mountain Romance series.   I received a complimentary copy of At Love's Bidding from NetGalley and The Book Club Inc.

She convinces Tom bury the man's body and take the baby (which they name Lucy) as their own, as if her last baby had been born. It turns out, the baby's mother is alive and looking for Lucy and her father. The story develops as the couple gets to know about this mother and meet her.   The story starts well, gets a tad depressing at some points, but recovers in the last part and has a very poignant end.

The first 3/4 of the book are exciting and building up to that big moment, WHEN HE COMES OUT! and guess what, WORST COMING OUT IN BOOK HISTORY! All it basically says is ""And then I found out why he couldn't love his wife."" SERIOUSLY?!?!?!   A part of me wanted Richard to just confess his undying love for Blondel, because obviously he needed him around ALL THE TIME = YOU LOVE HIM.   The book kind of leaves you feeling dry. What happened to Anna and Blondel? Did they begin a romantic friendship?   The one part I EFFING LOVED Was Anna's narrative She was so effing awesome! I kind of think myself as the guy version of her.   Richard.... idk, he was super charming.......... but like really? you couldn't bring yourself to make a baby with her? Gay men get married to women and have children ALL THE TIME! He could have just thought about a boy."

61baad09216ed2ddcd5568296a9ef9b9	neutral	On hammastyttavaa, miten erilaista arkipaivan elama on entisaikaan ollut. Tavallisillakin ihmisilla saattoi olla palveluskuntaa valtava kaarti - oli sisakkoa, keittajaa ja lastenhoitajaa, vaikka niihin ei olisi juuri ollut varaakaan. Ulkomaanmatkoille lahdettiin hetken mielijohteesta ja hotelleissa saatettiin asua kuukausitolkulla. Oli normaalia, etta matkalle otettiin mukaan roykkioittain matka-arkkuja, hatturasioita ja muita nyytteja, joita varten tarvittiin kosolti palvelusvakea ja kantajia. Matkalta saatettiin yhtakkia ostaa viehattava lipasto sen kummemmin murehtimatta, miten se saadaan kuljetetuksi kotimaahan. Ennen toista maailmansotaa pitkatkin matkat tehtiin yleensa junalla ja laivalla. Matka Englannista Euroopan halki Lahi-itaan kesti siten monta paivaa, mutta matkustaminen paljon huolettomampaa. Matkatavarat saattoi lahettaa edelta kasin perille vailla huolta siita, ettei niita sen koommin nakisi enaa. Matkustaminen oli myos suhteellisen turvallista, suuntautuipa matka mihinpain maailmaa tahansa. Erityisesti huoleton matkailu junalla, bussilla ja ratsain ristiin rastiin Lahi-itaa, herattaa nykylukijassa suunnatonta ihmetysta.   Agatha Christien omaelamakerta on jarkalemainen tiiliskivi mutta nautinnollista luettavaa Hercule Poirot'n, neiti Marplen ja muiden hahmojen ystaville. Agatha Christie ei kerro juurikaan kerro kirjailijan tyostaan ja kirjojensa syntyprosessista lukuun ottamatta uransa keskeisia kaannekohtia, mutta tarkkaavainen lukija huomaa, mista kirjailija on ammentanut ideoita teoksiinsa. Han tuli esimerkiksi helposti merisairaaksi - niinpa Hercule Poirotkaan ei voinut sietaa merimatkoja. Toisaalta han oli tavattoman kiintynyt junamatkailuun ja omisti aiheelle useita teoksia (   Sininen juna   ,   Idan pikajunan arvoitus   ,   Paddingtonista 16.50   ja   Plymouthin pikajuna   ).   Agatha Christien elamasta on kirjoitettu lukuisia muita kirjoja. Tata elamakertaa taydentavat eritoten Jared Caden   Agatha Christie katoaa   , jossa keskitytaan kirjailijan salaperaiseen katoamiseen vuonna 1926, seka Jonh Curranin   Agatha Christien salaiset muistikirjat   ja Agatha Christien murhasuunnitelmat, joissa kuvataan yksityiskohtaisesti Agatha Christien kirjojen syntyprosessia.

I'm a big fan of WWII-centric literature so maybe I'm biased, but I loved the writing style of Markus Zusak. I thoroughly enjoyed the narrator choice which I think helped keep the greater war in mind while we were focused on Himmel Street."

The story is one of Patricia's great-great-grandmother, Fiona, a master at creating beautiful,intricate lace. It is expected that when she is old enough she will work in the mill in the small village in Ireland, where they live, but the mill closes, leaving many Irish families desperate for a way to live. When the opportunity arrives for she and her sister and parents to go to Chicago, Illinois, her parents as indentured servants, they find life in the US is not the streets of gold they were expecting. Although the parents have jobs, those jobs only pay to work off the debt of the passage and rent on the two room apartment where they live. It is Fiona's lace that allows them the hope that they may one day find their dream of owning a farm in Michigan come true, but all that is threatened during the great fire of Chicago.

067c9c9e4862dcbf8a99651ad4e67a13	neutral	Cara Elliott   I just finished this AWESOMELY HILARIOUS UNIQUE BOOK. Cara has such a creative and imaginative mind. I read a lot and when book plots surprise me that is great writing. Devon is so misunderstood so he can do his spying. Anna is a closet author, writing racy novels under the male name. Devon has a hobby I have only read about in one other book. (I don't want to ruin for other readers) Both characters have such creative and imaginative minds I think Cara wrote a male and female characters that are HER!! I also loved all her secondary characters like Josette, Caro, McClellan, Lady de Bois, Vicomte, a Prince and of course Anna and Caro's mom. She also describes a room full of mechanical models like a Igor eating an Englishman. I can't wait for Caro's story in PASSIONATELY YOURS with I hope Baron McClellan. This book gets 5 fingers up and 10 toes!!

1924e75667cecba1cd347027e4ab1d73	neutral	I don't think that I've laughed so much during a book than I did with this one. Seriously, I thought that I would wake up the neighbourhood at three in the morning while I was still reading this book last night because I could not put it down.   It's a series of essays/stories that, to be honest, I have no idea if they're complete lies, slightly untold truths, or blatant elaborations but I also don't care. This book was hilarious, witty, and downright fun. Sure, I could have easily stopped at the end of a chapter since they don't really relate to each other, but I didn't want to, pure and simple.   I don't know what else I can really say about this book since it's not really fiction that follows a set plot line, but if you can you should really read it. However, it might not be suitable for a younger audience since it deals with a few adult situations and language. To be frank, at times it's incredibly vulgar... but I just found those bits really funny.   If you're able to, and can stomach everything about it, I say go and pick up a copy of this book. You'll laugh, you'll cry... ok, you'll laugh. But still, it's more than worth it. Which is why I'm giving this book a 10/10. Amazing.

561b66f7ea0c1476ef826bd59e8b0305	critical	Wow, this book along with the first one (The Winter King) is so well written. Bernard Cornwell really took the Arthurian legend and removed all of the fairytale bluster and put it in the setting of 5th BC Britian to historical context.   Written through the eyes of his trusted warrior Derfel, this book carries on from where the first ended after the battle of Lugg Vale where Arthur brings peace to the land of Dumnonia. I never thought I'd hate Lancelot as from the fairytale's he's written as a paragon, but here is a dastardly schemer. I can't wait to read book 3 Excalibur.
41545231faa4cf2d92d502fd18574203	very non-critical	As much as I love the ocean, I grew up on stories of epic storms and wrecks. Even my occasional proximity to Lake Superior (an inland sea, if freshwater) has been known to make me anxious (having visited several wrecks personally).   But I had heard of the 1900 hurricane, and I trusted Larson's ability to take a historical event and make it personal.   And he did.   This is an account of Isaac Cline, his work, his storm, and the fate of his family and his city.   Note to self: avoid hurricane states.
157d736e149fbbbfb01b0ec08eaf0994	neutral	I had to read this book for my English Literature exam. I'm sorry to say but I disliked this book. There are so many ways you could go with this topic and the historical context but it wasn't written well at all! Really disappointing. To be quite honest I found it boring there was no plot or story. The main theme was mother and daughter relationships and I didn't feel any connection towards it at all. You know you've read a good book when you feel a connection towards it and I didn't feel it with this at all! Well this play not book..
9a1613a3b6c7599ac102aa053e3e630f	non-critical	I felt like I was transported to another place another time, I could almost see myself living on a 1930s southern small town in America. Loved Scout and how she touched all characters, even Boo Radley. Found Atticus to be a father and a man role model, too good to be true, but he's 'humanized' at the very end of the book when he realized Boo Radley had killed Bob Ewell to save his children and decided to do what he felt was right vs. what'd be right according to the law. The trial of Tom Robinson conveyed the dimension of racism that time. Now that I finished the book, I wonder what would happen next: does Scout marry Dill, does Jem become a lawyer?

1ee7607e07e13debb84d68908b973515	neutral	"You May Now Kiss the Bride   , the debut of author Lisa Berne, follows the engagement between a couple caught in a compromising position. The steady pacing allows them the chance to fall into lust, and eventually, everlasting love with one another.   The product of a ""suitable"" (i.e. loveless) marriage, Gabriel Penhallow has never contemplated the idea of marrying for love, much less ever experiencing that emotion for himself. A penniless orphan raised by her uncaring aunt and uncle, Livia Stuart has a heart full of love and no one to give it to, nor has she ever experienced being loved in return, much less having felt wanted.   Gabriel comes to the area to meet, and propose to, the suitable, biddable girl his grandmother has selected for him. He is expected to marry, produce an heir and a spare, then live a life separate from his wife. The ""Penhallow way"" is about duty and respectability. A chance encounter in the woods with the dangerously fascinating Livia eventually leads to a forbidden kiss in the garden outside a ballroom. Gabriel does indeed leave with a fiancee -- only it's a far different one than intended. The stubborn Gabriel has met his match in the feisty Livia.   Livia's kind heart and determined spirit eventually begin to win over the Penhallow matriarch (with a few bumps in the road - hooray for three-dimensional secondary characters!). These traits, added to her unique beauty and arresting sense of humor, also have a profound effect on Gabriel. Through it all, Livia remains true to herself, learning her own value as she navigates ""the Penhallow way"".   At first, I thought the engagement for a couple caught in a compromising situation seemed a bit long. I think I'm just used to most books tossing the naughty pair at the altar and then letting the emotional growth and affection happen after the vows. This is where author Lisa Berne set the trope on its head -- with an excellent payoff.   I could have done without a slightly contrived misunderstanding towards the end. However, it was resolved quickly so no lasting effect my overall enjoyment of the book or to the plot (it did serve to demonstrate character growth).   Lisa Berne has produced a truly delightful heroine in Livia and provided her with a man who proves himself worthy of her, giving readers lots of fun, a little heartache, and plenty of passion throughout."

Frankly, she was a bitch. And to be honest, I'm kind of okay with that.

b571194639aa1fd23964ae27871b2d48	critical	"I was very excited when I found this book because I adore anything to do with Catherine de Medici who I find woefully under-appreciated in the history books. With that being said I acknowledge that there was a bias towards Diane de Poitiers who was always potrayed in glowing terms while Catherine was usually written off as ""fat"" and ugly. However she did bring up Catherine's intelligence a great deal which I appreciated and described the history of France which I haven't read much about and cleared up my confusion on the prisoner situation with Henry's dad. It did quite well on detailing the menage de trois (sp?) relationship between them and how complicated and uncomfortable that must have been. I was fairly impressed with it though I am still peeved that the writer clearly loved and admired Diane in history over Catherine and that it was so palpable."

f18857678e0e6109d62180282f002046	very non-critical	Just wasn't for me. I thought the characters were weak, poorly developed, and there was no one to like. Give me at least one strong character who has a shred of backbone. It's hard to keep plodding through when you hate the premise of the story. I seem to be in the minority and I do think her writing holds promise and I will try again, maybe. I just don't want to walk away from a book hating everyone in it.   I picked it up because Markus Zusak endorsed it on the cover. I wish he would write another book instead of reviewing others.
13d2eb81d979fc8378b3df3f2bb078b5	neutral	A fun book, especially since I'm in Chicago this month! It's amazing how many traditions/inventions were formed at this Worlds Fair. That said, the serial killer stuff sometimes brought me down pretty hard.
64e0c412fbc2f2d36b435f79de1db2d5	very critical	I snatched this book up as soon as it hit the stores. At the age of 22 when it came out, I was nearly the same age as Ayla, one of my favorite characters of all time. I grew up with her, I loved her uniqueness and her strength.   The 5th book in the series, we finally get to meet Jondalar's family, and see if they are going to accept Ayla.   The Zelandonii surprised me, to be honest, from the people they have in their group to their beliefs.   I have to say that this book is tied with the first (Clan of the Cave Bear) as my favorites in the series. I loved getting to know the Zelandonii and hearing their stories, and watching their relationships grow.   Jean Auel went through some extensive research to get her facts straight and she admits she tried to stay as close as possible to what the research has found, but, she also admits that there may be times when she changed the facts (from cave placement to time frames) to fit her needs in the storyline. I admire the lengths she went through to research, and am quite jealous of the places she visited (she tells about her research in her acknowledgements at the end of the book). All of this research becomes invaluable to her (in my opinion) because it allows her to write about it in such exquisite detail that it feels like you are there. You see what she saw, and you see what Ayla is seeing. It's an incredible feeling, to feel like you are part of this history.   I do have to say, however, that they sing the mother's song about a billion times, and the lyrics are written out in full just about every time. i read them once, then skipped the rest...   however, I have to say I have the memory span of a gnat, I can't remember 5 minutes ago. I can watch the same movie for 4 days straight and not remember I've seen it, and when watching it, be clueless what's going to happen. I read a book and within a week, I'm able to read it again because I've forgotten how it ends. With the exception of 2 authors. J.K. Rowling, and Jean Auel. I re-read these books not because I've forgotten them, but because I actually remember them. and I love them.   if that isn't enough encouragement to read them, I don't know what is.
e34e3b49e17386ad88c2e70e9e6f2e34	critical	"3.5 My husband just finished reading this aloud to me before bedtime.   An interesting, if at times thinly supported and, in the later section, obviously biased, account of the different ""nations,"" or regional cultures, that make up North America. The best parts were the discussions of the founding of each ""nation,"" as well as the political and cultural differences each brought to the table during the Revolutionary War and the early days of the United States. Learning American history during the Bicentennial years, I wasn't exposed to much of the less ""rah-rah"" aspects of these periods."

b2b9853864c90afa54571dee5ef394b9	non-critical	I love how Elizabeth Camden combines mystery and romance with insight into real historical events. This book about the history of U.S. intelligence agencies and the attempts to create cultured pearls is another fascinating book in her catalog of works.
cf3315db4ec310542f0b3536fcd2e34e	critical	I loved this play very much. The lives of convicts affected me deeply. especially the woman,Liz, was going to be hanged because she was accused of stealing bread for other convicts. but the interesting thing is that she did not even advocate herself. she refused to speak in front of the King.   Also, I liked the meaning of theatre in that society. they accepted it as a way of 'taming' the convicts. They were excited to rehearse their part every time and filled with hope again. the only thing that must be alive in our hearts. ' they left the country for their country's good.' the last sentence that still remains in my mind. (political one.)
c69a895b0e6590fd4d01657358bb5316	neutral	Bintang 3   Suka 1/2 bagian pertama dari buku ini yg bersetting di India dengan konflik dan penggambaran karakter orang orang di India yg eksotis dan mistis. Georgie pun terasa eksotis disini. Seru saat Knight bersaudara menimbulkan kekacauan di istana maharaja.   1/2 bagian terakhir yg bersetting di London dan pedalaman Inggris menurutku datar saja walau ada ketegangan saat penculikan Matthew, kejar kejaran dan baku uantamnya kurang seru. Masa lalu Ian juga kurang membuat aku simpatik. Hampir seluruh kisah HR yg tokoh heronya bermasalah ya itu... Ditinggal istri yg tidak setia.   Georgina Knigth bungsu dari bersaudara Knigth yg tinggal di India, adalah gadis cantik dan ceria, berpendirian dan berkepribadian bebas. Terlahir dan dibesarkan di India membuat Giorgie memiliki keunikan sendiri akan karakternya. Giorgie adalah gadis yg peduli pada sesama tanpa terkecuali. Semua orang dianggap sebagai teman dan keluarga karena selalu kesepian ditinggal oleh ibu yg meninggal saat umurnya masih belia. Kemudian ayah dan 2 saudara lelakinya selalu meninggalkan Georgie untuk urusan dan tugas mereka masing masing. Berbekal pengetahuan akan pernikahan teman teman Indianya (Lhaksmi yg menikah dengan pria tua dan harus melemparkan dirinya dalam kobaran api setelah suaminya meninggal, dan Meena yg merupakan salah satu dari 30 selir maharaja di India) serta buku pedoman karangan bibinya yg bebas membuat dirinya tidak ingin bergantung dengan seorang pria untuk dijadikan suami. Georgie adalah wanita penganut kebebasan dan tak suka penindasan kaum pria.   Ian Prescot, Marquis Griffith adalah seorang pria dingin yg memiliki masa lalu yg menyakitkan pada pernikahannya. Masa lalunya inilah yg membuat Ian tak memikirkan bahaya yg dihadapi dalam setiap tugas diplomatik yg dijalaninya selama ini. Berangkat ke India dalam tugas meyakinkan Maharaja Janpur untuk menandatangani perjanjian netralitas dengan pihak Inggris dalam menghadapi kelompokenjahat yg dilindungi Maharaja Baji Rao. Dalam tugasnya kali ini Ian didampingi beberapa prajurit Inggris yg berada di India termasuk Kedua bersaudara Knigth.   Pertemuan pertama Ian dan Georgie yg sedang menyelamatkan teman Georgie dari kewajiban membakar diri setelah kematian suami membuat Ian tertarik dan berusaha menolong Georgie melarikan diri setelah berhasil menolong temannya itu. Georgiepun begitu, malah sebelum pertemuan mereka Georgie sudah merasa tertarik dengan pribadi Ian. Georgi telah mengumpulkan info mengenai Ian dan setiap perjalanan tugasnya yg selama ini selalu berhasil.   Georgie dengan maksud baiknya dan merasa bahwa dirinya adalah kenalan Maharaja Janpur (teman Georgie selir kesayangan Maharaja Janpur) berniat membantu Ian dalam tugasnya kali ini bila niat Ian dan Inggris murni membawa perdamaian bagi wilayah Janpur. Ian dibuat terkesan saat Georgie menyusul Ian ke istana Maharaja karena sebelumnya Ian menjadikan Georgie tahanan rumah dengan mengirim tentara untuk menjaga agar Georgie tidak mengikuti Ian setelah Ian mengetahui niat Georgie untuk ikut dalam rombongan diplomatiknya.   Walau kesal dan marah, Ian terpaksa berterima kasih pada Georgie karena berkat campur tangan Georgie. Terjadi kehebohan saat Georgie secara tidak sengaja membuka kedok sang Maharani dan putranya yg bersekutu dengan Baji Rao untuk membunuh suaminya sendiri untuk merebut kekuasaan, dan berakibat kematian putra Maharani ditangan Gabriel kakak Georgie. Perjanjian netralitas ditandatangani Maharaja Janpur tanpa ada celah bagi Janpur untuk mengingkarinya. Menghindari kejadian politik yg tidak diinginkan, Knigth bersaudara diminta meninggalkan India Tapi sang Maharani yg sudah dipenjara sempat mengirimkan seorang pembunuh untuk membunuh Knight bersaudara dan menculik Matthew putra Ian.   Tiba di Inggris, Georgie yg kapok dan tak ingin lagi menimbulkan masalah disambut Ian dengan lamaran pernikahan. Georgie yg ingin berubah menerima lamaran Ian. Georgie sempat cemburu pada simpana Ian. Georgie juga marah ketika Ian tidak jujur akan keberadaan putranya Matthew dari pernikahannya yg pertama. Georgie dibuat terkejut akan perangai Ian yg buas saat Ian menghabisi penculik an pembunuh yg dikirim Maharani Janpur. Tapi semua itu tidak membuat Georgie mundur dari rencana pernikahan. Setelah menikah mereka bersembunyi di Estat pedesaan Ian (takut ada penculik dan pembunuh yg lainnya). Disinilah Georgie mengetahui rahasia yg selama ini disimpan rapat oleh Ian mengenai kematian istrinya dan kegagalan pernikahan pertama Ian. Dan seperti sebelumnya Georgie tetap mencintai Ian dan bahkan membenci Istri Ian yg egois dan tidak berperasaan. Dan Ian sangat bahagia dan berterima kasih pada Georgie karena Ian akhirnya dapat mewujudkan impiannya untuk merasakan cinta sejati yg selama ini didambakan Ian.

1bd414eaf3ceb3a6a7e57527e07ec723	critical	"I'm a big fan of Ms Austen, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility being my favourites, so I was excited to read this new biography by Paula Byrne, having enjoyed her previous biography about Evelyn Waugh. It's a great read, written to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice and one I'd highly recommend for any ""Janeites"" out there. What makes it more interesting for me is how it is structured, instead of the factual dryness you can sometimes get with biographies, the author chooses to talk about Austen's life through objects that belonged to her. The pictures of the objects, in particular the two topaz crosses that Austen's brother chose to give to her and Cassandra (her sister), are beautiful and it added that little extra bit of charm to the book as a whole.   I certainly found out a lot I didn't know about Jane which I'm not going to spoil, but the overall picture that emerged of her was as an extremely witty, kind and intelligent person who loved her writing so much that she was prepared to dedicate her life to it, remaining single until her death (although she had no shortage of marriage proposals). What I also loved is the strength of her convictions. When she was invited to write a more ""historical romance"" novel she politely declined with the words ""I must keep to my own style and go on in my own Way."" She absolutely refused to be defined as that kind of writer and made it quite clear that she was a comic rather than a historical novelist.   The closeness of her relationship with her sister Cassandra was lovely to discover, and finding out about her extended family including her cousin Eliza (whom Mary Crawford in Mansfield Park is said to be based upon), was incredibly intriguing. There was certainly a host of exotic and surprising circumstances surrounding the Austen's and their nearest and dearest. Finally, I think Paula Byrne did a fantastic job with this book, and I cannot wait to see what and whom she delves into next.   Please see my full review at http://www.bibliobeth.wordpress.com"
b96a26971fd471ac7476d8bdeaf675a3	neutral	After two months of ploughing through Diamond's anthropological beast of a book, I want to say that it was worth it. The human side of Guns, Germs and Steel was really interesting; in particular, the linguistic developments made throughout the world. However, chapters and chapters about crops was enough to lose my interest. I can't comment on how factually correct Jared Diamond manages to be, but this is clearly a book suited more to those with a substantial anthropology background and not to the lay-person like me.

04baf91302da21e4bb7d76e074ec95f4	very non-critical	This book was one of those that you read some and must put it down for a bit to process what you read. Of course you don't have to, but I recommend it if you want to grasp the intensity of story. What I learned? I didn't learn, so much as it was reaffirmed, that many of us who are in social work of some sort are wounded healers. Good book. I recommend this if you are interested in the complexities of the mind as it relates to a personal story of recovery.
6cd2a7eb4adee657d6297a3f7c8fd321	very non-critical	As someone who doesn't know jackshit about science or biology - I found The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot riveting (FYI, I notice I say riveting A LOT in my reviews, what of it?). In the 1950s, Henrietta Lacks, a young Black woman died of cervical cancer, yet her cells live on. You see, the doctors took her cancer cells which didn't die like normal cells, but kept on multiplying.   Read the rest of my review here

daf3c1af92960c6d4a7d20d3e2fb5576	very non-critical	Another good read from the author of The Girl on the Mountain, continuing the story and can't wait for the next book! Here's a brief review from Amazon:   When feisty Wanda Wyatt is left widowed, penniless, and disturbed by recent fits of rage, she turns to the one person she hates - her grandmother, ex-moonshiner Lucie Bosell. Lured by a vague invitation, she travels back to her mountain roots with two goals in mind: money and revenge. But at what cost? Prohibition has come to West Virginia, and with moonshine worth more than ever, Lucie wants in on the action. Playing along, Wanda finds that being as mean and deceptive as Granny hurts her chances with a compelling man from her past. Worse, the old woman's high-stakes business attracts ruthless people and big trouble. Wanda learns the hard way--revenge is cold comfort.   This is Bk. 2 in the Mountain Women series.
847f89617cc6fa09fd3feb69ed9ccfac	very critical	"Just some short notes and thoughts on this reading:   I remember sitting in mandatory chapel at college and the Baptist preacher was going on about how all this new age religion is just a rehash of pagan beliefs and how nothing was new in religion -- except his religion. I am not Baptist or believer for that matter and let that that sermon go in one ear and out the other.   However, I remembered it while reading Gilgamesh. In the story we have a man made by god from clay. There is a woman, fallen from grace, who tempts a man who is pure in nature. There is a fall from the state of nature. There is a tree with a serpent. There is a man who is two thirds god -- made flesh of the gods. There is an ark and a flood. The man who built the ark was commanded to ""...abandon all possessions and save his life. Tell him to disdain worldly riches and preserve life instead."" The flood not only comes from rain but from waters under the earth. When the flood rains stopped birds were sent out to find dry land.   It is interesting how stories from geographically close regions are similar in nature. There are differences though...   Gilgamesh, himself, was no savior. He was a bad ass. He was Chuck Noris of his day... no more like Tanny Trejo's Machete. He could take on Chuck Norris and Beowulf while making a sandwich. He practiced droit du seigneur and even fought his closest friend over the matter. Gilgamesh lived like no mortal man could.   Finally, there is a line in every story that is just too good not to quote. In Gilgamesh it's:   ""The stones rained down onto the deck of Ea's boat like a storm of pounding turtles.""   Overall, it is a clear and easy to read translation that captures the larger than life Hero of an ancient time. A fun adventure."

de22d4c1dd1c0e1ce4347d07a8942531	non-critical	DNF   I'm around 200 pages in and although I can continue, there isn't enough intrigue to keep me going. The protagonist seems anachronic too. Language and perspective is too modern for a historical novel.
17d9edb862ab948170e6ffc648d1aae2	critical	This is a great book. I first heard about it when Eric Metaxas interviewed the author on his radio show. Vodolazkin, a Russian scholar of medieval history, has a fascinating personal story. The novel itself was VERY Russian and reminded me a lot of Dostoevsky. On a historical level, it gives real insight into the medieval worldview of the Eastern Orthodox variety. Christian themes of love, faith, and self-sacrifice permeate the novel sometimes subtly, sometimes more straightforwardly (though I have to admit that I, an Evangelical Protestant, was often simultaneously impressed and saddened by the asceticism that permeated Medieval Russian Orthodox Christianity and which, I believe, undermines the grace of the Gospel--though, on the other hand, exposure to this tradition may be a needed antidote for American Christians who have been listening too much Joel Osteen). Overall, this is a beautiful book.
a45fcc901c0284830a6a191c9a985ef0	neutral	Julia has been drawn to a house in rural England her entire life. The death of an aunt gives her the means to purchase it. But why does the house look so familiar? And why are the people so familiar? And who is Mariana? Julia must explore the past to learn her future.   Having read both The Rose Garden and the Winter Sea, was really looking forward to this story. Not quite a time travel tale, it was an interesting perspective. I liked Julia - she seemed to have so much life in her. I think the author drew out the story a little longer than I would have liked, the suspense was quite agonizing.   The Rose Garden is still my favorite.
