32f17f5659a06e6a23f19342b87b9d64	very critical	This would be an excellent book for introducing students to Malcolm X.   Cowritten by one of Malcolm's daughters, this is a fictionalized account of his early years leading up to his imprisonment and the reawakening of his faith. Extensive author's notes help clarify fact from fiction and give the story historical context.   While reading this book I was struck by how little I really learned about Malcolm X in school. He was often introduced as a foil to Martin Luther King Jr, one violent and the other nonviolent. I know there was much more to this man than that and this book sparked my interest in learning more.   This novelization does a good job showing the character flaws and sometimes selfish behavior that led Malcolm to his eventual arrest for burglary. It does not try to sugar coat the questionable behavior of his youth. You can see his decisions that lead him down the wrong path.   It also brings up many of the racial struggles that Malcolm faced throughout his life-- from his mom losing a job because she was black, to the harsh sentencing at his trial. I couldn't help but connect his story in my mind to the racial struggles that continue in our country today. This is an historical fiction novel that will still strike readers as being very relevant.

95c6e87736f7a290c7aa71e48f149e0a	non-critical	Slices of life that features Mississippi during the 1960s. The book focuses on the 'help', primarily the black maids during that time period and how one white woman chronicles their story and how they've affected her life as well. In addition to issues of segregation, the book explores the issue of class - making for quite an interesting read. The characterization is well done.
87de2cb6467c4a2682b80bef3ada7805	critical	This book had the potential to be really exciting and fascinating. Instead, it's just plain dull.   I mean some explanation of the types of soil and rock that are found on a volcanic island are pertinent to the topic, but all I remember is this guy droning on and on non-stop about it, and all sorts of background that had no relation to the explosion at all.   When I buy a book about a volcano, I'd like to know about the volcano, about the people who were affected by the event, about the before and after of the calamity. Not the freaking composition of the damned igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic rock, the plants that grow in the rock, and various oher errata.
5c3fdbe579d8980a8888ae9136454512	very non-critical	It seemed invariably like a modern version of Jane Austen's Emma, but with a few small changes. First, the girl seems like the independent sort who wants to get married just so she has a man to take care of her. In other words an overly practical girl who doesn't care for the idea of love at all. And then the guy is just a bumbling fool. And while he may be adept in business, he is pathetic in social etiquette, as well as in the matters of love- though he at least will admit that love is real.

I think what helped the story is that the book started out hinting at strange/magical events, so that by the time I got to the end, the supernatural happenings were believable.
c645e0bb81e15bd3291708e58def4c2b	neutral	How funny... I see that I started reading this book in 2010 but didn't finish it. See comments between Lynn and I. I must have forgotten I had tried to read it, because I just read it again and had no idea this was the same book until I came here to write my review! Isn't it funny how different moods and periods of time bring different feelings towards books?   I enjoyed it this time around for some reason. I didn't love it, but I did enjoy getting into the location and time period of the book - 1950s England. The cockney language was still a bit difficult to get into, as mentioned in my comment in 2010, but I got used to it after a while. I also became more understanding that author didn't tell more birth stories, which was my complaint the first time around, but only focused on a few. I also accepted the fact that it read more like a novel instead of a memoir, and enjoyed it more once I did so.   Recommend? Only if a story about a midwife in 1950s England sounds appealing to you.
9d79f342d7e3cf66f4e97ea76e52e9c4	non-critical	This is a debut from a new author for me and a first book in her The Wicked Quills of London series in which we'll be meeting three heroines who are all good with their quills.   We open the series with an owner of a prominent scandal sheet.   This was such a fun, F.U.N., read! From the opening scene to the last, you'll be on a rollercoaster and you'll not want to get off.   I loved everything about this story! The plot was as much intriguing as our heroine was about the life of our hero. And speaking of, what a man he was! To go to the lengths that he does in order to help a friend, is not just honorable but commending.   To follow these two as they're trying to read each other and in the process fall in love, was a delight.   Melanie for b2b   Complimentary copy provided by the publisher

97f6f6c9e40ae5457ae595bc0bc87ed6	neutral	This historical fiction/fantasy series imagines the world basically as we know it, except with dragons. It is creative and entertaining, although at times it felt a little repetitive. It has all the makings of an epic series, if only more of the characters were more thoroughly developed. Other than the main characters (Laurence and Temeraire) and some of the other dragons, the character development was a little flat. Perhaps that is because the author's intent was to spend more time imagining how the Napoleonic wars might have gone if dragons were part of the equation. She is definitely in her element describing battles and strategy and the political maneuvering between nations. Overall, I enjoyed this series very much. Looking forward to more from Naomi Novik.

88bac5ed7cc113388ae7f0dabb27bef1	critical	An old fashioned, very English ghost story. It is set during WW2 and Downton Abbey kept coming to mind. The characters and settings are stiff upper lip types dealing in Port with a large holiday mansion which is haunted. I kept picturing Hugh Grant as the main character.   The story flows and the hauntings are explained as the characters delve into their families secrets and the history of the house. It does have a good atmosphere and there are a couple of good scenes which are creepy, menacing and full of dread but there isn't enough of them.   It did make a change from reading gritty urban English horror. It is a good solid tale but is not scary enough. It was all a bit restrained. The writing style is the opposite of descriptive, compact and too the point. I felt like I was touching the surface and a more detailed and deeper story was bubbling underneath.   This is the author's latest book and was published in 2013, 9 years after his last novel. I have his first book, Naomi's Room which is considered to be one of his best, sitting on my shelf and I look forward to reading it.

b010a5e703b63fbfdb15d83225d02a85	neutral	"The Alice Network is a compelling story of two women, strangers, who embark on a journey on a search for truth and retribution following WWII. Charlotte St. Clair is traveling with her mother to Europe, pregnant and unmarried, to take care of her ""little problem."" But Charlie, as she's called, is also searching for her cousin Rose, who disappeared in 1944 in France. Charlie comes into contact with Eve Gardiner, a woman bearing scars from her past, spending most of her days alone and drunk. Along with Finn, Eve's man of all trades, the women travel to France to search for Rose, and also for the people of Eve's past who have left her wounded. A riveting tale of spies, revenge, and heartbreak, but filled with lighthearted, tender moments as the trio become friends, and as Eve tells them the stories of her time spent with The Alice Network during the First World War. This book is historical fiction at its finest; an intriguing story that teaches the reader about a time in history that might be new to them, along with a warmth and understanding, multi-dimensional characters that we truly care about and a story that reaches into our soul."

c2061b20ab1a4f512b5a0287c2862a1b	neutral	Buena biografia de Charles Dickens. Me gusto mucho la articulacion entre la vida y la obra que propone Jean-Pierre Ohl. Todo cobra sentido en la obra de Dickens cuando se considera su vida, tal como la presenta Ohl. Me gusto tambien que es una biografia reciente (originalmente publicada por Gallimard en 2011). Incluye informacion mas completa que las biografias contemporaneas a Dickens, como la de John Forster (The Life of Charles Dickens, Edit. Cecil Palmer, Londres, 1872-1874), que es reconocida como la mejor porque Forster era amigo y confidente de Dickens. Opino que conviene leer esta biografia de Ohl junto con la de Peter Ackroyd, (Dickens. El Observador Solitario, editado en espanol por Edhasa). Ohl recorre la agitada vida de Dickens con herramientas de critica literaria a mano. Me parecio especialmente interesante la amistad con Wilkie Collins y las descripciones de las oscilaciones del animo de Dickens. Creo que en la actualidad Dickens tendria el diagnostico de trastorno bipolar por su ida y vuelta entre entusiasmo extremo y tristeza extrema. Mas aun, Ohl ofrece indicios de posibles alucinaciones en diferentes momentos de crisis de la vida de Dickens. En sintesis, opino que esta biografia es muy recomendable. La traduccion se lee con fluidez y la edicion esta muy bien cuidada.
ac2b73344e174ba4cb89a370f67d6be0	neutral	A close-up look at the double-stranded story of Henry Hudson's final voyage, and Samuel de Champlain's efforts to locate the aftermath of said voyage.   Hunter does a good job of bringing to life the many personalities involved, and makes clear to differentiate between fact and speculation.   If there's one complaint, he gives excessive detail to secondary subjects, which often slows the story to a crawl. I found myself skipping sentences, then paragraphs, then pages at a time in order to get back to the main narrative. Still, a solid work overall.

I love history stuff like that! A World War II aspect? Count me in. However, it was not good. First of all, somehow I missed that there would be a serial killer who details his brutal crimes in more detail than I want to know. Ick. But the worst was that it just wasn't good. The characters we're flat and unsympathetic. When you finally reached the reveal of ""whodunit"" it was a letdown. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone."

Part of the novel takes place in Shanghai and shows us the somewhat carefree life of the privileged class masked in denial and shallowness. Then it transitions amid chaos and horror to San Francisco and exposes the reader to life in SF's Chinatown surrounded by prejudice and mistrust of anything foreign. I'll read more by Lisa See.

4c0afe6bfd4b3719b95f0298218f8da6	very critical	"I really loved this book. I have wanted to read it for years and never got around to it until now. Mitchell was truly brilliant. I loved this book from page one. Masterfully written. Very well built characters. It was also a great history lesson as I had never heard a ""Southerners"" side of the Civil War story. Some say the book is racist but I think it needs to be taken in context. It was written in the 1930's and it was about the Civil War.   I really had no idea how horrible Scarlet was. In the movie she is cruel and flawed but you love her. But in the book she is horrible! The things that she said about her children made me flinch. What a detestable character. She cared only for herself and nothing else. Not even her children which is deplorable. She knew her own emotions so little that she didn't even recognize the feeling of love when she felt it. She thought she loved Ashley but really is what a- the thought of Ashley and b-Ashley didn't choose her so she wanted what she couldn't have. Once Melanie died she realized that she didn't love Ashley and that she did love Rhett. What a fool. At least in the end she did realize how much she loved Melanie.   Melanie on the other hand, she is the polar opposite of Scarlet. She is good in every way. I really really wish I was more like Melanie. Loyal and strong in such a feminine way. She reminded me of the song ""A poor wayfaring man of grief"". She took in those who needed her help and loved them irrespectively. If the world had more Melanie's in it it would be a better place without a doubt.   I loved Rhett and his strength. I felt so bad for him when Bonnie died and also when I knew how much he loved Scarlet and how little she cared. Although he really was a scoundrel he was lovable. And he loved others, unlike Scarlett. He was the embodiment of what a man should be. (Well not completely but you know what I mean.) At the end I didn't know whether to be sad that he really left Scarlet or be happy for him that he was getting away from her.   I also loved Mammy and how well she could ""read"" everyone around her. I loved how she kept Scarlet in check. Well as much as anyone could. And my heart broke for her when she went back to Tara after Bonnie died and Rhett and Scarlet were at each others throats.   By the end of the book I was sobbing. I had no idea it was going to be so tragic and sad, although I had seen the movie numerous times. Although it was quite long I enjoyed every second of reading it.   I have always loved the movie. I was really surprised to see how well the movie follows the book. Specific and identical lines. And of course how it ends is spot on. Even the last line of the book is the last line in the movie.   One thing I love about this book is that although is incredibly long, when you are finished reading it you want more. You want to know what happens the next day, week and year. Does Scarlet win Rhett back? Do they have more children? Questions, questions. L-O-V-E-D this book!"

fb86e8fd88c47762d36cf8b71e4aa1ac	very critical	I love true crime, Victorian everything, and Judith Flanders, but I did not love this book. As I've suggested in other reviews, it really chaps my ass when a book doesn't live up to its title (failing to live up to its jacket copy is bad enough, but title? Low bar here, people.). Obviously, the Victorians didn't invent murder, and Flanders kind of squanders the opportunity to make a solid case for what they DID do with it. For that matter, she doesn't do that much with it herself, besides in her inimitable way research the living bejesus out of it. She knows endless details about a century's worth of crimes and their cultural resonances, clearly from her own digging through archives, but she lays this knowledge out in plodding chronological order (crime, cultural aftermath; crime, cultural aftermath; etc; ad nauseam) with some extremely dubious transitions. She doesn't even keep with the theme of cultural attention to the crime: periodically she'll throw one in to say, this has all the hallmarks of the kind of crime that would get lots of press!... but somehow it didn't.   But, you might say, you gave it four stars. See the first sentence. If you love those things, you will like this book quite a bit, for the fun facts alone. If Flanders had made an overarching argument, had connected the murders she discusses and their afterlives like shining beads on a carefully-wrought string of narrative -- then my head might have exploded. So for the best really.
013136f5fc273def10d4edcb85e52fe1	critical	The story of the Australian Light Horse Brigade in the first world war. Or rather the story of a boy - and he really is a boy at the beginning of the book - and his horse. There are lots of great things about this book. The relationship between the boy and his dad. The war fever that gripped small towns at the beginning of the war, the white feathers delivered to those who didn't go off immediately. This is a great book to sit alongside David Hill's Two Brothers novel. Offering multiple perspectives of the war, although they are set in different battles. Morris Gleitzman is a wonderful writer and this book is one of his best. Highly recommended for Year 9 and 10 students and those who struggle with reading at yr 11 level.
0d47d8d3d6ea60c68a302d9c2f96aab2	non-critical	This was passed to me by someone who had heard the review on Radio 4 and liked the title. He didn't read it himself...simply past it to me after a very short conversation after his purchase!   Anyhow, this is the first book I've read by Jeanette Winterson. I knew she'd written Oranges are not the only fruit, but while I new it had been televised the book had never appealed to me.   Well, I am a changed person. I loved the writing. The topics resonate with me. I was not adopted. I shall be checking out 'Oranges' soon and will investigate her other writing - although I understand it is built around myths and alternative realities (much like Atwood perhaps?)   Anyway, I loved the title. Enjoyed the book.

6985e6950896e7048ae567e94e38eb11	critical	This was my first time reading a book by Daisy Goodwin and I was not disappointed. There are many intertwined storylines going on, but they all have their reasons and help you get to know everyone. I could not predict anything at all because there were many ups and downs and mystery to some characters. I loved the journey that the story had of following them and watching the grow. There were many parts that I loved and the ending left me wanting more.   Cora was defiantly a strong willed girl that was used to getting what she wanted, but she had something about her that didn't really come off as spoiled. She wanted to be free but also loved. I loved how she changed but didn't change at the same time.   Ivo is a man of mystery because he is so quiet and hides his past and emotions most of the time. I didn't fully understand him until he finally let go of his past and talked about it. I loved him from the start even though he was complicated.

9ba1bbfaa36d5c247799f3d75b959456	critical	"So many pot-boiler books have been written on the Ripper murders, it seems best to point out one that is actually worth reading.   Sugden's book is unusual, inasmuch as he has no solution to offer and no murderer to finger. He does give convincing reasons why the three lead suspects for one reason or another don't fit the bill as the offender, and concedes that ""there is every possibility that the man the Victorians called 'the master murderer of the age' was in reality a complete nobody whose name never found its way into the police file ... some sad social cripple who lived out his days in obscurity"" (p. 468).   What makes his book really interesting, I think, is the sheer amount of detail about Victorian London and about the lives of the victims, the police, and the suspects, before and after the murders. Indeed, the crimes themselves seem to be merely the anchors the rest of the book is organised around.   My own speculation on the Ripper case, for what it's worth, is to wonder if there in fact was a ""Jack the Ripper"". There should be a tangible hypothesis that the murders were not connected, and that the Ripper was, in a sense, the product of a mass hysteria.   Anyway, this is a first class review of the evidence and I recommend it in the highest terms."

3e42b69a1e5413c09cb7a9aae9a22267	non-critical	"I receieved an Advance Readers Edition of Unremarried Widow.   For 5 minutes and $5, a psychic forecast that Artis should ""pack her cowboy boots because her life and love would be out West.""   Aris was a free spirited, wanna be writer, who wanted to travel the world She met Miles Henderson at a club in Tallahassee, Florida. He was an Army pilot learning how to fly helicopters and to protect his country. They traveled together from Army camp to Army camp and got married three years later. Deployed to Iraq, Mied eles was killed in an unexplained Helicopter crash.   To me, this was more than a memoir. It was an exploration into her grief and loss, which touched my heart. The most touching thing to me was a letter written to Artis by Miles should he be killed. It was so beautiful as he declared his everlasting love for her, reassembled her life and coaxed her to fulfil her dreams.   A great read that will have you in tears and thinking about this lovely story long after you read the last page."

339b07e85ab5fead922c3527d5104ca2	very critical	The Portrait was dark, angsty and riveting. At times, I wasn't sure that I liked Jonas. However, I came to see that his initial cruelty towards Imogene arose out of his despair, his hopelessness about his life. People are often cruel out of self-defense. He felt a sense of powerlessness about his mental illness, and his dependence on his patrons to keep a roof over his head and to be able to do the one thing that had meaning for him, to pursue his art. As the book progresses, I saw that Jonas was a man who was very much capable of loving Imogene, a man that love could change for the better, merely by giving him hope and by having one person who saw him truly, who would not leave him or give up on him, even through the bad times, That was Imogene.   Imogene saddened me at times. Her lack of self-esteem, and lack of belief in herself. However, it was soon clear why she felt that way. Her father was just awful. He put his one daughter on a pedestal, and barely noticed the other, when he wasn't putting her down and inflicting emotional cruelty on her. She'd spent most of her life feeling like she was inadequate to her family, feeling her mother's disgust and hatred. Always below the mark of comparison to her sister, Chloe. When her father sends her to New York City to study art, she is determined to make a good artist out of herself, to make her father proud.   Instead she meets Jonas, a brilliant painter, who treats her cruelly at first, but captivates her and causes her to fall in love with him. Imogene wasn't a fool. She went into the love affair with Jonas with her eyes open. She had been used by a man before, not measuring up, and she didn't think that this larger-than-life artist could really love her for who she was. She was wrong. In Imogene, Jonas saw a masterpiece, a hidden beauty. But he also loved her for who she was. For her love and acceptance of him.   I love dark and angsty romance, but I was afraid this was going to be too dark for me. I'm glad to see that I was wrong. I loved the message of hope in this story. Jonas' mental condition was not an easy fix. Many people with bi-polar disorder don't fare well, particularly in the past, when they didn't even have a diagnosis and no good way to treat this mental condition. With this story, I know things won't be easy for Jonas or Imogene, but they have their love and their commitment to each other to help them through the dark times. Imogene has seen Jonas at his worst, and it didn't make her run away. She only left because she thought he didn't love her or that she didn't matter. But she came back because he was the one for her, her true love. She would stay by his side forever, no matter what, knowing that he truly wanted her. Thankfully, Jonas loves her for who she is, and that's what she always needed in her life. As this book ends, I felt a sense of hope that made this dark read just my kind of story. I could believe that although life won't be easy, they will have a happy ending together. And that's why I love romance novels.   Thanks to Denise for kindly loaning me this book for my Kindle!
1cca4e199fc37356546455f39d6a3d57	critical	I won this book free from Goodreads Giveaways. This story is the equivalent to a wife running away from an abusive husband. Except it's witches and they are immortal and they are running through time. The first three quarters of this book I give a strong 4* rating. Then in the last quarter before the end, the story of Elise I give it a 2* rating. So overall a 3. In the beginning I found the story very interesting I love the forbidden relationship between Elizabeth and Gideon and I even understand her crazy confused attraction. He is a bad man but aren't we sometimes attracted to the mysterious, forbidden things in life, don't our feeling and desires sometimes overpower our brains when making positive decisions? We might like something even though we know it's wrong. Even in a terrible way I found myself longing for them to be together. For him to become her hero even in his wickedness. I cried tears during the first of Elizabeth's stories, the story about Bess. I found her loss tragic. I became tired with the book during the Nurse/War/Elsie segment I felt it wasn't as entertaining and a bit repetitive with guns blazing and all the death that comes with war. I was uninterested. I loved Teagan and I'm glad with the outcome of the ending. Overall I thought the book was written great. Very descriptive. I most likely will not seek out book number two in this series.
251ca03243cb4189053ddee9b71610ef	critical	This was an interesting read. The author is quite sympathetic to Richard, and disputes the standard image our society has of Richard. Jones is constantly comparing his version of Richard to Shakespeare's, and I think he is successful in painting a new portrait of Richard.   I was more interested in learning about Richard III himself than the actual battle of Bosworth, and the book did not disappoint in that area.

4c847f88b542522cfb126bc05c7fffd7	very non-critical	In the world of conspiracy theories, the JFK conspiracy reigns supreme as one of the enduring mysteries of the twentieth century whose effects are still being felt today. It was all the more shocking because the assassination was carried out in front of hundreds of people in broad daylight, and in its aftermath it seemed Camelot had died. With the subsequent government cover up, allegations of CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and Mafia involvement we in the twenty first century are still left wondering. Who did it? As a child growing up the sixties and seventies Oswald's guilt was always accepted carte blanche by my father and passed onto me as gospel, a communist plot to get rid of the American president. It was only when I saw Oliver Stone's film, JFK that I saw how a coup d'etat could have occurred, and when two of the retired pathologists were trotted out for the public in the hype around the film I sensed the stench of corruption again.   Jim Marrs' book Crossfire, The Plot that Killed Kennedy is one of the books used as a reference point for Stone's Counter Mythology to counter the Government Mythology. At 590 pages it's a hefty tome and has an extensive bibliography at the back. It doesn't tell us whodunit but it gathers all the evidence that had been uncovered from 1963 up until 1989 and lays it all out in easy bite sized chapters. At the end of every chapter you find a brief summary of the major points, which I found crucial when you have to absorb so much information at once.   Part one is the Kill Zone, setting the scene for the assassination, the Texas School Depository, the Triple Underpass, the Grassy Knoll, and also gives you background information on the Kennedy rise to power.   Part Two is Means, Motives, and Opportunities, which goes into who might have wanted Kennedy dead. Lee Harvey Oswald's history, the Russians, the Cubans, Mobsters, the CIA, the FBI, Rednecks and Oilmen, and the Military.   Part Three is the Aftermath. Dallas, the two hospitals where two autopsies produced different results, the Jack Ruby connection, the evidence used to convict Oswald is debunked, the Warren Commission, the Garrison Investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, the Oswald Exhumation years later and finally a list of 'convenient deaths.' Witnesses who could have or actually contradicted official FBI and Intelligence reports.   At the very end is a re-enactment, similar to the conversation Costner's character has with X in JFK, where a possible assassination plot is put into motion.   It makes for stirring and thought provoking reading although other evidence that has since come to light obviously won't appear. However for anyone interested in what happened that November 22, 1963 this is an indispensable book to have on your shelf. It is probably the base text that will start you on your own journey. The summaries at the end of each chapter as mentioned mean you can condense the critical information in short bullet points.   But why we should care about the assassination of a US president back in 1963? I could probably point to the many government cover ups, lies. From Watergate through to the invasion of Iraq to search for WMDs, but I think I'll leave the last word to Jim Marrs, quoting from page 590 of the book where he states.   'The Kennedy assassination was a true coup d'etat, a sudden and violent shift of power to the right in this country. And that power, though weakened by revelations of corruption and unachieved goals, remains with us today.   Few people have shown a willingness to confront and accuse this power. But until the people of the United States confront the reality of Kennedy's death and face up to the power behind it, the wars, near wars, the wasteful military build up, foreign adventurism, squandered millions, trampled human rights, moral decline, and environmental pollution will continue.' 1   I've given it five out of five and lament the fact there are only five stars to give, it deserves more than that for its commitment to truth.   1 Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy page 590   By Jim Marrs, Published 1989 Carroll and Graf Publishers.

4aad8d47853ce633ffe7bc400c713f72	very non-critical	"Hugh Davies, spent his professional life working at the Transport Research Laboratory in Crowthorne, which happens to run next to the Devil's Highway, the road that linked London to Silchester. On his retirement, Hugh took up the study of road construction in Roman times. This book is based on his research, which lead to him being awarded a PhD from Reading University. Drawing on a life-time spent designing modern road systems, Hugh Davies provides a fascinating insight into the decisions and issues that the Roman engineers would have faced when planning their roads.   Complete with maps and diagrams, the book gives technical details of how the roads were planned, built and maintained, and considers the reasons why the roads we have discovered vary in width and quality.   For a lighter introduction to the topic, I would advise the reader to consider Hugh's more accessible work, ""Roman Roads in Britain"", which is less academic in tone."
622220a7a1a88ee9b4645baf41289be8	very critical	To anyone born and raised in America, the movies that we see show all members of the WWII German military solely as agents of evil. In particular the movies largely focus on stereotypical characters from the Gestapo and S.S. As a result, we tend to label all Germans or German military of the period as Nazis, with all that that implies as shown to us by Hollywood. Naturally, as I started to read this biography of a very decent German officer, I occasionally felt conflicted. In empathizing with the subject, I sometimes wondered if some Americans who haven't read the book might accuse me of being unpatriotic.   Much of the book is hagiography. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the narrative immensely--found it very difficult to put down. I appreciated the overall perspective, as well as the picture of the relations among and the characterizations of the men in the Luftwaffe while deployed in combat zones.   After all the thousands of movies about World War II, it is a relief to read something that shows members of the German military as three-dimensional, ordinary human beings. Also, of the ten years of Hartmann's imprisonment in Soviet labor camps, I appreciate that the author and Erich Hartmann made a point of showing the humanity of the ordinary Russian people who lived near the forced labor camps, as compared to the political operatives and psychopaths who ran the camps.   The co-author of the book was an American military test pilot himself. The book was written for those interested in the military, in WWII, in aerial warfare, and especially fighter planes and pilots. The author make every scrupulous effort to show Erich Hartmann as a thoroughly professional military man. They avoid politics and social issues as much as possible.   I accept it at face value that morale in the Luftwaffe throughout World War II was very good, in contrast to the morale of those who served on the ground on the Eastern front (It was likewise in the U.S. military during the Vietnam war, with abysmal morale in the infantry yet exceptionally high morale in the air force). The members of the Luftwaffe were entirely occupied with their own operations and not that aware of war conditions elsewhere.   Erich Hartmann joined the Luftwaffe at 18 and completed training as a fighter pilot at 20. At such a young age, it would be unfair to expect him to have well-formed political beliefs. However, I wish the author had included information about the young Erich Hartmann's exposure and experiences regarding the politics and social conditions in Nazi Germany. The book refers to examples of many Germans, including in the military who did not believe in Nazism.   Erich Hartmann's father had enormous influence on his son. From the beginning, Hartmann's father saw through the Nazi propaganda. He told his son in 1939 that Germany was going to lose the war, and he repeated it again to him in 1944. The authors present Erich Hartmann as being of the highest moral character, with the courage and strength to not compromise his beliefs even under the prolonged interrogations and inhuman conditions in the Soviet labor camp system. The author mentions in passing and without judgment that Erich Hartmann had been a member of Hitler Youth. But that was required of all German youth. Erich Hartmann does not appear to have been political in anyway. This is underscored by the fact that, after the war and after his release from the Soviet slave labor camp, that he did not join any of the German political parties, even though it would have been advantageous for him to do so career-wise. But I want to know if he had had any Jewish friends. Was he antisemitic? Was his father? Erich Hartmann must have been aware at some level of what the Nazi government was doing to the Jews and the other groups that his government was persecuting. Hartmann served all of his combat time on the Eastern front. Was he aware of the exterminations of Jews in those areas? What were Erich Hartmann's attitudes towards all that? What did Hartmann think about it after the war?   As presented in the book, Hartmann had exemplary personal morals and character, better than my own, and without question better than most human beings. He committed no war crimes. As he stated many times to his Russian captors, he was simply a professional soldier fighting for his country. He never applied his conscience to make a judgment about whether the war was just. While reading this biography occasionally my feelings lash out in anger,that he gave material cooperation to intrinsic evil--to an unprovoked and unjust war by Germany that caused suffering and death to millions of innocent people. Perhaps his ten years in a Soviet forced labor camp should be considered just punishment--part of a communal justice imposed on the German people.

9280e6c793eefd9c0d74d996cdb4c447	critical	"I have read this title as part of a college World Literature class, and aim to share my thoughts directed by quotations from the book. If you consider reading quotations from the book that do not give away any elements of the plot as spoilers, then you've been warned.   ""What did I yearn for? The subtle joys of being a slave. The cakes made out of crumbs from the stale bread of life. The fleeting moments of forbidden games."" (p. 63)   Conde breathes new life into a ""historically brushed-aside"" character. A very enjoyable read, aiming to demonstrate the idea of varying perspective. Readers are invited to empathize, where ""satanic witchcraft"" is introduced as simple homeopathic healing, from a strong woman who simply ""didn't know who Satan was!"" (p.26)   We are shown the influence of people's haste to labels that reduce a person an object of their judgement. ""Witch? She took care of people and cured them."" (p. 26)   Yet, Tituba understands that her art is a controversial one. ""Men hate us and yet without us their life would be sad and narrow... Thanks to us they can hope. Tituba, we are the salt of the earth."" (p. 52). Conde successfully designs a multilayered character, who even questions witchcraft in other regions. She is flabbergasted at the methodology used in Salem. ""In the West Indies, our science is nobler and relies more on unseen forces than on things."" (p. 54)   ""You can't imagine the hypocrisy of the white man's world."" (p. 46)   Another issue discussed, and is clearly introduced in the title is racism. Conde's Tituba embraces herself, as the dark-skinned witch from Barbados. She is simply ""Noire de Salem"" , in the original title. Black or blackness of Salem. She appropriates the label she was given. ""A slave originated from the West Indies who probably practiced hoodoo."" (The only historical record of her existence, from the Salme Witch Trials). Tituba does not offer a racism sob story, but instead she uses these lines to fuel her awareness of herself and her situation. The darkness of her skin is taken to be a sign of the devil, by the characters she meets.   ""She was convinced that my color was indicative of my close connection with Satan... In Salem, such a conviction was shared by all... All of us were not simply cursed, but visible messengers of Satan."" (p. 65)   ""The art of doing evil is a complex one. If this must be based on the knowledge of plants, this must be combined with the power to act on the unseen forces, which are rebellious by nature... Not just anyone can set herself up as a witch!"" (p. 67) Tituba begins to sarcastically accept what they have labelled her as, this is where this read becomes extremely satisfying.   The novel takes an entirely new turn when Hester is introduced, the protagonist of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). This is where Tituba begins to learn about feminism, an anachronism. Modern concepts transcend the order of time, and hang out in 17th century Massachusetts.   ""That was Salem, a community that stole, cheated and burgled while wrapping itself in the cloak of God's name."" (p. 84)   ""Why should I confess? What goes on in my head and my heart is my business."" (p. 41)   Conde's resurrection of Tituba is a tale of self-discovery. Her journey through layers of society, from choosing slavery, into being prosecuted , all the way to the unrelated end will show her arguably changed character . From being clueless about the cruelty of the world, into defining her own sort of motherhood, and meaning to life. Conde's take on the tale is well-written, and beautifully translated. However, it's told in a manner where you're simply unsure where Tituba's heading, she's simply accepting the twists and turns of fate. This is a reason why the last segment of the tale feels lackluster, in my opinion. Yet, this can be justified by saying that this is the flow of life, we do not know where situations will take us, and that is how Conde selects to narrate her fictionalized tale of Tituba, the black witch of Salem."

Forced into the kitchen house as a young girl, she grows up bonding with the slaves and they in turn become her family.

This is Rachel's coming-of-age story beginning with her diagnosis of leprosy at a very young age and her forced removal from her family. Blind to Moloka'i's beauty, wanting only her mother and home, Rachel is taken under the wings of her Uncle Pono and his wife, Haleola.   Doctors learn that surgery sometimes ""cures"" the leprosy patients, and Rachel is a good candidate for surgery. The Board of Health may decide to ""parole"" patients whose leprosy has gone inactive. Rachel's life on Moloka'i is a rich, full life, in a sense, yet bittersweet in its limitations. This story of her struggles and triumphs could be anyone's story at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Brennert tells it with dignity and hope."

This story of one of the 20th century's most famous bank robbers presents a complex character and raises questions regarding economic injustice. .......As someone who sees a story, then wonders what happens next, I couldn't help but be excited about this fictionalized take on a real-life bank robber! As if the crime sprees weren't brazen enough, the jail breaks and the heart break Sutton suffered (real, I think) are the stuff a good fiction writer would probably struggle to invent. It works here!

Nathaniel is a former military man. Sophia was the wife of one of his group of good friends while at war in the peninsula. Nat and his friends always considered Sophia as 'one of the guys' so to speak.... Good old Sophie! Sadly, Sophia's husband died a hero during the war and returned to London as the hero's widow. Several years have passed and while out on a walk, she runs into Nat and the guys. It's like good old times! ...... Or is it? Such a gut wrenching story of lost love and uncertain futures. It's a roller coaster.
c45bea5f4a88d67c7df405dde1e57638	non-critical	When his older brother Pasang returns to their Tibetan village, eleven-year-old Tenzin has no idea that when he leaves, Tenzin will be accompanying him. Desperate to escape from the oppression and poverty that exist in their country, Pasang decides to flee over the Himalayas to India where they will be able to be free. Readers will be caught up by the boys' journey and determination and keep their fingers crossed that they will survive as they endure brutality from border guards and face extreme conditions on the mountain as well as a guide that deserts them near the end. They also meet others who are just as determined as they are to reach safety. Their story was originally told in a documentary made through a chance encounter, and now retold in this book. I certainly admire the brothers for their actions, and I doubt that I could have survived the trek. The author has tried to describe their feelings and the challenges they faced, but I wonder if the book would have been more effective if one of them had written it.

508e4a85c7c5061a1293095e2f668fa9	neutral	I struggled to finish this book. This is some of my favourite subject matter (the Plath estate, as well as biography as a genre and its limitations and difficulties) and yet I had to force myself through it. A little disappointed tbh. Although Malcolm makes brilliant observations and offers invaluable insight into the genre of biography, her style is just so dry.   At about p.183 things really started to pick up. I particularly enjoyed the final note on Malcolm's correspondence with Hughes over the US publication of The Bell Jar as an example of the problem of the omniscient biographer. It was artfully included and summed up her argument very neatly.
a4b32fd074e2321fc86149e386e27c7e	neutral	I've read a number of books by Indian-American authors during my Centrum residency in Port Townsend (the buyer at the local library appears to have a fascination with all things Indian, since so many of this genre grace the shelves), but this is my favorite of all. Not the jazziest title (which has to do with the main character's astrologer husband, who asks the midwives delivering his children to toss a lemon through the window, so he'll know the exact time of their births and can forecast their horoscopes).   This book is a generational novel about a ten-year-old Tamil Brahmin girl, Sivakami, and her brief marriage, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. I loved the clear, prescient writing and the touch of magical realism (just enough to make the story poignant and beautiful). Some of the characters as nearly perfect in their generosity and humanity (Sivakami and her closeted gay servant, Muchami),while others are painfully flawed (Sivakami's son, Vairum, for example, who is unloved by his father and suffers the effects throughout his life). The story features a lot of local history and a sweeping sense of the changes affecting India during Sivakami's lifetime. A brilliant, beautiful book -- one that is difficult to put down, especially at the end.

My favorite scene of the whole series is towards end of the book that deals with Merripen and Beatrix's main love interest. I laughed out loud at that scene and it just made it so good and comfortable to read and be in their world.   Though my only complain is that I wish Lisa Kleypas will make another story of all the Hathaway family and their kids. I will have a fun time reading the book.

The characters in the present-day storyline just didn't do it for me. The psychic angle dominated everything else to the point that at points Nicola and Rob felt like highly gifted props to get to the real story. I much preferred Anna's story, and could have happily read an entire novel set among the Jacobite exiles of St. Petersburg. (Does anyone know of one?) I did strain myself trying to remember the events of ""The Winter Sea,"" which I read but obviously didn't retain much from! I think knowing more of those details would have enhanced my enjoyment of the book, especially the early parts.   I read this back to back with Russian Winter, and the two have a lot in common - time-slip structure with parallel stories, mysterious objet d'art, and Russia. I give the win to Russian Winter in this case."

0ea3d7f47e9677d6abeff6f39ae0ad88	very critical	The Limit was nothing short of a fantastic book.   Some have criticised it for some errors, and yes as a fan of Formula 1 you can see that there are a few, but this book was written by an outsider of the sport, someone who doesn't have a great interest in it, and that helps capture the story even more. The fact that a non-fan can be captivated by the stories of Phil Hill and von Trips shows how great a story it really was.   The author manages to get through just how dangerous F1 was at the time, you realise just how dark a period the 50's and 60's was in the sport. How death was a constant companion and how most of the drivers faced it each time they stepped into the cockpit of their car. The accidents they would witness such as the one Phil Hill witness in front of his very eyes at le Mans are bought to life in stark reality. You have such a renewed respect for these men that risked their lives just to go fast, in an era were safety and protection was so basic and limited, there may as well have been none what-so-ever. And the fact that these same men witnessed their team mates, friends and rivals die week in and week out and would drive passed the accident time and time again both fascinate and horror the reader.   The fact that the 1961 season ended in such tragedy was not unusual, it was however a shame that a very worthy champion was pushed aside because he was forgotten by the bigger story and he was therefore deemed an unworthy champion by many as he won it on the grounds of his chief rivals death at the last minute.   Despite the errors, the mistakes are few and far between, and one can look passed these, because ultimately, it captures the essence of the sport in a deadly time, where nobody knew from one lap to the next whether them or their friends would make it back to the start finish line without serious injury or not at all. The book is therefore a testament and tribute not only to Phil Hill and von Trips, but also to every driver who raced with death, and especially to those who never made it back around the track.

a5f5cf876c90c943d9717ea01d89c278	neutral	I have read the previous books in the series, and this book did not disappoint. The storyline wraps up a lot of loose ends, leaving Maisie free to grow in new directions. If at times the series has seemed weighed down with the main character's trauma, this book lightens her load, mixing optimism with the melancholy. It was much easier to read than the last couple of books, and it saw a return of the deep point of view and well-chosen sense details that make the character so consuming. The colors are vivid, and the wisdom of the book hit me just at the right time and place, the sort of coincidence that Maisie would tell me to heed!   I can't say a lot more without giving spoilers, but if you are a fan of Maisie Dobbs, this book is worth moving to the top of the reading pile! If you haven't read the other Maisie Dobbs mysteries, go get the first book now - you have quite a journey ahead of you!
2ba18c169fc1c0cca375805e3c8440a1	very critical	"Most fans of classic American literature, especially fans of F. Scott Fitzgerald, know at least a few basic facts about Zelda Sayre, the Alabama beauty who became his wife at the end of World War I. As famous during their lifetime for their high-living lifestyle as for the fiction Fitzgerald produced, the pair considered themselves to be the epitome of the ""Jazz Age."" Whatever else might be said about them, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald were two of a kind, and they and their marriage crashed and burned in relative short order.   Some blame Zelda for what happened to them; some blame Scott. The truth, however, is that both of them enthusiastically embraced the lifestyle that would ultimately be their ruin. Therese Anne Fowler's new book, Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald, uses Zelda's voice and perspective to tell their story. And what a story it is.   The novel opens in Zelda's hometown of Montgomery, Alabama. It is June of 1918 and Zelda is only 26 days from her eighteenth birthday. Beautiful, and part of a wealthy and respected Alabama family, Zelda already has more than her fair share of suitors. But it is Lt. Scott Fitzgerald, a ""Yankee interloper"" stationed at nearby Camp Sheridan, who will win her heart.   Zelda, never having traveled far from home, was stunned by the lifestyle she and Scott assumed immediately following their marriage. But, as Fowler vividly portrays in the novel, that lifestyle would ultimately cost them their health, their sanity, and their very lives. Theirs was definitely not a marriage made in heaven, but for many, it represents the classic Jazz Age marriage.   Therese Anne Fowler breathes new life into the stereotypical image that most have of Zelda Fitzgerald - although, sadly enough, much of the Zelda Fitzgerald stereotype seems to have been true. Zelda, a budding feminist, wanted more out of life than just being the silent, compliant wife that her husband demanded she be. As much of a rebel Fitzgerald was regarding his own behavior, he required his wife to perform her ""wifely duties"" in the most conservative manner possible. Her role, as he saw it, was to support him in his efforts; everything else was secondary. This proved to be the wedge that would ultimately ruin their marriage.   Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald is an eye-opener that will be appreciated by fans of historical fiction as well as by those who more specifically enjoy reading novels about authors and their books."

1c93b669f68750cde9f832f74a8c8b4b	non-critical	"Ever since I saw one of his prints in my art classroom supplies, I've been fascinated with Chuck Close's work. I didn't know a lot about him, just found his abstraction of a face fascinating.   This biography is told in a question and answer format and has a fascinating section in the middle where there are several Close self-portraits that can be mix and matched. I learned about Close's learning and neuromuscular problems. Probably most interesting and ironic to me of his struggles was that this great portrait artist has prosopagnosia, ""face blindness"".   One of his techniques I'd like to try personally or in the art classroom: ""I use photographs as a tool to organize a composition. I enlarge the photograph and, using a pen and ruler, draw a grid over it. The photograph becomes a maquette. I then transfer a pencil version of the grid onto the canvas or paper, keeping it proportional."" (28) Then he lays down color and layers paint to make his portraits.   About problems in art, he says: ""I don't plan in advance. I make my decisions directly on the canvas, in each rectangle. That's where I figure out what colors to add and what shapes to paint. This process allows me to make problems for myself when I am making my art. Sometimes I choose colors that get me in trouble -- perhaps they are too loud or clash with the other colors. Then I have to use my intuition to paint my way out. There is great joy in discovery when making art."" (30)   Most of Close's portraits seem to be large, but made of small pieces -- fingerprints, boxes of colored shapes, pulp paper squares, etc.   ""The bigger the painting, the longer it takes to walk by, and the harder it is to ignore."" (35)   ""'Inspiration' is a word that you hear often. Inspiration is for amateurs. Artists just show up and get to work. Every idea occurs while you are working. If you are sitting around waiting for inspiration, you could sit there forever. I change what I am doing in the studio by changing materials, techniques, scale, size, lines -- not by changing my subject matter. I keep myself engaged in the process of making. I force myself to make decisions, and I stick with them. That is how you find your style."" (36)   I was inspired to learn about Close's return to health and his art work after he was paralyzed.   ""Ease is the enemy of the artist. Go ahead and get yourself into trouble."" (47)"

47eb7f0b20c77342fac85cada5347368	non-critical	This is the 2nd book in the Kate Shackleton Mysteries set in 1920's Yorkshire. Kate's husband is still missing, presumed dead, in WWI. Even though I loved the 1st book I think this one is even better!   When Kate is asked to inform the robbed pawnshops customers of their stolen pledges she travels to the lovely spa town of Harrogate where, by coincidence, she also becomes involved in a murder mystery and is asked to look for the missing daughter of a Boer War hero (who served in the war with the murder victim) and who has received a ransom demand that doesn't quite ring true. Are they connected in any way - if so, how and why?   As Kate tries to find the answers, we are taken from the streets of Harrogate to the battlefields of the Boer War in 1900 and the relationship between Captain Wolfendale and his batman, which I found really informative as I knew very little of that particular conflict.   There is so much going on in this book that it is never boring and speeds along at a pace that's not too slow or too fast. There are so many suspects and so many surprises that I just did not have a clue which way the story was going to go. What more could you want in a mystery?   Kate is a really good judge of people and her observations are usually spot on, she is independent and observant and I really warmed to her, and I loved it when a little romance came into her life!   Highly enjoyable and ideal for cosy mystery readers.   From Carole's Book Corner

It just makes me want to go back and read the first two books in the series!   Bailey is a strong woman, so strong in fact that by living far from town and working her ranch alone, she has everyone thinking ""Bailey"" is a man. Most surprised is the man she has been shooting at in order to keep him from coming to her place to talk in order to gain access through her small piece of land for his cattle to enter his luscious canyon grazing land. Bailey has been using Gage's canyon for her own small, growing herd.   Bailey Wilde is hiding something which has developed an unnatural fear and loathing of men. Gage has his own background problems to deal with. One now involves his mother coming from Texas to visit her only son, her ""little boy,"" and this smothering mother thinks Gage is married. Who can he quickly find to fulfill this wifely role in his life so his mother does not discover he lied about being married to keep her away? Add to those conflicts that someone is trying to harm or kill Gage and besides not knowing who it is, they don't even know why.   Bailey is a woman before her time. She wears britches, works the ranch, and helps birthing animals in distress. She is capable, strong, and really does not need a man, but might she have a better life with a man's love and a family? Can she hold on to working outside which has been the force in her life if she becomes a wife? The answers are found when you read another clever, delightful read by Mary Connealy.

I haven't decided which yet.   Strauss has another hit on her hands with Murder at Feathers & Flair. Well crafted, the book continues to develop the characters and their relationships while presenting an intricate and compelling mystery. The insights into the time period and the social setting she has chosen are enlightening and even educational.   Above and beyond that, however, the novel is just plain entertaining. You can not go wrong with the Ginger Gold mysteries!
0d96038118a36e383a98dbf8fc8b42a9	non-critical	"This is a romance for those who want them steamy and explicit and find kinky (or at least not plain vanilla) sex and orgies to be sexy. There is a LOT of sex in this book, not all of it involving the hero and heroine (see my reference to orgies). The ""hero"" in this story is into throwing orgies. In fact he is known to have the best orgies in London. I am not sure if there is a plain vanilla sex scene in the entire book, and the book is full of sex scenes and sex talk. The heroine is an innocent who rescues children from the bad parts of London and brings them to the foundling home her family runs. The backstory is that the hero and heroine were in love and engaged 10 years before the story starts but that the hero broke off the engagement because he didn't think he would make her a good husband.   They find themselves together on an island they can't leave in a house party where the guests and staff are dying one by one.   I didn't care for this book at all. I prefer more romance than sex and this book was just not my style. I hadn't read any of the earlier books in the series so I didn't know in advance that this was going to be one of the steamier historical romances. However, I know that many women enjoy reading steamier romances and the mystery that goes along with the romance is very interesting as is the hero's past and how that contributed to his kink. Those readers would likely enjoy this book a lot more than I did.   I received this book as a free e-ARC from NetGalley."

617f1511d77b96d9d8983e6a2fdc85e5	very critical	"Hi Ho, the artistic life.   I had very divergent feelings about Just Kids, Patti Smith's National-Book-Award-winning memoir about her friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There were times that I felt moved by the beauty of her writing, and others in which I found her to be nothing more than another spoiled, entitled kid who got where she got to, talented or not, because of connections. It is not that Smith arrived in NYC with a list of names and numbers. But she did have the good fortune to encounter a knight in shining armor who had a prodigous artistic drive and the good looks to attract a series of male gateways to the New York arts scene.   There is no doubt about the deep connection Smith formed with Robert Mapplethorpe, famed photographer to-be. They were not only lovers, but bffs. And that continued long after they stopped sharing a bed.   Smith takes us on a journey through the gritty and some not-so-gritty portions of the New York arts scene, offering glimpses of the many, many people she and Mapplethorpe met. It is a veritable who's who, including bits and pieces on Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sam Shepherd, Andy Warhol, Wiliam Burroughs, and a cast of hundreds. I never got the impression that Smith was name-dropping. She was as amazed as any aspiring artist might be at finding herself among so many notables. One downside to this is that so many shining lights speed by like houses at night as seen from a train. I would have liked it had she gone into a little (or a lot) more detail on more of these luminaries. She certainly does reinforce the image of the Chelsea Hotel as a cauldron of creativity in its day.   The story of her arrival in New York, meeting Mapplethorpe and struggling to get by is worth the price of admission, a real look at what it means to be a starving artist. And that is not just a glib turn-of-phrase, as Patti, at times, made use of the five-finger discount in order to eat. It is also fun to read about how she and Robert trolled discount stores for materials they would use to make jewelry or incorporate into other artistic projects.   Despite the minimal physical mileage traversed here, Just Kids is a bit of a road story. Instead of crossing continents, she and Mapplethorpe cross from obscurity to fame, from outsiders to insiders, from fellow travellers (in a very non-political sense) to lovers to soulmates   I was surprised at a few things. Ok, look at almost any photo of Patti Smith and tell me with a straight face that she doesn't make you think of the Calvin Klein ideal of physical appearance. Yet, when she appeared in a play as a person with drug issues she was completely uncomfortable pretending to shoot up. Even her director was shocked at her lack of hard drug experience. A little weed here and there does not give one that lovely Ginger Baker look. A diet sprinkled with stolen food contributed for sure, but nature sculpted that body, not dark substances. I was also surprised--having come to the book with no familiarity with Smith beyond her recording of ""Because the Night""--about the diversity of her artistry, running from drawing to poetry, to playwrighting, to acting, and so on.   I have read better memoirs, and I do not think this should have won the National Book Award. But there is no missing the real feeling she communicates, the love she and Mapplethorpe had for each other. Her writing is good, sometimes better than good, and you will not be disappointed. But for many, the lifestyles presented here might be discomfiting, the willingness to engage in hustling, thievery, and very open relationships make the artistic world Smith and Mapplethorpe inhabited a decidedly acquired taste."
85d99d2b9e6c18876482e71db0410d25	critical	Forget what you think you know about Wuthering Heights. It is not a love story. It is a novel of violence, nature, class, revenge, and other stark and bitter aspects of humanity. Where some see love the true presence of obsession and greed, and even at times, guilt manifests. I was stunned by how much emotion this book invoked in me: rage, injustice, and irritation chief among them. I relish in a book that makes my heart ache with powerful feeling and this book did exactly that. I found myself detesting and pitying characters until my chest was weighed down with thoughts and perplexities at the situation and plot of the novel. Bronte is a master at blurring the lines and creating characters that will leave scorch marks on your mind and soul forever.
177a778fe94786c4dd7d0f963f25a517	neutral	A fun short story prequel to Rhys Bowen's also fun Lady Georgiana caper/mystery series. Probably most of interest to those who already know the major players.   Audible offered this as a 2014 Halloween free read so I downloaded it. I still did enjoy Rhys Bowen's story, but again really, really hated Katherine Kellgren's narration. Just so over the top. Thank heavens it was free.
d573cc64e7c3a2093be4542ec3cf0e97	very critical	Such a good historical fiction novel. I didn't think anyone would be able to write a completely fictional story about real people. But it happened and it was amazing. It wasn't completely fictional, sorry, just all the added details and whatnot were, but yes, Cleopatra Selene the second did live, and she did become queen of Egypt. I think she was actually the last cleopatra, though I could be wrong. I remember she had two kids, and one was a daughter but I dont think she passed on the family name. I know more about her mother and father Marc Antony than I do her. :(   Anyways, I liked the story a lot. I love reading about Egypt, because duh, pharoahs and mummies! I also enjoyed the romance between her and Juba. I cant wait to see how Dray makes the wedding scene. :)

The author succeeded on so many accounts and I was so in tune with the character that I was just as wide-eyed and depressed and surprised as she was in her year-long reverie...I lived within these pages. Perfectly transported to the late 1930s, the descriptions, the dialogue, the feel of Manhattan, and the most amazing characters, you love and hate them and still envy them the experience. Highly recommended...now I need to go put on some Billie.

I knew next to nothing about her family life and upbringing and definitely did not know that she spent part of her youth out in Prince Albert. This semi-biographical fictional novel was fascinating, fun, and enjoyable. I would highly recommend it if you are a fan of the author or interested in her life.
3a13423a9e7c11c2c83bdf4395ccfe55	very critical	I have mixed feelings on Emperors of the Ice: A True Story of Disaster and Survival in the Antarctic, 1910-13. On the one hand, it is a fictional memoir based on an actual memoir. Much research was done to write this one. Perhaps just as much research as if it was a traditional nonfiction book. The author's love of the subject was evident throughout. The book is told primarily if not exclusively through the eyes of one of the men on the expedition, Apsley Cherry-Garrard. The exception being the few places where readers learn what happened to other members of the expedition. On the other hand, was it absolutely necessary to fictionalize a memoir in order to tell the story? I think there were things to be gained by such a decision, and, perhaps a few things lost.   Aside from the fact that this one doesn't really quite fit in as fiction or nonfiction, Emperors of the Ice was an interesting read. It was not quite as depressing as you might expect. I've read more depressing books on this subject certainly. The focus of this book is more on science and exploration than on the race to be first to the South Pole. This book argues that it was never about being first or being best. This book tells the basic story, but, it includes plenty of details. For example, I learned that one of the teams--science teams--went to the Antarctic to study emperor penguins. Their goal was to learn about the penguins and their eggs. It wasn't exactly learning by observation. Cherry was part of that team. I learned quite a few things.
2de44a7823832fde259ed6d7882b9583	critical	Having made a new year's resolution to myself that I would endeavour to read more historical crime fiction, I was made aware of E. S. Thomson and Beloved Poison by one of my bookselling colleagues, who couldn't recommend it highly enough. Set in the crumbling St Saviour's Infirmary in the 1850's the story centres on Jem Flockhart, an apothecary's daughter who disguises herself as a man to practice her medicinal craft. It is a world of stinking wards, visceral medical procedures, and professional rivalries. As the demolition of the hospital looms, six tiny coffins are discovered, which provide a strong link to Jem's past, and as a series of murders ensue, she finds herself in terrible danger. I thought this was a terrifically bawdy romp, with a host of beautifully named characters that Dickens would be proud of. Thomson's precise and graphic description of the disinterment of bodies from the graveyard attached to the hospital, the medical practices of this time, and the detail of the more natural cures available to apothecaries of the era, were rich and lively in a darkly delicious way, bringing a colour and vivacity to the whole affair. This worked perfectly in tandem with a well plotted and sporadically shocking plot, as Thomson so adroitly immerses us in a tale of murder, sex and jealousy peopled by blundering doctors, whores, sharp tongued servants, and the wonderfully empathetic Jem herself, disguised as a man with the necessary toughness of demeanour, but at the mercy of her finer feelings as a woman. I fair scuttled through this one, with its colourful characters, menacing atmosphere and brilliant period detail. Sordid, rumbustious and totally enjoyable. Highly recommended.
2177c8e6d67331b504906e783ee22d8a	very non-critical	"The early 1970s is a difficult time in American history. The Vietnam War is in full swing, surrounded by patriotic men who sign up to fight this war to save America from the spread of Communism and the protestors who face armed violence but refuse to back down against a war they believe is totally unjust . In the middle of this pitched battle are the wives of four officers undergoing special training in Fort Knox, Kentucky. They represent four types of women throughout America, a Jew, an African-American, a Southern Baptist and a Puerto Rican. They have received a booklet by the name of Mrs. Lieutenant, a book whose contents they are to read and obey without question, rules that determine the success or failure of their husband's officer training program.   It sounds a simple enough plot yet there is so much complexity representative of this actual historical period of bloodshed and strife. Yes, there is the obvious prejudice that depicts the anguish of being a Jew or black person in a white, ""Southern"" mentality Army; but always threading the conscious conformity lie the fears and questions of those who knew that orders to Vietnam meant death or at the least permanent mental anguish from what is seen, heard and done during that time. For instance, what of the custom of ""fragging"" which means the killing of an officer by discontent men who lack respect for their leader? Those who are older might think they know everything about these years and scarring memories, but this novel will open the eyes of many.   What about the tension that mounts to snapping point and winds up in the near-death of a man and the actual death of the one who has flipped? What about a woman who has lost one husband and is now faced with the death of another to this man-eating war that promises disaster no matter how well one is trained? These and so many more questions are addressed in this monumentally simple yet profound account of historical fiction that is replete with too much painful and yet proud reality? Quite a job well-done, right down to the raw emotions, memories, and imagined scenarios for the present and future replete on every page for Vietnam era participants! Read it and reflect on its theme about tomorrow's possibilities!"

I thought they would be dull, which is odd as a historian who loves history more than anything else! But I think I thought it was all Kings and ""great men"" history which I am not interested in. But this was just wonderful! I loved all the women! From Anne to Elizabeth and the old queen Margaret. There were wonderful parts for women in this. The scene I liked the most had the women coming together and bitching about Richard, and ended with Elizabeth telling Richard why after murdering her sons she wasn't quite so keen on the idea of him marrying her daughter. Then there was a wonderful scene full of ghosts at the end!   I'm seeing a Chinese production of this tonight at the Globe, but will definitely have to see an English production as well. Just reading this it turned into my 2nd favourite Shakespeare play and I can't wait to see it performed."

9e5062025c88f920b9b44ae1806ef4de	very critical	"~*Full review on The Bent Bookworm!*~   First of all, look at that gorgeous cover. I could practically reach out and touch the silk of that dress. Also I swear I see blood on the knife, every time I see it out of the corner of my eye. But when I look at it closely, of course there's nothing there. And that, my friends, is why this was my Creepy Cover. Because no matter how many times I look at it...I see that blood (it's probably the combination of the lip color with the knife when I just glance at it...but still). Oh, and inside at many of the chapter beginnings, there are these AWESOME old creepy pictures.   I'm fascinated by unsolved true crime. Yes, I am one of those people. At the same time, I like keeping a semi-safe distance between me and the crime. Hence, Jack the Ripper fits the bill because he's obviously dead by now. Phew. All the same, this book raised the hairs on the back of my neck. While simultaneously causing me to tear up in the final chapter. Like what IS this mix of emotions, even?!?   Audrey is a scientifically minded young woman with a backbone of steel. She is fascinated with the human body and despite the VERY suspicious appearances, studies under her uncle, a professor with an unsettling obsession with the dead (now we call it forensic science). I love the way she flaunts society while at the same time enjoying what fashions suit her own fancy. Of course, this also involves disobeying her extremely protective father, who honestly comes across as rather unhinged after the passing of her mother. She still cares deeply for him, despite her constant frustrations with the limitations forced on her. Audrey's brother, Nathaniel, is another sympathetic character. He deals with the loss of their mother much differently, seeming to have picked up and moved on as a sadder, melancholy person concerned only with his family and holding them together. Her motivation for studying science above and beyond what's considered proper really resonated with me:   It was then that I knew I'd rely on something more tangible than holy spirits. Science never abandoned me the way religion had that night...God no longer held dominion over my soul.   Yessssss. I'll join you in hell, dear sister.   Ahem. Moving on. *insert ""Fight Song"" playing in the background*   Then there is Thomas, the quirky, socially awkward student with the face of an angel and tongue of a viper. He's annoying in an endearing sort of way. Every time I was about to be all, ""Awwwww,"" he would make some other caustic remark that made me want to slap him. Like for real slap, not pretend slap. He gets better and we get inside his crusty exterior more and more as the story goes on, though, and by the end I was feeling very charitable towards him, indeed. In the way one feel charitable to a naughty but adorable puppy.   The hunt for the serial killer (a term not yet coined) Jack the Ripper - first called Leather Apron by the press (look at me, learning things!) keeps the plot moving along briskly. The attention to historical detail in this book is AWESOME, even if there were a few liberties taken that made me roll my eyes. Like at one point Audrey's cousin says women should be able to wear a certain type of clothing to ""go to work."" Um...wealthy women in the 1880s most definitely did not ""go to work."" Just saying. I understand Audrey is something of a revolutionary, but to maintain believability I think a couple things like that should have been edited out. I do love the way she comes into her own through the story, and THAT part is handled exceptionally well.   ""This who deserve respect are given it freely. If one must demand such a thing, he'll never truly command it. I am your daughter, not your horse, sir.""   The creep factor is amazing. At first I thought it was going to be relatively tame (flaying bodies open and lots of blood really don't bother me, ummm...sorry?), but the psychological aspect of it really starting affecting me about a third of the way in and I couldn't put it down at all! I started it in bed one night...and quickly decided to finish the rest in broad daylight. I was by turns fascinated, horrified, and at the last just so very sad. The foreshadowing was incredible - which means it was so skillfully done that I was completing flailing in chapter before the reveal and while I felt completely broadsided, immediately saw the clues I'd missed.   My biggest issue with the book is actually the romance. Thankfully, it's more of a sub-plot, but I think the whole thing would have been better by just hinting at possibilities to come instead of anything actually happening. In the first several chapters it's WAY too distracting and it really seems out of place for Aubrey's character. Contrary to popular opinion, it seems, I think you can have a very successfully told YA story without having any romance at all. Sometimes ""just-friends"" friendships are the strongest ones we have.   Overall, 4 out of 5 stars.   Monsters were supposed to be scary and ugly. They weren't supposed to hide behind friendly smiles and well-trimmed hair. Goodness, twisted as it might be, was not meant to be locked away in an icy heart and anxious exterior. Grief was not supposed to hide guilt of wrongdoing.   Blog | Twitter | Bloglovin | Instagram"
3fa584bd45ab2d13f997bccb1d9780ce	neutral	*2,5 STARS   Well, unpopular opinion coming, but this was my least favorite of the 3 stories in this universe so far. I really like the world of hexes, witches and familiars. I find it interesting and entertaining. The plot was good, the writing was good. My problem here was with the couple itself. While I liked Owen, I found Mal to be a washed out version of Cicero, who I really like. But the actual bad thing was the romance. It just felt forced, there was lust but I just didn't believe they could fall in love. And that affected my reading experience. It could have used a little deeper character developement too. I will, however, continue with the series if there are more books in the future.

6e0faec131d649491708c6dd692f655c	very critical	"I'm not inclined to think of this book as important for the main reason that its audience, and no doubt its author, find it so. I tend to think that bloodlines have very little to do with your history or cultural context, and an African American of the late 20th Century has much more to learn from Aristotle and Thomas Jefferson, a slave-holder, than 18th Century Africans in understanding his culture.   That said, the author thinks otherwise and approached this project compulsively for over a decade, and as I saw someone say on the internet once, ""It's fascinating when people who *really* care about ants, talk about ants."" What an incredible story! It's epic in its reach, tracing the author's family history for over 200 years all the way back to Africa through six generations. Based on a strong family oral history and both a talent and temperament for travel and research, the author is able to uncover his family history in amazing detail with stories corroborated on both sides of the Atlantic. Combined with research on the conditions of slavery in America and a talent for painting a vivid picture of time and place, this comes together and a gripping and amazing story unlike anything else I've read.   I'd recommend this book to everyone. I'm currently watching the 1976(ish?) miniseries and though its first third is enjoyable, it is no substitute for the book. Even if you've experienced this story that way, I still recommend the read."

I think the synopsis of the story is more interesting than the actual telling, but maybe that's just me.

921721ec6e025d2c4eb5bc84d484ad80	very critical	"Cora is a slave on a Georgia cotton plantation with a brutal master. She feels his eyes on her and fears his next move. When another slave tells her about the Underground Railroad, she agrees to his escape plan. They travel to another state, but the slave catcher Ridgeway is on their trail.   Colson Whitehead uses magical realism by writing about a secret railroad located underground in dirt tunnels. He also plays around with the time and location of events, pulling many important events from black history into the places along Cora's escape route. It was a clever and imaginative way to present the types of challenges and the cruel people that an escaped slave would encounter. Some of the horrors depicted, especially early in the book, were so brutal and inhumane that I could only read a few chapters at a time.   The book has a large number of characters since Cora is meeting new people as she moves from state to state. In the beginning of the book we get a good understanding of how Cora is feeling. But between the third person point of view and so many characters, the spotlight was taken off Cora many times as the book progressed. The reader is not inside Cora's head, experiencing the terror she must have been feeling under the circumstances or her emotional reactions to the other characters. Cora's experience was sometimes sacrificed to tell the general African American experience. It may have been the intent of the author to make the racial history the priority.   The story starts with Africans being loaded into slave ships, and ends with some hope as some slaves escape to the north and west. While things are better today, there is still a segment of the population that shows extreme prejudice against people of color. ""The Underground Railroad"" reminds us that African Americans have experienced a horrific history. Colson Whitehead's inventive presentation of that history has nudged people to discuss an important topic."
bcaa14cb18ad3f724602545c4538370d	non-critical	I'm not usually into Stephen King, his books just get too weird for me. 11/22/63, however, surprised me.

2759080f0d0628cc2c14be870a80cb0b	very critical	I'm not a patient enough person to have liked this period book after its midpoint as well as it seems most others have. It is beautifully written, really, but its plodding pace ground me down after the first excellent half. The characters didn't grow or appear to learn much from their errors, so that last bolus of chapters - where I had high hopes for some type of resolution - just deflated for me.   The atmosphere is one of sadness; the kind that Sisyphus-like stories can engender. When in novels we bump into a character that repeatedly and unsuccessfully tries to accomplish something, I can manage that for a certain time period, but my own personality draws me up at a certain point. When more than one character illogically bangs their heads against a collective wall, I disengage. That is what happened here. I do not do collective futility well.   The protagonist is a good guy. A really, really good guy - zero faults, unless we could say that he possesses kindness to a fault. There are two other main characters who are also too perfectly angelic for me to have regarded with much sense of them being real. The villain too was cartoonish, and his loathsomeness sputtered.   On the good side, this felt a little bit like Lonesome Dove with an aging gent and the beautiful countryside being front and center. There was one big surprise before the midpoint that kept me reading on, but in hindsight, I wish I'd given up the ghost and moved on to something with either deeper characters or an intriguing plot. For a much better story set in farmland and with a family facing turmoil try I WILL SEND RAIN by Rae Meadows.   I liked the story and will be on the lookout for more from the debut author who has solid descriptive skills.
d2fa99711b1f31c0c62e0d9ab62c0118	critical	I wanted to read this book the instant I heard about (shortlist for Baileys Women's Prize, I believe), and my hunger for it was justified because now, a week after finishing, I'm contemplating whether I can reread it before it's due (and if I can justify buying it).   Set in 1893, the novel follows Cora Seaborne, a new widow, who has a voraciously hungry intellect and a naturalist's passions. Freed from her cruel husband, she goes to Essex on a friend's suggestion, where she meets William Ransome, the parish vicar. Expecting him to be brutish or comfortably corpulent, she instead finds a mind like her's, hungry for knowledge -- but where she honors science, he honors faith.   The wild stories of the Essex serpent -- blamed for the deaths of livestock and children -- shape the landscape, the people, their experiences. Cora hopes to find it while Will believes it to be imaginary. The serpent allows them, for good and for bad, to ignore the other things swirling around them -- their feelings for each other, the lives and emotions of their friends and family.   This beautiful, rich novel is reminiscent of Possession and all those luminous, muted British films where much is conveyed with the twitch of the mouth or a half-started gesture. And yet, this isn't a subtle novel -- it's about a sea monster! -- and the emotions Perry depicts are huge and messy and impossible to confuse. Her narrative style is almost decadent in its sensory details, but it isn't florid or overwrought. It evokes the era wonderfully without being pastiche.   If it's not obvious, I loved this book, and it will be one of my top ten reads of the year. What else can I say??   Initial Thoughts   Lovely, and emotional. Beautifully written. Wrung me out. I was reminded of Possession, a bit, with a touch of Sarah Waters. More later, when I can write.   Later   Been chewing over this book still, and I think I love it. But something I'm stuck on (and if you've read, help me out!)...   I don't really understand the point of Naomi running away. No one seemed to notice her absence besides her father, and it's not as if he changed greatly for it. Joanna seemed unconcerned, Will didn't seem to know, the schoolteacher didn't care. And as far as I can tell, nothing happened to Naomi while she was gone. And once she returned, she had a slight awkward reunion with Joanna -- a moment that still could have happened by just continuing the growing apart that was established.
83eebafaa4c060dfbef078fb92e966b5	critical	This historical adventure combines a great story and interesting characters. Simon Scarrow manages to make people of two thousand years ago of their time yet timeless enough for the modern reader to engage with.   I especially like the way in which he artlessly combines his own characters with famous and less famous people in Roman history. The legionaries Cato and Macro make a great mirror for their times, enabling the author to introduce historical background with a light and confident touch.

ddd2305ad3b6680ff7a4f7e34ed1eb35	very critical	One dark night in 2003, with $20 cash and eight children in tow, Carolyn Jessop fled for her life. She left behind the only world she knew, a polygamist community located along the Arizona-Utah border, and became the first woman to successfully leave the clutches of the compound with her children. After a frightening, bitter court battle, she also became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a dispute involving the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.   At 18 she was forced to become the sixth wife of 50-year-old Merril Jessop. Uncharacteristically permitted to attend college and work as a teacher outside the home she shared with the other wives, she had to turn her paycheck over to her husband. Withstanding marital rape, she conceived eight children all the while hoping she would gain better treatment for her and her children.   Jessop's memoir portrays females' lives as those lived without basic human rights. They are objectified, treated as property, subject to mind control and perpetually subservient to the patriarchy. Her story is well-written, powerfully poignant and ultimately pertinent given recent news events in Texas.

A good deal of the main characters are of lower social status and some of the secondary characters can be described the scum of the earth!

The authors seemed faithfully honest about Nelson, but did add enough commentary on his day and times and the sea life that he lived to help us understand and not misjudge by today's standards. Well worth reading for history buffs and arm-chair admirals.

Handsome, a bit arrogant, smart and suave.   They had some great chemistry together. There were a few very well written sex scenes too, so this is not a rated G book.   The story line and plot were great, it flowed together very well. Lots and lots of great dialogue throughout the entire book.   I really got a kick out of Rose. She was 5 going on 30 sometimes, giving some LOL moments for sure.   As for the narration, it was great. Susan Duerden has become one of my favorites. She reads with such emotion, whispers, yelling, laughing etc.. if the story calls for it she does it. The men sound like men and everyone get their own distinct voice. Wonderful job SD!

bfab8157d454ec119124cd1eae80fe66	very critical	I lived in South Korea for two years. I taught English at a private academy and spent my weekends traveling around the country visiting Buddhist temples, museums and the many festivals that take place throughout the year. I learned so much about the country's history but the subject I heard the most about was the desire for the unity of the north and south. The DMZ or Demilitarized Zone runs like a scar between the two Koreas. It separates the land into two radically different areas. The south is a mixture of high tech, non-stop, bright light cities and more traditional villages and farms. The north, which I only glimpsed through a set of binoculars, is secretive, isolated and restrictive. Yes, I've watched many documentaries about North Korea and have been fascinated by it, but this book offered a very human and emotional perspective on life within the Hermit Kingdom.   The story is essentially an exploration of survival and human resilience. It forces the reader to question what they would do if left with nothing and how far they would go to overcome such horrible obstacles. It is told through first person narrative by Sungju, a North Korean boy who belonged to a very well off family in Pyongyang. Everything in his life was perfect. He attended the best school, always had enough food and lived in a modern apartment. The country and its politics began to change in the late 1990s and as a result, Sungju and his parents are forcibly exiled to a small village in the north of the country. It's such a radical difference from what he had been used to. There wasn't any food or basic necessities and those who act against the state were publicly executed to frighten others into submission. Many of these aspects of North Korea have been frequently discussed in the media, but reading about it through the eyes of a child was devastating. The confusion and then slow realization of what was happening broke my heart. So much of Sungju's life had been a lie!   While reading it was hard to remember that this book was actually non-fiction, a person's real life story. It reads and flows like a dystopian novel. It has all the essentials: an authoritarian government, censorship, violence, the struggle for survival. Nobody wants to believe that such human cruelty can still exist, but sadly it does and this is why I firmly believe it's a book that young people should read. It's such an eye opener and to see what the author has accomplished...wow!   My only wish was that the ending wasn't so rushed. A large amount of the book focuses on Sungju's membership in a gang of boys who fight their way to survival throughout the country. However, the actual escape from North Korea is written as such a minor aspect of his story. For me, that would be the MAJOR part of the story, what everything led up to. It just ended up being a few pages. It was very emotional though because I was firmly invested in his story from start to finish. I look forward to reading more memoirs from the people of North Korea. It's important to hear their voice and not just the narrative the government would like the world to hear   Originally posted on Rattle the Stars.
1985624fe84d584fae59ed24185afbe5	neutral	I greatly enjoyed Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat & Other Clinical Tales, but this book, simply put, was too dull for me. I don't have an interest in chemistry so that alone should have stopped me from buying the book, but I thought that my interest in Sacks himself, plus the WWII London setting would be more than enough to interest me in this... unfortunately, WWII London serves as little more than a backdrop to a shockingly small portion of the book. And for all of the effort that Sacks put into chemistry as a child, by the ending... well, it shocked me to see the apparent ease with which he abandoned it. I guess I really don't know how I feel about the book... some sections were just very slow moving for me and I didn't really have anything to relate to or a common interest in it. There were a few funny anecdotes, but not really enough. I even toyed with the idea of not finishing it for an hour or so... which is a rarity for me! And in the end, I am glad I finished it, but really, this is a book best suited for science buffs, not history buffs.

e6f20b82b16aad270d758ac0ec1ea265	critical	"""Spies, poison, and curses surround her... Is there anyone she can trust?""   The fourth book in Phillipa Gregory's The Cousins' Wars series, based on the War of the Roses between the Lancastrian and York lines, is told from the viewpoint of Anne Neville, daughter of Richard Neville. Richard Neville, also known as the kingmaker since his military strategy and political know-how helps Edward IV overthrow his cousin Henry VI, will stop at nothing to see one of his daughters on the throne. Edward marries Elizabeth Woodville, a lower ranking noble with ambitions of her own, robbing Neville of the power he once had over the newly crowned king. War is not far off and Neville will stop at nothing to get closer to the crown, killing the queen's kin without trials and marrying his daughters to possible over-throwers of King Edward. Anne and her sister are tossed from winning to losing sides many times and readers will wonder what shall happen to Anne, unless of course they've read the other books in the series.   Though Anne Neville hasn't the distinctive personality of Margaret Beaufort from Gregory's second book in the series, The Red Queen, Anne's story is a page-turner until the very end. The wild ride from one war to another, from one marriage to the next keeps the reader wanting more, desperate to discover what will happen next even though they know what eventually happens to Anne (if they've read the other books in the series). Gregory brings the real history of the War of the Rose to life through Anne's complex relationship with key players in this real-life game of thrones. For example, Margaret of Anjou who murdered Anne's grandfather and became the source of her childhood nightmares, eventually becomes a mentor of sorts to the young Anne. It's amazing how Gregory can take a villain from one book and authentically paint her as the heroine of her own story. The Kingmaker's Daughter is a must read for royal fiction fans and the best yet in The Cousins' War series. 5/5 Stars   Author: Phillipa Gregory   Genre: Adult Historical Fiction   Publication Date: July 14, 2012   Source: Purchased by Reviewer   Review Written by Andrea Cefalo, author of The Fairytale Keeper series and chief editor of Obelisk Review"
97d6a6da70495c6ecf8f8aee91d804b9	neutral	Como muchas veces, en la obra de Vargas Llosa (ensayos y novelas) se funde su vision periferica y lucida del contexto mundial y su propia y personal forma de delimitarlo, pasional y suya; algo que en mi opinion enriquece el libro. Leo resenas que alaban o critican algunas de las polemicas posturas que se deslizan a lo largo de su analisis, a veces estoy de acuerdo parcialmente con unas y otras, pero descubro que nadie percibe algo que esta alli, soportando todo ese despliegue de erudicion: el estilo literario. Quienes amamos la buena literatura, no podemos menos que agradecer que se escriban libros con esa vehemencia lirica, al margen de si todos estan o no de acuerdo con las innecesarias conclusiones que pueden desprenderse. Personalmente, comparto gran parte de las opiniones que vierte, pero asi fuera al reves, no puedo dejar de apreciar la musica que estiliza maravillosamente un sincero ejercicio de reflexion ejecutado por uno de los grandes intelectuales del planeta, algo que a los peruanos nos llega de orgullo.
61adc33d680109701d2bfcfae0a9bac1	neutral	An era of opulence and intrigue? A badass and powerful princess? People with names like Cosimo and Troilo? Um, count me in!   I love books about cool women, and Isabella de' Medici was definitely a cool woman. Born to the most powerful family in Renaissance Italy, Isabella did what she wanted and didn't give a rat's behind about what anybody thought about her. Can I get a hell yeah?   So basically Isabella was raised among her brothers and was well educated and extremely intelligent. She married a (pretty stupid) prince and basically spent most of her time away from him because A.) She didn't like him. and B.) She hated where he lived. That wasn't a normal or an acceptable thing for a woman for her to do in her time, but did she care? Nope. Then she took a lover and had kids (who her kid's fathers were, we don't really know) and raised them to be totally cool too. And then her husband murdered her because he was resentful. That's a really short and poorly written summary of her life. Pretty amazing right?   I'm now of the opinion that this girl needs her own movie. I mean I would totally watch that. The only complaint I have about this book is that it focused a little bit too much on her family rather than just Isabella. Her family was crazy and interesting, but she's interesting enough by herself.   But anyway, great biography of an amazing woman. Bravo! (Brava? Bravissimo? I don't know, I'm American.)   4/5 stars

7da50ce3e89b97bbb67bebc31af026a2	very critical	"Take my five stars with a pinch of salt--I give way too many five-star reviews.   What I liked about this book was its sensible and stirring account of human nature. Ferguson cuts across many of the old debates--nature vs. nurture; progress vs. decline--by arguing that human nature is a potential. Roused to assert themselves, human beings are capable of valour, grandeur, struggle and success. Doused in the cold water of slavery, human beings are capable of pettiness, weakness, resentment and servility. He considers human beings in all kinds of settings, from what he chooses to call ""savage"" (or we might call ""nomadic"") society to what he calls ""polished"" or ""commercial"" society. In all these settings, he tries to consider how different forms of government, economics or culture might affect our innate individual power of freedom and glory. He is faithful that even in the most corrupt, slavish or destitute nations, the fire of human passion can never be finally extinguished.   Ferguson is a fine writer, and I mean it when I say the book is stirring:   Man may mistake the objects of his pursuit; he may misapply his industry, and misplace his improvements. If under a sense of such possible errors, he would find a standard by which to judge of his own proceedings, and arrive at the best state of his nature, he cannot find it perhaps in the practice of any individual, or of any nation whatever; not even in the sense of the majority, or the prevailing opinion of his kind. He must look for it in the best conceptions of his understanding, in the best movements of his heart; he must thence discover what is the perfection and happiness of which he is capable. He will find, on the scrutiny, that the proper state of his nature, taken in this sense, is not a condition from which mankind are for ever removed, but one to which they may now attain; not prior to the exercise of their faculties, but procured by their just application.   Readers of Hannah Arendt will find much that is familiar in this book--as one other Goodreads reviewer has noted. Here Ferguson asks us to live towards birth, as Arendt would put it, to look into ourselves and find a potential, a possibility for something new.   Ferguson's assessments of the various threats to our individual freedom remain insightful today. The division of labour, he claims, compartmentalises people, reducing them to a task. Economic inequality endangers a democratic order, by erecting differences between people and destroying their solidarity. Rulers who desire to hang on to power cling to it at the expense of their subjects, reducing them to a slavish condition. The pursuit of peace and prosperity creates deathly bureaucracies, turning the struggle for life into forms and files. Imperialism degrades both the conquered and the conquerer, turning the losers into slaves and the victors into slavedrivers. Mankind flourishes in adversity. We face adversity best as a free league of fellow citizens.   There are of course limitations to Ferguson, but they are quaint and adorable. He was himself a soldier--so he sees martial valour as the paradigm of all valour. He was classically learned--so he sees Roman citizenship as the paradigm of all citizenship. He was a manly man--so humans are always ""he."" He was writing in the 1760s--so his knowledge of the cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas is often faulty (though it is far better than you might expect, and he factors his own ignorance humbly and cleverly into his arguments). None of these things really detract from his arguments, however, because he was in no way a bigot, and his ideas are easily extensible to any liberation movement."

e58541211fd0b4e3f489e505ceac9f2c	very critical	"""All you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation...You have no respect for anything. You drink yourselves to death.""--Gertrude Stein   Hemingway credits Gertrude Stein with naming their generation. They were the ones who came of age during the first World War, the Great War. And what was lost was a sense of direction, of being able to draw on the past for identity and guidance.   For American writers, this included a world of decadence, of the frivolous lifestyles of the very rich such as The Great Gatsby, but also the loss of innocence, the fiction that the American Dream was within everyone's reach. For countries like England, it meant a generation literally lost, with over two million women more than men under age 45.   These are the themes of By the Hands of Men, Book Three: The Wrath of a Righteous Man, Roy M. Griffis' epic World War I series, which sends lead characters Robert Fitzgerald and Charlotte Braninov on a search for connections to their pasts and their futures in a post-war world which has obliterated both.   This has become one of my favorite historical fiction series ever, but it is not a series where each book stands alone. If you haven't had a chance to read the first two volumes, I urge you to do so, because the threads connecting them are carefully gathered and woven in. For example, in my previous review, I complained about a vignette in Book Two describing Charlotte's interaction with a Jewish pawnbroker that I thought was only there to make a statement about aristocratic anti-semitism. In a similar way, as I was reading Robert's various adventures in Shanghai and Africa, my first thought was that these were just padding to show what the rest of the world was like. I could not have been more wrong. Both threads play a critical role in this next volume.   In The Wrath of a Righteous Man, the Great War is over. Robert, recovered from typhoid, has left Shanghai, and is now bound for Africa. Charlotte escaped the the nightmare of death and torture that is the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and--along with her few remaining friends--is on a boat bound for England. But she can't allow herself to believe that the sailors around them have any genuine humanity, even when they take up collections to provide clothing and gifts for the tattered refugees. [Quote]""It was almost enough to make the nurse believe in the possibility of the goodness of men. Almost.""[End Quote]   Instead, she puts her faith in the guns she hides under her dress, and makes almost a religious ceremony of cleaning them.   [Quote]""Oddly, the thought of cleaning the pistols filled her with a joyous anticipation. And why not, she reasoned. They had saved her life and the lives of her companions. They gave her a kind of control over her existence which the Reds had conspired to take from her. No one would ever take that from her again.""[End quote]   Back in England, Charlotte struggles to take care of her friends and connect with the people around her. But as fate sends her in search of the Jewish pawnbroker, Kamensky, she must travel to Paris. Despite leaving war and revolution behind, Charlotte imagines that she smells death and decay in the air everywhere she goes.   [Quote]""Shoving her face into the opening, she inhaled deeply, and amid the scents of water and sewage and smoke, there was still the sickliness of decay. And why not? Millions, literal millions had perished in the Great War, many of them on this very soil. The cold, impersonal mechanism had done its mindless work, and beneath the mud, beneath the streets, the dad lay, mute testament to the blind machinery of the World.""[End Quote]   As Charlotte struggles to connect to the present, she slowly validates her affection and love for the people around her but at a cost: she must first release her ties to the people and memories that have gone before, including her memories of falling in love with Robert.   Meanwhile Robert has gone to Africa, where similar disillusionment awaits. He's horrified to see the evidence of torture and death, the numbers of Africans with hands chopped off--standard punishment under the rule of King Leopold of Belgium. Robert, who saw his time in the trenches as supporting the ""gallant"" Belgians, is sickened by this further evidence that his war might not have been all that just. He's sent from the Congo into Nigeria, where he serves with and comes to admire a former Boer soldier--and also learns first-hand about the atrocities on both sides of that war.   When his friend is killed by a sect of murderous religious zealots and slavers, Robert realizes that honor demands he take command of the native troops and fight their way through to punish the atrocities committed. After gruelling battles and losses, he finally succeeds in his campaign, capturing the leader of the slavers. But the final blow to Robert's picture of himself as a soldier and an honorable man comes when British authorities release his captive because he is ""useful"" to them.   Robert takes shelter with friends of his fallen Boer comrade, and spends the next four years recovering.   [Quote]""What can you do?"" Uys asked him.   I can kill men, Robert thought. I can tie a cravat. I can pick a wine for dinner. ""I can ride a horse,"" he finally said.[End Quote]   In both Charlotte and Robert's cases, their recovery of the ability to trust and even love is tied up with their relationship with animals. Charlotte and her friends have rescued a beautiful golden eagle and brought it with them from Russia. Robert works on a farm, first acquiring pets and then actively studying to become a veterinarian.   But other new forces again interfere. The fantastically wealthy American newspaper baron, Randolph Hearst and his moviestar mistress, Marion Davies, come on safari and engage Robert's veterinary services. He's stunned to see their camp, ""...something out of the Arabian Nights"", complete with generators, and guests donning formal dress for dinner.   The book ends on a pair of cliffhangers, as both Charlotte and Robert--still mourning their lost love--are faced with dangers from their past and both are forced to again move on.   I simply can't say enough good things about this book. It's a read for the long haul, with steady pacing, characters whose spirits are torn apart and slowly, painfully rebuilt, plus a supporting cast of three-dimensional characters who breath life and color into the tapestry. And there is the story itself, which is nothing more than an epic picture of a world between wars, as experienced on human scale through the two protagonists. The bare bones I've told here don't begin to convey the wealth of detail and adventure that are woven into the twin stories of Robert and Charlotte, of what the war has cost, and of what they've each gained.   It's an incredible achievement and my only complaint this time is that I want to know what happens next. I'm rooting for Robert and Charlotte, and my fingers are crossed that after all they've been through, the next and final book will bring resolution.   *I received this book for free from the publisher or author in exchange for an honest review.

b8afee3971e96c8c21f514be1bd1bce0	neutral	Hmm...I'm not sure if I'll continue with this series or not. It ends where I'd been dreading it might end (with Claire apparently pregnant ) and I so do not care about that kind of story line at all going forward. It's just the least interesting thing possible to me.   I really liked Jamie and found him charming and sympathetic. He spends the whole book getting hurt to greater or lesser degrees, but it's still a surprise when he's horribly brutalized and raped toward the end. Claire's methods for dealing with Jamie's emotional trauma seem foolhardy and dangerous if you imagine them applied to a real person's situation, but of course it all works out fine in the book, just like everything Claire does.   Claire. She's not my favorite, and I'm having a hard time pinpointing why. I expected to love her because I was so taken with the TV version, but TV Claire is definitely better. For instance, while exploring a ruined castle, TV Claire pulls up her skirt and reveals that she's not wearing any undergarments and invites her husband Frank to go down on her. Which he does. Book Claire, on the other hand, tries to discourage Jamie from doing the same because it's dirty. WTF Book Claire? She goes on to be fairly sex positive for the rest of the book, but that attitude coming from a character who's otherwise presented as strong and feminist just really bothered me.   The sex scenes are mostly terrible, fwiw. At several points throughout the book I winced in sympathetic pain, though Claire seemed to like what was going on all right. I dunno. I don't think this is a series anyone reads for the sex anyway.   Anyway, there are a lot of other things I want to read before I read a Claire pregnancy/baby story line, so if I do continue with the Outlander series, it won't be anytime soon. It was fine. I didn't hate it. Jamie is awesome. Claire is...not as awesome.

I understand where the author was headed with it because I could see it coming but I still think we could've picked up the pace just a tad. The ending was phenomenal. I felt like Klassen really outdid herself with it and it really did make up for the slow pace.

Un po' di silenzioooooooooooooo   Ok, ho provato a farmi un altro giro e finalmente dei volti acquistano una fisionomia piu precisa, si ripresentano, si fanno riconoscere. Finalmente!   E cosi mi sono ritrovata a seguire il poeta gringoire che seguiva esmeralda ed eccomi alla Corte dei miracoli.   Ora si che la storia inizia ad avere un senso! Non vedo l'ora di continuarla!   Parti III-V   La storia si ferma. Per una curiosa come me che avrebbe voluto sapere lo sviluppo dei fatti (anche un minimo, insomma un pochettino...) non si sa piu nulla di che succeda a esmeralda, gringoire, quasimodo e frollo. C'e un tuffo nel passato di Frollo e di come la sua vita l'abbia portato a incontrare Quasimodo e a prendersi cura di lui.   Dalle prime descrizioni che si hanno in questa parte di Frollo, ero portata a credere che si trattasse di un personaggio positivo (la cura che ha del fratello, poi del trovatello storpio) e poi scopro che non e affatto cosi. E' un personaggio indurito, forse dai suoi studi, forse dalla fede, o dalla sua vita tutta... non e un tipo amabile, insomma, men che meno con le persone che ""dovrebbe"" amare: suo fratello e il piccolo gobbo.   Cominciamo a vedere Quasimodo, la descrizione e perfetta sia esteriormente che nel suo ""operare"" all'interno della cattedrale, anzi e quasi commovente quanto ami la sua chiesa e il suo benefattore...   La terza parte, quella descrittiva di Parigi, purtroppo mi ha annoiata a morte e per quanto io adori Parigi in tutto e per tutto, non sono riuscita ad appassionarmi al racconto di questa parte ma quasi ad addormentarmi. L'ho letto sorvolando velocemente. Sono pero contenta di una cosa: che Hugo separi completamente le due parti, il racconto dalla descrizione, cosi pur sorvolando non corro il rischio di perdermi qualche accadimento particolare!!!   E mi sorprendo davvero tanto del fatto che riesca ad annoiarmi morbosamente nelle sue descrizioni dei luoghi e a incatenarmi magicamente nelle sue descrizioni dei personaggi!   Il capitolo sull'architettura per me e geniale, bellissimo, inimitabile. E mi ha riportato subito sulle note di ""Questo e il tempo delle cattedrali la pietra si fa statua musica e poesia...""   Stupendo.   Cap. VI-VII   Riprendiamo la storia.   Esmeralda e il centro.   Quasimodo se ne innamora per la sua generosita.   Claude Frollo la desidera ma si sente in colpa per quel desiderio e cerca di averla e allontanarla.   Phoebus e un farfallone, si augura di passare una notte con lei come con qualsiasi altra bella donna, ma che sia o meno Esmeralda non gli fa gran differenza.   Esmeralda si innamora di Phoebus.   Non sembra che la storia proceda di chissa quante ore, ma scopriamo tantissime cose. E capiamo che molto probabilmente Esmeralda e la figlia della reclusa ... lo pensate anche voi, vero??Immagino che quel sacchettino che porta appeso al collo contenga una scarpina.   Ok andiamo avanti.   Parti VIII-IX   Finalmente Quasimodo ha un ruolo un po' piu preponderante in questa parte: si storpia sempre il titolo di questo romanzo in ""il gobbo di notre dame"" e poi lui appare cosi raramente...   Certo e che quando appre buca la scena.   Il salvataggio di Esmeralda e il suo ripetuto urlo ""ASILO!"" erano proprio visibili, palpabili... mi sembrava di guardare la scena di un film e non di star leggendo un libro.   Esmeralda ha 15 anni. E si comporta da quindicenne: ama l'apparenza, crede che il principe azzurro sia quello bello, e egoista perche gli adolescenti sono egoisti... non sa ancora distinguere il giusto dallo sbagliato.   Phoebus e un cretino della peggior specie e proprio non si sopporta: e lui il vero ""cattivo"" della storia. E' lui che illude, lui che non capisce, che agisce con superficialita, e un idiota. Punto. Non lo salvo.   Frollo ha acquistato le tonalita dello psicopatico stupratore: mi sa che molti film tv degli ultimi anni potrebbero basare i loro serial killers tranquillamente su di lui. Fa paura. Ma almeno non crea false aspettative.   Esmeralda capisce solo cio che vede:   la violenza di frollo   la bruttezza di quasimodo   la bellezza di phoebus.   Non riesce ad andare oltre.   Parti X-XI   E' gia finito. E' stata una bella esperienza leggere il libro con questo gruppo, non mi e pesato neanche per un attimo e mi sembra di aver letto un racconto anziche un romanzo... e volato via leggermente e mi ha lasciato un bel ricordo.   Il finale e dei piu tragici: cavolo muoiono tutti! ma ciononostante mi ha dato l'aria di un happy ending.   Come se la morte venisse dopo e fosse ininfluente al racconto: lui era gia finito prima, nella ribellione di quasimodo a frollo, nell'incontro di mamma e figlia nella buca dei topi, nei vari discorsi di gringoire...   In quest'ultima parte mi ha un po' dato fastidio capire come funzionasse la giustizia a quei tempi (perche ora, ...): non contavano i fatti ma solo cio che si voleva vedere e sapere. Solo la via piu veloce. E impiccare era quasi sempre la scelta giusta e che faceva felice il popolo (al popolo piace vedere ste scene).   E comunque confermo:   Frollo e uno psicopatico   Phoebus e un farfallone idiota   Esmeralda una quindicenne illusa   Quasimodo, poverino, e il migliore ma nessuno ""vede"" in questo romanzo.   Complimenti a Hugo per questi perosnaggi!   Chi vuole cimentarsi nei Miserabili con me??? Ora e il momento giusto!!!!"

It would have inspired some self confidence in me! I hope my nieces will read this as they're growing up, to help them realize that it's okay to be fannish or quirky or weird.

82388c05228ec49d18cce81e33e4dc63	very non-critical	I have wondered about David Good's life ever since I read his father's memoir, Into the Heart: One Man's Pursuit of Love and Knowledge Among the Yanomami. David is the son of an American anthropologist and a Yanomami tribal woman. When David was five, his mother left the family to go back to her tribe in the Amazon. For many years I wondered: how were David and his siblings? And how was Yarima, his mother? Now, with David's memoir, I have some answers. A fascinating cross-cultural book.

1d5c7ed337750c83c5a01d792e09b5af	neutral	Good story. Though I am no expert, the book certainly had the feel of 1700's England, at least to me. As far as being a thriller, however, it fell well short of being a so-good-you-can't-put-it-down read. That said, it was still very enjoyable and entertaining and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves British historical fiction. I hadn't read any of the previous stories featuring Benjamin Weaver, but am definitely going to put them on my to-read list.

The author, Dan, having recently lost a dog, decided to bring Gracie home instead of letting the breeder euthanize her. This is her story.   I really enjoyed this. As with most animal stories, there were laughs and tears.
bc230afcca0e543598c47cdc278c1475	neutral	A wonder read. At times the rambling prose felt more like I had picked up Steinhem's personal journal than published book, but what a journal to have the honor of reading! She writes about gatherings big and small, people both known and unknown with the same sense of reference and love of the stories she learned in their presence. I have a feeling this is a book I will be going back to again and again. So many stories here that I found myself wanting to hold onto. An amazing life lived. I'm glad she has shared it with us.
dea214e8b2b2ff22e8f26636278f014b	very critical	When the publisher sent me a copy of this book to review I was immediately drawn to the absolutely beautiful front cover. It immediately gives the reader a bit of a clue as to how wonderfully full of life and colour the actual story is going to be.   The book opens with a young Eliza watching the Viceroy's procession take place in Delhi. Her father who is accompanying the Viceroy in the procession has promised Eliza that he will stop his elephant and wave at her. However, Eliza's world is turned upside down by a terrorist attack.   Fast forward 18 years later and Eliza is back in India, this time as a young widowed photojournalist who has been assigned, by the British government to record what life is like in India. She's to spend a year at a palace photographing every day life both inside and outside the palace at Rajputana. There she meets the royalty who reside there and becomes firm friends with Prince Jayant who is so different to his brother Anish. Jay, like Eliza is horrified by the terrible poverty of some of India's people contrasted with the lifestyles of the very rich. He is forward thinking and wants some of the old traditions stopped. Traditions such as widow burning. He also wants to help his people out of poverty but feels helpless to do so. The friendship between Eliza and Jay gradually grows but given their very different backgrounds, can it ever come to anything? Meanwhile, while living among its people, Eliza soon realises that the India she thought she knew and loved is being stripped apart bit by bit by British rule and the terrible treatment and suffering of the Indian people by the British government shocks her. She feels a desperate need to do something and she and Jay are united in their desire to help make the lives of the poor so much better.   This book simply took my breath away with its beautiful writing. The descriptions of India simply swept me into a world of strange sights, smells and traditions of a people who are fiercely proud and passionate. I love that despite the era, Eliza is a woman who refuses to be confined by what is expected of her simply because she is a woman. Two cultures, each with its own traditions and rules clash but are more alike that anyone even realises. One's place in society dictating life choices and behaviour. Duty is everything and love, passion and ambition must always take a back seat. And, like every good book it has a wide range of characters for the reader to both love and hate and remind our central characters of what is expected of them. There is always someone lurking in the shadowy hallways and passages of the castle.   Dinah Jefferies has written a wonderful historical novel and she has quite clearly done her homework around this period of British rule in India. Like Eliza, I felt myself get lost in the culture and the beauty of India and equally become horrified by the poverty and superstition that accompanied some of the old traditions. Before The Rains is an breath-taking novel that I would highly recommend. A fantastic story line that had me hooked. Historical fiction is a genre that I am still getting to grips with and I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to read this book as it has simply made me want to read more of this genre.
