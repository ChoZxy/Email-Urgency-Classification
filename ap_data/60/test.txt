78	3	President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies have created a climate of “fear” in the Hispanic community, said Greenville businessman Ricardo Parra.  On Thursday, Parra joined restaurateurs and shop owners across the country who shut down their businesses for a day in a coordinated protest.  “The government is acting against the immigrant community,” said Parra, who has owned La Esperanza Bakery since 2010.  “We feel like we don’t belong to this country,” added Parra, who employs 14 workers. “We want to show that we are part of the community.”  More than 60 businesses in Greenville’s growing Hispanic community participated in the nationwide strike/boycott known as “A Day Without Immigrants,” according to activists.  In addition, one-third of the Hispanic children in Greenville County elementary schools didn’t show up for classes on Thursday, according to district spokeswoman Beth Brotherton. Figures were unavailable for middle and high schools on Thursday.  Michael Parrish, a music teacher at Alexander Elementary School near White Horse Road, said a large number of Hispanic students had chosen not to attend school on Thursday.  “I missed my students and I can’t imagine my school without these students,” Parrish said. “These Hispanic students bring a lot of diversity and culture to our school.”  “A Day Without Immigrants” encouraged Hispanics and other immigrants and supporters not to work, open their businesses, buy things, go out to eat, buy gas or go to school.  The movement, organized largely through social media, is designed to show what America would be like without immigrants. It was also intended to protest Trump’s immigration agenda, which includes a pledge to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.  In addition, activists said they’re alarmed by raids across the nation last week that according to USA Today resulted in about 680 arrests, .  “It’s definitely generated fear,” Parra said.  U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, however, said the real problem is illegal immigration.  “What we really need to see in our country is a day (or a year) without illegal immigration,” Duncan said in a statement by email. “That would help shore up our health care and educational systems and relieve the burdens that hardworking American taxpayers are paying every day. It would also help make our country safer again from the threat of radical terrorists who can now enter through our southern border as they please.”  On the campaign trail last year, Trump said illegal immigration costs the country $113 billion a year, a claim which the Pulitizer prize-winning fact-checking organization PolitiFact rated as "Mostly False."  Duncan, a Republican congressmen, said last week’s raids were directed toward people with “extensive criminal backgrounds.”  “That’s why I support the actions of the president in restarting the building of the border fence and cracking down on illegal immigrants, particularly those with extensive criminal backgrounds which were the focus of last week’s successful ICE raids — raids that also occurred during the Obama Administration,” Duncan said.  A ‘lonely’ street  Many of the Hispanic businesses that closed Thursday are located along White Horse Road.  “The street looks kind of lonely,” Parra said as he surveyed the closed shops.  Outside Compare Foods on Blue Ridge Drive, a Pepsi worker, arriving to make a delivery, was trying to figure out why the grocery store had shut down for the day.  A sign in Spanish in the window announced that the store was closed “in support of the Latino community.”  Across the street, the closed-for-the-day Supermercado El Rey displayed a similar sign in the window.  The expansive parking lot of the normally bustling La Unica Supercenter on White Horse Road was barren on Thursday.  Dozens of other businesses in the community were closed during posted business hours.  PASOs, an agency that helps to connect Hispanics with health care and education services, was open and operating Thursday, but state executive director Julie Smithwick said, “We absolutely support anyone who chose to participate” in “A Day Without Immigrants.”  She echoed Parra in saying that Trump’s immigration policies had created deep anxiety in the immigrant community.  “There is highly increased feeling of fear and uncertainty,” Smithwick said. “It is all over the state and it’s affecting families that we work with on a daily basis. We’ve been hearing from a lot of families who are even afraid to go to a doctor appointment. People are staying home more than ever and they’re fearful.”  Anti-immigration rhetoric in last year’s presidential election has contributed to violence against immigrants, Smithwick said.  “Some people feel emboldened to engage in discrimination and bullying,” Smithwick said. “We’ve seen reports of bullying increasing at school. It feels like we’re trying to hold back a dam with a finger because the fear is rampant.”  There were more than 235,000 Hispanics living in South Carolina in 2010, according to the U.S. Census, an increase of 148 percent over the previous decade.  Some of the area's biggest employer saw no effect from the protest.  Representatives of hospital systems in Greenville and Spartanburg said “A Day Without Immigrants” had not increased absences among employees beyond usual daily levels.  Rogelio Montez, owner of the El Arriero restaurant on North Main Street in Anderson, said he considered closing Thursday, but decided against it because so few of his customers would have any idea why the business was closed on a non-holiday.  “Most of our customers don’t know anything about it,” he said of the closings. “We didn’t want customers to come and find the door closed, and not know why.”  Greenville County Councilman Joe Dill said protesters misunderstand Trump’s goals.  “I think what we’ve got here is a huge miscommunication among people,” Dill said. “Who are they (protesters) defending? I appreciate a government that will try to protect me from anyone who is here to harm me.”  U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy said people have the right to strike but praised those who choose not to protest.  “People have the right and freedom to express their thoughts and perspectives in a variety of ways,” Gowdy said in a statement by email. “I am grateful to the women and men who have defended and continue to defend these rights and freedoms. It is one of the many reasons so many people seek to come to the United States in the first place. I am glad, however, that the law enforcement officers who thought President Obama was wrong on law and order and constitutional issues did not decide to take a day off to protest.”  Adela Mendoza, executive director of the Hispanic Alliance of South Carolina, said her agency supported “A Day Without Immigrants” by working with “DREAMers” — Hispanic students who arrived in the U.S. at a young age and who have lived here for many years.
290	3	A 300-mile march across New Jersey in support of driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants made its way on Monday afternoon to Newark, where advocates chanted "licenses yes, promises no" as they made their way through the city's streets.  "The immigrant community in New Jersey deserves to drive without fear,'' Catalina Santiago shouted into a bullhorn as she and about 10 others walked on Springfield Avenue toward Irvington and their final destination for the day, Maplewood. "They need to have the safety of knowing that cops will not stop them, and that they will not pile numerous amount of tickets for not having the access to driver's licenses, and to know they can take their children to a hospital or a clinic."  Some of the marchers will walk the entire 300 miles over 11 days. The walk was organized by Movimiento Cosecha, a national coalition with members in various states who have organized sit-ins and marches on behalf of undocumented immigrants.  The walk, which began on Friday in New Brunswick, is scheduled to end with a rally in Trenton on June 11. Marchers walk 9 to 10 miles each day in areas with large immigrant populations. At night they either go home or stay with supporters, resuming the walk the next day in a different location. On Tuesday, the marchers will make their way to the cities of Passaic and Paterson.   "We are going through immigrant-heavy areas and hoping that people will join us,'' said Carlos Rojas Rodriguez, a community organizer. "We know we are going to get licenses when people are more active."   More: Young N.J. activists back 'Day Without Immigrants' boycott  More: Advocates embark on 300-mile NJ walk supporting licenses for undocumented immigrants  The journey hasn't always been easy. Marchers said they often are greeted with support, from onlookers who raise their arms in solidarity and from drivers who honk their horns, but they have also encountered open hostility. Someone threw a bucket of water at one of the marchers over the weekend. The participants chose not to dwell on those parts of the experience.   "At the end of the day, they are the minority,'' said Santiago, who is from Florida and is working on the driver's license campaign in New Jersey.   Many people who have stopped them don't know that New Jersey driver's licenses aren't available to immigrants without legal status, she said.  A proposal for licenses  A bill, the New Jersey Safe and Responsible Driver Act, was reintroduced this year by Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, D-Union. It would extend driving privileges to people who are living in the country illegally, as well as to the homeless, veterans and other populations that may have trouble meeting the requirements of the state Motor Vehicle Commission's Six-Point ID verification program to obtain a New Jersey driver’s license.    Quijano said last month that the bill is being updated to address concerns that have been raised about residency requirements and the potential for fraud. One goal, she said, is to avoid lapses that have led some states, such as Maryland, to issue licenses to undocumented people who do not actually live there.  Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said he would support such a measure, Last month, he said the legislation is moving along.  Critics of extending driving privileges to those in the country illegally say it rewards lawbreakers and leads to fraud and security concerns.  Proponents of the bill say it will make New Jersey's roads safer by requiring newly licensed drivers to be tested, trained and insured, and that it would help the state’s economy because the number of customers who could purchase automobiles and car insurance would grow.   One of the marchers, Andres Rojas, 44, said he appreciates the support from strangers he has encountered along the way. Rojas, who came from Mexico in 1994 and now lives in New Brunswick, said he relies on his son, a U.S. citizen, to drive him to work and the grocery store, and that he would prefer to have a license of his own.   "They give us hope,'' he said. "It's time we got licenses."   Keyon Hall, 40, who was waiting for a bus at the corner of Springfield Avenue and Jones Street, said he thinks driver's licenses should be given to immigrants without legal status. Hall, a U.S. citizen who lives in Irvington, said his family came to the United States from Jamaica decades ago.   "People come to this country to work,'' Hall said. "If they are coming here to work to better their lives, they need better jobs with better pay, and those jobs sometimes require them to drive and have a license."
172	3	Wearing red in solidarity and waving provocative signs, protesters gathered in downtown Houston mid-day Monday for the first of two gatherings aiming to show support for workers and immigrants.   The first gathering, starting at 11:30 a.m. at Sesquicentennial Park, drew police as the crowd snaked through the streets to City Hall to "show the Trumps of the world what real power looks like," according to the event's Facebook page.   "Rights are not given," the post notes. "They are won."  MUTUAL FIGHT: Texas police chiefs band together against 'sanctuary cities' bill  A second May Day rally - organized by Houston Socialist Movement, Latino Inmigrantes Triunfadores and a slew of other protest groups - is slated for 5:30 p.m. at Guadalupe Plaza.   "This rally will be different from other May Day events in Houston," organizers promised in a press release.  "This rally is being organized by workers independently of the Democrats and Republicans, and no elected officials or politicians will be on the platform. Participants will also voice fundamental criticism of the entire political system and capitalism in general."  CAPITOL RALLY: Protesters stage sit-in at governor's office in Austin  The evening rally-goers will demand an end to deportations, a $15 minimum wage, union rights and an end to capitalism. Story continues below       May Day, which is also known as International Workers' Day, has sparked nationwide protests in the past - and this year is no exception.   Even as Houstonians gathered in solidarity, crowds came together - sometimes clashing with police and sparking violence - in cities from Istanbul to Paris to Washington DC.

234	2	GREENFIELD — Greenfield residents recently received some unexpected mail.  Postcards distributed to mailboxes throughout town show, on one side, a green sign that reads “GREENFIELD WELCOMES ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.” On the other, the postcard asks residents to call Rep. Paul Mark to demand he withdraw his support for a bill to make Massachusetts a sanctuary state.  The postcard, which was mailed by the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, upset numerous residents who gathered on the Town Common Saturday in protest.  “I was disgusted by the flier,” said Greenfield resident Jan Maher, who attended the demonstration with her husband, Doug Selwyn.  “This is just part of the ugliness happening from top to bottom,” Selwyn added.  The postcard campaign also resulted in a local officer of Mass. Fiscal Alliance quitting that group — as well as his seats on the Greenfield Community College Board of Trustees and a Baystate Franklin Medical Center advisory board. Dylan Korpita of Sunderland, who ran unsuccessfully for state Legislature three years ago, said Saturday he has left the Mass. Fiscal Alliance because he disagreed with the anti-migrant messaging.  At Saturday’s rally, Maher explained that when she saw the postcard, her first impression was that the it was pro-sanctuary state. It wasn’t until she read further that she realized it was the opposite, discouraging sanctuary states.  The demonstration was organized by Franklin County Continuing the Political Revolution (FCCPR), and led by FCCPR member David Cohen.  “They have been doing this all over the state, promoting this question that immigrants are the cause of our problems here in the United States,” Cohen said of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance. The organization’s website describes itself as a nonpartisan, nonprofit group focused on promoting social welfare.  Sean Cain, an aide to Rep. Paul Mark, read a statement from Mark. He described such postcards as becoming the norm in many parts of the country, and emphasized his desire to ensure “opportunity and fairness for anyone, regardless of what they look like.”  “We are going to stand up to these groups and fight back for the values we know are right,” Cain read. Local affiliation  The demonstrators also called out Korpita. When reached by email Saturday afternoon, Korpita said he is the only Mass. Alliance board member from western Massachusetts.  Cohen circulated a petition to have Korpita removed from his positions as a member of Greenfield Community College’s board of trustees and a member of the Community Advisory Council at Baystate Franklin Medical Center. But Korpita seemed to have gotten ahead of the protest with his weekend resignations.  “How are people going to use these public facilities?” Cohen asked, then, referring to immigrants, adding, “How are they gonna feel going to the hospital when someone sits on the board who wants to deport them?”  “Dylan Korpita does not belong on any of these boards,” said At-Large Town Councilor Karen “Rudy” Renaud, noting that residents haven’t seen the last of her proposed Safe City Ordinance, which was voted down by her fellow Greenfield town councilors last August. Member responds  Korpita told The Recorder Saturday he stepped down from his position as treasurer of Mass. Fiscal Alliance that morning after learning about the postcards, which local politicians and politically active residents were already talking about on Friday. Korpita said he also resigned from Baystate Franklin’s Community Advisory Council, and heeded GCC board of trustees Chairman Robert Cohn’s request to resign from the GCC board.  “I was involved in these groups to give back, not get ahead, and I will remain in Franklin County and find other ways to help my community,” he said.  Korpita said he didn’t know about the postcards before they were sent out, wasn’t involved in their mailing and doesn’t agree with their message.  “I got involved with (the Mass. Fiscal Alliance) because they were supposed to focus on budgetary and good governance issues,” he said. “This mailer does not do that, and drives a wedge between their organization and many members of the community both by the topic it addresses and the way that it addresses it. I had voiced my opposition within (the Mass. Fiscal Alliance) about the group getting involved in the sanctuary state bill issue when it was discussed in general.”  While the demonstration was centered around the postcards and the Mass. Fiscal Alliance, those involved hoped to send a broader message.  “We want to make crystal clear that Greenfield welcomes everyone,” said Colrain resident David Greenberg.  “Our experience is Greenfield has been incredibly welcoming to us,” said Maher, who moved to Greenfield about a year ago. “I would like to think that’d be true if I spoke Spanish as my native language, or if I was brown skinned. … But I know it isn’t, yet.”
213	2	Grammy-winning R&B artist Miguel clasped his hands and listened.  Gwen Barrios, 17, of Santa Ana was in tears while she spoke about her father’s arrest by immigration officers as she was getting ready for school. She said her father is currently held at the Adelanto Detention Facility.  Mitzie Perez, an organizer with the Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth Collective, talked about her cousin’s deportation from the United States. He ended up in Guatemala, where his life was in danger. She said he wound up getting killed there.  Carlos Hidalgo, of North Hollywood, spoke of his time detained at the Adelanto Detention Facility. It’s run like a prison there, he said.

The facility also serves as the largest ICE Processing center in California. (Sarah Alvarado for The Press-Enterprise)  of Expand  On Friday, Oct. 20, Miguel was in Adelanto — home of California’s largest immigration detention center — to advocate for fair treatment of incarcerated immigrants at the Adelanto Detention Facility.  He was there to headline a show at Adelanto Stadium as part of the #SchoolsNotPrisons campaign — a free music and art tour that produces shows in communities “impacted by the overuse of punishment and incarceration.”  But before his performance, he met with a group immigrant rights organizers and youth impacted by deportation.  “There’s just a lot of injustice happening and I’m here to be educated and hopefully help shed some light to the issue,” Miguel said.  “We can find a solution. There’s no reason why people, who are contributing, to be ripped from their way of life,” he added.  The concert was organized by groups including The California Endowment, the Inland Empire-Immigration Youth Collective, the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, the Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement, known as CIVIC, and Revolve Impact.  Immigrant rights organizers in Adelanto on Friday announced a petition calling on media and government agencies to start referring to detention facilities as prisons.  “These detention centers are not what they look like,” Hidalgo said. “They are prisons and they are run like prisons.”  At 409,000 square feet, the Adelanto Detention Facility has an average daily population of 1,600. Immigrants stay anywhere from a couple of months to several years. More than 70 nationalities are represented among immigrants currently detained there. Most are Mexican nationals, followed by immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador.  Immigrants can end up in Adelanto after seeking asylum at the San Diego and Tijuana border or after they’re arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agents in enforcement operations across Southern California.  They are there solely for administrative purposes, pending decisions in their immigration cases or while awaiting deportation.  The private facility, operated and managed by The GEO Group, has drawn criticism over the number of detainees who have died at the center. There also have been complaints of sexual assaults and poor medical care.  ICE officials, and The GEO Group, however, have insisted they run a clean ship. Immigrant detainees get full physicals within 14 days of arrival and can access dental, mental, and other medical needs, officials have said.  Organizers of the event — which also featured Los Rakas, Ceci Bastida, and Buyepongo — said more than 1,000 signed up to attend the show.  Born to a black mother and a Mexican father, Miguel, whose last name is Pimentel, grew up more than 100 miles west of Adelanto in San Pedro. He simply goes by Miguel now.  In a recent Viceland documentary series, Miguel visits his father’s Mexican hometown of Zamora, Michoacán, for the first time.  “Most people think of me solely as a black artist, but there’s a reason why my name is Miguel,” he said.
130	1	It may have been a sweltering weekend with the heat, but that didn’t stop more than 200 people from participating in a cause they believe in.  The “Families Belong Together” rally in Ottawa drew hundreds from LaSalle County as well as Milwaukee, Peoria, and Kansas City. The really was for an end to the family separation policy in Zero Tolerance, and to demand that children who have been separated from their parents be reunified.  The Ottawa rally was one of more than 700 that have been held throughout the United States. One of the main speakers was Sara Dady, the Democratic challenger to Congressman Adam Kinzingers seat in the House of Representatives.
109	3	Calling for Frederick to become a sanctuary city and criticizing many of the policies of President Donald Trump, several hundred people gathered downtown on Saturday to show support for the city’s immigrant community.  The march was to increase awareness of how diverse Frederick’s population is, and to show what an important part of the community immigrants are, said Ben MacShane, one of the organizers.  The march was also organized by Stand Up for Racial Justice, a national network of groups and individuals that recently began a chapter in Frederick.  Recent attacks on immigrants aren’t just a problem in other parts of the country, MacShane said.  There are a lot of immigrants who need to see that people stand on their behalf, and the rally was a great opportunity to show them that people care, said the Rev. Eliezer Valentin-Castanon, who spoke Saturday.  Valentin-Castanon is a pastor at Trinity United Methodist, but said he was speaking on his own behalf rather than for the church.  Frederick Alderman Michael O’Connor spoke about how his grandparents came to America from Ireland in search of opportunity and a better life.  He urged the crowd to use the energy on display Saturday and translate it into a commitment to the country’s ideals, and make sure that Frederick remains a city that values justice and compassion.  “Every generation has its moment of conscience. And this is ours,” O’Connor said.  Several speakers called for Frederick to become a sanctuary city, a municipality that doesn’t prosecute residents based on their immigration status, and typically provides services to residents regardless of their immigration status.  Many people in the crowd carried signs, many calling for tolerance and opposing strict measures of immigration enforcement they said have been carried out since Trump took office in January.  Trump made stricter enforcement of the country’s immigration laws one of the cornerstones of his campaign for the White House and his time as president.  Saturday’s rally began at the corner of Patrick and Market streets in downtown Frederick, and moved to the amphitheater in Carroll Creek Linear Park.  Sergeant Jay Brown of the Frederick Police Department, who supervised the department’s handling of the event, said it went smoothly and without problems.  Melanie Gettier of Frederick said she came out to show support for her “fellow human beings.”  Gettier said she and her husband moved to Frederick 24 years ago because they were attracted to the city’s friendly and welcoming feel.  Lily Chalkley, a sophomore at Frederick High School, said she came with some friends because she thought it was important to show support for the immigrant community.  She said she likes the mix of cultures at her school, where you can walk through the halls and hear several languages being spoken.  Chalkley said she didn’t think her school experience would be the same without that diversity.
240	2	SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Hundreds of protesters countered a planned march in San Francisco against sanctuary cities.  "I'm here supporting our President and I'm here standing up against the radical left that supports protecting criminal aliens at the expense of American citizens," Fight Sanctuary State group member Ben Bergquam said.  The protest called to end sanctuary cities to protect Americans.  The group of about 30 people was met with dozens of demonstrators resisting their message of what they call "hate and racism."  "We're here to stand up to anti-immigrant bigotry, and we're here to say no to Donald Trump and his whole racist program of scapegoating, demonizing and deporting our immigrant brothers and sisters," Refuse Fascism group member Rafael Kadaris said.  San Francisco stirred an already heated debate about sanctuary cities when undocumented immigrant Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was charged with shooting and killing Kate Steinle in 2015.  City officials released him from custody before the shooting on Pier 14 without turning him over to immigration authorities.
129	2	Peoria’s diversity was on full display during a pro-immigrant rally at the Gateway Building Sun.  About 120 people gathered to listen to a lineup of 10 speakers that included local physicians, activists, and students.  2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ameya Pawar was also in the lineup. His father immigrated to the US from India. Pawar, a Chicago alderman, says only in America could an immigrant’s son be elected to City Council.  18156bdfc1478a33ab83019e1c77e1e8.jpg Credit Cassidy Foster / Peoria Public Radio / Peoria Public Radio Chicago Ald. Ameya Pawar introduced himself to attendees of a pro-immigration rally in Peoria Sun. Pawar is a Democratic candidate for Ill. governor. “Illinois has a long and storied history of resettling refugees and being welcoming to immigrants, like my family," Pawar said. "My perspective is we need to be a welcoming state, we need to make sure we’re protecting our friends, neighbors and families from the federal government.”    Pawar is one of six candidates in the Democratic field for the 2018 race for governor.  Pawar says Gov. Bruce Rauner should take steps to make Illinois a more welcoming state for immigrants and refugees.  “There are governors around the country, including Governor Cuomo, who’s talked about making sure that we pass legislation like the Illinois Trust Act, one that makes sure that we secure and protect the lives of immigrant and refugee populations,” Pawar said.   The Illinois Trust Act would limit the involvement of local police departments in federal immigration enforcement. It’s pending in general assembly. Gov. Rauner, a Republican, hasn’t taken a public stance on Pres. Donald Trump’s executive orders on immigration and travel from six Muslim-majority countries.  The American Immigration Council estimates that nearly 1 in 7 Illinoisans are foreign born. Almost half of them are naturalized US citizens who are eligible to vote.  The 10 speakers from different backgrounds and professions injected statements that, in essence, said “we are part of this community” or "you depend on us."     Two physicians, Rahmat Na'Allah and M. Jawad Javed, highlighted that one in four doctors in the US are foreign born. In Illinois, that number is higher, at 30 percent.     The children of immigrants also had a strong showing at Sunday night's event.  During the candlelight vigil following the evening's speeches, Rasheeda Na'Allah held a candle beside her mother, Rahmat.     "I used to want to go into medicine," Rasheeda Na'Allah said. "But I kind of want to go into business now."     Na'Allah, a 7th grader at Dunlap Middle School, says Pres. Trump's rhetoric  and policies aimed at immigrants and Muslims have had an effect on her plans for the future.     “We went to this one rally, where we were talking about women’s rights," Na'Allah siad. "And I think it would be cool to start a gym for women to have fun, and let loose."     Another student, Serene Musaitif, says she also plans on starting a business. Musaitif, a culinary arts and business junior at ICC, says she wants to open a Palestinian restaurant, so she can share her heritage with the region.
183	4	Nadine Yousef appeared genuinely touched Saturday when more than 60 people stopped in front of the West Side Bazaar, where she works, to express support for immigrants and refugees as part of the Western New York Peace Center's Immigrants Solidarity March and Rally.  She gave a shy greeting and offered thanks for the support that she and her family received after coming to Buffalo from Iraq two years ago. Yousef, her husband and four children arrived in Buffalo fearing they would be resented or shunned. But the opposite happened.  "That's amazing when you see all the people around you," she said, after people applauded and cheered her brief remarks. "They like us and support us here."  She spoke to people carrying signs like "Buffalo is better with refugees" and "Negate the hate."  Yousef works seven days a week. Both she and her husband work at Wegmans, then Yousef comes to the West Side Bazaar to tend to her macrame shop, where she sells macrame art, jewelry, hanging planters and clothing.  Michelle Holler, program manager for the West Side Bazaar, told the crowd, "Thank you for supporting diversity and what makes America beautiful."  The crowd of rally participants walked for an hour and carried signs in the light-but-relentless drizzle. They stopped at the bazaar, which supports immigrant businesses and restaurateurs, then proceeded to Lafayette High School, which has the highest concentration of refugee high school students in the city.  [PHOTO GALLERY: Immigrants Solidarity March]  Bullhorn chants were loud and plenty:  "When our friends and neighbors are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!"  "No wars! No walls! Sanctuary for all!"  At Lafayette High School, former Bhutan refugee Lamin Tamang recounted how he was "kicked out" of his country in 1992 and spent 20 years in a refugee camp in Nepal before making his way to Buffalo in 2012. He will graduate shortly with his associate's degree from Erie Community College. He works in the Central Registration Office of the Buffalo Public Schools to assist immigrant families registering their children.  Refugees shouldn't be dismissed as welfare burdens who don't contribute back to the community, he said. They should be embraced as productive citizens.  "We are here to love each other, not hate," he said.  The march and rally, which started with singing and drums at the Massachusetts Avenue playground near Winter Street, ended at Pilgrim-St. Luke's United Church of Christ, a self-declared sanctuary church.  Renee Stith, an Elmwood Village resident unaffiliated with any group, said times are truly tough when introverts like her join a movement. She carried a sign that said, "Make America kind again."  "It's necessary that we show ourselves," she said.  Various community, anti-racism, faith and immigration advocates came together to participate in the afternoon event, one of multiple events planned by the Western New York Peace Center as part of the recurring National Day of Action.
289	2	Minneapolis, MN - More than 100 people came to a noon rally, June 1, to protest the Trump administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. The protest at the U.S. Courthouse downtown was called on very short notice.  The rally was initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union and included speakers from the ACLU as well as the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee and Minneapolis Ward 3 City Council member Steve Fletcher.  Another hastily-called protest on the same issue happened May 30 outside of Senator Klobuchar’s office, demanding that she initiate congressional action to try to stop the cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.  While the separation of immigrant families on a massive scale has been an integral feature of U.S. immigration policy for decades, news reports this week about the Trump administration’s escalation of such policies at the border has provoked outrage, and a new wave of protests is starting to emerge around the country.

230	1	This story was reported by Rajvi Desai and Alison Fox. It was written by Nicole Brown and Lauren Cook.  Hundreds of protesters gathered outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on the Lower West Side Thursday, chanting “ICE out now” and demanding to know the whereabouts of a prominent immigrant rights leader, just hours after two city councilmen were arrested during a similar protest in Foley Square.  City councilmen Ydanis Rodriguez and Jumaane Williams were among 18 people who were arrested during the Foley Square protest sparked by the arrest of Ravi Ragbir, the executive director of the faith-based immigrant rights group New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City. Ragbir was detained when he showed up for a check-in with ICE, organizers of the rally said.  Outside of the ICE building at 201 Varick St. Thursday night, former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said she stands with Ragbir as well as her former colleagues who were arrested.  “I know Ravi personally; he is a man of grace, and community building. What is happening is the outrageousness of this administration that seeks to demonize anyone who is a person of color,” Mark-Viverito said. “We are tired of it, and that’s why I came down here today.”  Over 500 people lined the Varick Street sidewalk to take part in a form of prayer and protest known as a Jericho walk. Protesters walked a loop around the building, which takes up an entire city block between Varick and Hudson streets. Carrying signs that read “No walls,” “Human rights across all borders” and “Love restores our humanity,” protesters chanted “I stand with Ravi.”  As the protesters chanted a prayer that organizer and New Sanctuary co-chair Kaji Dousa said Ragbir says every Thursday, his wife Amy Gottlieb Ragbir held hands and cried heavily.  “I want to say thank you to everyone here today, that you love Ravi almost as much as I do,” she told the massive crowd. “He knows that we are going to win this fight and that no one is backing down that he will be with the immigrant communities of the city and that Ravi will be here leading the fight for year.”  Earlier Thursday, Grace Goodman, who is on the board of the New Sanctuary Coalition, said she and other members of the group went with Ragbir to his ICE check-in to participate in a different Jericho walk.  “We were informed that ICE had decided to detain Ravi,” she said. “Apparently, Ravi fainted and they took him out of the building in an ambulance.”  As Ragbir was taken away in an ambulance, Rodriguez, Williams and other protesters stood in the road, prompting police to push them aside so it could get through, video of the rally shows. Several people were arrested when they did not move onto the sidewalk, out of the way of the ambulance, Goodman said.  Rodriguez tweeted photos of himself being taken into police custody and accused the NYPD of putting him in a chokehold, a banned police tactic.  “This is NOT how you treat people who are protesting for Human Rights. This is NOT what democracy looks like,” he wrote.  NYPD Sgt. Jessica McRorie said video of officers’ interactions with Rodriguez is being reviewed.  “At this point, it appears the police were clearing a path for an ambulance with a patient inside that was en route to a hospital,” McRorie said in an emailed statement. “The NYPD was attempting to clear a path for that ambulance, which was purposely and repeatedly being blocked.”  Rodriguez was arraigned Thursday night on charges of obstructing an emergency medical service, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, according to a law enforcement source.  Most of the other 17 people arrested, including Williams, were charged with disorderly conduct, reckless endangerment and/or obstructing an emergency medical service, police said.   Mayor Bill de Blasio was briefed on the protest and police activity, his spokesman Eric Phillips said in a tweet.  “The area is covered extensively by cameras and we’ll be reviewing the footage to get to the bottom of what happened,” he wrote.  Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said certain protesters at the Foley Square rally “intentionally escalated an already tense situation,” which put police and other protesters “at greater risk.”  “Our elected officials should know the difference between a peaceful protest and behavior that endangers public safety. Yet some of them have chosen repeatedly over the years to cross that line in order to raise their own profile,” Lynch said in an emailed statement. “Now more than ever, we need leadership, not showmanship.”  Ragbir came to the United States in 1991 from Trinidad and obtained a green card in 1994, but in 2006, a judge ordered him to be deported because of a 2001 wire fraud conviction, according to a group of community members and advocates who have fought for him to stay in the country.  He has been granted multiple stays of removal, but ICE agents told his lawyer, Alina Das, that they have the “power to make a discretionary choice,” she said.  “We are asking them, what’s the change, why now? And they are not giving us an answer.”  Ragbir handed Das his hat and a crucifix when he found out he was being detained, she said.  “The fight is not over today. We need your prayers to make sure Ravi knows we are going to continue fighting for him,” Das added. “He represents a good man — a father, a husband, a leader.”  Donna Schaper, pastor of Judson Memorial Church, said another New Sanctuary leader, Jean Montrevil, was detained last week and is now in Miami, Florida.  “We have no choice but to see these two incidents as a direct insult to the New Sanctuary movement,” Schaper said.  Now that Ragbir is in ICE custody, “it’s all in the hands of the courts now,” Schaper said.  Representatives from Sen. Chuck Schumer’s office have been in touch with Ragbir’s attorneys to offer assistance, a source with knowledge of the situation said.  About a dozen churchgoers and members of New Sanctuary gathered in the basement of Judson Memorial Church after the Foley Square protest to regroup and make a banner that prominently displayed the hashtag “#WeNeedRaviBackNow!”  During the Varick Street protest, a slew of elected officials and immigration advocates demanded New York City live up to its name as a so-called sanctuary city for immigrants. With no megaphones at hand, protesters used a human echo chain reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street movement to relay what the speakers were saying.  Councilman Bard Lander lauded Williams and Rodriguez for “putting their bodies on the line.”  “Our new speaker, Corey Johnson, stood with Ravi today. He was very distressed to see what happened,” Lander added. “ . . . he made clear in this city we will continue to stand up for the rights of immigrants, for the right to peaceful protest and to be a sanctuary city.”  City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Ragbir’s arrest was an international disgrace.  “We will be out here to support Ravi and his family. I think about children that get separated from their mothers and fathers,” Stringer said. “This is not what America is all about. So, for all the freedom fighters here today, New York City has your back.”
86	3	CENTRAL FLORIDA -- Throughout Central Florida, hundreds gathered on Saturday for the "Families Belong Together" march -- a protest of the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration, as well as to call for the reunification of families and children who were separated at the border.   Residents marched to 'bring families together' on Saturday Protests held in Orlando, DeLand, Melbourne RELATED: Protesters flood US cities to fight Trump immigration policy Protests were held in downtown Orlando, DeLand, and Melbourne.  "Inhumane situation that these families are being put in and cannot allow this to happen," Karen Caudillo said.   Becka Niemczyk walked across the Eau Gallie Causeway in Melbourne with her children along with hundreds of others.  "Kids should not be separated from their parents. That's the whole point, they are parents," Niemczyk said.   Many people were wearing white to symbolize peace and unity. Those protesting wanted to see the children reunited with their families.  In DeLand, hundreds of people of all ages came together as one, marching near city hall.   "To bring the family together, right away, not waiting around for who knows how long," Dorothy Wilson said.
191	3	SOUTHFIELD — On Monday, June 12, dozens gathered outside the Mother of God Chaldean Catholic Church in Southfield to protest a recent wave of ICE raids that targeted, captured and detained dozens of Iraqi immigrants at multiple locations across Metro Detroit, including local churches, homes and even a hospital.  Shocked and outraged by the seizure of individuals from communities including Sterling Heights, Warren, Southfield, Oak Park and Dearborn, impacted family members rallied around the ICE detention facility in Detroit Sunday evening, where large white buses carrying the detainees were departing.  Protesters blocked a bus in an attempt to halt its transport to another detention facility.  Most of those taken into custody over the weekend are to be transported to the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, Ohio before their deportation.  Friends and family of the targeted individuals said that more than 100 were rounded up and deported.  “We have around 160 in a list that we have compiled with other non profits and the ACLU,” Mark Arabo, a Califonia-based Chaldean American businessman of the Minority Humanitarian Foundation said.  ICE puts national estimates for deportation orders at 1,444 individuals, with around 199 individuals detained in the past week. Of those, 114 were detained in Michigan.  Cal of Southfield, Michigan is one of many Iraqi American Chaldeans who has called the U.S. home for nearly 40 years. Having served time for a 1993 armed robbery, he was released in 1999 and since has been a law-abiding member of society.  Many of his friends and associates, with past records as minor as marijuana possession, were part of those picked up by ICE over the weekend.  “I would be on one of those buses too,” he said. “If I didn’t run to an attorney to reopen my case.”  In a written statement to The Arab American News, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said that the selected were deemed eligible for removal under U.S. law.  “As part of ICE’s efforts to process the backlog of these individuals, the agency recently arrested a number of Iraqi nationals, all of whom had criminal convictions for crimes including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, drug trafficking, robbery, sex assault, weapons violations and other offenses,” he said.  The sweep follows the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act passed by Congress on June 6. The legislation called for the provision of emergency aid to the victims of genocide by ISIS against ethnic minorities, which include Christians, Yazidis, Assyrians and Shi’a Muslims, the latter of whom comprise a majority of Iraqis and are deemed heretics by ISIS.  Cal said that in the context of the current genocide, the Geneva convention against torture deems it unlawful to send persecuted individuals back to endangerment.  “You cannot send them to their death,” he said, adding that many of the friends and family of those detained are sure their loved ones will meet that fate if sent to Iraq.  Affected individuals are encouraged to get an attorney who’ll file a motion under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), with the threat of persecution evidenced by the Congressional bill that recognized violence against these groups.  Numerous Michigan lawmakers, including Rep. Sander Levin (D-Royal Oak) Reps. John Conyers (D-Detroit), Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn), Dan Kildee (D-Flint), Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield), and John Moolenaar (R-Midland), wrote to Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, requesting that Kelly immediately send a copy of the U.S. government’s agreement with Iraq so that Congress can review its terms. They followed up their request by asking for subsequent direction on measures to take to ensure the detainees’ safety.  “Until we in Congress can review all aspects of the agreement reached with Iraq, and the referenced safety measures, we urge you to hold off removal of these individuals to Iraq,” they wrote.  Salem Jiddou, principal engineer of a contracting firm, was among those in attendance at Monday’s rally.  “They were punished, they served their term in jail… and whatever fine was imposed upon them,” he said about the detainees. “Now, after 20 years of being good citizens, we are sending them to Iraq to die. What human rights is that?”   Laverne Kenawa cries upon recollection of her uncle’s seizure at the hands of ICE agents  The deportations follow recent negotiations between the Iraqi government and the Trump administration to remove a certain number of Americans of Iraqi origin from the country.  Sources say that the exchanges are part of an agreement to ease Iraq off of the U.S.’s travel ban.  “Reading between the lines,” said attorney George Mann, “orders from Washington [targeted] convicted criminals. But most of these people have been here for a long time and have their whole families here.”  Mann said that while some have met terms for orders of removal, which he recognizes as an often arbitrary and “blanket” designation, prior administrations have not prioritized forcibly deporting these individuals.  “Trump has never hidden his attitudes towards immigrants and people here illegally,” Mann said, noting that the administration “looks at people with orders of deportation as criminals.”  While Trump received support from the Chaldean American community, his campaign promises to protect and prioritize Christian immigrants and refugees from the Middle east were quickly eclipsed by his execution of his harsh immigration and deportation policies.  A statement released by Emgage on Tuesday called for immigration reform in the wake of the raids.  “It is imperative that local law enforcement be allowed the right to refuse to honor ICE’s detainer requests to maintain a level of trust between law enforcement and residents. Immigrants contribute heavily to our society, and have an enormous impact on our economy. Immigration reform is needed, and the separating of families must come to an end,” said Emgage Executive Director Hassan Sheikh.  “Each [deportation] will be hurting at least 100 people because Chaldeans are family oriented people,” Jiddou said. “They served their terms, they are paying their taxes and some of them are very successful business people.”  Not all of those rounded up Sunday were of Chaldean or Christian origin.  One Muslim woman, a cosmetologist who volunteers at a Livonia food bank, vehemently demanded that justice be met for her family and community after her brother was taken by ICE agents Sunday.  “They said he’d be back in two hours. Where is he?” she asked. “We are volunteers; we work here; we pay our taxes and we pay our dues…we were adopted into this country, only to be targeted.”  Immigrants rights groups from Detroit to Ann Arbor also joined Monday’s rally to share information and offer support.  Representatives from the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Rapid Response team showed up to distribute information and instruct residents to not comply with certain ICE demands out of intimidation.  “In response to all questions, say, ‘I don’t want to talk to you without a lawyer,'” a representative from the group advised the crowd.  They additionally advised the families and friends of those detained to not have their loved ones sign anything while in custody, which they warned would “sign away their rights.”  However, attorneys and groups say that these individuals are being moved and held before they can organize or receive help.  “You wait in jail until the judge grants you a bond,” Mann said, recalling that recent cases involved individuals facing arrest before their cases forwarded to judges for bond hearings.  “Either a judge in Ohio will have to decide the bond or we would have to go represent [them] there or telephonically over a crucial bond hearing” he said.
62	3	Las Vegas resident Marisela Torres was surprised her car was one of just three in the normally packed parking lot Thursday morning at popular Latino grocery store Mariana’s.   Torres, who is originally from Puebla, Mexico and shops at Mariana’s for tortillas, meats and vegetables, found the store at 4151 South Eastern Ave. closed as part of the national Day Without Immigrants protest.  Immigrants nationwide skipped work and school in an attempt to demonstrate their importance to the U.S. economy, while many businesses closed in solidarity. The protest was aimed at President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on immigration, by such means as a wall at the Mexican border.  “We’re part of the community, and we contribute to making Las Vegas what it is,” Torres said in Spanish.  Mariana’s store owner Ruben Anaya said the closing was not politically motivated, but intended to show support for the majority of Hispanic store employees who wanted to participate in the boycott.  “It just picked up a lot of momentum this week, and we decided it’d be the right thing to do,” Anaya said. “They’ve supported us since Day 1, and we’d be nothing without them.”  Mariana’s wasn’t the only Las Vegas store to shut its doors Thursday.  Six La Bonita stores, another popular Latino grocery chain, were closed for the day to “support the cause,” spokeswoman Zaira Contreras said.  The closings frustrated North Las Vegas resident Antonio Arellano, who shook his head as he read a sign advising of La Bonita’s closing on the front door the store at 2672 Las Vegas Blvd. North. He said he stops by the store twice a week to buy groceries.  “I don’t know what’s going on, but this is kind of annoying,” he said.  Next to La Bonita, Rigo’s Taco #8 was serving up tacos, burritos, enchiladas and quesadillas, like any other day. Miguel Ortero, the taco shop’s manager, said while he supported the efforts of Day Without Immigrants protesters, he was working on Thursday to support his wife and two elementary school-age daughters.  “At the end of the day, you have to make money and make sure ends meet,” Ortero said.  Another popular Latino supermarket, Cardenas, said its four Las Vegas stores would remain open throughout the day.  In Chinatown, businesses seemed to be operating normally, with neon “open” signs illuminating the Asian restaurants and stores along Spring Mountain Road, west of the Las Vegas Strip.  Several Chinatown business owners said they hadn’t heard about Day Without Immigrants and didn’t have any plans to close early.  “Nobody told me about that,” said Yi Chenguang of the Fat Dumpling restaurant.  At a couple of Las Vegas area schools, meanwhile, more students than normal missed school, Clark County School District spokeswoman Michelle Booth said. But, for the most part, there was no significant decline in attendance across the district. Rancho High and Hyde Park Middle schools saw “an unusual dip in attendance,” she said.  “I have not heard anything so far that would suggest a large-scale boycott,” Booth said.  Fabiola Perez, who is from El Salvador and now lives in the northeast valley, pulled her daughter out of Mountain View Elementary School to attend a nearby education workshop supporting immigrants’ rights. The afternoon workshop, one of multiple held across the valley by non-profit Hermandad Mexicana, advised concerned immigrants on their legal status and educated them on their next steps to obtaining citizenship, an organization spokesman said.  Standing in line at the front window of the Hermandad Mexicana office on 2900 Stewart Ave., Perez, who is a green card holder, and her 8-year-old daughter Elisa, who was born in Las Vegas and is a U.S. citizen, attended the workshop to “make sure we’re safe.”  “We want to make sure our right to stay here is protected,” she said in Spanish. “Today is the right day to do this.”  Elsewhere around the nation, the heart of Philadelphia’s Italian Market was uncommonly quiet, per media reports, while several eateries and grocery stores in Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston were also closed for the day.  Organizers of the protest, which originated Tuesday on social media and quickly spread across the nation, urged immigrants from all walks of life to participate. Mi Familia Vota and The Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada were among local advocacy groups to support a Day Without Immigrants.  About 564,000 Nevadans are foreign-born, according to 2015 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, accounting for nearly 20 percent of Nevada’s population. Immigrants accounted for 21.4 percent of the Silver State’s work force in 2015, according to information obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Foreign-born Nevada workers, including those who are U.S. citizens, green card holders and immigrants working without legal authorization, often begin working in the state’s grocery, restaurant, construction, hotel, gaming and retail industries.  Over 65 percent of workers from the 57,000-member Culinary Union Local 226, which employs the majority of workers across those industries on the Las Vegas Strip, are foreign-born or children of foreign-born parents, spokeswoman Bethany Khan said.  “Our state and this country were built on the backs of immigrants,” Khan said. “All the people who make this country great should have a seat at the table.”
152	4	MANISTEE — They wore white. They shook their fists in the air. They carried signs reading: "No more children in cages," and "What's next? Concentration Camps?"  In major cities and tiny towns, hundreds of thousands of marchers gathered Saturday across America, moved by accounts of children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the latest act of resistance against President Donald Trump's immigration policies.  Protesters flooded more than 700 marches, from immigrant-friendly cities like New York and Los Angeles to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming. They gathered on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near Trump's golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president is spending the weekend.  Manistee was part of that map too, as nearly a hundred people from across the county showed up to rally at the corner of U.S. 31 and River Street on Saturday evening.    PAID CONTENT  This Mendocino County winery has been making award-winning certified organic wines for over... BY: FREY VINEYARDS "To me, being silent and doing nothing means you're complicit," said one local protester.  Bear Lake's Bill Turner, a former U.S. Marine, said the rally was his first.  "I've never done one of these before, but I just felt like I had to show up and help make a presence," he said. "I'm not a republican, I'm not a democrat, and I'm proud of it. But this president is the worst I've seen. ...  "(His immigration policies) are openly cruel," he said, "and it's just not American. One of the things we can do is take to the streets."  The local rally was organized by members of the Manistee Peace Group and We the People Action Network of Northwestern Michigan. The two groups partnered a year ago to bring the film "The Harvest" to the Vogue Theatre, as well as the following panel discussion featuring former migrant worker Zulema Lopez.  "We believe that immigrants are essential to build a vibrant and growing Manistee County," said Miriam Epskamp of We the People Action Network. "We believe it is possible to have a secure border without treating people inhumanely."  Turner was impressed by the local turnout, which lined both sides of U.S. 31 at the rally location.  "We were here a little before it started, and there was nobody," he said, "but little bit little they came and now we have nearly a hundred. ... I didn't know what to expect, but for a small town in Northwest Michigan, this is an appreciable showing.  "So many people are honking their horns and giving the thumbs up too," he added. "That's encouraging."  Trump has backed away from family separations amid bipartisan and international uproar. His "zero tolerance policy" led officials to take more than 2,000 children from their parents as they tried to enter the country illegally, most of them fleeing violence, persecution or economic collapse in their home countries.  Those marching Saturday demanded the government quickly reunite the families that were already divided.  A Brazilian mother separated from her 10-year-old son more than a month ago approached the microphone at the Boston rally.  "We came to the United States seeking help, and we never imagined that this could happen. So I beg everyone, please release these children, give my son back to me," she said through an interpreter, weeping.  "Please fight and continue fighting, because we will win," she said.  The crowd erupted.  In Washington, D.C., an estimated 30,000 marchers gathered in Lafayette Park across from the White House in what was expected to be the largest protest of the day, stretching for hours under a searing sun. Firefighters at one point misted the crowd to help people cool off.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical "Hamilton," sang a lullaby dedicated to parents unable to sing to their children. Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys read a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border.  "It's upsetting. Families being separated, children in cages," said Emilia Ramos, a cleaner in the district, fighting tears at the rally. "Seeing everyone together for this cause, it's emotional."  Around her, thousands waved signs: "I care," some read, referencing a jacket that first lady Melania Trump wore when traveling to visit child migrants. The back of her jacket said, "I really don't care, do U?" and it became a rallying cry for protesters Saturday.  "I care!! Do you?" read Joan Culwell's T-shirt as she joined a rally in Denver.  "We care!" marchers shouted outside Dallas City Hall. Organizer Michelle Wentz says opposition to the Trump administration's "barbaric and inhumane" policy has seemed to transcend political lines.  "This is the issue crossing the line for a lot of people," said Robin Jackson, 51, of Los Angeles, who protested with thousands carrying flags, signs and babies.  Singer John Legend serenaded the crowd and Democratic politicians who have clashed with Trump had strong words for the president, including U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters who called for his impeachment.  The president took to Twitter amid the protests, first to show his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement as some Democrats called for major changes to the agency. Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police."  He later tweeted that he never pushed House Republicans to vote for immigration overhaul measures that failed last week, contradicting a post three days ago in which he urged GOP congressional members to pass them.  In Trump's hometown of New York City, another massive crowd poured across the Brooklyn Bridge in sweltering 90-degree heat, some carrying their children on their shoulders, chanting, "Shame!" Drivers honked their horns in support.

Experts are raising concerns that sludge spread on agricultural fields around the U.S. could contaminate crops. About half of the 7 million tons of sludge generated each year is applied to farm fields and other lands. "It's important for this administration to know that these policies that rip apart families — that treat people as less than human, like they're vermin — are not the way of God, they are not the law of love," said the Rev. Julie Hoplamazian, an Episcopal priest marching in Brooklyn.  Though seasoned anti-Trump demonstrators packed the rallies, others were new to activism, including parents who said they felt compelled to act after heart-wrenching accounts of families who were torn apart.   Marchers took to city parks and downtown squares from Maine to Florida to Oregon; in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; on the international bridge between El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico; even in Antler, North Dakota, population 27. People braved the heat in Chicago and Atlanta to march.  Some of the demonstrations were boisterous, others were quiet.  Five people were arrested outside an ICE office in Dallas for blocking a road. At least one arrest was made in Columbus, Ohio, when protesters obstructed a downtown street. Light-rail service was temporarily shut down in Minneapolis as thousands of demonstrators got in the way of the tracks. A rally in Portland, Maine, grew so large that police had to shut down part of a major street.  But in Dodge City, Kansas, a 100-person rally led by a Catholic church felt more like a mass than a protest.   In rural Marshalltown, Iowa, about 125 people gathered for a march organized by Steve Adelmund, a father of two who was inspired after turning on the news on Father's Day and seeing children being separated from their families and held in cages.  "It hit me in the heart. I cried," he said.  "If we can't come together under the idea of 'Kids shouldn't be taken from their parents,' where are we?" he asked. "We have to speak out now while we can, before we can't."  Drum beats and horns sounded as thousands of protesters hit the streets of San Francisco.   "We came here to let the president know that this is not acceptable," said San Francisco resident Barry Hooper, who attended with his wife and two daughters.  His 7-year-old daughter Liliana clutched a sign she made, saying, "Stop the separation."  Three thousand miles away in Washington, protesters ended their march at the white-columned Justice Department. They stacked their protest signs, written in English and Spanish, against its grand wooden doors.  "Fight for families," one sign demanded.   In Portland, Oregon, police ordered participants in a march by Patriot Prayer to disperse after officers saw assaults and projectiles being thrown. Some arrests were made.  The problems occurred as two opposing protest groups — Patriot Prayer and antifa — took to the streets. People in the crowd were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs and police used flash bangs to disperse the clashing protesters.
96	2	About 150 Rubidoux High students walked out of school early Friday afternoon to protest disparaging Facebook posts and comments teachers made about those who participated in Thursday’s national boycott, “A Day Without Immigrants.”  They held Mexican flags and chanted, “Mexico, Mexico!” and “Que Viva la Raza!” as they walked on sidewalks and in the middle of streets. Many wore red as a sign of unity, as a flier announcing the march had asked.  As students made their way toward Patriot High and walked back to Rubidoux High, drivers honked in approval and cheered them on.  Students were protesting by noon Friday and Riverside County sheriff’s deputies were at the scene keeping protesters and the general public safe.  RELATED: Social media reaction to Rubidoux High teachers’ comments on immigration  Students march at Mission & Camino Real in Jurupa Valley as it starts to rain pic.twitter.com/KpP3cl78wP  — Alicia Robinson (@arobinson_pe) February 17, 2017  Some educators applauded the fact that Latino students missed class on Thursday for the national “A Day Without Immigrants” boycott. The comments included statements calling students “lazy” and “drunk” and noted that the cafeteria was cleaner without them.   Social science teacher Geoffrey Greer started the thread Thursday afternoon by saying that having 50 percent fewer students proves “how much better things might be without all this overcrowding.”  UPDATE: Rubidoux High teachers on leave for ‘Day Without Immigrants’ social media posts  Freshman student Vianey Camacho, 14, said many of the students became aware of the teachers’ comments through social media Thursday night.  And teachers, she said, acted like “it was a normal day” Friday. The comments were not addressed in class, she said.  Camacho said students planned not to buy anything from the student store, as a boycott, to protest the teachers’ comments.  The walkout “kind of just happened.”  She said some walked out during lunch, and soon others followed.  Others, however, stayed in school and participated in a peaceful sit-in inside. Those students said “they wanted to do it the right way.”  Victoria Rodriguez, a Rubidoux student, said the walkout protests “didn’t prove anything.”  Throughout the walkout, students expressed their disappointment with hearing those kind of comments coming from teachers, especially some they looked up to. Former students also marched.  RELATED: From taco trucks to Latino markets, owners shut down in support of immigrants  Students Christopher Maldonado and Isaias Torres, both juniors, waved a Mexican flag as they led the group walking back to their high school.  Maldonado said they were marching to, “Show them that we have a voice, too.”  “He (Greer) can’t make all those comments. It made us feel disrespected.”  Bernice Meza, 17, watched what started as a peaceful protest during lunch become chaotic. Some students tried to put up the Mexican flag on the flagpole, she said. Others ran, threw food and tried to leave campus but the gate was locked.  Other than some graffiti on a classroom, Duchon said he wasn’t aware of any wrongdoing by students.  Riverside County sheriff’s spokesman Michael Vasquez said no one was arrested and that rumors of students jumping on cars or committing vandalism were false.  Duchon said school officials wanted to let students exercise freedom of expression. Keeping them from harm was “our only goal – we’re not about punishment,” he said.  Students walking to school in the morning found the atmosphere much more tranquil.  Freshman Terrell Ladd, 15, said he liked Baugh, his science teacher, until he read Baugh’s post saying his classes were “quieter and more productive” with 49 absences and that the teacher wanted to see the situation repeated.  “It’s crazy,” Ladd said. “They put it on social media thinking nobody would go off on them. I feel bad for the students because they’re not troublemakers.”  Meza, who didn’t participate in the walkout because she was in the office talking to administrators, said she was disappointed in some of her classmates’ behavior.  “I feel like it’s giving us a bad image,” Meza said. “People are going to associate us with people who are choosing to be disruptive and people who want to leave class just to leave class. Not everyone in this movement is violent. Not everyone wants to walk out of class and vandalize everything. We want to let everyone know that we’re not going to be suppressed.”  Meza, an honors student with a 4.1 GPA, said she took Advanced Placement history class last year from Greer, whose post began the string of comments in question. Greer was opinionated and controversial but challenged students to think, she said.  Meza said she no longer admires Greer.  “Now we know what he really thinks of us,” she said.  Back at the school, parents gathered, waiting for their kids.  Berenice Saldaña, who has a daughter who is a freshman student, said she understands people have a right to freedom of speech, but she felt the teacher’s comments were rude.  “I told my daughter, ‘Let’s protest, but with respect and dignity,’” she said  Saldaña said her daughter participated in the peaceful protest inside the school.  “The students are offended. I’m offended,” Saldaña said.  Staff writer Alicia Robinson contributed to this report.
52	4	Roughly 450 people gathered outside Santa Maria’s ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) facility, chanting, “Shut ICE down!” on Saturday. The protest followed a downtown Santa Barbara “Families Belong Together” march that drew a few thousand in protest of President Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration crackdown, and was part of an estimated 700 similar rallies nationwide.   Hundreds turned out on Saturday to continue the Families United protest Paul Wellman “This is the first time we are organizing here [in Santa Maria],” said Hazel Davalos, the Santa Maria–based community organizing director for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE). However, added Elias, who did not want to give his last name, “[Family separation] is nothing new. It’s been happening [here] for years, and finally people are beginning to understand the cruelty and damage that ICE brings to our community.”  Three years ago, 3,000 people protested to keep this facility out, said Davalos. “And now they are planning to grow their staff.” Community members live in fear of deportation, she said. Organizers are concerned about the proximity of the ICE facility to the new jail, set to open in April of next year. “Whether they’ve committed a crime or not, we’ll stand behind them,” she added. “No person deserves to be punished twice — once by our criminal justice system and a second time by deportation.”  While the rally was organized by CAUSE, a number of organizations collaborated and attended the rally, including Planned Parenthood. The group’s Central Coast representative, Miguel Angel Perez, told the crowd that President Trump’s administration want “to divide and conquer” communities. “But, one: We are not the enemy. And two: You will never divide us.”   Hundreds gathered Saturday for the nation-wide Families United protest Erika Carlos Farmworker and mother of five Francisca Pacheco, who has lived in Santa Maria for 15 years, told the crowd, “I am part of this community.” Pacheco said she has two kids enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented students — one is a college graduate and the other is studying medicine. She said it would be tragic if they lost everything they’ve been working toward.
214	2	HOLLAND, Mich. (WOOD) — Hope College students organized a march Tuesday in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  The march began at Pine Grove in the heart of Hope’s Holland campus and ended at city hall.  March organizers say their goals were to raise awareness about issues of immigration and show support for students and community members affected by the decision to end DACA.  “I think all of us are affected by this,” march organizer Alejandra Gomez Limon said. “Because whether it’s people in the Holland community, our families back home, the positive impact they make in our communities is going to be wiped away.”  DACA protects immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children.  The program won’t officially end until early 2018. In September, the Trump administration announced plans to end DACA, giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program.

149	3	Adults and kids danced in the street and chanted in the rain in Immokalee on Monday afternoon during a march celebrating laborers and the working class on International Workers' Day.  Marchers held up signs reading, "My parents are not criminals," "Justice for all" and "Immigrants get the job done."  Lugarda Juan Bidal marches with members of the community through the streets of Immokalee for International Workers' Day on Monday, May 1, 2017.  The demonstrators said they marched for livable wages, decent working conditions and, most of all, respect for a marginalized group that puts food on people's tables, roofs over their heads and maintains lawns and agricultural fields.  "We're marching as one part of a national day of movement and community support," said Leonel Perez, a march organizer. "We're here to unite and keep working and support one another."  Immokalee resident Susana Gomez, 19, got permission to skip work for a few hours to attend the march for herself and her family.  She has been working at a popular Mexican restaurant called Mr. Taco since she was 17 to help her family with their expenses. She's also studying medical administration at the Immokalee Technical College.   "My parents had to work, but I came for them," Gomez said. "We're here to give the message that we're here for good. We're not here to take away. We want to support our families and are doing our best to work hard."  Susana and about 150 others participated in the march, which was organized by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.  A truck led the demonstrators; organizers on the back of the truck played music and led the marchers in chants.  Live coverage: Workers hit the streets in Immokalee for International Worker’s Day  Residents march through the streets of Immokalee for International Workers' Day on Monday, May 1, 2017. People spilled out onto the street from their homes and businesses to watch the demonstrators go by — waving, whistling and taking photos and video on their phones from sidewalks and street curbs.  A group of Haitian nationals at the front of the marching line danced with signs in their hands to a song in Creole that blared from speakers on the bed of the truck leading them.  A toddler fell asleep in his dad's arms during the tail end of the 2-mile march.  The speeches given by local activists and spiritual leaders before and after the march had more of an assuring tone than a political one.  Miguel Estrada, a pastor at Misión Peñiel in Immokalee, commended the demonstrators for attending the march when there is so much fear in the community about being stopped by law enforcement and taken to immigration detention centers.  "There is some ignorance surrounding why people come to this country," Estrada told the crowd. "People think we want to leave our families behind, our homes, our roots. That's not why we're here. We're here to work and to provide for our families and get them ahead. We should have no fear and nothing to be ashamed of."  Lupe Gonzalo, an organizer with the coalition, marched to fight for her family and to teach her two sons to fight for their futures.   She worked more than 12 years in agricultural fields all over the country after leaving Guatemala and said she knows firsthand the abuses that laborers, especially women, face — sexual abuse, stolen wages, subpar living conditions, discrimination and no protections against any of the abuses.  "We're tired of hate," Gonzalo said. "So we march. If we don't do anything, if we don't speak out or speak up, we give up. We're trying to build a path of respect and dignity for workers in the community. In the future, when I have grandkids and great-grandkids, it's important to me for them to know that they have someone fighting for them."
236	4	OAKLAND PARK (CBSMiami) – Protesters gathered outside Senator Bill Nelson’s office in Coral Gables on Wednesday to demand action on DACA. Local DACA recipient Nery Lopez isn’t cheering  a federal judge’s decision to block the Trump administrations plan to phase out protections for undocumented dreamers.  Her parents brought her from Mexico to Florida when she was four.  She’s a junior at Florida International University living in legal limbo.  “My permit expires in a year and I only have about three semesters left and I don’t know if I’ll be able to graduate on time if something happens and I lose my status,” Lopez said.  Lopez and a dozen other demonstrators talked their way into Senator Nelson’s Coral Gables office Wednesday afternoon.  They say they’re upset Nelson didn’t tie his support of the federal government spending bill to the Dream Act, which would protect childhood arrivals from deportation.Nelson said he’s all for the Dream Act and is pushing to get it passed.  But for the estimated 20,000 dreamers in Florida, there’s a fear time is running out.  Elizabeth Blandon is a South Florida immigration attorney who has represented hundreds of DACA recipients.  She’s calling the latest court ruling a ‘temporary victory.’  “This is gonna battle out in the courts for a few years, unless congress decides earlier, which I hope they will,” Blandon said.  She also said dreamers need to follow whatever path to citizenship may work, and it starts with talking to an Immigration lawyer. “If you can get DACA, great,” she said. “But even if you can, there might be other things we can do for you. If you never go speak to an immigration attorney, you will never know.”
113	4	WASHINGTON (AP) - They wore white. They shook their fists in the air. They carried signs reading: "No more children in cages," and "What's next? Concentration Camps?" In major cities and tiny towns, hundreds of thousands of marchers gathered Saturday across America, moved by accounts of children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the latest act of mass resistance against President Donald Trump's immigration policies. ADVERTISING  Protesters flooded more than 700 marches, from immigrant-friendly cities like New York and Los Angeles to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming. They gathered on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near Trump's golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president is spending the weekend. Trump has backed away from family separations amid bipartisan and international uproar. His "zero tolerance policy" led officials to take more than 2,000 children from their parents as they tried to enter the country illegally, most of them fleeing violence, persecution or economic collapse in their home countries.  Those marching Saturday demanded the government quickly reunite the families that were already divided. A Brazilian mother separated from her 10-year-old son more than a month ago approached the microphone at the Boston rally. "We came to the United States seeking help, and we never imagined that this could happen. So I beg everyone, please release these children, give my son back to me," she said through an interpreter, weeping. "Please fight and continue fighting, because we will win," she said. The crowd erupted. In Washington, D.C., an estimated 30,000 marchers gathered in Lafayette Park across from the White House in what was expected to be the largest protest of the day, stretching for hours under a searing sun. Firefighters at one point misted the crowd to help people cool off. Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical "Hamilton," sang a lullaby dedicated to parents unable to sing to their children. Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys read a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border.  "It's upsetting. Families being separated, children in cages," said Emilia Ramos, a cleaner in the district, fighting tears at the rally. "Seeing everyone together for this cause, it's emotional." Around her, thousands waved signs: "I care," some read, referencing a jacket that first lady Melania Trump wore when traveling to visit child migrants. The back of her jacket said, "I really don't care, do U?" and it became a rallying cry for protesters Saturday. "I care!! Do you?" read Joan Culwell's T-shirt as she joined a rally in Denver. "We care!" marchers shouted outside Dallas City Hall. Organizer Michelle Wentz says opposition to the Trump administration's "barbaric and inhumane" policy has seemed to transcend political lines. "This is the issue crossing the line for a lot of people," said Robin Jackson, 51, of Los Angeles, who protested with thousands carrying flags, signs and babies. Singer John Legend serenaded the crowd and Democratic politicians who have clashed with Trump had strong words for the president, including U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters who called for his impeachment.  The president took to Twitter amid the protests, first to show his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement as some Democrats called for major changes to the agency. Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." He later tweeted that he never pushed House Republicans to vote for immigration overhaul measures that failed last week, contradicting a post three days ago in which he urged GOP congressional members to pass them. In Trump's hometown of New York City, another massive crowd poured across the Brooklyn Bridge in sweltering 90-degree heat, some carrying their children on their shoulders, chanting, "Shame!" Drivers honked their horns in support. "It's important for this administration to know that these policies that rip apart families - that treat people as less than human, like they're vermin - are not the way of God, they are not the law of love," said the Rev. Julie Hoplamazian, an Episcopal priest marching in Brooklyn. Though seasoned anti-Trump demonstrators packed the rallies, others were new to activism, including parents who said they felt compelled to act after heart-wrenching accounts of families who were torn apart.  Marchers took to city parks and downtown squares from Maine to Florida to Oregon; in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; on the international bridge between El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico; even in Antler, North Dakota, population 27. People braved the heat in Chicago and Atlanta to march. Some of the demonstrations were boisterous, others were quiet. Five people were arrested outside an ICE office in Dallas for blocking a road. At least one arrest was made in Columbus, Ohio, when protesters obstructed a downtown street. Light-rail service temporarily shut down in Minneapolis as thousands of demonstrators got in the way of the tracks. A rally in Portland, Maine, grew so large that police had to shut down part of a major street. But in Dodge City, Kansas, a 100-person rally led by a Catholic church felt more like a mass than a protest. In rural Marshalltown, Iowa, about 125 people gathered for a march organized by Steve Adelmund, a father of two who was inspired after turning on the news on Father's Day and seeing children being separated from their families and held in cages. "It hit me in the heart. I cried," he said.  "If we can't come together under the idea of 'Kids shouldn't be taken from their parents,' where are we?" he asked. "We have to speak out now while we can, before we can't." Drum beats and horns sounded as thousands of protesters took to the streets of San Francisco. "We came here to let the president know that this is not acceptable," said San Francisco resident Barry Hooper, who attended with his wife and two daughters. His 7-year-old daughter Liliana clutched a sign she made, saying, "Stop the separation." Three thousand miles away in Washington, protesters ended their march at the white-columned Justice Department. They stacked their protest signs, written in English and Spanish, against its grand wooden doors. "Fight for families," one sign demanded. ___  Associated Press reporters Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Emily Schmall in McAllen, Texas; David Warren and Ryan Tarinelli in Dallas; Paul Elias in San Francisco; David Sharp in Portland, Maine; Martha Irvine in Chicago; Sarah Betancourt in Boston; Damian Dovarganes in Los Angeles; Rick Callahan in Indianapolis; Bob Lentz and Ron Todt in Philadelphia, Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, and Julie Walker and Michael Sisak in New York City contributed to this report.
119	4	Farmworkers, physicians and clergy members descended Tuesday on Oxnard City Hall, quickly filling up the City Council chambers and two overflow rooms as they called for a declaration of a "safe city" in the face of federal plans to step up enforcement of immigration laws.  Hundreds gathered outside Oxnard City Hall on Tuesday calling for the council to pass a safe city resolution. Nearly 300 people rallied outside, holding signs that read "Oxnard sanctuary city" and "Resist hate" as evening traffic passed on Third Street, some cars honking in support. It was the strongest push yet calling on the City Council to make a declaration of a safe city.  Organizers of the rally are pushing "safe city" over "sanctuary city" status for political reasons. President Donald Trump has threatened to remove federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, a stance that many experts say has little merit.   "Sanctuary cities have generated so much fire," said Lucas Zucker, of Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, or CAUSE, one of about eight advocacy groups focused on this issue.  An hour before the City Council meeting, organizers rallied participants to sign a petition supporting a status as a safe city.  Jorge Martinez gave out about 40 self-designed T-shirts that read "Raza unidos sin miedo," which is Spanish for "Our people united without fear." Martinez, who entered the country without legal permission, said he made the shirts to show solidarity with farmworkers.  "We're all here to work," Martinez said. "If we don't help them, the whole Ventura County economy can go down. Who's going to pick the fruits?"  When the council meeting convened, the room wasn't large enough to accommodate the crowd, so an overflow room across the street was opened. That room on B Street quickly filled up and a second overflow room was opened at the library.  About 40 people spoke in favor of a status as a safe city and many talked about their fears of raids and mass deportations. One speaker opposed.  George Miller, publisher of Citizens Journal, said recent calls for a safe city are part of an "orchestrated campaign." Miller said residents who do not commit crimes won't be targeted.  "This is scare mongering," he told the council.  Xochitl Lopez holds a sign while listening to her father address the Oxnard City Council about a proposed safe city resolution. Mayor Tim Flynn laid out the ground rules at the start of the public-comment period of the council meeting. There would be no applause, no boos and no hissing. Each speaker was allotted one minute.  A minister told the council his faith commands him to love and welcome immigrants. A sixth-grade boy said students aren't going to school because families are scared that teachers will communicate with federal immigration officials. Port Hueneme Councilman Jim Hensley said he thinks the whole county should be declared safe.   Immigration attorney Vanessa Frank said she believes cities will be able to fight any federal government threats over sanctuary city status.  "We have the law on our side. We have morals on our side. We have the community on our side," she said.  Proponents want the council to consider at its next meeting a resolution that would prohibit all city departments from using funds and resources to enforce federal immigration laws. They would like other cities to declare safe city status, too, but they're starting their efforts with Oxnard, the city with the county's largest immigrant population.   According to CAUSE, Oxnard has an estimated 35,000 people who entered this country without legal permission. That's one in six Oxnard residents.  Related content:  Oxnard City Council mixed on sanctuary status Local schools declare themselves safe spaces for students Flynn said the city is, in essence, a safe city because local police have already made the vow not to enforce federal laws.   Police Chief Scott Whitney said his department will not go knocking on doors and stopping people on the street asking about immigration status.  "We're not in the business of immigration enforcement; that doesn't benefit public safety. That's not going to make our city safer," Whitney said. "Our residents should not be afraid of the Oxnard Police Department or any other police departments in the city."   By the time council members addressed the issue, most of the rally participants had left. City leaders did not say whether such a resolution would be on a future agenda.  Councilman Bert Perello said that with limited funds, he wouldn't want to get into any litigation with the federal government.  "I don't believe that makes me a racist," Perello said.  Councilwoman Carmen Ramirez thanked members of the community for speaking and then gave an impassioned speech condemning the hate crimes across the country on Jewish centers and various immigrant groups.  "We are all from immigrant families unless you're Native American," Ramirez said. "And we have to try to understand the terror going through our community. ... If you don't recognize that or empathize, I feel sorry for you."  Ramirez said her husband's family fled the Nazis, and at that time, there were people who underestimated the anti-Semitic rhetoric.  "This is a time not to be neutral, to speak up for our families," she said. "I feel very strongly about that."
177	3	CHEYENNE – Wind, a chilly breeze and even light hail didn’t stop more than 100 people from taking to the streets Monday afternoon to show support for undocumented immigrants in Wyoming.  Protesters across the nation participated in May Day events. Though the annual demonstrations usually center on labor issues, Monday’s march and rally in Cheyenne was focused on supporting immigrant communities that have been in a state of uncertainty and fear because of President Donald Trump’s approach to immigration.  The event began at the Cheyenne Depot Plaza before participants marched down Capitol Avenue to Gov. Matt Mead’s temporary office across the street from the state Capitol. There, organizers delivered a letter signed by supporters to Mead before marching back for a rally inside the Cheyenne Depot Museum. Chants and cheers rang throughout the speech, with now familiar calls of “this is what democracy looks like” and the more topical “no human is illegal.”  Local advocacy group Juntos organized the event. Executive Director Antonio Serrano said it’s an important time to show support for the undocumented in Wyoming because those people and their loved ones are living in fear under the Trump administration.  “We’ve seen the fear people are living with every day firsthand,” he said.  “We see the fear with kids, especially. We have kids in school being bullied, being told they’re going to be deported. And it’s been happening locally. We want people to feel safe in Wyoming. We grew up here, and we love this community.”  Even before Trump’s election, previous administrations’ policies led to undocumented people and their loved ones facing deportations and raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Wyoming. Serrano said the march was in part to send a message to Wyoming’s undocumented that they have supporters in the state.  It also was to send a message to those in Wyoming government, he said.  “We want our local government to know that we care about the immigrant community, the refugees,” Serrano said. “We want law enforcement – especially the (Laramie County) Sheriff’s Department – to know that we know what they’re doing.”  Cheyenne resident Sandi Gaulke said several groups have worked together to advocate for the undocumented in Wyoming since 2012 raids affected several families locally. She said she doesn’t oppose deporting dangerous criminals among the undocumented, but she wants to see comprehensive immigration reform to protect working families.  “They’re our neighbors, our friends, workers in this community, children who go to school,” Gaulke said. “While they’re not documented now, many have been in this community for 20 years. We don’t think it’s right to just kick them out.”  Sabrina King, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming, said that organization has historically stood behind immigrants. She said the local chapter is working with Juntos to advocate for the undocumented, adding she’d like to see Mead make a statement of support.  “Honestly, the biggest thing is even just coming out with a statement of support saying that immigrants are welcome here, and undocumented folks are going to be safe in our communities,” King said.  “There’s a lot of fear right now, and a lot of that fear can be allayed by just showing his support and acknowledging people are frightened by what the federal government is doing.”  Some Wyoming residents have made faith-based decisions to support the undocumented in the state, including Rodger McDaniel, pastor at Highlands United Presbyterian Church in Cheyenne.  “For me, it’s biblical,” he said. “I think Scripture is pretty clear that we are called on to treat foreigners kindly, to welcome them to our land and to recognize we are all immigrants of some sort. So I come at it from a faith perspective, just believing its part of what we’re called to do as Christians.”  Conditions outside that started cold deteriorated by the time the march reached the Depot. McDaniel said the considerable participation and energy of the crowd despite the conditions showed strong support for the cause.  “To have this kind of turnout on a day when the weather is threatening, and it’s a work day, it says something,” he said. “I hope people like the governor would take notice of that.”
120	3	Crowds gathered in hundreds of separate rallies across the nation to protest the policy toward undocumented immigrations implemented by the Trump administration nearly two months ago, which led to thousands of children being separated from their parents.   Protesters gathered on both sides of First Ave. on Saturday. Photo by Ben Olson.  While the main rally took place in Washington, D.C., over 125 protestors gathered on both sides of First Avenue outside the Bonner County courthouse in Sandpoint. The peaceful protestors held signs and waved American flags, cheering at the passing motorists honking their support.  Signs read “Keep families together,” and “Never again is now.” One lady held a jacket on a stick with the words, “Yes I care” written on the back. Two women held a large American flag with the words, “In our America, all people are equal, love wins, black lives matter, immigrants & refugees are welcome, disabilities are respected, women are in charge of their bodies, people & planet are valued over profit, diversity is celebrated.”   A woman holding a sign that reads, “Yes I care.” Photo by Ben Olson.  A common refrain in the crowd was a call to reunite separated migrant families and the end of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.  Dave Mulliner from Sandpoint said he attended the rally because “We don’t believe parents and children – anyone’s children – should be separated from one another. We need to put kids back with their parents.”  Alirene Mulliner said, “Let immigrants follow natural law. We don’t need to impose these draconian measures.”  Barbara Russell of Bonners Ferry said she attended the rally because separating children from their parents is “cruel and inhumane.”  “I’ve been looking at my grandchildren’s faces and trying to imagine their terror if they were separated from their parents,” she said. “Just think of when a parent can’t find their kid in a store for five minutes, think of the terror they must feel having them taken away and they don’t know where they are or when they’ll see them again.”   Protesters holding signs at the rally on Saturday. Photo by Ben Olson.  According to the New York Times, more than 2,300 undocumented children have been separated from their parents in the weeks since the “zero tolerance” policy took effect – nearly 70 children per day for the first five weeks of the program. Under this policy, any adult caught crossing the border illegally faced prosecution, with their children separated and sent to federal shelters in various parts of the U.S.  President Donald Trump signed an executive order June 20 effectively reversing the family separation policy, but ten days after that order, there are still more than 2,000 children that have yet to be reunited with their parents.
295	3	Dozens of demonstrators gathered at Jackson City Hall Thursday carrying a string of over 1,000 blank pages to represent children who have been separated from their families.  President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy separates children from their families when they attempt to illegally cross the United States border, including those seeking asylum.  “Indivisible Jackson members were here today to register our disagreement with the Trump administration’s policy of separating families when they apply for asylum here in the United States,” founder Cindy Boyles said.  This is an issue that can bring all Americans together, Boyles explained, because everyone has a family and can imagine what it would be like to desperately leave your home seeking refuge.  A lot of the families coming to the United States are fleeing from war and violence. The “zero tolerance” policy puts parents in an impossible situation, she said. Their children are in danger in their home country, and in the United States when they are taken from their parents.  “We certainly have room in our country and room in our hearts for families that are fleeing,” Boyles said. Spreading it out  Each piece of paper represented “the administrative, bureaucratic coldness of the Trump administration” and how families have been reduced to a form of paper, she said.  While they are not sure exactly how many families have been separated at the borders, one number that is clear is 1,475 kids who have been lost track of by the Department of Health and Human Services.  The immigrant children were placed with sponsor families, but the federal government couldn’t account for 1,475 of them last year.  The reason for stringing each piece of paper out was to show how much it really is. Looking at reams of 500 doesn’t seem like a lot until it’s spread out.  “When you see it represented that way, I think it’s very impactful, and that’s what we wanted,” Boyles said. “We wanted to have some kind of visual representation today of each of these families.” What’s next?  Ideally, they would like to see Congressman David Kustoff (R-District 8) and Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) help pass immigration reform that allows a safe and legal way for families seeking asylum to come to the United States, Boyles said.  “However, we don’t feel that’s going to happen because they haven’t really shown much of an interest in doing that in the past,” she added.  That’s why it’s important for Stephanie Phillips, vice president of the Madison Area Democratic Women, to teach her 19-, 17- and 10-year-old children the importance of voting and knowing who the our representatives are.  More is required than simply registering to vote, Phillips said, it’s about actually voting and letting your voice be heard.  “One day this is all going to be in their hands,” Phillips said. “They’re our future.”  If people don’t teach their children how to recognize and address issues, they will not be informed and engaged voters when they get older.  “It doesn’t matter my race or ethnicity, it doesn’t matter my background or where I come from — families are important and families belong together,” Phillips said.
225	1	This is no fish story  Justin Hamlin got lucky on Valentine’s Day this year but his luck didn’t last long. He caught a record-breaking fish in Keystone Lake near Tulsa, Okla. that Friday: a paddlefish weighing in at about 157 pounds. But, alas, he could not claim the record, reports the Association of Mature American Citizens, or AMAC.  The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation made him release it. It seems that the American paddlefish is classified as a vulnerable species and so the state’s fishing regulations require paddlefish caught on Mondays and Fridays must be released. Though he can’t claim the record, he does have the satisfaction of knowing his catch outweighed paddlefish that won the state’s record of 132 pounds and the world record of 144 pounds.  ###  A virtuoso performance  How do you pass the time when you are lying on an operating table undergoing brain surgery?  Dagmar Turner played her violin. It happened at King’s College Hospital in London during an operation to remove a brain tumor, according to AMAC. Turner plays with the Isle of Wight Symphony Orchestra. Dr. Keyoumars Ashkan, who performed the surgery, explained that playing the instrument during the operation helped ensure that her musical abilities were not impaired.  Ashkan said that her tumor was too close to the parts of the brain that control motor skills.  “We perform around 400 resections (tumor removals) each year, which often involves rousing patients to carry out language tests, but this was the first time I’ve had a patient play an instrument,” Ashkan said.  ###   Pigeons power  PUTIN ordered a fly-by over downtown Las Vegas recently, but it wasn’t the Russian president. Rather, it was a group calling itself Pigeons United To Interfere Now, which outfitted each of the pigeons in the flock with red Make America Great Again hats.  PUTIN says it organized the demonstration in support of President Trump. One of the birds even wore a wig mimicking the president’s hairstyle.
114	4	IDAHO FALLS — Crowds took to the streets of US cities Saturday to demand “Families Belong Together” nearly two months after the Trump administration implemented its “zero tolerance” policy toward undocumented immigrants.  Around two dozen marchers met at the Bonneville County Courthouse at 9 a.m. and walked through parts of downtown Idaho Falls holding signs.  immigration protest  The main rally is taking place in Lafayette Square in Washington, but hundreds of marches, protests and rallies were underway across the country to call for the immediate reunification of migrant families and an end to family detentions and separations.  According to organizers, protesters have three demands:  • They want separated migrant families to be reunited immediately. • They want the government to end family detentions. • And they want the Trump administration to end its zero tolerance policy.  Chants of “Shame!” rose up from crowds in both New York and Washington as the protests got underway, while demonstrators in Atlanta carried cages with baby dolls inside.  Attendees carried signs demanding a change to the administration’s policy, or celebrating the contributions that immigrants make to the country.  “We are all immigrants,” one said.  “Seeking safety is not a crime,” another said.  “Let our children dream. Let them go!” a sign in Washington said.  And there were plenty of shirts declaring, “I really do care, do u?” — a dig at the jacket first lady Melania Trump wore while departing for a trip to the southwest border last week.  “I’m outraged that families are being separated,” said Margaret Stokes, 54, a Virginia teacher protesting in the nation’s capital. She carried a sign that asked, “Where are the children?”  “Separating families, especially young children, without a plan to reunite them is abhorrent,” Stokes said. “This is not America.  “We need to let the administration know that we will not become numb to these atrocities.”  Saturday’s protests are just the latest. On Thursday, more than 1,000 female activists marched through Washington and ended up in a Senate office building to protest the White House’s policy.  According to US Capitol Police, 575 of them were arrested.
271	2	HOLLAND, Mich. (WOOD) — Hope College students organized a march Tuesday in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  The march began at Pine Grove in the heart of Hope’s Holland campus and ended at city hall.  March organizers say their goals were to raise awareness about issues of immigration and show support for students and community members affected by the decision to end DACA.  “I think all of us are affected by this,” march organizer Alejandra Gomez Limon said. “Because whether it’s people in the Holland community, our families back home, the positive impact they make in our communities is going to be wiped away.”  DACA protects immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children.  The program won’t officially end until early 2018. In September, the Trump administration announced plans to end DACA, giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program.

217	3	AUSTIN — Nearly a year after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited El Paso and called the border town "ground zero" in the federal government's war on cartel-related crime, the Trump administration has again zeroed in on the area.  This time the government's focus is on a quiet town on the outskirts of El Paso County: Tornillo.   The city, which had a population of 1,568 in the 2010 census, will be the site of the first temporary shelters constructed for immigrant children who have been separated from their parents after entering the country without authorization.  More:US eyes Fort Bliss, Goodfellow, Dyess Air Force bases for immigrant-children tent cities  The Tornillo-Guadalupe International Port of Entry previously was the site of a tent city for an estimated 500 immigrants who entered the United States for processing and then were allowed to migrate to various states to reconnect with relatives. Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said 360 children will be placed at the Tornillo site in the coming days. More could be added in the future.   "HHS is legally required to provide care and shelter for all unaccompanied alien children referred by (the Department of Homeland Security), and works in close coordination with DHS on the security and safety of the children and community," Wolfe said in an email.   Multiple media outlets reported Thursday that tents would be used to house the children in Tornillo.   Leaders in El Paso have opposed housing children in tents or other temporary structures at military bases, going so far as to send a letter to federal officials demanding they reconsider their plans to do so.   More:U.S. attorney general calls border 'ground zero'  On Thursday, many leaders expressed outrage at the prospect of housing children in tents in Tornillo, especially considering the high temperatures in the region.   "This week we're experiencing 100- to 105-degree weather," said state Sen. José Rodríguez, D-El Paso. "You are talking about placing children in tents in the desert regions of West Texas? It is totally inhumane and it is outrageous. It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility."   The federal government has been working to identify locations for temporary housing since the administration adopted a "zero tolerance policy" for people entering the country illegally in April.   The administration pledged to intensify criminal prosecution for people caught crossing the border between ports of entry. When children cross with their families, they are separated from their parents if they are apprehended and met with criminal charges.   "It really doesn't matter where the tent cities are constructed — we shouldn't be doing this," said U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-El Paso. "We shouldn’t be separating children from their parents."  More:Trump administration may put immigrant children at Texas military bases  O'Rourke said he is joining legislation to oppose this practice of separation.  When children are apprehended at the border or are separated from their parents, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is an office of the Administration for Children and Families.   There are 100 shelters for minors in 14 different states, but the administration's new policy of separating families has left the government looking for more options for housing these children.   Officials with the Health and Human Services Department said they were considering three locations in Texas as options for temporary shelters: Fort Bliss in El Paso, Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo and Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene. Tornillo was not included on the list.   The tent structures will be at the Tornillo port of entry between the city and Guadalupe, Mexico. The port opened last year.  More:Port of Entry in Tornillo named after World War I hero  'Use of children as a deterrent' U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican who represents a large district that includes Tornillo, said he is "disappointed" in the lack of information the government is providing about the "detention situation along the border."   "The crisis along the border is not new and will continue until we have smart border security, work to address root causes of mass migration from Central American countries and have enough immigration judges to apply consequences for violation of the law," Hurd said in a statement. "Our strategy to solving our broken immigration system should never include the use of children as a deterrent.”  El Paso area lawmakers who represent the city at the statehouse on Tuesday sent a letter to federal officials condemning the proposal and the practice of separating children from their parents.   Now that a decision has been made, Rodríguez said he fully expects to see a legal challenge to the separation policy and the resulting housing decisions.   "We are going to look at everything we can to stop this outrageous proposal," he said in an interview. "All of us, it seems to be, have a responsibility to speak up, rise up and say we are not going to accept this, we are not going to tolerate this and we are going to prevent it from happening."   State Rep. César Blanco, D-El Paso, called the decision to erect tents "ridiculous" and said he plans to visit the site once it is operational to ensure that the conditions are livable.   "If there's nothing to hide and they're going to live with this decision, they need to be open and transparent," Blanco said.   El Paso County Judge Ruben Vogt said, “It’s so heartbreaking to realize where our country is right now, and the fact that we are having to erect this tent city because of a government created problem, basically.   “If we were not separating children from their families, we would not have to be erecting these tent cities, and that fact that it’s happening in our backyard in El Paso, it’s just heartbreaking, disheartening and unnecessary.”  Veronica Escobar, the Democratic nominee in the race to replace O'Rourke in Congress, said lawmakers need to take action to stop the practice of separating families and therefore lessen the need for temporary shelters in the first place.   "The family separation occurring in our country is a tragedy of historic proportions, and it's heartbreaking to know it's occurring in our own backyard," Escobar, a former county judge, said in a statement. "This policy, cruelty that was created by the Trump administration, is policy that the President can end, and one that Congress must end if he does not."  More:Veronica Escobar takes Democratic nomination for Congress, easily defeats Dori Fenenbock  Immigrant rights advocates also have denounced the administration for its "zero tolerance" attitude and the resulting separation of children from their parents.   Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso, said using tents to house immigrant children is akin to incarceration.  "We cannot have El Paso as an example of child incarceration," Garcia said, adding that he also plans to monitor operations at the temporary shelter while mobilizing activists.  The organization is planning to protest of the policy of separating children from their families Tuesday in El Paso.   "We are going to be observant, but we're also going to be protesting," he said. "This is the very last straw."
111	4	SAVANNAH, GA (WTOC) - In line with the immigration protests nationwide, protesters in Savannah descended on Johnson Square on Saturday afternoon to have their voices heard.  After speakers rallied the crowd together, hundreds of protesters marched to city hall carrying signs and chanting their frustrations.  "I couldn't imagine," said Emily Aluizo. "I have a three-year-old son so if someone were to rip away my child, I don't know how I would feel. So that's why we're here. That's the most important part, to bring those children back to their families."  The protest was peaceful.
196	4	While getting ready to head over to the "Keep Families Together" rally protesting the Trump administration's immigration and family separation policies on Saturday, June 30, I made sure I was prepared for the 90-plus degree weather. Water bottle, straw hat — check. But then it occurred to me that maybe I should carry my passport just in case I have to prove I'm a citizen.  It's come down to that. Who knows if there would be agents in the crowd, or some kind of roundup taking place? The day before nearly 600 people had been arrested at the Women Disobey rally in Washington, D.C. That's something people, particularly dark skinned people, have to think about these days. I grew up watching movies in which scary sounding Nazi Gestapo agents were always asking for somebody's "papers." More and more often I make sure I have my papers on me when I'm moving about.  As it turned out, when I joined some 1,200 to 1,500 people at Clark Park in the heart of Detroit's historically Hispanic neighborhood I didn't need a passport — although it seemed that from the number of people carrying signs that those might be required. And if you didn't have a sign, you could easily get one or help someone else hold up their banner.  LARRY GABRIEL Larry Gabriel The program featured a number of great speakers on a number of aspects of this Trumpian offensive against immigrants and a number of citizens. There were three children whose mother has been deported who graced the stage along with a number of others activists. While those were crucial statements, it seemed that everybody there had something to say. There were fervent speeches being made on every placard and banner on display there. Well, some of it was on people's attire, such as the "I really do care, do you?" response to Melania Trump's "don't care" jacket.   TOP STORIES  25 YEARS AGO, A JOE LOUIS BLOODBATH HELPED PROPEL THE DETROIT RED WINGS INTO A GLORIOUS ERA But it was the signs that made the statements of the day. One delightful rendering said it all so eloquently in one word: "RUMP." A simple deconstruction of his name placed the president exactly in the part of the anatomy where so many feel he belongs. Short even by Twitter standards, I have to admire the ability to communicate in shorthand (or with small hands).  LARRY GABRIEL Larry Gabriel "IMMIGRANTS MAKE AMERICA GREAT" was another wonderful sentiment. This gets into some testy territory, because not only do immigrants make America great, but immigrants made America, period. Were it not for immigrants, this country would not exist. Apparently immigration is only all right if it happened a long time ago, and the immigrants were from Europe.  Had the Native Americans had a policy like the ones coming from Washington, D.C. these days, they would have sent those Euro adventurers right back where they came from. Instead, they trusted some of the most vicious, violent, and greedy people in the world — and paid for it dearly by nearly getting wiped off the face of the earth. And speaking of Trump's suggestion that Mexico is sending criminals here — well, the British sent criminals here on the Mayflower among the Pilgrims.Speaking of Native Americans, one sign printed with "A NATION OF LAWS" detailed laws "that we regret" — such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the fugitive Slave act of 1850, and Public Law 503 of 1942 (Japanese internment). All of this goes to show that acts of unspeakable cruelty can all be very legal. George Zimmerman, the man who killed teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, stood on sympathetic legal ground due to Florida's stand-your-ground law. As another sign pointed out, "Everything HITLER did in Germany was legal." Hmmm.  LARRY GABRIEL Larry Gabriel Moving on, "ICE BELONGS in the FREEZE" was a very popular sentiment. In fact ICE caught a lot of comments, with signs reading "NO to ICE," "Melt ICE, Not Icecaps," and the punchy "No WALL, No JAIL, No ICE." On a day that was so hot I wanted ice, I had to remind myself that this ICE is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency that has been cruelly separating children from their parents when they come to the border seeking asylum. A terrible thing — or as one sign reminded us, "This is not normal, This is not okay."There was a great conversation going on with the signs, though one of the most welcome signs on this sweltering day of action was "Free lemonade + voter registration." That pretty much works in tandem with those that read, "Remember their cries in November," and "make your voice count, VOTE." Those point to the strongest solution we have at hand — vote for people who oppose the Trump administration's policies in this fall's election. Vote, vote, vote. The best way to beat the vote suppressors is to get up and vote.  LARRY GABRIEL Larry Gabriel And just to remind us of the immorality of the problem we are facing, one sign put it this way, "Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl." As it stands now, it could be a case of heaven help us. That help will come in the form of a wall of voters standing between us and the Rump.
5	4	HELENA — Nearly 200 people braved bone-rattling cold Friday in a grass-roots protest of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry into the United States by citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  The rally, held on Last Chance Gulch, was held in single-digit chill as the ban faces legal challenges nationwide. It sparked large protests last week in several major U.S. cities.  On Friday, U.S. District Judge James Robart of Seattle issued a nationwide restraining order blocking the travel ban, KOMO news reported.  Annie Hanshew organized the Montana for Immigrants event with the help of friends.  “We are just normal everyday folks upset with what President Trump did,” she said.  People gathered on Last Chance Gulch on Friday for a Helena rally opposing President Donald Trump’s recent executive order. People gathered around the yellow trolley in front of the Windbag Saloon and Grill, some clutching signs that read: “I love my Muslim neighbor” and “We the people are greater than fear.”  Judy Hart of Helena said she was there “Because I believe in our open policy.”  Hart said the country already vets immigrants.  “The ban is against what we stand for,” she said. “I don’t know what more we can do.”   John Driscoll of Helena said he was there “Because it’s time to say the emperor has no clothes.”  He called Trump a “fool.”  Katherine Haque-Hausrath said came to the rally to make a statement.  “We’re standing up against bigotry and the incompetence of the executive order last week,” she said. “People will die because of this ban.  “We are sending a message to our elected representatives we are watching them. Immigrants are an important part of our state,” Haque-Hausrath said.  Alex Street brought his bundled-up son, Jack, 4, to the rally.  “I’m an immigrant,” Street, who is from England, said as he then pointed to his son. “He is a second generation immigrant. Immigration is good for our country.”  Rachel Carroll Rivas, co-director of the Montana Human Rights Network, encouraged the crowd to contact U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Steve Daines.  Grace Johnson holds 3-month old Ziva Grossmann during Friday’s rally opposing President Donald Trump's recent travel ban. She also told them to support local organizations such as the MHRN and the ACLU of Montana.  Hanshew said afterward the turnout was bigger than expected.  “We thought it was going to be a group of our friends, but it spread like wildfire on Facebook,” she said. “It speaks well of the Helena community.  “It was a good turnout for something around zero (degrees),” she said.   Hanshew, a historian, said the event was not only a protest, but it was also an appreciation of immigrants.  “Montana is made up of immigrant stories and I wanted to celebrate that,” she said.  “It was sweet, simple message,” she said.  Hanshew said her group is also monitoring a proposed bill now working its way through the state Legislature which prevents state judges from applying foreign laws in their courtrooms. Some people have labeled the law as anti-Muslim.
14	4	Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near the White House on Saturday in protest of raids following President Trump's executive order ramping up immigration enforcement.  Holding signs bearing calls to resist the Trump administration's "anti-immigrant" policies, some 200 protesters chanted "here to stay" and "undocumented, unafraid."  The protest, called together earlier Saturday, capped off a week marked by the first large-scale enforcement of Trump's Jan. 25 executive order cracking down on the roughly 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.  Trump has vowed to deport 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records, but the sweeping immigration enforcements raids this past week have been criticized by activists and Democratic leaders.  U.S. immigration officials arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants across the country this week in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta and New York.  At least 161 arrests were made in Los Angeles and 200 were made in Atlanta, though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials did not say many arrests were made in total.   One by one on Saturday, speakers took turns voicing concerns that their friends and families could soon become targets of federal immigration agents.  "These are the same raids that are terrorizing our entire community," said Deyanira Aldana, one of the speakers at the rally. "Rogue ICE agents come into our places of work, into our homes, into our neighborhood spots, and wait for our community to be vulnerable."  As the sun began to set Saturday evening, the crowd broke from its position on the east end of the White House and marched through the surrounding streets, briefly blocking traffic before ending on the west end of the building.   "Trump's goal for the next four years will be to expand the term 'criminals,'" said Ambar Pinto, another speaker. "It's a duty to resist. It is a duty to be the opposition."  At several points during the rally, which was organized by activists with United We Dream, protesters acted out scenarios demonstrating allegedly intimidating treatment by immigration agents.  Trump promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration during his White House campaign and has vowed to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a tougher position on illegal immigration.

12	1	Perhaps the most remarkable show of militant self-activity, yet one of the least discussed, is the Rundberg Rebellion of February. In response to the ICE crackdown on undocumented immigrants and recent raids, a spontaneous mass protest developed over multiple nights among the Latinx community at the intersection of North Lamar and Rundberg. This would come to be unlike any protest held by either liberal activists or the traditional Left. Dozens to hundreds of people filled the intersection, waving the flags of various countries. Many ran laps around the intersection, jubilantly dancing, clapping, and chanting things like “No rules, No ICE, let’s fuck this shit up!” As people took over the street, many stopped their cars and joined the action. Rather than another overdone street rally, the revolt took on a jubilant and defiant nature as an entire community manifested its social life in the intersection.    The police came out in full force and riot gear, terrified of the true potential of the insurrection that was developing, but they could do little but watch. Their arrival produced confrontation, with the militant youth launching water bottles and whatever debris they could find. While many Austin revolutionaries had arrived to participate alongside the community, they were not the first to mask up—it was the youth who donned masks and initiated confrontations, contrary to the assertions of many activists who have claimed that masking (and even militancy) are alien to Latinx and immigrant communities. These young insurrectionaries even defended the other militants against the anger of others who wanted the protest to retain a more peaceful, controlled nature. Though massively outgunned, the revolt did not need to defeat the police militarily because it had already won at a social level. The consistency, the social connections and community produced in that space—which one comrade described as “reclaimed…totally autonomous from the State”—ensured that the State could not penetrate or reclaim the territory until the people dispersed of their own volition.  Fireworks lit up the night and the celebratory crowd—with some reports even saying that a building and a cop car were burned over the weekend. Music blared through the night and produced a full-fledged dance party in the street. In an intersection ringed by riot cops people danced and sang along to “Fuck Tha Police.” Despite attempts by some to turn this into a moment to proselytize about their revolutionary program, the insurrectionaries maintained a jubilant and joyful revolt. They learned their politics not through lectures or books but by through experimentation and actualizing their capacity to hold space, through the rhythms of music and the movement of their bodies. Eventually though, this moment came to a close as over the next week the energy dissipated back into the community, the streets were not as filled, and the police seized upon certain community “representatives” to control the event while claiming that the confrontations were the result of “outside agitators.” We of course know that this is a lie—a racist lie that obscures the militant desires and self-activity of the exploited and excluded against the white supremacist State—and we know that the insurrection lives on in the community, in organizational efforts like the Instituto Tejano, and that it can always reactivate.
16	1	MOUNT VERNON, Wash. - Hundreds of demonstrators participated in a peaceful five-mile march from Burlington to Mount Vernon Sunday.  Demonstrators gathered at Mount Vernon Courthouse after the march, voicing immigrant and farm worker rights. Nearly 700 people attended the march.  The demonstration comes a day after protesters in Bellingham blocked a section of Interstate 5, causing a four-mile backup and a rollover accident that sent a woman to the hospital.  Burlington and Mount Vernon police provided 12 additional officers to staff Sunday's march from Burlington to Mount Vernon, citing concerns that I-5 could again become a platform for protest.  Authorities from the Washington State Patrol were also at the march.  Around 100 people were at the protest in Bellingham Saturday, blocking traffic on I-5 near Lakeway Drive. The demonstration led to a three-car accident, WSP said. A woman in the crash was hospitalized with minor injuries.  Authorities Saturday had a difficult time gathering enough officers to respond to the protest, WSP Trooper Axtman said, which delayed response time and allowed the protest to go on longer than expected.  Axtman said State Patrol did not feel safe confronting the protesters if they were outnumbered. State Patrol ended up borrowing troopers from as far south as Snohomish County.  It's illegal for pedestrians to be on the interstate. WSP is investigating and may make arrests early this week.  No arrests were made during Sunday's march from Burlington to Mount Vernon.  State Senator Doug Eriksen told KOMO Sunday he plans to push through a bill that would make it a felony charge for protestors to illegally ‘obstruct economic activity.’  “I support the right to peacefully assemble,” said Eriksen. “[However] You do not have the right to go block a major interstate and cause accidents and harm to other people. That's just wrong.”  Eriksen said yesterday’s protest would be such a case where protestors should be charged as they were blocking a major interstate.  The bill is currently in a State Senate Committee, but Eriksen said the bill should move forward to avoid events like yesterday’s from happening again.
163	3	NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Labor unions and civil rights groups staged May Day rallies in several U.S. cities on Monday to denounce President Donald Trump’s get-tough policy on immigration, a crackdown they said preys on vulnerable workers in some of America’s lowest-paying jobs.   Protesters gather at McArthur Park for the May Day protest march in Los Angeles, California, U.S. May 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kyle Grillot Protests and marches challenging Trump’s efforts at stepping up the deportation of illegal immigrants drew crowds by the thousands to the streets of New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with smaller gatherings popping up across the country.  A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travelers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees.  But the primary impetus cited by civil liberties and labor activists was Trump’s strict new immigration enforcement policy - falling most heavily on undocumented workers who toil in low-paying, non-unionized sectors such as fast-food, hospitality, child care and agriculture.  A May Day gathering grew unruly in Portland, Oregon, where a group of black-clad protesters roamed downtown streets in the late afternoon, setting fires, breaking storefront windows, throwing projectiles and vandalizing a police cruiser.  Police, referring to the perpetrators as “anarchists,” said they made more than two dozen arrests.  Nine people were also arrested in Olympia, the state capital in Washington, where protesters threw rocks, bottles and pepper-spray at police officers and broke the windows of downtown businesses, according to a Fox affiliate.  Rallies elsewhere across the country were boisterous but mostly orderly, even festive.  In some cities, immigrant-run convenience stores and other businesses closed their doors in solidarity with the May Day rallies, and many protesters themselves gave up a day’s wages to make their voices heard.  “Money will come back later, but not this opportunity, not this day,” said David Anaya, 44, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who chose to forfeit the $300 he would have otherwise earned at his job as a welder.  He was one of thousands who gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of “resistance, unity and defiance,” then set off on an animated but peaceful march across town to City Hall.   Slideshow ( 14 images ) A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington’s Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House.  ‘NOT AMERICA ANYMORE’  Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo WFC.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members.  The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York’s co-director of organizing.  “The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities,” Lopez said.  May Day, also known as International Workers’ Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries.  May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police.  The U.S. protests focused on Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars from “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate.  Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was “disgusted” by Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and workers’ rights.  “I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It’s not America anymore,” she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan.  Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.
53	2	Children who took off school, parents who took off work, immigrants and children of immigrants took to the streets in St. Paul on Thursday to protest policies by President Donald Trump they say are harming immigrants and refugees.  The march on the so-called “Day Without Immigrants and Refugees” started in the Dayton’s Bluff neighborhood with a few hundred people gathered near the corner of East Seventh and Hope streets near the offices of the Mexican Consulate in St. Paul.  Led by drummers and dancers, the group started marching down East Seventh, past an Asian grocery store, an Ethiopian evangelical church, Carbone’s Pizzeria, Swede Hollow Café and Alimama’s Mediterranean Grill, which specializes in sambusas, a snack typically eaten during Ramadan.   They carried handmade signs saying, “#DumpTrump,” “Brown and proud,” “Immigrants make America great” and “Make America kind again.”  The largely Hispanic group carried American flags, but also flags from Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador and Guatemala. They chanted in English and Spanish: “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here,” and “Aqui estamos, y no nos vamos,” or “We’re here to stay.” They cheered at the supportive honking from cars that drove by.  RESTAURANTS CLOSED Dozens of restaurants were closed as the campaign encouraged immigrants to refrain from dining out and making purchases. Across the country, immigrants stayed home from school and work to show how critical they are to the U.S. economy and way of life.   Fast-food giant McDonald’s even had to close some of its locations because employees did not show up for work, Business Insider reported Thursday.  In the Twin Cities, St. Paul institutions El Burrito Mercado and Boca Chica Restaurant & Taco House were closed, as were Blue Plate Restaurant Co. sites and St. Paul’s Black Sheep Pizza.  “Since we are a family of community restaurants, we listened to our community. And believe we are strongest when we are united. Because of that, we’ve chosen not to be open tomorrow,” stated a post from Blue Plate Restaurant Co.’s Facebook page for Bottle Rocket in St. Paul.  In addition to Bottle Rocket, Blue Plate restaurants closed Thursday in St. Paul include Groveland Tap and Highland Grill. The company’s restaurants in Minneapolis, Edina and Maple Grove also were closed.  “A Day Without Immigrants” actions also were planned in Philadelphia, Washington, Boston, Houston, Chicago, New York and other cities. The protest gained momentum on social media and by word of mouth.  It comes in response to President Donald Trump, whose administration has pledged to increase the deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally. Trump campaigned on building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and blamed high unemployment on immigration. As president, he’s called for a ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries from coming into the United States.  Some schools and day-care centers also were closed, with teachers reporting low attendance numbers, on social media.

Gilligan said she was marching for “equality, respect and to not live in fear.”  “My dad would be proud,” she said.  “I thank them for their courage and hard work,” Gilligan said of her family. “Without them, I wouldn’t have my life today.”   Jimmy Patiño brought his daughter, Lunabella, 10, and son, Jimmy, 12, to the march. Patiño, a University of Minnesota professor in Chicano and Latino studies, carried a sign saying, “No human being is illegal.”  “No human being is inherently illegal,” he said. “It’s a dehumanizing use of words.”  Patiño said, “Any attack against immigrants is also code for attacks against the Latino community.”  He said concerns of Latinos also intersect with people from predominantly Muslim countries facing travel restrictions.  “I’m here because I’m an immigrant. I’m here because I believe in justice and equality,” said Norma Atuesta, a nurse from St. Paul. “This president is bringing out the worst in human beings. The worst.”  Sisters Angelica Hernandez, 15, and Melissa Hernandez, 18, of St. Paul, came to the protest with their mother.  Angelica said their immigrant parents aren’t stealing jobs. “We’re here for a better life,” she said.  Melissa Hernandez said this was the second protest she’s attended. The first was the Women’s March in Minnesota the day after the inauguration.  “We’re making a difference. We’re letting our voices be heard,” she said.  Peter Zeftel, 61, of Minneapolis, marched with a sign attached to his walker saying, “Hitler came for my relatives. No one stopped him. Stop Trump’s attacks on immigrants.”  “Trump is attacking the least popular people,” he said. “These people are just working hard to make a living.”
118	3	Rally held for Highland Park dad detained by ICE while dropping kids off at school By Jade Hernandez Monday, March 6, 2017  EMBED <>MORE VIDEOS  A rally was held in downtown Los Angeles for Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant who was detained by ICE agents while dropping his girls off at school in Highland Park.  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- About 75 people gathered in Pershing Square on Monday to show their support for an undocumented immigrant who was detained by agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while dropping his children off at school.  Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez, 48, was detained by ICE agents Tuesday while dropping his daughters off at school in Highland Park.  His arrest was captured on video by his 13-year-old daughter, Fatima Avelica, who could be heard sobbing as agents took her father away.   EMBED <>MORE VIDEOS  While being dropped off at school with her sisters, 13-year-old Fatima Avelica recorded her undocumented father being picked up by agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   While Fatima Avelica was too distraught to speak during the rally, one of Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez's other daughters spoke to the crowd.  "My dad is very strong and that's why we are here. To be strong for him, and as a community we can do big things," she said.  The father, who the family's attorney said has paid taxes in the U.S. for 25 years, remains at a detention facility outside of Los Angeles.  "I was in grade school when he arrived in this country. He's paid his taxes, and he and his family have raised four beautiful U.S. citizen daughters. (They're) strong, independent women who are making the best of their community and rising to leadership levels," attorney Peter Greyshock said.  MORE: Mayor Garcetti speaks out about ICE arrest of Highland Park father  Those gathered on Monday urged ICE agents to use their discretion to keep a father with his family in the United States.  An emergency immigration town hall meeting was held in South Los Angeles later in the evening. Rep. Karen Bass said the video is one example of why fear is spreading in the U.S.  "The way the guidelines read - they are so general - that any jurisdiction could interpret it the way they want, and they can essentially say, 'if you're here illegally, you are a criminal,'" she said.  Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez's legal team has applied for a U-visa, which would keep him in the U.S. under special circumstances. His attorney said the approval process could take up to four years.  A meeting will be held Thursday to inform South L.A. residents about their rights should they face any deportation issues.
137	3	Parents, sons and daughters, observers, politicians, activists and educators were just some of the people that could be seen Saturday afternoon along West Ludington Avenue, holding signs, clapping, cheering and waving to passersby in the 90-plus-degree heat.   Though the 150 people gathered Saturday afternoon in Rotary Park came from a wide array of backgrounds, they united with the one goal: to speak out against immigration policies that lead to the separation of children from their families.  Ludington joined thousands of communities across the nation in holding Keep Families Together demonstrations to protest current policies, shouting chants like “Love not hate makes America great,” and “Make America moral again.”  The protest was organized by Kate Glancy and Logan Walworth of Ludington.

229	2	Luis Tapia, a junior at Horlick High School, speaks Tuesday at a rally before getting on a bus to travel to Washington, D.C., to protest for immigration reform. Tapia is one of about 60 Wisconsin residents planning to participate in the protest on Wednesday in Washington. Racine Mayor Cory Mason, right, speaks Tuesday to Horlick High School students at a rally outside the school before some of the students were to travel to Washington, D.C., to protest for immigration reform on Wednesday. RACINE — While most students exited Horlick High School to head home Tuesday afternoon, a few dozen stayed back to voice their support for immigration reform.  “Today I’m leaving Horlick High School because I’m going to go even higher — by going to Washington, D.C. I’ll continue to fight for myself, for my friends and for my family,” said Luis Tapia, a junior at Horlick. “We’re all going to Washington, D.C., as one.”  The students were rallying outside of Horlick, 2119 Rapids Drive, to bring attention to the issue of immigration.  Tapia, along with about 60 other people from Wisconsin, was to travel by bus Tuesday night to Washington to advocate for immigration reform and a “clean” DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship to undocumented individuals who were brought to the United States as children (often referred to as “Dreamers”) and protection for their families.  The students going on the trip planned the rally in front of the school Tuesday as a send-off before the long bus ride to the East Coast, where they were to join other protesters from across the country on Wednesday in the nation’s capital to lobby for passage of the DREAM Act. Racine Mayor Cory Mason attended the rally on Tuesday and thanked the students for their activism and told them “know you’re always welcome here.”Ricardo Torres covers federal, state and Racine County politics along with the Village of Mount Pleasant. He bleeds Wisconsin sports teams.  “I hope this is what my kids want to do when they’re in high school,” Mason said. “This is about achieving the American dream. All you want to do is be here, succeed in school and achieve the American dream like every other generation of immigrants that came before.”  Horlick teacher Aaron Eick also was present and voiced his support for the action the students were taking.  “It’s very important that these kids are going to D.C. to represent us and, as a teacher, I’m very proud to say that we stand with these children,” Eick said. ‘I want to show others how to be a leader’  Valeria Ruiz, organizer with Youth Empowered in the Struggle and a Horlick alum, has been to the nation’s capital “more than six times” to participate in protests for immigration reform.  When Ruiz was in high school she was active in the same cause.  “Now five, 10 years later, I’m an organizer and I’m again taking a delegation of not only (House Speaker) Paul Ryan constituents but also Dreamers and undocumented folks and their parents to D.C. to advocate for the same thing we were advocating for a long time ago,” Ruiz said.  Although the students will be missing a few days of school, Ruiz said “they’re not going on vacation.”  “They’re going for a reason … they’ll get the experience of people power, of community organization,” Ruiz said. “I’ve already gone through this leadership (experience) and I want to show others how to be a leader and develop them into strong leaders.”
2	1	In major cities and tiny towns, thousands of marchers gathered across America, moved by accounts of children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the latest act of mass resistance against President Donald Trump's immigration policies.  Here in Fresno, about a thousand people rallied together for today's "Families Belong Together" protest.  The protest is on the southeast corner of Blackstone and Nees.
222	3	 San Diegans protest GOP tax bills, ending of DACA By: Emily Thode Posted at 11:30 PM, Dec 04, 2017 and last updated 2017-12-05 02:36:16-05  SAN DIEGO (KGTV) -- Dozens of protested the Republican tax bills moving through Congress and the phasing out of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program by White House.  “I came out to support protesting the tax scam. But, when I came out I saw people protesting in support of the dream act, so I wanted to support them as well.” Louise Metter said.  The two smaller groups of protesters teamed-up to become one larger protest.  They repeated chants, including, “The people united will never be divided,” “Hey, hey, ho, ho, the tax scam has got to go,” and, “We support the dreamers.”  One protester, named Ali, said he was brought to the United States illegally at the age of four.  “When DACA passed, I was able to come out of the shadows. I was able to go to school. I went to UCLA and graduated top of my class. I was able to volunteer at hospitals," Ali said. "They treated me like a criminal before."  The so-called "dreamers" want lawmakers to pass legislation to protect them from deportation as the White House phases DACA out.  The protesters upset over the tax legislation fear that the bill will benefit the rich at the expense of those who are middle and lower income. Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

200	4	This story has been updated to reflect that Jen Strebs is a member of Kalamazoo progressive organization ProKzoo and that Kalamazoo County has cancelled its Commission meeting for July 3.  With temperatures in the 90s and the sun blazing, hundreds of people gathered in Kalamazoo's Bronson Park on Saturday to call for changes to U.S. immigration laws and policy.   The "Families Belong Together" rally focused on the Trump administration's recent practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico Border. But some demonstrators carried signs calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be not just abolished, but "prosecuted."   Jen Strebs, a Kalamazoo Township trustee and a member of Kalamazoo progressive group ProKzoo, which helped to organize the rally, called for Kalamazoo County Sheriff Rick Fuller to pledge non-cooperation with ICE. She urged the crowd to turn out for a Kalamazoo County Commission meeting this Tuesday, where a resolution on border separations is on the agenda. UPDATE: The County Commission has cancelled its July 3 meeting due to a train derailment in downtown Kalamazoo.  Strebs opened the event by noting that the land that is now Bronson Park was taken from the Pottawatomi. "No one is illegal on stolen land," read one sign.   Other posters addressed the theme of family separations: "Kidnapping is illegal," "Children should not be pawns" and "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, are they sleeping near or far?" While Trump has signed an order ending the policy, thousands of children have not been returned to their parents.  When asked what brought him to the rally, Kalamazoo Public Schools teacher Alfredo Aleman spoke of his elementary school students, many of whom he says are immigrants. But he also spoke about his parents.  "My dad was an undocumented worker. So was my mom, right after World War II. He was thrown back across to Mexico with my mom as well. My mom almost drowned in the Rio Grande River and she tells me these stories as we're watching the current events unfold on television," he said.  "It's very heart-wrenching for her as well as well as myself because I see the emotions that arise in her and I can't imagine that here we are, revisiting this again in 2018," he added.  Aleman said he hoped that people from all political parties would recognize that "children are children."  A Kalamazoo woman named Jen who was staffing the cool-down tent echoed that hope. Jen did not give her last name because, she said, she might have issues with her employer.   "I'm a mom. I have kids, I cannot imagine not knowing where they are or if they're okay, and not knowing if I'll ever see them again. So for me, it's very simple," she said.  At the end of the rally, a woman waved to demonstrators from a window at First Congregational Church: Saheeda Nadeem, a Pakistani woman who faces a deportation order for overstaying her visa. Nadeem raised her children in Kalamazoo and one of them is buried here. She has been living at the church since March in the hopes of avoiding removal.
15	3	“Galvanized by the images and voices of immigrant children separated from their parents by President Trump’s immigration policies, hundreds of thousands took to the streets Saturday in major cities and small towns across America to expressed outrage that they hope will carry over into the fall election,” reported the LA Times, June 30.  Idyllwild residents were no exception. Rallying support for “Families Belong Together,” Harmony Monument acted as ground zero at 10 a.m. Saturday, June 30, leaving little question that upwards of 175 residents demand immigration and refugee policy changes at U.S. borders.   Idyllwild-area residents gathered in front of Harmony Monument at 10 a.m. Saturday to do what thousands of people are doing all across the U.S. — marching in opposition to President Donald Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policy. Between 100 and 200 people marched from the monument through Strawberry Creek Plaza, along the Fort and up, then down, North Circle Drive. Photo by Becky Clark Led by a consortium of local community activists, the Idyllwild march became a flashpoint for placards and posters, with the chanting, “No hate! No Fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” Bronwyn Jones states, “I love this mountain village and the wonderful people who live, love and work here.”  Marching and chanting in unison, the group circled through Strawberry Creek Square, across the front of the Fort, up North Circle Drive and ultimately returned to the monument. Participants sporting Idyllwild Indivisible T-shirts mingled between participants carrying signs saying “What if They took your Children?” and “Practice Aloha.” Temple Har Shalom fielded a sign reminding “First they came for the children,” followed by “We are all family,” “I care! Do U?” “Proud Americans do Care” and “Proud Americans for family unity,” “Human Rights, Truth and Compassion.” Even children carried signs saying, “Families belong together.” “Resist; Grab ’Em by the 2018 Mid-Terms” and “We are all Immigrants” were common themes.  What is the takeaway from an epoch mobilization of free speech across the U.S. and in Idyllwild under the banner “Families Belong Together?” The National Domestic Workers Alliance Political Director Jess Morales Rocketto stated, “I have literally never seen Americans show up for immigrants like this.” But the subject is far from resolved.  Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that to date, MSNBC reports about 500 families have been reunited, yet thousands of children remain estranged from their families.
250	2	Berkeley College Republicans, or BCR, held a candlelight vigil for Kate Steinle on Thursday evening, garnering criticism from local activists.  The vigil took place on the steps of Sproul Hall, where participants laid down flowers and candles in memory of Steinle, who was fatally shot in San Francisco in 2015. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who was initially charged in connection with Steinle’s death, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges Nov. 30. BCR held the vigil in light of Garcia Zarate’s acquittal, according to BCR external vice president Naweed Tahmas.  “We were appalled and disappointed by the decision not to charge (Garcia Zarate) with murder or, at the very least, manslaughter,” Tahmas said. “We don’t want her name or memory to be forgotten.”  BCR arranged candles to spell out Steinle’s name and, according to Tahmas, organized a signed poster to send to the district attorney in the hopes that their condolences would reach the Steinle family. BCR organized the event without the family’s coordination, although Tahmas said BCR had tried to reach out to them.  About 20 people attended the vigil, which was met with both support and opposition from local activists. Raphael Kadaris, a member of Refuse Fascism, condemned BCR for politicizing Steinle’s death. He and two other members of the group held banners to demonstrate their support of immigration.  “These people don’t care about Kate Steinle,” Kadaris said. “They are using the tragic death of Kate Steinle to incite hatred and bigotry against immigrants.”  A crowd formed around Kadaris, whose banners accused Republicans of justifying “ethnic cleansing” and called for an end to the Donald Trump-Mike Pence administration. Kadaris also initiated an argument with the Refuse Fascism protesters about fascism. Bay Area resident Jeanne Solnordal, who said she attended the vigil because of the “unfair” verdict, engaged with Kadaris in debate and said she found his presence “disrespectful.”  BCR member Chase Aplin said he believed that the jury’s decision was an “injustice.” Aplin said he also believed “political vindictiveness” against Trump motivated the jury’s decision to release Garcia Zarate.  “Certain deaths should be politicized,” Aplin said. “This is a death that if the policies I support were in play, she would still be alive.”  Cal Berkeley Democrats president Caiden Nason briefly attended the event and expressed disapproval at the organization of the vigil, which he claimed “politicized” Steinle’s death against her family’s will.  Nason alleged that BCR was not hosting the event out of “the kindness of their heart,” but in order to provoke a response.  “I think there are good questions about whether the verdict was right, but this is not an immigration case and shouldn’t be turned into one,” said Nason. “A protest is only going to further politicize this awful thing that happened to this family.”
49	4	On a normal Thursday, the aisles of E & L Supermercado in southwest Detroit are usually busy with shoppers.  The popular grocery store on W. Vernor Hwy is known for its diverse selection of items, including marinated meats in a 16-foot wide butcher's counter that many Mexican-Americans flock to.  But today, the doors were shut at the store on W. Vernor Hwy as were about 100 other businesses along the commercial strip in Detroit's Mexicantown and in other Latino neighborhoods in southeastern Michigan. Concerned about what they see as increasing attacks on immigrants and Latinos, they joined protesters across the U.S. who marched or shut down businesses to take a stand on what they called a "Day Without Immigrants."  Waving American flags and holding signs that read "Stop Deportations" and "Stop Separating Families," hundreds walked along Vernor through southwest Detroit. Some chanted "Si, se puede," (Yes, we can) as they spoke out against what they say is a crackdown against immigrants and discrimination against Mexican-Americans.   And in Pontiac, about 500 people rallied this morning, marching from a local park to City Hall. Many were protesting what they describe as aggressive sweeps of Hispanic residents by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in recent weeks.  From Ypsilanti to Detroit to Pontiac, restaurants, car dealerships and groceries closed their doors to send a message of support to immigrants, said organizers. Others gathered in Clark Park in southwest Detroit in the heart of the city's Mexican-American community to call for respect of their rights. And some students didn't attend school today, instead taking part in the protests.  Also read:   National Day Without a Woman set for March 8  Many of the businesses shut down today were run by Latinos and immigrants, some of whom feel under siege after executive orders on immigration recently signed by President Donald Trump. They're also unnerved by reports over the past week of raids against undocumented immigrants by federal immigration agents.   We "demand respect for our rights and to unite the immigrant communities," said Maria Sanchez, who helped organize the march in Detroit.  "We're very worried for the families who are being separated and for the pain that families are going through."  “The goal for today is for the President to notice how important Immigrants are for the country and for the economy and how bad it would be for the economy if immigrants weren’t in this country,’’ she said.  Watch: 'Day Without Immigrants' protest  Maria Sanchez, community leader who helped organize "Day Without Immigrants" protests in southeastern Michigan. Photo taken on Feb. 16, 2017, in Detroit. Other businesses that closed include the popular Mexicantown Bakery, car dealerships, and Mangonadas Del Barrio, which serves snacks and desserts.  On its Facebook page, Mangonadas Del Barrio said: "We join the cause a day without immigrants we are Mexicans that day by day we work for a better future. And above all respect our Mexican roots."  The protests were not just about immigrants, but about the identity of Mexican-Americans, including those who are U.S. citizens and have lived in the U.S. their entire lives. They're concerned about the rhetoric against Latinos made by some government officials.   A grandchild of immigrants from Mexico, Martha Contreras, 50, of Pontiac, closed down her Del Pueblo Tortillas and Grocery, a specialty food market, today to attend the rally. She said she knows she’s missing out on business, but she wants to make point.  “We are all united today,” she said.  Contreras’s grandparents emigrated from Mexico in the 1960s. She was born in Chicago and said she’s not afraid for herself because she’s an American citizen. But she said she has friends who are fearful for family members, including an undocumented man she knows who was arrested recently in Pontiac and taken to a federal detention center.  “He was going to get his tools to go to work when they grabbed him,” Contreras said. “My father is 82 and he said he’s never seen it like this.”  Pontiac Mayor Deirdra Waterman addressed the rally and said she plans a meeting with community leaders to discuss the way residents are being treated.  “I think people are just fearful and this has stirred up a lot of emotion and anxiety,” she said. “We are proud of the cultural diversity. I will speak in defense of that.”
108	1	An estimated crowd of several thousand people marched peacefully Saturday morning in Atlanta as part of a national effort to spotlight U.S. immigration policies that are separating children from their parents.

Russell Federal Building.
195	2	MONTPELIER - More than two dozen protesters showed support Monday for two immigrant dairy farmers arrested after marching to a Ben & Jerry’s factory to call for better pay and living conditions on farms that provide milk to the ice cream maker.  Mexican immigrants Yesenia Hernandez-Ramos and Esau Peche-Ventura were arrested Saturday and were being held on immigration charges, the Vermont Department of Corrections said.  Scores of dairy farm workers and activists marching in Montpelier, Vt., on Saturday June, 17, 2017. They were marching to the main Ben & Jerry's factory in the Vermont town of Waterbury to protest what they feel are slow negotiations to reach a deal on their "Milk with Dignity" program that would ensure fair wages and living conditions. Ben & Jerry's spokesman Sean Greenwood says the company is committed to reaching a deal with workers. U.S. Border Patrol representatives said the farmworkers were stopped by an agent during a routine check near the U.S.-Canada border.  RELATED:Scores of farm workers, activists march on Ben & Jerry’s  "They appeared to the agent to have come across the border," said Brad Brant, special operations supervisor at the Border Patrol station in Swanton.  "As part of routine operations, the agent stopped the vehicle and during questioning determined the occupants may be illegally present in the U.S.," the U.S. Border Patrol said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Stephanie Malin. "The two occupants were taken to the Border Patrol station for further investigation where they were arrested for immigration violations."  The pair was turned over to the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.   RELATED:   Dismissed charge. Still jailed. Here's why. Released Migrant Justice workers speak out at BTV rally Activists march on Ben & Jerry's The immigrant rights group Migrant Justice said the farmworkers were arrested as they were returning to the farm where they work and live in Franklin County.  Protesters demonstrated Monday afternoon outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans and in the morning at a correctional facility in South Burlington where Hernandez-Ramos was being held.  “We were there to denounce the arrest of Esau and Yesenia and to call on ICE to use their discretion to release them back to their families, back to their community so they can continue to live and work in Vermont and continue to raise their voice for their dignity and human rights,” said Will Lambek, an organizer for Migrant Justice.  The state has about 1,000 Latino farm workers working or seeking work, and many are in the country illegally.  Migrant Justice says several of its leaders have been targeted for arrest by ICE in the past year.  The boundary marker cut into the forest marks the line between Canadian territory on the right and Vermont on the left. Among them were Enrique Balcazar and Zully Palacios, who protested Monday. They were arrested in March and released later that month.  Lambek said a lawyer had met with Hernandez-Ramos and Peche-Ventura on Monday.  A Ben & Jerry’s spokesman said Saturday before scores of dairy farm workers and activists marched 13 miles from the Statehouse to the Waterbury factory that the company was eager to reach an agreement with farm workers, and negotiations were underway.  Members of Migrant Justice demonstrate outside the Ben & Jerry’s scoop shop in Burlington during the ice cream company’s Free Cone Day on Tuesday, April 4, 2017. The Milk with Dignity program was created in 2014 by farmworkers and Migrant Justice to ensure that farms provide them fair wages and working conditions and decent housing. In 2015, Ben & Jerry’s agreed to join the program. Since then, the two sides have been negotiating over the details.  Ben & Jerry’s released a statement Monday in response to the arrests:   “We are concerned that hard-working, productive members of our community, who contribute to the success of dairy farms in Vermont, would face criminalization,” it said. “We need policy change that serves Vermont’s dairy workers, farmers, and industry as a whole.”
242	2	OAKLAND PARK (CBSMiami) – Protesters gathered outside Senator Bill Nelson’s office in Coral Gables on Wednesday to demand action on DACA. Local DACA recipient Nery Lopez isn’t cheering  a federal judge’s decision to block the Trump administrations plan to phase out protections for undocumented dreamers.  Her parents brought her from Mexico to Florida when she was four.  She’s a junior at Florida International University living in legal limbo.  “My permit expires in a year and I only have about three semesters left and I don’t know if I’ll be able to graduate on time if something happens and I lose my status,” Lopez said.  Lopez and a dozen other demonstrators talked their way into Senator Nelson’s Coral Gables office Wednesday afternoon.  They say they’re upset Nelson didn’t tie his support of the federal government spending bill to the Dream Act, which would protect childhood arrivals from deportation.Nelson said he’s all for the Dream Act and is pushing to get it passed.  But for the estimated 20,000 dreamers in Florida, there’s a fear time is running out.  Elizabeth Blandon is a South Florida immigration attorney who has represented hundreds of DACA recipients.  She’s calling the latest court ruling a ‘temporary victory.’  “This is gonna battle out in the courts for a few years, unless congress decides earlier, which I hope they will,” Blandon said.  She also said dreamers need to follow whatever path to citizenship may work, and it starts with talking to an Immigration lawyer. “If you can get DACA, great,” she said. “But even if you can, there might be other things we can do for you. If you never go speak to an immigration attorney, you will never know.”

254	2	‘Infeliz Navidad’: DACA Recipients Sing Protest Carols at Texas Governor’s Mansion  Texas’ approximately 110,000 DACA holders have no idea if or when Congress will assure them a future in the U.S.  by Gus Bova  December 5, 2017, 9:25 PM, CST  Around two dozen immigrant rights activists sang Christmas carols outside the Texas governor’s mansion Tuesday evening as a reminder that nearly 700,000 young immigrants nationwide face an “infeliz navidad” if Congress doesn’t find a solution for DACA. President Trump is set to terminate the Obama-era program, which allows immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to live and work in the country, on March 5.  “As you see behind me, [Governor Greg Abbott] is ready for Christmas and the holidays,” said Luis Ortega, volunteer director of Immigrants United, as he gestured toward the wreath-draped mansion. “A time that should bring joy and comfort, but for many of us it will be a cheerless holiday.”      "Infeliz Navidad": Carolers gather at Texas governor's mansion as reminder that "Dreamers" may face holidays full of uncertainty.      Posted by The Texas Observer on Tuesday, December 5, 2017  Ortega, 23, is one of around 110,000 current DACA holders in Texas hoping for Congress to clear up their futures. Some have already lost their benefits either by failing to meet an October deadline or through official mishandling, and if lawmakers don’t act by March 5, DACA recipients will see their work permits start expiring at a rate of nearly 1,000 a day nationally.  Ortega, who’s lived in Texas since he was 5, works full-time in retail and studies in Austin’s community college system, on top of directing his nonprofit. He says he applied to renew his DACA status before the Trump-mandated deadline in October, but he has yet to receive his new work permit, which expires December 29. He said he fears the document won’t arrive in time and he’ll lose his job. “That will be the last day I can work legally and help support my family,” he said.  Yuridia Loera, a 22-year-old activist with the immigrant rights group United We Dream, was also present Tuesday and said she has yet to receive a permit that she applied for in April. Her authorization is now expired. Luis Ortega.  Gus Bova  Ortega and Loera were joined in downtown Austin Tuesday evening by a small crowd that shivered against a cold front as they sang their modified holiday songs of protest. In their rendition, the classic “El burrito de Belén” changed to a song of popular resistance: “con mi protesta y mi pueblo, voy camino a mis sueños.”  The future of the “Dreamers” is currently shrouded in congressional bickering. Congress members have introduced various measures that could offer a path to citizenship for DACA recipients and other immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. The preferred vehicle for many immigrant advocates is the Dream Act of 2017, which offers the least onerous path to status.  Meanwhile, Congress faces a December 8 deadline for passing a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, and Senate Republicans will need at least eight Democratic votes to do so. Some prominent Democrats, such as California’s Kamala Harris and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, have pledged not to vote for any spending bill that lacks a DACA fix.  On Monday, U.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, blasted them on the Senate floor. “That’s simply a hysterical and cynical ploy – putting their party and their agenda ahead of the nation,” he said. The Senate Majority Whip argued that lawmakers could easily assemble a DACA solution in January or February, and there was no need to risk a shutdown.  But advocates are wary of letting a decision slip into the new year. “If Republicans somehow manage to kick the can to next spring, what’s predictable is that they’ll load up an inadequate DACA fix with enough poison pills to ensure opposition,” said the pro-immigration reform group America’s Voice in a statement Monday.  Cornyn is also co-sponsor on a bill introduced Tuesday that would pair border security measures with a three-year extension of DACA that Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice Education Fund, has called “a witch’s brew of nativist poison pills topped by a stingy, temporary three-year reprieve.”  [Image: Will Hurd — trump] U.S. Representative Will Hurd, R-Texas  Office of Will Hurd  On Tuesday morning, 34 House Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan supporting a DACA fix before the year’s end. Two Texans signed the letter: retiring Congressman Joe Barton, and Will Hurd, whose District 23 spans one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the state’s most competitive. Though the Republicans fell short of promising to withhold votes on the upcoming spending bill, House GOP leadership currently favors a version that would extend only through December 22, which could create a second chance to include the immigration legislation.  Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration for its handling of the DACA program. The administration has fought to halt discovery in those cases to avoid releasing documents relevant to its deliberations on the policy. The Justice Department most recently filed with the U.S. Supreme Court to stymy a suit filed by six “Dreamers,” which accuses the president of “unconstitutional bias against Mexicans and Latinos.”  United We Dream, which has held frequent actions targeting members of Congress, held a die-in Tuesday afternoon outside the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Julieta Garibay, a Texas organizer with the group, said Tuesday they have actions planned targeting Texas Congress members as well, including Hurd and Representative John Culberson, a Houston Republican.

61	4	Hundreds braved the heat and gathered in West Hollywood today to join a nationwide call to action with a Families Belong Together rally to protest against the immigration crisis caused by the Trump Administration with their disastrous and inhumane family separation policy at the country’s borders.  West Hollywood councilmember Loren Meister lead the call for humane and sane immigration policies at the West Hollywood Park on San Vicente Boulevard. Her line of speakers ranged from activists, entertainers, politicians, WeHo city officials and WeHo residents. Speakers included Chaz Bono, Rob Reiner, West Hollywood Mayor John Duran, Sepi Shyne, Eugene Jarecki, long time WeHo resident Ivy Bottini, Steve Rohde and Michael Aguilera, and District Representative for Congressman Adam Schiff.   “Thousands of children are still in facilities far away from their parents,” said Congressman Schiff, via a written statement read by Aguilera. “Despite statements to the contrary by the president, it is unclear when they’ll be re-united and if the administration truly ended its cruel policy of family separation. Congress must hold this administration accountable and I’ll continue my work with colleagues to find a compassionate immigration policy. Remember West Hollywood, this policy was not an accident. We remember when Mr. Kelly talked about how this would be deterrent, this was on purpose and it meant to be cruel and we cannot stand for that in West Hollywood or across the country.”   Ivy Bottini – Photo by Paulo Murillo Another speaker who made an impact was longtime human rights activist Bottini, who pulled no punches when addressing the crowd.  “I probably won’t be too popular for saying what I’m about to say, but we really are a lazy community,” she yelled from the podium. “We have been too safe for too long and we think it’s how its going to stay. It’s not going to stay. We are on the brink of losing it. And there will people in this community. In this crowd that will not vote in November!”  Then she led the crowd in a chant of “Shame! Shame! Shame!”  “If you haven’t voted and you aren’t registered, please do so,” she stressed. “November is so important. At 92, it feels like this is where I’m supposed to be saying this: Get off your asses and bring back Act Up. Bring it back! Bring it Back… they were fearless. Fearless! I don’t want to hear after the vote in November that we lost. And then I don’t want to hear people say, ‘Oh, I was so tired. I was so tired and it was only one vote…’–yes, it could be the one vote. All you need is one to have a majority. I’m on your tail and I’m watching you.”   West Hollywood Council Member Lauren Meister – Photo by Paulo Murillo Councilmember Meister also had a moment of silence in memory of the five people that were murdered in Thursday’s horrific shooting at the Capital Gazette in Indianapolis Maryland. It was also a show of solidarity and support for the free press.  Signage at the rally did not mince words. They varied from, “Save Children, Dump Trump,” “Who Would Jesus Deport?” “Jail Trump’s Kids” “Kids Aren’t Criminals, Trump Is,” and some signs simply read “Fuck Trump.”  The event ended with the crowd singing This Land is Your Land–a folk song written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940.  Families Belong Together protests happened nationwide following the executive order that Donald Trump signed this week, which keeps kids imprisoned indefinitely, and doesn’t reunite thousands of separated families. Though it is not a solution to the crisis created by Trump and his administration, it does show that public pressure is working. To continue the pressure for justice, thousands of people across the nation gathered to say that families belong together—and free. Most of the events were organized at act.moveon.org.
131	1	QUINCY, IL — Nationwide demonstrations protesting the policy of separating immigrant families at the border reached the Tri-States in downtown Quincy.  Protesters held signs and shouted phrases like "civil rights are human rights'.  Katherine Daniels helped organized the event.  "As part of the administration's "zero tolerance" approach to illegal immigration, children have been separated from their families at the border while the parents are held for prosecution. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that nearly 2,000 children had been separated at the border over the period beginning April 19 and ending in May. An unknown number of children taken from their families in June. There is no current plan to reunite these children with their families. Even though the revised policy claims it will reunite families, it may still incarcerate the whole family," said Daniels in a statement regarding the event. On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order that said families should not be separated, but confusion over the policy still remains.
33	1	BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. – A bicyclist was killed after he was hit by a school bus on Bonita Beach Road at Orr Road just east of I-75 early Thursday morning.  The crash happened around 4:30 a.m. when a school bus driver crashed into the back of the bicyclist who was riding in the outside lane of Bonita Beach Road, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.  The bicyclist later identified as a 59-year-old Estero man was thrown from the bike in the crash.  Troopers said the man was pronounced dead on scene. An incident report shows he was not wearing a helmet.  A 16-year-old Bonita Springs boy was on the bus at the time of the crash.  The bus driver was identified as a 53-year-old Fort Myers woman, according to FHP. Both the woman and the teen were uninjured in the incident.  A second bus later arrived on the scene to pick up the student, witnesses said. School officials said the student and the bus were headed to Dunbar High School.
292	3	A group of Rockland residents turned out Saturday, June 2, to protest an "activist training" session led by a state legislator known for his anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim views.  The location of the Maine First Project event, organized by state Rep. Lawrence Lockman, a third-term Republican from Amherst, was kept secret. He recruited people via the internet, but people who wanted to attend had to send him private messages in order to be approved for the session.  Becca Glaser of Rockland, along with her father, City Councilor Ed Glaser, were among the protesters who turned out at noon Saturday at the Rockland Public Library, where they had heard the training session might be held.  "The Maine First Project was keeping a tight wrap on the location, as they know their racist, anti-LGBTQI views are not popular in Maine, so even if they are not at the Rockland Public Library, the group will rally to show our values for diversity and inclusivity — a welcoming Maine with room for all of us," Becca Glaser said in a written statement handed out at the protest.  "The responsibility of all caring people is to show up and speak out against the creep of anti-immigrant racism and other bigotry disguised in the cloak of what it means to be a Mainer. We will not let their voice be louder than ours! And we ultimately hope that their empathy will come to be expanded to understand there is enough for all of us, and that we are much stronger when we expand the circle of who we care about," she said.  Rep. Paula Sutton, a first-term legislator from Warren, attended the training session.  "I made a short presentation on the topic of rank choice voting to a group of people who were attending a training class on political networking and marketing," Sutton said Sunday in an email response to the Courier-Gazette.  On her Facebook page, Sutton said it was a civilized event with about a dozen people in attendance.  On Monday, Sutton responded to the issue of immigration.  "I warmly embrace all legal immigrants and am a regular at a few locally owned businesses run by new immigrants. I applaud their business skills and entrepreneurial pursuits, whether they have a seamstress shop, a restaurant or nail salon, as those are the places I patronize regularly," Sutton said.  "It may serve your readers if you could keep the differences in mind between illegal and legal immigration. This detail seems to be strangely overlooked at times and is quite important," she said.  The Maine First Project mission includes ending refugee resettlement programs and any assistance to communities that accept immigrants. The Maine First Project also posts links to Maine First Media, which features anti-Muslim videos and stories.  Those stories include ones with headlines such as "Exposed: Open-border leftists plot to invade rural Maine with Muslim refugees."
69	2	The Day Without Immigrants protest shut down businesses nationwide last week, but it didn’t come without some consequences for a handful of workers who decided to take part in the demonstrations.  Dozens of workers said they lost their jobs after taking part in Thursday’s protest. The boycott was aimed squarely at President Trump's efforts to step up deportations, build a wall at the Mexican border and close the nation's doors to many travelers. It was unclear how many participated.  Twelve Latino employees from the I Don’t Care Bar and Grill in Tulsa, Okla. told Fox 23 News they were fired over text message because they didn’t show up for their shift and failed to let their employers know about their absence. The employees told the station they expected to be reprimanded, but not dismissed.   The firings led to an outcry in the community.  “If you have 12 people who feel strongly and want to make a stand, I think management should have taken a look at that and at least stood by them or give them some time,” Catherine Bishop, of Broken Arrow, told Fox 23 News.  The restaurant had already posted on Facebook seeking employees for its open positions.  Meanwhile, Carmen Guerrero, an immigration activist told the Philadelphia Inquirer that six people were fired from their jobs at a Bahama Breeze in King of Prussia for taking part in the protest. Guerrero said when the workers heard of the protest, they decided to join in and when they showed up Friday for work they allegedly were told they couldn’t enter the building.  Bahama Breeze spokesman Rich Jeffers told the paper that “no one was ever fired.” Guerrero said the workers told her that they were all rehired “to make it look like nothing happened.”  According to News Channel 5, 18 workers from Bradley Coatings Inc. were let go. The workers told the station they told their employer they would be joining in the nationwide protest on Wednesday and when they returned to work Thursday they were informed they had been fired.  "We are the team leaders directly under the supervisors and they informed us last night that we could not go back to work and the boss said we were fired," one employee told the station.   An attorney for Bradley Coatings said in a statement that the employees were told they would “need to show up for work (on Thursday) or they would be terminated” because of the “time-sensitive” job they were assigned to. The statement contended that the firings had nothing to do with politics.  Encore Boat Builders LLC, based out of Lexington, S.C., had 21 workers who didn’t show up for work Thursday. WLTX-TV reported they were told not to participate in the demonstrations or face termination and when they failed to show up, the company followed through on its threat.  Six staff members at a Bonita Springs, Fla. daycare quit, Rev. Jeremy Walker, who runs the day care, told NBC 2. However, two workers said they were fired for wanting to join the protest, while four others claim they resigned after the others two were fired.  Several students also participated in Thursday’s protest. There were no immediate estimates of how many students stayed home in many cities. Many student absences may not be excused, and some people who skipped work will lose a day's pay or perhaps even their jobs. But organizers and participants argued the cause was worth it.  Marcela Ardaya-Vargas, who is from Bolivia and now lives in Falls Church, Virginia, pulled her son out of school to take him to a march in Washington.  "When he asked why he wasn't going to school, I told him because today he was going to learn about immigration," she said, adding: "Our job as citizens is to unite with our brothers and sisters."  Carmen Solis, a Mexico-born U.S. citizen, took the day off from work as a project manager and brought her two children to a rally in Chicago.   "I feel like our community is going to be racially profiled and harassed," she said of Trump's immigration policies. "It's very upsetting. People like to take out their anger on the immigrants, but employers are making profits off of them. "  The Associated Press contributed to this report.
