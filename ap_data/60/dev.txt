148	4	MIAMI (WSVN) - Rallies in Homestead, Downtown Miami and Fort Lauderdale marked International Workers Day, Monday, as many focused on immigrant workers and their contributions to South Florida.  Hundreds of people gathered at the Downtown Miami rally at 5 p.m., at the Stephen P. Clark Center, to show support for immigration, immigrant workers and oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.  “Coming together to demand the attacks stop on immigrants,” said Helene O’Brien of SEIU chapter 32BJ.  One young girl taking part in the rally in Downtown Miami spoke about her fear of losing her undocumented parents. “Sometimes I have nightmares that ICE will come and take my family away,” she said.  “I will keep fighting for my family because we are here to stay,” she said, before urging other demonstrators to chant with her. “Repeat with me, folks: We are here to stay!”  In Homestead, marchers chanted about a united community on the national day of action for immigrant rights. Dozens gathered at Homestead City Hall with a focus on farm workers.  “We are here, and it’s time for this country to recognize our labor and to give us permanent protection, respect and dignity,” Jose Ruiz, a marcher, said.  The rally comes during a stressful time for undocumented immigrants fearing deportation under the Trump administration.  Archbishop Thomas Wenski appeared at a May Day event at Miami-Dade College.  “Too many people in the community today live in fear,” Wenski said. “This community needs relief; it needs immigration reform that is humane and just.”  At the event, Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado offered immigrant families a symbolic key to the city to welcome them and honor their contributions in South Florida.  “The City of Miami will remain a city that welcomes immigrants,” Regalado said.  A May Day rally also took place in Fort Lauderdale, Monday night.
89	3	A protest in downtown Louisville against the Trump administration’s immigration policies splintered in two Saturday as half of the crowd abandoned the organized rally to instead march to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, chanting "shut down ICE!” along the way.  Many among the crowd, which reached into the hundreds, appeared confused by the sudden division.  But Isai “Izzy” Sanchez, 20, who called for the spontaneous march, said the move was necessary.  'Families Belong Together' rally at Metro Hall in downtown Louisville, Ky.  June 30, 2018 "I look at our local politicians not reflecting what their constituents think,” Sanchez said from a podium atop the steps of Metro Hall. “A compassionate city or mayor would not hesitate when it comes to the sanctuary of others.”  Sanchez joined roughly 200 others in the half-mile march from Metro Hall to the ICE offices on Seventh Street. There, several other speakers criticized Democratic Mayor Greg Fischer for not declaring Louisville a sanctuary city and for allowing Louisville Metro Police to assist federal agents.   Nationally:'Where are the children!' Families Belong Together rallies take over US  Earlier coverage:Trump administration says Louisville is not a sanctuary city and complies with federal law  State Rep. Attica Scott, also a Democrat, was among the critics.   “Make sure you go down to Metro Hall, make sure you confront the mayor and Metro Council every chance you get, and say to them, ‘Make Louisville a sanctuary city,’" she said.    A sanctuary city is considered one that defies federal law by shielding immigrants who entered the country illegally from being deported.   Fischer changed the city's policies last year to prohibit Louisville police from working with ICE on their sting operations. Metro Council solidified that change by approving an ordinance that forbids Louisville police from helping immigration agents unless a judge signs a warrant or if federal officials alert police of a risk of violence or larger danger to the public.   While the U.S. Department of Justice initially threatened to cut some federal public safety grants over that police, this year those same federal officials announced reviewed the ordinance and decided Louisville was not a sanctuary city.  In a statement to the Courier Journal on Saturday, Fischer said sanctuary city is "a political term."  "Louisville is a city of compassion, a global and welcoming city whose population growth has largely been fueled by internationals," Fischer said. "... We continue to stand with our foreign-born neighbors while humanely complying with all applicable laws."  Earlier in the day, Fischer participated in the rally outside his office at Metro Hall. Speaking to the hundreds who remained after the protest split in two, Fischer spoke out against President Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policies, including those that in recent months have separated migrant parents from their children.  The rally was among more than 600 "Families Belong Together" marches planned across the country on Saturday.  Faced with widespread criticism of the family separations, Trump issued an executive order on June 20 to stop the practice. A federal judge has since ordered the government to reunite children under 5 years old with their parents within 14 days and all other children within 30 days.  Immigration advocates say thousands of children remain in limbo, staying in foster homes or detention centers while waiting to be reunited with their parents.  Story continues below gallery   On Saturday, protesters chanted for an end to family separation.  Most were clad in white, a color organizers said would demonstrate the solidarity of activists across the country. Many sought refuge from the sweltering heat in the few pockets of shade available. At least one woman received medical attention due to heat exhaustion.  As U2’s “Beautiful Day” pumped from speakers perched atop Metro Hall's steps, Art Baltes paced back and forth below holding a banner that read “Immigrants and Refugees Welcome.”  Baltes, of Louisville, said his Catholic faith spurred him to attend the rally.  “That’s exactly where it starts — our faith,” he said. “We just want people to know that people in this town support immigrants and refugees.”  Fred Nett, also of Louisville, held a poster of Lady Liberty that read “freedom for all.”  Migrant families separated at the Mexico border “should be reunited immediately,” he said.   Sanchez, who called for the crowd to march to ICE, said the second protest wasn't intended to sow division.  Instead, Sanchez said he hoped it would draw attention to grassroots organizations such as Mijente that advocate for Louisville's immigrant and refugee communities on a daily basis.   Sanchez, a student at the University of Louisville, came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was a toddler. As a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient, his legal status is uncertain due to the Trump administration's policies.  “The real action will come from people who dedicated more than one afternoon,” he said.”
132	1	Using Tax Day as a backdrop, hundreds of people protesting President Donald Trump's visit to a Wisconsin manufacturing company urged him to release his returns, admonishing the president with signs, chants, and even an inflated chicken supposed to bear his resemblance.  Trump had his own crowd of supporters outside Snap-on Inc. in Kenosha Tuesday, where he signed an executive order to tighten the rules for technology companies seeking to bring highly skilled foreign workers to the U.S.  Before his arrival at the tool-making company, protesters gathered at Sunnyside Park and lined nearby streets with signs that criticized several of Trump's policies. The protests started with a march of solidarity with undocumented immigrants.  The president's refusal to release his taxes was at the center of the protest, with Americans facing the deadline to file their own.  "Release Your Tax Returns! What or Who Are You Hiding," read one sign. "Grab him by the 1040," read another, a reference to raunchy comments Trump made about women during a 2005 taping of "Access Hollywood.  Tom Gilding, a retired high school teacher who was among the protesters, said Trump's decision not to release his taxes shows a lack of transparency in his administration. Gilding helped hold up an inflated chicken that was about 10 feet tall and meant to serve as an effigy of Trump. Gilding, 65, had a sign that read "What are you afraid of, Donald? Release your taxes."  "If the chicken could say anything, he would say that," he said.  Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin in November, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since 1984.  His promise of returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. resonated with voters such as Chris Manoyan, 54, who joined the crowd of about a hundred Trump supporters gathered across the street from Snap-on while Trump was inside. Manoyan took time off from her job as a property manager to show support for Trump, waving a blue "Make America Great Again!" flag.  "I think he's done a lot in a short period of time. I think he's doing a good job," she said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Drew Angerer/Getty Images 59of59  Armed with signs and a megaphone, a few DACA recipients took to the streets of Laredo in a demonstration to raise awareness about their status and demand that officials advocate on their behalf.  The Laredo Immigrant Alliance, a group led by DACA recipients and allies, organized a rally Tuesday afternoon outside of the local office of Congressman Henry Cuellar. They then marched to the Joe A. Guerra Public Library. Bystanders cheered as they drove down Calton Road in support of the rally.  RELATED: Judge temporarily preserves DACA program, blocking Trump plan  Jose Luis Saldaña, one of the organizers, said the main goal behind the event was to alert the public on how Laredo is getting involved.  "This is not only for big cities like Washington, D.C. They all are doing something for Dreamers. It's actually also small towns like Laredo, we also have Dreamers and especially in Webb County where we have 6,000," Saldaña said. "This is mainly to alert the community about what's happening. Many don't know."  According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 1,300 people were registered under DACA in Laredo as of Sept. 4. Across Texas, there were 113,000.  Saldaña, 22, was brought to the United States when he was 2 years old. His family is from San Luis Potosi, a Mexican state in which over 45 percent of the population lives under the poverty line, according to the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy.  "I am worried simply because this DACA permit basically allows us to be here as immigrants. We are undocumented, but we do have that permit that allows us to work here, which is basically our lives. We live here, we work here, we contribute to the economy," he said. "If that ends then what are we?"  Saldaña said he found out he was undocumented in 2015 after graduating from LBJ High School.  "My mom broke it down for me, no San Antonio for me, no nothing else," he said, referencing that he can't travel into the interior U.S., pass the Border Patrol checkpoints.   After that, he said his mother filed the paperwork to register him under the DREAM Act and since then he has been able to maintain a job. Saldaña was able to renew his permit two months before President Donald Trump decided to put an end to the program. His permit expires in 2019.  "I am planning to stay here and hope nothing goes wrong, abide by the law. This will leads us back to the shadows, back to being afraid again. We have our local policemen out here to support us. We don't want to be afraid of them," Saldaña said when asked what were his plans if he wasn't able to renew his DACA status. "There is no plan B until now. Hopefully I get to go to college. I do want to go to college."  Another rally participant and Dreamer, Alberto Castillejo Morales, said he had recently traveled to Washington, D.C. and is ready to go again next week with United We Dream, a national organization that develops campaigns to fight for justice and dignity for immigrants at the local, state and federal levels.  "Most Dreamers I've met in Washington, they are Americans without papers," Castillejo said. "But living on the border, you see the diversity, you see it's not normal to have Border Patrol, is not normal to have militarization of the border. This thing shouldn't be normal. We should be supporting trade, supporting bridges, not walls, which is so pathetic to me. But I am excited to go next week to Washington, D.C. and talk with senators and hopefully get a DREAM Act passed or something."   Castillejo, who was 7 years old when he came to the United States, said he considers himself Mexican but adopted by the U.S. He is in the process of transferring to Texas A&M International University.  Ena Vega, another Laredoan who is going to D.C. next week to lobby on behalf of Dreamers, was holding a sign with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's office phone number. She was asking the community to call their elected representatives and pressure them to find a solution for the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who will lose their legal status.  "I encourage everyone witnessing this to step up and come with us and not just fight for DACA people, but fight for immigrant rights, because we are humans and this is not just a political issue, this is a community issue," Vega said.   We need to stand up for each other and fight for what we think is right.  "I am a DACA recipient, so I am fighting for my right to be here, because nobody can tell me where I belong and where I don't. It's just a paper. It's just a matter of a paper being signed for me to be a citizen. I've been here half of my life and the other half I was a child so I don't remember much. This is where I was raised. This is where I want to be. I don't want to go back to somewhere that I am not familiar with."
60	4	Diego San Luis Ortega has lived in Visalia for as long as he can remember.   He grew up attending local schools, playing on Visalia sports teams and is actively involved in the community.   The 21-year-old is also a DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipient. With that has come challenges and an underlying fear of the unknown.  More recently, his undocumented status, immigration and the separation of families have become heated topics of discussion for millions of Americans.   It's a conversation San Luis Ortega and his family have to take extremely seriously.   "With the 'zero tolerance' policy and the crackdown on illegal immigration, my family has come up with a plan just in case we do get separated," he said. "My parents, at one point, did plan on self-deporting. That hurt a lot."   Daphne Valencia holds up a sign at the Visalia Families Belong Together Rally at the intersection of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue on Saturday, June 30, 2018. An 'unacceptable' policy  San Luis Ortega will not remain silent, he said.   "DACA changed my life in a way I never thought it would change. With DACA came the possibility of me finally being able to do more community service, help out more," San Luis Ortega said. "Now I have the opportunity of advocating with CHIRLA (Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles). Through them, I found my voice. Having DACA rescinded kind of gave me the confidence to be the light for people who are still afraid to come out."   San Luis Ortega chose to be a light alongside 200 other local activists at the Visalia Families Belong Together Rally Saturday morning.   The activists joined thousands across the country to protest President Donald Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy.  Organizers say the gatherings provide a forum for people to call out the president's broader push to limit legal and illegal immigration, from his controversial travel ban to his ending deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants.   On Saturday, local protestors met at St. Paul's Episcopal Church before heading to the busy intersection of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue.  Tulare Councilman Jose Sigala joined activists at the church.   "It's about us having humanity, about us having compassion, about us taking a stand for what's right and fighting against what is wrong," Sigala said. "We've all seen those horrible stories of children being separated from their families, of children crying. Imagine yourself as one of those children, not knowing what's going to happen."  Your stories live here. Fuel your hometown passion and plug into the stories that define it. Create Account Sigala said what is happening with the "zero tolerance" policy is unacceptable.   "They may obviously give these children clothes and food, but what they're taking away is their spirit, their faith in humanity," Sigala said. "We're all here today because we believe in families. We believe that these families should be together."    Once out on the street, activists waved signs, chanted in unity and held up peace signs to cars as they passed.    More than 200 activists participate in the Visalia Families Belong Together Rally on Saturday, June 30, 2018. Locals, who held signs and chanted at the intersection of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue, joined thousands protesting across the country. Drivers honked their horns and waved as they drove through the intersection.   Local activist Lali Moheno, who helped plan the rally, stood alongside the activists. She said she was pleased that so many people came out to support.  "It's very significant to the people of Tulare County because this county's known to be a conservative county and, like you see right now, it's not. There are two sides," she said. "This city is very strong and supportive of the children. I think it's really significant that the people came out to show that. We're very pleased with that and we hope that we get to show some of that in November — that power. We're ready for it."   San Luis Ortega, who will transfer to Sacremento State University in the fall, said he is proud of the people who stood alongside him at the rally.   "It motivates me to see this," he said. It makes me think 'OK, now I need to get more people involved.'"   His number one goal: to make sure everyone who can vote, votes.   "To people who say this won't affect you, it will affect you in different ways," he said. "And to the people who think voting doesn't change anything, voting does change."
221	2	The anguish was obvious as Francisco Serrano spoke haltingly about losing his brother through deportation and watching his parents fret over their future as they applied for permanent residency after the loss of their temporary protected status as Salvadorian nationals living in the U.S.  “The whole process was hard on us,” said Serrano, a Bowling Green native. “I felt hopeless, I felt there was nothing I could do. It’s hard seeing my three nieces grow up without their father and it’s hard not having my whole family together.”  Serrano helped organize a rally Saturday morning outside U.S. Sen. Rand Paul’s State Street office to protest the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents in recent weeks at the border, one of the effects of the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policy requiring the arrest of anyone crossing the border illegally.  The reunification of separated families has been slow to occur despite the president recently signing an executive order stopping further separation of families and a federal court ruling last week that requires the government to reunify families separated at the border.  Bowling Green joined hundreds of other U.S. cities Saturday in holding demonstrations united under the slogan “Families Belong Together.”  “Welcoming the stranger, showing hospitality to foreigners and extravagant generosity are non-negotiables in the Bible,” said Rev. Megan Huston of First Christian Church.  More than 200 people were estimated to have attended the downtown rally, which occurred in stifling heat approaching 90 degrees late Saturday morning.  Several demonstrators held hand-made signs bearing messages that included “love has no borders,” “reunite families now” and “save democracy, stop fascism.”  “Just because you have a piece of paper that says you have status, that doesn’t make you more of a human than someone who does not,” Serrano said.  Speakers gave passionate addresses about advocating for the rights of immigrants.     “I cannot imagine the pain that mothers and children are going through by being separated,” said Julia Rivas, a Bowling Green resident whose family emigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador when she was a child.   advertisement Salvadorians are the largest group to have temporary protected status, due to families fleeing a civil war that wracked the nation for more than 12 years.  The U.S. government announced plans to discontinue temporary protected status for Salvadorian nationals this year.     Rivas said that more recent asylum-seekers are fleeing poverty and crime in El Salvador.     “Some of these families are facing violence and protecting their children from being taken into gangs, they have no option but to try to protect their children and themselves,” Rivas said. “It’s been extremely hard for me to see everything that’s going on, it hurts me so much as a mother. However, we see young leaders trying to make a change and that gives me hope.”  Patti Minter, Jeanie Smith and Dana Beasley Brown, all candidates for state or local office, exhorted those in attendance to organize and advocate for changes to federal immigration policy.  Sabina Husic spoke of her family’s experience in Bosnia during the Srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 Muslims in 1995 during the Bosnian War.  Husic never saw her grandfather alive again after Srebrenica and was almost separated permanently from her mother.  “Separation is a traumatic experience,” Husic said. “Even if they were to be reunited, the pain never goes away, the fear of losing your family never goes away.”     Addi Hernandez of Bowling Green said after the rally that she was “pleasantly surprised and overwhelmed by the support” shown by the community.  Hernandez, whose family brought her to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 2, spoke during the rally about the desperation felt by many immigrants seeking asylum here.  “It really gives you strength and courage to stand up for what’s right when you see all the support from the community,” Hernandez said after the rally.
139	4	WASHINGTON — "We're here today because there are a lot of parents who can't sing their kids to sleep tonight," Lin-Manuel Miranda told the crowd at Saturday's Families Belong Together rally protesting the Trump administration policy that has separated more than 2,000 immigrant children from their parents after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.   ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE READING "They can't sing their kids lullabies so I'm going to sing a lullaby I wrote," the "Hamilton" creator said before launching into an a capella version of "Dear Theodosia," the musical's ode to the young children of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Halfway through, the crowd had joined in, singing, "We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you. If we lay a strong enough foundation, we’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you. And you’ll blow us all away."  Backstage after his performance, Miranda told USA TODAY that the family separation policy "flies in the face of everything this administration purports to stand for: family values and keeping families together."  He continued, "They’re coming seeking asylum. There’s a poem that says, ‘The woman who puts her child in the water only does it because it’s worse on land.’ And so to treat them with even more monstrousness? We have to fight for who we are as a country."  Miranda's father Luis, who accompanied him to the event, came to the U.S. in his 20s from Puerto Rico and is now a consultant to the Democratic party, so his family is of one mind on the immigration debate. However, not all Americans are in that situation. What advice does he have for the people who were watching in the crowd or on TV who struggle to discuss the policy with conservative family members who support President Trump's administration and its "zero tolerance" policy without descending into shouting matches?  Celebrities show up for the Families Belong Together march                1 / 12 × Alex Brandon, AP Stars are showing up and speaking out at the Families Belong Together marches across the United States, which protest the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, including Lin-Manuel Miranda who sang during the rally in Washington, D.C. "You have to say, 'What if this was me? What if this was me separated from you? Or you separated from your parents?' You have to put yourself in the shoes of your fellow humans," he advised.

Ads By Connatix Illegal immigration:  Separating the facts from fiction  Miranda, who has two young sons himself, said he was at the rally because "I gotta look my kids in the eye when they’re old enough to understand this, and I want to say I was on the right side of history."  Although the president signed a June 20 executive order ending the separations, followed by a June 27 federal court ruling ordering that children under five be reunited with their parents within 14 days and those older within 30 days, Miranda says it's not enough.  More:  Trump administration argues it can detain migrant children and parents together without time limits  "I don't think we're not going to stop marching and protesting until these families are reunited and I don't think they've made any plans for that," he said. "All evidence suggests they haven't. We want transparency and we want to see these families reunited."   After the Justice Department argued Friday that it can detain immigrant families together indefinitely, Miranda says the Families Belong Together movement also wants "absolute humane treatment of those who come seeking asylum. That's one of the promises we export as a country. We need to uphold those values."
259	2	Advocates and church leaders across East Tennessee are offering support for immigrants and their families after a federal immigration raid that rounded up nearly 100 people last week.  Members of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, along with family and friends of those arrested, held a prayer vigil at 6 p.m. at Hillcrest Elementary School in Morristown to decry "the unjust separation of families" caused by Thursday's raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Southeastern Provision, a Grainger County slaughterhouse near Bean Station, Tenn. The raid has been called the region's largest such roundup in the past decade.   "My husband was detained," said Elisabeth Morales in a statement provided by the coalition. "I have been 20 years in Morristown. All my children were born here. My husband is sick. He has diabetes. We're worried about him that they're not treating him very well."  The statement doesn't list her husband's name or state his immigration status. Sister shows of support  The Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville held a "sister vigil" to the Morristown event at the same time — 6 p.m. Monday — at the sanctuary, 2931 Kingston Pike.  "It'll be a time of prayer and reflection, but also of action," said the Rev. Chris Buice, the church's pastor. "It's really kind of an open expression of being a good neighbor. The Bible instructs us to welcome the stranger in our midst, for by doing so we may be entertaining angels unawares.  "What we're seeing is a very painful reckoning because our elected leaders have kicked the can down the road and postponed action on immigration reform. Now we have mothers and fathers separated from their children and spouses separated from each other, and this was completely avoidable."  About 50 people gathered Monday morning outside the Knoxville ICE office on Prosperity Road for an hourlong vigil of prayers and songs, organized by Allies of Knoxville’s Immigrant Neighbors, another advocacy group.  “There were a lot of people in the Knoxville community understandably that were very upset and were interested in demonstrating our support and love and our community commitment," said organizer Meghan Conley.  Contrary to some claims, Grainger County schools haven't seen a jump in absences since the raid, Director of Schools Edwin Jarnagin said. Details on absences for neighboring Hamblen County weren't immediately available.  "Our initial reports of absences that may be related to this are probably less than 10 percent," Jarnagin said. "We've had counselors and other faculty members on hand for students who need them." Churches, nonprofits call for action  St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Morristown was among the houses of faith and community organizations offering Hispanic families help after the raid. Knoxville’s St. James Episcopal Church announced after the raid an offering would be taken at its Sunday services to go to St. Patrick’s Hispanic Emergency Fund.  The nonprofit Hispanic Outreach Leadership Association of Lakeway, or HOLA Lakeway, in Morristown organized a GoFundMe page to help detainees’ families. In two days, 534 people raised $36,067 — more than $6,000 over HOLA Lakeway’s $30,000 goal.  Bishop Richard F. Stika, whose Knoxville-based diocese includes Grainger and Hamblen counties, said in a statement the arrests “placed an unnecessary stress on vulnerable families.” He said a lack of “common-sense solutions” by government leaders about immigration means “families suffer and people live in the shadows.”  Stika said he remains “inspired by the inspired by the tireless and faithful work of many volunteers who gathered to assist families at St. Patrick's to provide “services, food, water, personal supplies and love to all of the men, women and children who have been affected."  “Over the past few days, I have said that our response to this incident isn't about politics or personal agendas. It's about being the face, hands, feet and heart of Jesus — at all times and to all people,” the bishop said. Paperwork and profits  Agents held 86 people for checks on their immigration status after Thursday's raid, with 54 of those detained for further immigration proceedings, according to ICE. Another 10 face criminal charges in U.S. District Court for defying deportation orders. One worker faces state charges, with no further details given by ICE.  Agents seized paper and electronic records as part of a federal probe into whether the plant's owners, James and Pamela Brantley, hired undocumented immigrants to duck turning in payroll taxes, court records show. The Brantleys haven't been charged.  IRS Criminal Investigation Agent Nicholas R. Worsham wrote in a search warrant the Brantleys have been hiring undocumented immigrants since 2008 and hiding it from the IRS. The warrant claims the Brantleys used their daughter and other employees in the scheme, lied to the IRS about how much they paid themselves and American employees, filed false tax returns and exploited the plant's largely Hispanic and undocumented work force. Payroll and pollution  The Brantleys withdrew more than $25 million in cash from bank accounts since 2008 “for payroll,” according to court records. The couple withdrew $10.9 million in cash from 2013 to 2016 but reported paying workers only $2.5 million to the IRS, according to the search warrant.  The $8.4 million difference would translate to pocketing $2.5 million in unpaid taxes, Worsham wrote in the warrant.  Records show Southeastern has a history of sanitation and safety violations. In March, the plant's septic system failed, leading to the contamination of well water in the surrounding area by coliform and E. coli bacteria.  The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ordered the plant to shut down its underground wastewater system and haul its waste to an offsite treatment facility.  Residents were forced to use bottled water as authorities worked to help them install treatment or tie onto public water systems.
4	4	Hundreds of students, faculty and Manhattan residents braved freezing temperatures Wednesday evening to attend the MHK Solidarity Rally, which later turned into a march on Anderson Avenue, in Bosco Student Plaza in protest of President Donald Trump’s executive order that limits immigration from certain Middle Eastern countries.  At the rally, Marjan Habibi, graduate student in economics from Iran, said she is not able to see her husband under the immigration restrictions.  “My husband is in Iran, so I cannot go to see him, and he cannot come to see me,” Habibi said. “I hope that President Trump actually just makes an exception for students. We’re only students, we’re not terrorists. Not all of us immigrants are terrorists.”  Lisa Tatonetti, English professor and one of the rally’s organizers, led participants in several chants, such as “K-State won’t hate” and “no ban, no wall; Manhattan, Kansas, welcomes all.”  Related: K-State student forced to drop classes due to Trump travel ban Read Now   Tatonetti also introduced speakers at the rally, which included representatives from several multicultural student organizations, including the Indigenous Alliance, the American Ethnic Studies Student Association and the Universalist Unitarian Church. The Rev. Jonalu Johnstone, minister at the Universalist Unitarian Church, asked rally attendees what democracy looked like.  “I know that democracy is chaotic and wild,” Johnstone said. “I know that democracy strives to navigate the difficult form between majority opinion, and minority rights… Today, Muslim brothers and sisters, we are here for you. Tomorrow, we are here for whoever is next at risk… we have each others’ backs.”  LaVerne Bitsie-Baldwin, director of the College of Engineering Multicultural Engineering Program and co-chair of the Indigenous Alliance, said the alliance stands with all immigrants and refugees.  “Today, we stand in solidarity with the K-State community,” Bitsie-Baldwin said. “For over 500 years, the indigenous peoples have taken in outsiders and refugees from all around the world. We have accepted a multitude of individuals and beliefs, and we are here in solidarity with our Muslim allies.”  April Petillo, assistant professor of American ethnic studies, particularly spoke against Trump’s executive order.  “The executive order issued by Trump on Jan. 27, protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the nation, does not protect nor does it ensure safety,” Petillo said. “Instead, it preys on fears, it directs anger and it effectively does us all harm.”  “When we buy into these ideas, we show that we do not know these histories,” Petillo said. “If we are really against terrorism in all its forms, we stand for migration. We stand for each other, and we stand against this order.”  Other speakers urged action.  “We really need to take that anger and turn it into action,” Alonso Pena, junior in English and American ethnic studies and president of the American Ethnic Studies Association, said. “I really appreciate that we’re all here. We need to keep breaking the silences.”  Dan Cutter, instructor of public speaking, said Trump’s immigration executive order and other political actions should anger American citizens.  “Mere hours after the CEO of Exxon Mobil was confirmed as Secretary of State today, hours after the House removed a restriction that required oil companies to disclose payments to foreign governments, what we are witnessing is the rise of fascism in the United States,” Cutter said. “We have always been told that this cannot happen here, that America is exceptional, that we are immune to this disease, but it is happening now.”  “We can no longer idly stand by while we allow this to happen,” Cutter continued. “Every single day, we must find ways to advocate and to resist against this regime. It does not stop with just advocating against the Muslim ban, or the wall, or any number of other things. We must advocate against all of it and fight every single day.”  Lisa Hamer, local attorney and public defender, said any change has to start locally.  “In 2010, the Tea Party did something amazing, as much as we might have hated it,” Hamer said. “They started local, and we need to do that here. You are K-State students who walk on Manhattan streets, you eat and drink in Manhattan’s restaurants and bars—let’s face it, you owe us quite a bit.

There is racism happening right here in your town, if you just pay attention.” Sajid Rahman, graduate student in computer science and president of the Muslim Students Association, thanked rally attendees for their support.  “On behalf of the (Muslim Students Association), I would like to offer all of you my heartfelt thanks to stand here in support of us in this cold weather,” Rahman said. “There have been some negative impacts, but I would like to share some positive experiences. From the beginning of the executive order, we’ve received hundreds of messages and emails on Facebook and social media from all around the Manhattan community. They want to show their support, they want to stand next to us”  After the speakers addressed the crowd for about a half hour, Tatonetti led protesters on a march along Anderson Avenue to the south of the parking garage, and the march blocked the entrance to Mid-Campus Drive for about 15 minutes.  Passing cars honked at protesters, but it was not clear whether the drivers honked in solidarity with the protest.  Although the rally initially began as a demonstration of solidarity with Muslim students and community members affected by the immigration ban, the marching protesters began to yell chants such as “black lives matter” and “sí se puede.”  Most of the protesters later moved towards the Union for a lecture by Angela Davis, political activist and keynote speaker for the Black Student Union’s celebration of Black History Month.  After the rally, Cynthia Ferguson, sophomore in computer science and speaker at the rally, said  “I’m here today because I firmly believe in brotherhood, friendship and most importantly, I don’t like division at all,” Ferguson said. “I feel like everything that has been going on with Trump’s executive order is dividing our country. It’s racist, it’s fascist, it’s against our Muslim brothers and I felt the need to speak on it.”  Other attendees said they hoped the rally inspired people to affect change.  “Through media and other people, we can get the word out that there’s people here supporting immigrants,” Rachel Whetstone, Manhattan resident, said. “The rally also helps people know how to get in contact with their congress people, and that we need to do it by telephone, because other means don’t work as well.”  Zelia Wiley, interim associate provost for diversity, said the rally will increase awareness.  “I think that one thing here at K-State is that we need to get people aware of what’s going on, because so many people feel like everything is OK,” Wiley said. “This rally showed people that something must be going on. It’s going to cause people that don’t know about these issues to ask questions.”
59	3	From morning through evening Saturday, local residents gathered at five Families Belong Together rallies across Ventura County as hundreds of similar events took place across the country.  Signs, chants and cheers energized those who turned out to protest immigration policy that has separated an estimated 2,000 children from their parents after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission.  Some at the Ventura County rallies were immigrants or children of immigrants. Some were grandparents, military veterans, students or citizens impassioned to take a stand. Events in Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Ojai, Ventura and Camarillo brought them out starting at 10 a.m. and kept some going past 6:30 p.m.  Saturday's protests across the nation:  'Where are the children!': Families Belong Together rallies take over USA In 50 states, hundreds of thousands protest immigration policy 12-year-old's powerful moment: 'I'm afraid they will take my mom away' For parents bringing their kids to protest family separations, it's personal President is at N.J. golf resort as thousands protest in D.C.  Hundreds of protesters dressed in white gathered at The Collection in Oxnard starting at 10 a.m. and marched to the Oxnard Boulevard overpass of Highway 101.  “I felt bad for the kids when I saw them on TV,” said Rosa Sanchez, of Oxnard. “It looked like they were in cages with blankets that looked like foil. I don’t think this is what the US is about.”  Jade Smith, of Ojai, said children need their mothers.  “What is happening now is not right,” said Smith, who planned to attend other rallies later in the day. “We are a country of immigrants. We come together. We fight injustice.”   Some motorists passing through the area honked their support. Elected officials including including state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblywoman Monique Limón, both Democrats from Santa Barbara, addressed the crowd before the march.  At 2 p.m., a larger crowd gathered in Ventura at Telephone Road and Victoria Avenue, near the Ventura County Government Center. Organizers estimated about 750 people were on hand at the rally’s peak.   Attendees were stretched along sidewalks at all four corners of the intersection, with the crowd five deep in some spots. Many drivers honked as they drove past, with ralliers waving and cheering back. Several big rigs blasted air horns, eliciting loud applause and cheers.  Not everyone was in support. Two men in a pickup shouted profanities at one section of the crowd as the pair waited out a red light. Other insults occasionally wafted through open windows as vehicles passed by, although no organized counterprotest was immediately visible at the site.   Vicki Cortez, 31, a first-generation American whose father is an immigrant from Mexico, said she and her sister were strongly influenced by his work ethic and the stress he put on getting an education.  “For me to be separated from him would have been such a disheartening experience,” said Cortez, who lives in Oxnard. She worried that children taken from their families through strict enforcement policies don’t have community support she has seen as a school district employee.  “There is no one to take care of them,” she said.  Some came in strollers. Susan and Jim Prosser, of Ventura, brought their 8-month-old grandson, Magnus, who was napping in the car on the way. Susan Prosser said Magnus’ presence would provide a visual example of the real-world impact of the separation policy.  Across the country, protesters flooded more than 700 marches, from immigrant-friendly cities like New York and Los Angeles to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming, The Associated Press reported. Gatherings were held on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near President Donald Trump’s golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president is spending the weekend.   Trump has backed away from family separations amid bipartisan and international uproar. His “zero tolerance policy” led officials to take more than 2,000 children from their parents as they tried to enter the country illegally\.  In Camarillo, a group gathered at 5 p.m. outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office at 770 Paseo Camarillo. A group played music as the crowd gathered around a grassy section of the parking lot, with participants ultimately marching together off site.   Bill Brontsema, of Camarillo, said he showed up because he can’t sleep at night. He’s written to the president and other officials, he said.  “This is appalling to me — it tears at my heart,” Brontsema said. “I don’t know how anybody can sit still and not do anything. It’s wrong.”  Also on hand was 18-year-old Litzy, who did not want to give her last name. Originally from Oaxaca, Mexico, she came to the U.S. when she was a year old. After growing up in Oxnard’s Mixteco community, she now attends U.C. Berkeley, where she is double majoring in political science and Spanish.  She said immigration issues now in focus nationwide are nothing new.  “For many of us in the Tequio Youth Group, we’ve been talking about this for a while,” she said, referring to an organization for indigenous youth supported by the Mixteco/Indigena Community Organizing Project, or MICOP, which helped host the Camarillo event.  While Litzy’s interests include broader international issues, she saw value in the local rally.  “I get to see who’s really involved and who isn’t,” she said.

249	2	Tensions escalated this week at UC Merced after a conservative student club demonstrated on campus, carrying homemade signs encouraging people to report undocumented immigrants.  UC Merced’s College Republican club held up signs on campus that read “ICE ICE Baby” and on the back included the number for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Another sign read “I Love Undocumented Firearms."  In a statement sent to students and faculty, UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland said the signs from the College Republicans “disturbed many of us.”  “It troubles me to think that some in our Bobcat family would wish harm upon them and that through their speech, they would deliberately introduce added stress and anxiety into their fellow students’ lives,” Leland said in the statement.  Leland went on to say the signs violated UC Merced’s Principles of Community, which promote inclusion and “cultivating a campus climate rooted in mutual respect and compassion,” the principles say.  The signs were “clearly intended to create an unwelcome environment for our nearly 600 undocumented students,” Leland said.  However, the chancellor also said the club has the First-Amendment right to express their political views even “if others would consider them offensive or harmful.”  “UC Merced remains committed to doing everything in its power to enable our undocumented students to pursue their education,” Leland said. “Like so many of our dedicated students, they are remarkable individuals with remarkable stories.”  Devon Hunter, the 20-year-old UC Merced student who held up the sign with the number to ICE, said he can understand how the sign might offend some, but said it was “supposed to be controversial and draw them in.”  Hunter, an economics student, said the University of California system wants to put “boundaries” on free speech.  “It’s all well and good until people take offense to it,” he told the Sun-Star in a phone interview. “We want to make sure they (signs) hit close to home to show people this is the United States and we have the First Amendment here to protect statements that are unpopular.”  Harrison Duran, president of the College Republican Club, said the intention was to “start a dialogue on campus.” He said members of the club don’t believe people should reside in the country illegally but have different views on policy.  “I understand the material can be upsetting to certain people and they can disagree with it,” the 21-year-old ecology and evolutionary biology student said.  Some students organized a counter-protest in front of their tables Tuesday.  They chanted "education not deportation" and "say it loud say it clear immigrants are welcome here," said Christina Acosta, a 31-year-old Ph.D. student who participated in the protest. Acosta said it’s important for the hundreds of undocumented UC Merced students to know they have support on campus.  “I think it’s just really important to let them know that this won’t stand. We won’t allow this kind of hatred to stand,” Acosta said.  Acosta, who also is a teacher's assistant, said she’s seen how the current discussion around immigration policy can be a stressful distraction that interferes with education.  “How many students walk by there and were traumatized by that?” Acosta questioned.  The Republican club’s advisor, Phillip Cunningham, said he personally wouldn’t have drawn the signs carried by some club members, but said he “supports their right to do it and get the conversation going which is what we wanted.”  “I can see how some people could find offensive or provocative,” Cunningham added. “I don’t necessarily agree that it’s threatening.”
193	3	Detroit — Relatives, advocates and lawmakers rallied Friday outside of the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building against the deportation of more than 100 Iraqi-American immigrants arrested in raids last weekend.   Event organizers contend sending the majority-Chaldean detainees to Iraq will put them in jeopardy of genocide by ISIS for being Christians.  “We want to make sure that people are aware of the human rights catastrophe that’s unfolding here,” said Martin Manna, 45, a rally organizer and president of the Sterling Heights-based Chaldean Community Foundation.  “How can our country violate laws and send people to places they can be harmed and killed,” he added. “It’s basic human rights.”  Manna said Friday the group is asking that the process be slowed and that special consideration is given to the group, he said, have contributed to the metropolitan Detroit society.  The immigrants being held were chosen for their past felony history. For most, supporters said, the offenses date back decades and the individuals have served their sentence.  U.S. Reps. Sander Levin, D-Royal Oak, and Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, joined the group in Detroit Friday to protest the deportations.  “There’s no real threat here. These crimes committed decades ago are the only reason the government knows where they are because they followed orders and reported to courts all those years,” said Levin, adding U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly has said federal authorities are focused on “the worst of the worst.”  Levin said spoke with federal immigration authorities this week and is seeking a copy of the written agreement between the United States government and Iraq, as well as measures to confirm the detainees’ safety.  One of them is Yani Daoud, a resident of Warren who was arrested Monday at his home. His sister, Susie David, 48, said Daoud is married with kids and unknowingly signed deportation papers ordered by a judge without a lawyer present.   “He had a felony with weed and did six months and did everything right,” David said. “I feel so sorry for all of them. His birthday is Wednesday…he’ll be 40.”  Sam Hamama was picked up by ICE on his way to church with family on Sunday. His daughter Britanny, 20, and wife, Nahrain, spoke at the rally.  “He was taken for a felony committed 30 years ago. He knows nothing but America,” Nahrain said. “We’re not Iraqis, we’re Americans.”  Meantime, a hearing is expected Wednesday in U.S. District Court over a class-action lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union. The group is asking a federal judge to halt removal of the detainees until its determined whether they are entitled to protection.  The ACLU, in the lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, argues it’s illegal to deport the detainees without giving them an opportunity to prove they could face torture or death if returned to Iraq.  Federal immigration authorities have defended the arrests, saying that all of those rounded up had been convicted of crimes and were subject to deportation.  Another rally is set for 3 p.m. Sunday at Nelson Park, 2775 15 Mile Road, in Sterling Heights.

The protest was one among hundreds of “Families Belong Together” rallies held in U.S. cities to criticize policies that led to the separation of several thousand families at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent weeks.   “The most important message is that we cannot be silent, that we need to rise up, we need to protest,” Enrique Morones, director of the San Diego-based immigration human rights organization Border Angels, told City News Service at Waterfront Park, where the downtown protest began. “A society is judged on how we treat our children. And what is taking place right now is horrific.”  The Trump administration in April enacted “zero-tolerance” policies that included separating children from their parents as they try to enter the United States.

Trump addressed the issue on Twitter Saturday afternoon.   “When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY excort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering,” the president tweeted. “Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!”  Listen: Audio of Border Angels director Enrique Morones at Waterfront Park Tanya Benitez, who was at the event volunteering with Border Angels, said she was impressed and encouraged by the number of people who showed up.

At the Carlsbad protest in Cannon Park, the atmosphere was tense as police posted signs warning that a permit had not been issued for the protest, and anyone participating in an event of 50 or more people could be arrested.   Organizer Robin Mastro told The San Diego Union-Tribune that she received a letter from the city attorney saying she, too, could be arrested if the protest were held.  “They said they could arrest me even at my home,” Mastro told the newspaper.  Carlsbad sent out a pair of tweets during the protest.  “Lots of confusion about sign at Cannon Park. Organizers didn’t get a permit but we respect your right to protest. The goal is to keep everyone safe,” one said.  The second tweet thanked demonstrators.   “Protest is peaceful and lawful,” it said.  A few counter-protesters were gathered at the Carlsbad protest, according to the Union-Tribune, including one man who held up a sign that read “No border no country” on one side and “Long Live ICE” on the other.  Last week, similar protests were held downtown and at the Otay Mesa Detention Facility, where some migrants were being detained. Six people were arrested at the Otay Mesa protest last Saturday.  Border Angels founder Morones, at the downtown rally, introduced himself as a native San Diegan “and a very proud 100 percent Mexicano.”  He labeled Trump “pure evil” and connected family separation to the larger issue of refugees worldwide.   In calling for a moment of silence, he said: “Let’s think about the 8,000 migrants that died last year crossing borders — most of them crossing from Africa to Europe and Middle East into Europe.”  More than 11,000 immigrants have died on the U.S.-Mexico border, he said, “because of that wall.”  He promoted Border Angels, which places water in the desert the third Saturday of every month (including November 2016, when 500 volunteers showed up — ten times the normal turnout — “because people are outraged”).  Morone mentioned his weekly podcast.  “I know how to pronounce it,” he said. “It’s called Bad Hombre. I’m a bad hombre. My partner said: ‘What about me?’ I said have no fear. So now we have bad mujer (woman). This is the Year of the Mujer.”   He encouraged his fellow Bernie Sanders backers to vote because “a lot of people didn’t vote in 2016. Now look where we are. We can never, ever let it happen again.”  Morones closed by leading the familiar chant — in English and Spanish — “The people, united, will never be divided” — “El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido.”  — City News Service contributed to this report.
166	2	Chants and raised fists flooded Falmouth's Main Street on Saturday, June 30, in solidarity against President Donald J. Trump’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of families at the southern border.  Cape Cod Democratic Socialists of America, Move To Remove, the Coalition for Social Justice, and the Falmouth Democratic Town Committee organized the local demonstration, one of many taking place across the nation between 11 AM and 1 PM. About 100 people participated in Falmouth.  Concerned Cape residents gathered at the Village Green, flashing signs at passing cars. Among the messages on the signs were "Reunite Refugee Families," "No One is Illegal," "Keep Families Together" and "Abolish ICE."  The crowd roared whenever their efforts were greeted with a friendly horn honking or a driver flashing a thumbs-up in the air.  Activists then took to the streets, marching down the road and disrupting the flow of foot traffic on sidewalks.  A police officer blocked traffic on Main Street as the chanting protesters swarmed the green at Peg Noonan Park.  The demonstration concluded with 90-second speeches by Rachel K. Rhude of Maya Childcare Incorporated; Joel Paul of Cape Cod DSA; Yuki Honjo of McLane Research Laboratories, Inc; Jarita A. Davis of Engage Falmouth; and additional members of the crowd willing to speak. The speeches centered on family separations; ICE agents; and the 287(g) Agreement, which deputizes the Barnstable County Sheriff James Cummings to act as an ICE agent.  Calls for action were passed out to the crowd, leaving each attendee with a further mission after departure: Call government officials to object to the policies in place and—most importantly—vote.

Bridie Farrell, once an aspiring Olympic speed skate, is now an advocate for childhood sexual abuse victims. Farrell said she was abused when she was 15 by a much older, prominent Olympic skater. Farrell, now 36, is one of many survivors who cannot seek legal justice in New York because the alleged abuse happened too long ago.  Farrell joined other childhood sexual abuse victims, advocates and lawmakers outside the Lower Manhattan office of Zurich Insurance Thursday. The group was angry that Zurich and other insurance companies spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby New York State Senate lawmakers to vote no on the Child Victims Act.  The legislation would allow New Yorkers like Bridie Farrell a longer window to come forward.  “No one has ever said I’m lying. I mean, he was known for these things,” Farrell said. “He would pick me up from school, and you know skip school, and go skate and then he would bring me to his house.”  A February 2018 poll from Quinnipiac University showed 90 percent of New Yorkers support changing the law so victims have more time to seek justice.  “We urge all the bill’s opponents, including the insurance companies, to stop the opposition and get behind this bill once and for all,” Safe Horizon’s Michael Polenberg said.  Insurance companies have tried to block this legislation to avoid increased civil payouts to victims, State Senator Brad Hoylman said.  “It was the almighty dollar and that’s what you see in Zurich,” Hoylman said. “That’s what you see in the insurance industry in cahoots with Republicans.”  Current law gives victims until they’re 23 to file lawsuits against their abusers. The Child Victims Act, which passed the Assembly, would change the statute of limitations so people up to age 28 can file for criminal cases. Victims would have up to 50 years after the alleged abuse to sue in civil cases. There would also be a one year window where older survivors could come forward to sue their alleged abusers.  According to Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, “I think the insurance companies, the Church, some Jewish religious organizations and everyone who does not believe in justice said, ‘Wait a minute, it’s going too fast!'”  The American Insurance Association responded by saying, “Sexual assault in all circumstances needs to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. From an insurance standpoint, we have concerns about any provision that retroactively removes the statute of limitations (SOL) for civil cases. Going forward, we could support an appropriate, prospective expansion of the SOL in such cases where the state has not previously extended it.”  Zurich North American stated in part, “Our position on the bill was not about hindering victims of child abuse or their rights to come forward but about retroactive changes to current law.”  Victim advocates hope there is enough momentum that the legislation could pass before summer recess.

158	4	May Day rallies in Albuquerque on Monday mirrored the pro-labor, pro-immigrant and anti-Trump themes of rallies across the country.  More than a thousand people came out for the May Day Rise Up ABQ Rally at Tiguex Park, which featured live music, dancing, children’s activities and speakers who addressed what they called assaults on the rights of workers, immigrants and teachers, and oppressive polices coming out of Washington.  About 40 organizations sponsored the rally, including political groups, the American Civil Liberties Union, health care organizations, labor and teachers unions, grass-roots immigrant-led groups and more, said Marco Nuñez, a spokesman for El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, one of the chief co-sponsoring organizations.  Earlier in the day, a group of protesters from the New Mexico Dream Team stood in a mock jail cell in front of Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to denounce what the group called “racist, anti-immigrant attacks” by the Trump administration.  advertisement  The Dream Team is a statewide network of immigrant youths and families who are advocating for immigrants’ rights.  Other May Day rallies in New Mexico took place in Santa Fe, Gallup, Hobbs and Portales.  The local and national May Day rallies are part and parcel of International Workers Day events. In the United States, celebrations often pay tribute to labor unions, and in particular the struggle of workers in Chicago who in the late 1800s fought for a 40-hour workweek.  “We’re carrying on a legacy of workers rights,” Nuñez said. “We live in extraordinary times. There are some pretty profound attacks on the immigrant community, who are workers.” And as workers, he noted, undocumented employees in New Mexico contributed $66.3 million in local and state taxes in 2013.  advertisement  “The fearmongering that came out of the Trump candidacy has leapt into his presidency,” he said. “Trump continues amplifying a message that is divisive instead of uniting, and this event today is the antithesis of that.”  The courthouse site of the Dream Team rally was selected because “we have had confirmed cases of community members who have shown up for their court dates and have been detained and picked up by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and then secretly deported,” said Yazmin Irazoqui Ruiz, a Dream Team spokeswoman.  “We are speaking against the criminalization of our community and the detentions and deportations of our community, because this is our home and we’re here to stay,” she said.  Protesters carried signs saying “No human is illegal” and “Resist, fight back,” and chanted “undocumented and unafraid.”  advertisement  Ruiz told onlookers they cannot remain apathetic. “You may not agree with the racist agenda of the people who are running our government, but by staying silent and doing nothing you are perpetuating racism, you are perpetuating the criminalization of our people.”  Rebecca Schreiber said she attended the rally “because I support immigrant rights and immigrant justice.”  “I think that immigrants are being scapegoated as the cause of America’s problems, she said.”
181	4	Around 300 high school students marched through University of Oregon campus as part of the annual Raza Unida Youth Conference. They chanted phrases like, “El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido,” (the town united will never be divided) and “Migration is beautiful.”  The conference is an all-day event organized by MEChA in which Latinx high school students from Lane County and all over the state come to the UO campus to attend workshops on topics ranging from knowing your rights to latin dance. There is also a political action portion and a cultural portion, according to Amy Garay-Azucena, Media and Communications Director for MEChA.  MEChA is a student organization focused on education rights of Latinx students. Around 300 MEChA chapters exist nationwide, according to UO MEChA’s website. Latinx is a gender neutral way to refer to people of Latin American descent.  This year’s Raza Unida Youth Conference theme is “Mi Exsistencia es Resistencia,” (My existence is resistance). The conference aims to empower Latinx youth by providing education and resources that could help them get into college.  “I hope the high school students see folks that look like them succeeding” said Manuel Mejia Gonzales, a coordinator of the conference.  The students gathered to listen to speeches in the EMU amphitheater after marching to the Memorial Quad to place red flags in the lawn. The flags represented the 30,000 families separated by mass deportations last year.   In President Trump’s speech announcing his presidential bid, he regarded Mexican immigrants saying, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”  “Majority of mi gente [my people] who come from Mexico are not rapists criminals nor drug dealers. They came to this country for a better life, to escape the violence and for education,” said Alex Aguilar, 17-year-old Youth Organizer and Media coordinator for MECha. “You are not alone. Look around. We are here together. This is where we start. Remember we are seeds who will rise into a flower, just how a phoenix rises from its ashes.”
79	4	Joni Newby's voice cracked as she held a megaphone Saturday in front of Wilmington's Carvel State Office Building, explaining how her young daughters inspired her to organize her first march.  With hundreds listening and daughters Natalie, 10, and Guinevere, 5, standing by her feet, Newby was almost overwhelmed by the moment, drawn to action in opposition to President Donald Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy.   "I do it with the hope of a better world for them, which means when there's oppression, hatred and intolerance, you stand up and fight!" shouted Newby, a social worker from Bear, as U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., stood at her side on the steps of the state building.  Newby's march, which started at Cool Spring Park and cut through the city to the Carvel building, was one of three protests in Delaware and more than 750 held across the country Saturday in reaction to migrant children being separated from their families.  In addition to Wilmington's march, which also included a speech by U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., Milltown's St. Barnabas Episcopal Church and Dover's Legislative Mall each had events, drawing several hundred people to those rallies as well.  Joni Newby of Bear helps lead the rally as protesters gather at the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington to rally against the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy Saturday. The series of Delaware events drew sign-toting protesters, many of whom said they felt helpless as they watched images of detention centers on television and read about the separations.  Dover's protest was led by McKenzie Melvin, 18, a Dover-based college student. Milltown's gathering was organized by Maria Perez, 68. Along with Newby, 38, all three were leading their first protests.    Melvin said, "When a lot of people stand up and protest, lawmakers are more likely to make change. That's why it's important to leave your homes and participate because that's what it's going to take to get the people running the country to hear us."  Hundreds of protesters stand on the steps of the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington to rally against the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy Saturday. Linda Gordon, 68, weathered temperatures in the low 90s in Milltown to make her voice heard, surrounded by others with signs that read "Put Trump in a Cage" and "Shame, Shame."  "It's just terrifying to see this happening here in our country," said Gordon, whose only other protest was her trip to Washington, D.C., earlier this year for March for Our Lives. "I like coming out for the camaraderie. I don't know how to explain it other than to say by being here, I feel like I'm not alone."   St. Barnabas became a protest site after parishioner Maria Perez approached the Rev. Martha Kirkpatrick, church rector.  Kirkpatrick agreed it was an important time to stand and be heard, deciding to serve lemonade and apples to the gathered crowd of several hundred protesters clustered in the shade under a tree.  Kirkpatrick felt that the issue spoke to her as a Christian, spurring her to proclaim that her religion's message is a message of love for all people. She said she wanted to amplify her own voice as others, including some fellow Christians, disagree about the country's border policy.  U.S. Senator Tom Carper addresses the crowd gathered at the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington to rally against the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy Saturday. "We are called to bear witness to injustice. We are called to proclaim love. And we just have to keep speaking," she said during a break outside her church. "In some ways, people are standing up and representing Jesus in a way that I don't recognize. It compels me to stand up and speak for the Jesus of the gospels. There's just no room for hate in that Jesus. And I thought it was important for the church to stand up and say that."   Kirkpatrick and Perez said they were appalled by the government's actions, like so many others who came out in protest across the country.  "We're standing with so many others who are standing up and saying, 'This isn't my America,'" Kirkpatrick added. "We're focusing on love. We don't need more hate speech."  Delaware protesters joined tens of thousands coast-to-coast at the "Families Belong Together" rallies protesting an immigration policy that left more than 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.   In the nation's capital, thousands poured into Lafayette Square, across from the White House, to chant “We care” and “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA.”  Shane Sanders of Wilmington (left) and Anna Ogunnaike of Hockessin listen to speakers as protesters gather at St. Barnabas' Episcopal Church in Milltown to rally against the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy Saturday. Protesters waved signs in English and Spanish. The slogan on one English sign demanded, “Where are the children?” One sign, sounding like a mother's stern rebuke, read in Spanish, “Trump te calmas o te calmo.” Translation: "Calm down, Trump, or I will calm you down."  While Trump and first lady Melania Trump avoided the chants in Washington, the protests followed them to their weekend retreat in Bedminster, New Jersey. Only a few miles from Trump National Golf Course, more than 100 protesters lined the side of a major New Jersey highway waving anti-Trump signs and chanting, “Where are the children!”  Many of those messages were mirrored in Delaware.  By the time Perez spoke at the church, some already had tears in their eyes as they reflected on both on the plight of migrants and their treatment at the hands of the U.S. government.  Protesters gather at St. Barnabas' Episcopal Church in Milltown to rally against the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy Saturday. "Children need their parents and not detention camps. They need the love that only their parents can provide," she said. "The cries of the children must be heeded. The suffering and abuse of these children must stop."  For Newby, her first time as a march organizer sparked something within. After her speech, friends and family joined fellow protesters, politicians and political candidates in thanking her as she stood with her daughters.   While the event was more work than she initially thought when she decided to organize, the march was worth it.  "It was so inspiring. I almost burst into tears this morning when I saw 181 people were registered and knew it was going to be even bigger," Newby said. "I think I've been bitten by the bug."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Metro DACA students from the Kansas/Missouri Dream Alliance headed to Missouri’s capital Wednesday to lobby against a budget bill that would terminate in-state tuition rates for undocumented youth with DACA.  “It was horrible. I ended up going to the dean’s office. It got to the point where I really wanted to continue school. I didn’t want to drop out or go to another college, but I wasn’t able to afford it,” said Zaid Consuegra, a dreamer from Mexico City. He came to Kansas City in 1999.  He did not get in-state tuition for his schooling and knows the struggle of not being able to afford his education.  Now, Consuegra said he feels for undocumented youth who might have to pay extra in pursuit of higher education.  “I think it is discouraging for someone who is trying to better themselves and be in higher education,” Consuegra added. “I think it’s ridiculous to stop people, or students, from higher learning.” Zaid Consuegra  “I know lots of students that have had to drop out, or transfer to Kansas schools because of this,” said Jessica Piedra, a metro immigration attorney. “It’s really a huge barrier to these low-income families to achieve that higher education here in a state where they’ve grown up in.”  Piedra said the failure of Congress to pass the Dream Act has resulted in a patchwork of policies where Kansas students get in-state tuition. Missouri students do not.  “This is really an example of why we need the DREAM Act to pass on the federal law, so we can have one federal policy for the entire United States,” Piedra said.  Consuegra said this just creates inequalities and barriers for students.  “We could either keep being ignorant or manage and solve the issues right in front of us,” said Consuegra. “We are just people at the end of the day. We’re just trying to get by. We are not at fault. Obviously we didn’t ask for this, but now we’re dealing with it. We’re not asking for handouts. We’re doing everything we can to better ourselves and just live a happy life.”  There are about 3,500 youth with DACA who call Missouri home.
121	3	Despite a stiff wind that made the weather Sunday afternoon feel much colder than the actual 37 degrees, 50 people gathered to participate in the Welcome to Hastings Immigrants Rally.  Participants in the rally, which was intended to celebrate immigrants as well as begin the process to try and make Hastings a sanctuary city, stretched from the Welcome to Hastings sign at the corner of 16th Street and North Burlington Avenue halfway down the block to 14th Street.     Rally organizer Margaret Marsh of Hastings was pleased with the participation.  advertisement “It was great considering the weather,” she said. “When I first came out to the corner and was by myself, you know, I had my doubts. It was great we had so many people who did turn out.”  Marsh said to begin the process to make Hastings a sanctuary city, The Welcome to Hastings Immigrants Rally Facebook page is collecting signatures to petition the Hastings City Council to pass a resolution stating as a municipal law enforcement agency, Hastings Police Officers do not stop motorists to ask them about their immigration status.  “It really isn’t changing any sort of policy,” Marsh said. “It’s just making it public, making people aware of it, that that is the status of Hastings, that (HPD officers) will not round up people and be questioning their status.”  Robin Vodehnal of Hastings was among the rally participants.  “Immigrants have been getting a bad rap,” she said. “There’s been a lot bans with countries and we really want to send the message that Hastings is a friendly community. We’re not here to persecute anyone. We want to welcome people, we want to help people. Direct action is the way to do that.”  Dressed in insulated snow pants, Vodehnal handed out hand warmers to other people gathered along Burlington Avenue. She, too, was worried about a low turnout because of the weather conditions.  “But it looks like people are standing by their principles," she said.  Some motorists passing by offered support throughout the hour-long rally by honking and waving.  advertisement That support was interrupted a couple of times — once by a teenager in the back seat of a SUV who yelled “Make America Great Again,” “Build a wall,” and “Donald Trump,” and another time by a pair of pickups with American flags — one truck also had a Confederate flag — that cruised by the rally several times.  “It just makes us more determined,” Marsh said. “That’s what they need to understand, is that this is not something we’re going to give up on. We will keep on our position and stay on our message.”  She chose 16th and Burlington for the rally because there is a lot of visibility since it is a high-traffic area and because of the Welcome to Hastings sign at that intersection.  “I thought that reiterated our message on that corner,” she said.  While most of the rally participants brought their own signs, Marsh brought a handful herself, some of which said “Welcome to Hastings” in one of several different languages.  Other signs included “We Stand with Her” with a silhouette of the Statue of Liberty and “Equality for All.”  Among signs promoting inclusiveness, Judy Dangler of Trumbull waved a large version of the golden and red Royal Banner of Scotland that belonged to Don Robertson of Hastings.   The two had never met prior to Sunday’s rally and just happened to arrive at the same time.  Robertson, a first generation American of Scottish ancestry, asked Dangler to hold the flag while he held the small speaker that broadcast chants led by Marsh.  “It just seemed appropriate,” he said of the decision to bring the flag.
8	4	While Martín Esquivel-Hernández could not speak to his supporters directly in Pittsburgh, his words were still heard.  Esquivel-Hernández, a former Pittsburgh resident who had been in prison for nine months on charges related to undocumented immigration, was deported Tuesday.   At a protest Tuesday night in his honor, Christina Castillo, an organizer with the Thomas Merton Center, read aloud one of Esquivel-Hernández’s letters written from prison.  “Despite never having met every single one of you, please believe me when I say how grateful and in debt I am to all of you,” Esquivel-Hernández wrote. “There will never be enough magic words to thank you all for the moral support and the love you give me as human beings.”  Castillo was one of about 100 people who gathered at the corner of Hot Metal and South Water Streets Tuesday night to protest the deportation of Esquivel-Hernández. The event, hosted by the Thomas Merton Center — an organization dedicated to social justice activism — included speeches on the lawn, followed by an attempt to march onto Hot Metal Bridge. Before they could march, Pittsburgh police guided protesters back to the lawn so that they would not block the intersection and halt traffic flow.  “No more deportation,” rang through the streets as a few cars passed the crowd, honking to show their support.  Esquivel-Hernández had spent the past nine months at the Seneca County Jail in Ohio after failing to present a valid U.S. driver’s license and was caught attempting to cross the Mexican border into the U.S. on four separate occasions between November 2011 and May 2012. Ultimately, he was detected in summer of 2016.  The angry protesters shouted, “Shame!” during mentions of the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that chose to deport Esquivel-Hernández.  Some protesters held up signs including phrases such as “No borders, No nations, Stop the Deportation,” “Dignity, Not Deportation” and “You would do the same for your family.”  Faith, community and labor leaders also showed their support throughout the last few months in an effort to keep him in the country, including Mayor Bill Peduto, Congressman Mike Doyle and Roman Catholic Bishop David Zubik.  The protest was peaceful yet emotional as the participants gathered in a large circle holding signs, flowers and candles. Esquivel-Hernández’s family was also present, specifically his wife, Alma Brigido, and their two daughters, Shayla, 11, and Luz, 9. Alma read a passionate letter to the crowd, which was in Spanish, while a translator relayed her words of hope to everyone in attendance.  ”ICE is successful in dividing us, but they can never separate our souls and our hearts,” Brigido said. “Even though he is in another place, we’re going to keep fighting, because they cannot separate us from accomplishing our dreams and our goals.”  The deportation case was under the jurisdiction of ICE Field Office Director Rebecca Adducci, whose office received an influx of calls and letters from 1,400 people in support of not deporting the man.  In addition to the people who sent in letters voicing opposition to the situation, other protesters joined in on the message to speak about the great injustice of deportation.  While some speakers focused on how “immigration is a natural thing,” others pointed out that America is a country made up of immigrants. One supporter sang in Spanish and played her cello, accompanied by a saxophone player.  Kai Pang, 22, of Bloomfield, and an organizer with Pittsburgh United—a coalition of community organizations who work to improve Pittsburgh communities through policy campaigns—joined this particular movement because he sees immigration issues as workers’ issues. He noted that while deportations have been ongoing, the current political climate is also a contributing factor to the growing support of deportation.  “Deportations are nothing new, and I think the rhetoric under this new administration has definitely emboldened ICE as an institution to further go about their policies without any sort of retribution,” Pang said.  Pang also said that deportation stories have “always been there,” but that now, stories such as Esquivel-Hernández’s are more often brought to light with protests and public outrage.  Part of this public outrage comes in response to President Donald Trump’s latest actions. On January 27, Trump signed an executive order that banned entry from seven countries that are heavily populated with Muslims: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  Esquivel-Hernández’s event, then, was just the second in a pair of Pittsburgh immigration protests in the past week. Some Pittsburghers fought Trump’s order on Jan. 30 by taking to the Pittsburgh International Airport and protesting.  While the rally at the airport enforced the idea of solidarity, Tuesday night’s protest ended on a somber note. Sister Janice Vanderneck — a director of Casa San Jose who works closely with Latino immigrants in Pittsburgh. — left the rally with a parting message about immigration rights, not just for people in Pittsburgh, but for everyone in the nation.  “We need to do all we can to keep this from happening in our nation,” she said. “I know we are together. It’s so helpful to see you all here.”
188	2	SHEBOYGAN - Immigration rights activists rallied Tuesday night outside a Sheboygan Area School District board meeting to press local school leaders to adopt “sanctuary” policies aimed at protecting undocumented immigrant students.  About 85 protesters, organized by Milwaukee-based group Voces de la Frontera, hoisted banners and signs just outside Sheboygan South High School, where the board was meeting to accommodate larger-than-normal crowds for that night's annual student and employee awards presentations. Members of the group Youth Empowered in the Struggle, a Voces de la Frontera-affiliated student organization, were also part of the rally, which featured a march outside the school before protesters filed into the building to watch parts of the meeting.  The organization has been pressing schools to adopt a resolution that would, among other things, limit immigration enforcement officers’ access to schools and provide resources in the district to undocumented immigrants and their families. The resolution, as drafted, would also require the district to pay for attorneys to represent students facing deportation.   RELATED: Immigration group seeks city, school protections in Sheboygan   “We just come in peace and ask them to please help these families and keep the school safe for kids and for the families,” Saul Uribe, one of the protesters, told a reporter. He said the resolution is important to help immigrant students and their families feel safe from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.   Superintendent Joe Sheehan said Tuesday the district was considering updating policies to specifically prohibit bullying in schools based on students’ immigration status. Proposed policy updates would also clarify law enforcement agents’ access to students.  The board took no action on the matter and didn't spend much time on the topic. But members did listen to comments from several meeting attendees, mostly backing the resolution.   Abril Moreno, a senior at Sheboygan North High School who has pushed the district to pass the measure, told board members more than 1,000 people had signed petitions this month urging the district to adopt rules protecting immigrants, and offered to submit those signatures to the board.  Moreno also said local undocumented immigrants are fearful of being deported.  “Deportation is happening here. Whether you see it or not, it is,” she said during a public comment portion of the meeting. “I know that maybe you don’t understand because you didn’t have to cross a border when you were just a kid.”  Your stories live here. Fuel your hometown passion and plug into the stories that define it. Create Account Several others also backed the resolution. Bob Bledsoe, who described himself as a Unitarian Universalist minister living in Sheboygan, told board members “reasonable people can debate and can argue,” but that everyone should agree children of undocumented immigrants shouldn’t be targeted for deportation.  “There are places we consider sanctuary for a reason: churches, synagogues, mosques,” he said. “And I would argue that schools are also to be sanctuaries.”  Not everyone agreed.  “I think the community is trusting you to do what’s right in the eyes of the law at this time,” Becci Aschenbach told board members. “I don’t know the law. I haven’t studied the law. But I believe what they’re asking us to do is condone illegal behavior.  “I feel for them,” Aschenbach added of undocumented students, noting many entered the U.S. with their parents. And, she added, schools have a responsibility to support students in the classroom. “But I don’t believe that it’s right to condone something that’s against the law.”  The board didn't discuss the issue in much depth Tuesday. But discussions in the past suggested the resolution, or at least parts of it, could face a challenge. Elected leaders earlier this month said they thought the district should deal with immigration issues by making changes to its policies, not by adopting a resolution. Board members also wondered whether existing federal regulations would trump whatever policies or resolutions schools might adopt. And the board’s vice president, Mark Mancl, has called parts of the resolution “essentially a self-inflicted unfunded mandate.”  School board member Ryan Burg said before Tuesday's meeting parts of the resolution would likely need to change before the board might approve it, though he noted the district has “a moral and legal obligation to care for all of our students, and especially the migrant and the immigrant community.”   “I really hope that we can come to something that works for everyone, and that recognizes the Hispanic community, recognizes the immigrant community,” Burg said, “but also, too, doesn’t do so at the expense of all of our students.”  Elliott Magers, a local organizer with Voces de la Frontera, has chafed at claims the resolution would impact the district’s budget. The resolution, though, at least as drafted, would require the district to “fund attorneys to represent students facing removal proceedings.” Burg said that line specifically could need nixing if the board ends up seriously considering the measure.  Among other things, the resolution would require Sheboygan schools to:  Step up partnerships with legal and other types of organizations to offer resources for families facing deportation Offer presentations covering students’ and their family members’ rights when working with law and immigration enforcement agents Create a “rapid response network” — though the term isn’t clearly defined — to help detained students or their family members Treat students equally when offering school services, including free and reduced-price lunches, transportation and instruction The measure would also bar the district from doing certain things, including:  Asking about or recording a student’s or family member’s immigration status Telling federal authorities about students’ “confidential information” — including their “actual or perceived” citizenship status, gender identity and sexual orientation, among other things — without the student’s, or his or her guardian’s, permission Voluntarily sharing information with immigration agents, “to the fullest extent possible under the law” Entering into agreements with local, state or certain federal law or immigration enforcement agencies, “except as required by law”  The proposed rules are modeled on a resolution drafted by the National Immigration Law Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration organization that’s pushed for protections for undocumented immigrants. The resolution in Sheboygan is also similar to a recently adopted set of rules in Milwaukee Public Schools aimed at making that district a “safe haven” for undocumented immigrant students.  Magers has been critical of local school leaders’ response to his organization’s demands. He said he felt “embarrassed” listening to board members’ discussion on the topic earlier this month, and said his organization’s push for sanctuary policies in schools has faced “nothing but obstruction since Day 1.”  Voces de la Frontera is also pushing the City of Sheboygan to distribute photo identification cards to local residents in a move aimed at getting around stricter rules that can bar undocumented immigrants from getting state-issued driver’s licenses. The city IDs couldn’t be used to vote, and the issue hasn’t fielded official discussion yet at any Common Council meetings.
126	2	A traffic stop in Geneseo Thursday evening involving two women and six children led to a protest at the U.S. Border Patrol station in Irondequoit, where a state trooper was struck by an object and a Rochester man arrested.  Two individuals — a woman and her 12-year-old brother — were sent to immigration officials in Buffalo. One other woman was already in the immigration system. Four of the other children are U.S. citizens. One is Guatemalan.  Philipp Birklbauer, 29, was charged with five counts, including criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and resisting arrest, for his alleged actions during a protest overnight at the station, 171 Pattonwood Drive. He was arraigned Friday morning in Irondequoit Town Court and remanded to Monroe County Jail on $5,000 bail or $10,000 bond.  State Police reported there were about 75 protesters at the Border Patrol station.  According to court documents, Irondequoit police and New York State Police allege that Birklbauer threw a cylindrical object that struck Trooper Thomas J. Loewke on the side of his head, just missing his eye.  Lisa Englert of Hamlin, takes part in a rally outside the Federal Building to protest government treatment of immigrants and their families. A rally to draw attention to the detainment of farmworkers in Orleans and Livingston counties was held Friday afternoon outside the Kenneth B. Keating Federal Building, 100 State St. in Rochester. The entrance of the building was barricaded. About 200 people gathered peacefully, calling for equality and togetherness.  "In Episcopal faith we question things, we question religion," said the Rev. Ruth Ferguson from Christ Church on East Avenue in Rochester who was representing the faith community. "We ask ourselves, 'Is this the religion I need to practice?' A test of that is, 'Does it produce and promote the well-being, spiritually and materially of other people?' That's a good question to ask if you want to be a law-abiding citizen. I do, but are these laws producing and promoting justice?"   The crowd responded, "No."  Traffic stop in Geneseo The protest at the Border Patrol station was the second in response to events that began about 6:15 p.m. Thursday. A Geneseo police officer stopped a vehicle that allegedly was speeding on South Street (Route 20A) in the village and needed help identifying the two adults who were from Guatemala and six children.   Neither of the adults spoke English, and neither was a licensed driver, said Geneseo Police Chief Eric Osganian. The driver did have a Guatemala passport, according to the chief. Border Patrol later reported that she did not have a visa to be in the United States. The children ranged in age from 2 months to 12 years old.  Osganian wrote in an email that the officer called Border Patrol to confirm the passport and get help identifying the driver. "We are not experts in these types of documents, as Border Patrol is," he wrote. "Border Patrol has been our resource in assisting us with this. The call was not made as an immigration purpose, solely for identification purposes."   Osganian said a crowd gathered to protest the call to Border Patrol, and that started to play out on social media as bystanders recorded the event.  Osganian said the crowd created a dangerous situation. "We don't want people on the side of the road at night," he wrote.  "I am very supportive of the way it was handled," said village Mayor Richard Hatheway. "I think that some people are looking at it as though there is a witch hunt going on in Geneseo. That is not the case at all. It must be remembered, the reason the car was stopped in the first place was because they were exceeding the speed limit."   Hatheway said that a few weeks ago he asked for data on the number of traffic stops for any sort of infraction that turned out to involve someone in the country illegally. "Last year there was one," he said. "We might have had at one point about 10 years ago as many as four. But this is a highly unusual incident to occur."  Hatheway said the incident has stirred emotions in the village.  "I don't think that everybody realizes the responsibility that the police department has, that law enforcement has, partly because of what's happening on the national level," he said. "It gets drilled down to the very local scale. ... As soon as you mention Border Patrol or ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) , these images of goons come up and that's just not the case. The village police department is exceptionally sympathetic."  ►MORE: Full statement from Geneseo Police Chief Eric Osganian  Role of Border Patrol  Border Patrol has access to databases that local police may not, and Jones said they get requests to help with identifications.   Border Patrol initially responded to the Geneseo request by sending a pickup truck. The decision then was made to bring the individuals to Rochester to continue the identification process, according to agent Corey Jones of the public affairs office in the Buffalo sector headquarters.  He said the group was transported in a passenger van, with child seats for the young ones. Once in Rochester, he said the children were fed and given toys.  A crowd gathers as part of a rally outside the Federal Building to protest government treatment of immigrants and their families. Names of the individuals have yet to released by ICE or Border Patrol, but Jones did explain some of the family relationship and their status.  Jones said on Friday that one woman and her 12-year-old brother were in the country illegally. They were transported to immigration officials in Buffalo and were scheduled to be released Friday.  Jones said that the woman requested that her children, who are U.S. citizens ranging from 2 months to 4 years old, be released to her sister.   In addition, her 4-year-old Guatemalan daughter was released to the woman. Jones said the child's status will be determined by ICE, but she will not be separated from her mother, Jones said.  Bystander account Evan Goldstein, a senior at SUNY Geneseo, was making dinner in his campus apartment when two other friends came by and told them a passerby had come upon the traffic stop near the SUNY Geneseo campus. According to what Goldstein was told, the passerby saw the driver was upset and she asked the officer about the situation. When the officer told her he was calling Border Patrol, the passerby flagged down his two friends and asked them if some students could help.  ​Goldstein said he contacted the Worker Justice Center of New York, and then word began to spread through social media.  Goldstein said about 100 students showed up, with some live-streaming the event on Facebook. Some also went to the Border Patrol station.  Protesters attempted to block vehicles from leaving a border patrol station in Irondequoit. Goldstein said the protest in Geneseo also attracted professors and townspeople. He said it was orderly, but people were condemning the officer and the Border Patrol agents.  "There is broad sympathy for the migrant population in Geneseo," Goldstein said. "There is not much broad sympathy for the police in Geneseo."  Goldstein said he did not know what pressures were on the officer when he called Border Patrol, but he said the vulnerable populations feel they are targets of police.  Hatheway, the mayor, said that if police officers don't make routine stops and something bad happens down the road, they are derelict in their duties. "If you get a hold of a couple of women and a bunch of kids, you look like real monsters. Nobody knew that when the car got pulled over."  In Irondequoit, the protesters were met by Border Patrol personnel, Irondequoit police and state troopers.  Protesters attempt to block vehicles from leaving a border patrol station in Irondequoit. They blocked the main driveway out of the station a few times by sitting in the road.  They chanted, "Let them go. Let them go." They called law enforcement officials Nazis and fascists and questioned why they wanted to be officers. Most of the officers did not respond. Yellow crime scene tape and a few feet separated the two sides for most of the night.   Goldstein described the Irondquoit protest at times as a candlelight vigil. He said he did not see the incident where the trooper reported being struck.  Jones, for the Border Patrol,  said he can understand why the public could get upset, but he said that agents need to make sure they have all the facts before releasing information. Jones said he received a call from the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, apologizing for some of the actions outside the station.
95	3	NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A second consecutive day of protests against U.S. President Donald Trump’s month-old administration appeared to lose momentum on Friday, with rallies in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York attracting small yet enthusiastic crowds.   Demonstrators march during the "Day Without Immigrants" protest in Chicago, Illinois, February 16, 2017. REUTERS/Theopolis Waters Activists had called for a “general strike” a day after thousands of immigrants across the United States stayed home from work and school during “A Day Without Immigrants” to highlight the contributions of foreign-born workers to the American economy.  Strike4Democracy, one of the groups organizing Friday’s strike, said more than 100 public protests were expected around the country.  In New York, more than 16,000 people responded to a Facebook page set up for a rally at Washington Square Park in Manhattan, but fewer than 200 protesters were at the park an hour after the posted start time.  Crystal Thornebrooke, one of the organizers, said the event was intended to spark discussions about how activists can make progress in fighting Trump’s agenda.  “Introducing ourselves to people, hearing people, hearing their concerns with our administration and then build from there - this is the preliminary stages of organization,” she said.  In downtown Los Angeles, a rally at the Regent Theater drew about 60 demonstrators, waving signs and chanting, “Fight ignorance, not immigrants.”  “I have friends and family members who are undocumented immigrants, and I’m scared for them to be deported,” said Priscilla Alburquenque, a 20-year-old college student.  Some protesters said Thursday’s walkout may have sapped some of the energy for Friday’s action.  “The immigration event yesterday was a big event, but not everyone can be at them all,” said Joe Balkis, a retired United Parcel Service worker who was one of approximately 75 protesters at Daley Plaza in Chicago.  Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and signed an executive order, which was put on hold by federal courts, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. Those policies, along with a series of federal raids last week, have alarmed immigrant rights’ groups.  Strike4Democracy urged Americans to stay away from work, donate their lunch money to a worthy cause and contact congressional representatives about the strike.  Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has faced a steady stream of protests and marches, highlighted by mass rallies focused on women’s rights that drew millions of people around the globe on the day after he was sworn in.
244	4	"The Washington Times - Wednesday, December 20, 2017  Hundreds of illegal immigrant “Dreamers” were taking to the halls of the U.S. Capitol complex Wednesday to complain they were being left behind by congressional leaders working on a year-end deal that does not grant them full citizenship rights.  The Dreamers were particularly angered that Democrats, who they were counting on to engage in a shutdown showdown over their fate, appear to have backed off and are willing to grant another month-long funding bill without a an solution in hand.  The activists, wearing red stocking hats and T-shirts, marched and lay down in hallways to try to slow business in the office buildings that ring the Capitol. They broadcast the actions live on Facebook.  “We want Dream Act,” protesters chanted, referring to a bill that would grant tentative legal status to more than 2 million illegal immigrants, and would see 1.7 million of them earn a green card signifying permanent legal presence, according to the Migration Policy Institute.  Wednesday’s protests are the latest in a series that have seen Dreamers arrested while staging sit-in protests in lawmakers’ offices.  The Dreamers had set a year-end deadline for Congress to grant them a more permanent status than the legally suspect Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty, which President Trump announced earlier this year that he was phasing out.  Mr. Trump set a six-month phaseout that will kick in March 5, but Dreamers said they wanted status well before that deadline.  They had encouraged Democrats to withhold support for a year-end spending bill, risking a government shutdown, unless a full legalization program was included.  After holding firm initially, Democratic leaders and some GOP applies have since backed off that insistence, saying the issue could be dealt with early next year.  Sen. Jeff Flake, Arizona Republican, said Wednesday that he has assurances the DACA issue will be taken up in January. He said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “has committed to bring the bipartisan DACA bill we are currently negotiating to the Senate floor” next month."
134	1	Hundreds of workers, business owners and families have rallied in five Connecticut cities to support immigrants' rights.   Monday's "Day Without Immigrants" event in Stamford, Danbury, Bridgeport and New Haven was among similar demonstrations held across the country to mark May Day, a traditional day for workers' rights demonstrations.  Some immigrant-owned businesses shut down for the day as part of the protest.  Politicians and hundreds of Connecticut residents attended a "Here to Stay" immigrants' rights rally in Hartford on Saturday. Gov. Dannel Malloy, Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and U.S. Rep. John Larson were among the attendees and speakers.  President Donald Trump has aggressively pursued immigration enforcement, and the government has threatened to withhold funding from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
42	1	Immigrants across the country are expected to stay home from school and work on Thursday to show how critical they are to the U.S. economy and way of life.  "A Day Without Immigrants" actions are planned in cities including Philadelphia, Washington, Boston, Houston, Chicago and New York. The protest gained momentum on social media and by word of mouth.  In south Louisiana, Ideal Market, a popular Latin grocery store chain, has announced it's shuttering its stores Thursday. Ideal has locations in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.  The movement comes in response to President Donald Trump, whose administration has pledged to increase the deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally. Trump campaigned on building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and blamed high unemployment on immigration. As president, he's called for a ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries from coming into the U.S.   Organizers expect thousands of people to participate or show solidarity with workers.
287	3	MINEOLA, Long Island (WABC) -- A protest was held Tuesday ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to Long Island to discuss the administration's efforts to eradicate MS-13, with organizers saying more are planned for Wednesday.  The groups demonstrated on the steps of the Nassau County Legislature, saying Trump's "xenophobia and racism" are not welcome on Long Island and that he is using gang violence to paint all immigrants with the same brush.  New York Congressman Pete King's office said they're expecting the president to travel to Bethpage, one week after Trump raised eyebrows when he used the word "animals" to describe some people who enter the country illegally in response to a comment about MS-13.  The president has doubled down on his rhetoric, saying he will continue to use the term in referring to the gang.  The White House also released a fact sheet Monday morning, titled, "WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIOLENT ANIMALS OF MS-13."  Trump traveled to Suffolk County Community College last July to discuss the gang before law enforcement officials.  Protest organizers say they are committed to "resisting Trump's assaults on immigrant families and communities and call on elected officials across the region to stand with them in solidarity and reject Trump's visit." They also ripped local politicians who plan on attending Trump''s event.  "As law enforcement departments from both counties stand next to this man, let's remember that his type of hatred and rhetoric only fuels gang recruitment," said Sergio Argueta, with the group Strong Youth.  But Nassau County's executive, Democrat Laura Curran, said she's attending in the hopes it'll help in the fight against MS-13.  "It's the president of the United States," she said. "He's coming to Nassau County. Perhaps we can get some resources and federal help, and I am open to having that bi-partisan conversation."  At least 27 murders are now blamed on the notorious gang.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Businesses across Los Angeles - and in cities nationwide - closed on Thursday in support of the "A Day Without Immigrants" protest.  Immigrants skipped out of shopping and stayed home from work and school as a response to President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. Trump is pushing for increased deportations, a wall on the Mexico border and a travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.  In Ventura County, at least 50 students from Ventura College held a demonstration on campus in honor of immigrants.  Similar boycotts were held in Chicago, Washington D.C. Philadelphia and other cities.  Juan Sanjuan, the owner of Gloria's Restaurant & Bar in Huntington Park, was among those who closed for the day.     "Money is important but being with our community, being united is bigger," Sanjuan said. "It's important for people to know that we are here to work and we're good people. We're not here to disrupt or do anything wrong, we're just here to work."
297	1	Washington CNN  —   House Democratic Chairman Joe Crowley collapsed during a protest in Washington on the Trump administration’s immigration policy that has been separating parents and children at the southern border.  Crowley, who is from New York, was participating in the protest alongside his Democratic colleagues in the House.  Lauren French, the spokesperson for Crowley, told CNN he is fine and had collapsed due to heat exhaustion.  After Crowley collapsed, he got back up and walked out of the protest.  French tweeted, “Thanks for all the texts and emails checking in. Chairman Crowley is fine - was just a hot day in DC and a long day marching in protest. But on that note, everyone should drink some water!”  Hundreds of activists from around the country joined lawmakers for the demonstration.  Crowley recently wrote to the Department of Homeland Security to demand information on the location of immigrant children who have been separated from their parents.
170	3	NEWBURYPORT – At least 200 people of all ages rallied in Market Square on Saturday morning, hoisting signs and cheering as organizers urged continued resistance to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies that have taken thousands of children from their parents along the U.S.-Mexico border in a recent crackdown against illegal immigration.  Rally organizer Walt Thompson, as well as City Councilor Charlie Tontar – who talked about his immigrant parents – and Newburyport School Committee Vice Chairman Bruce Menin, urged those at the rally to speak out against what they see as inhumane treatment of immigrants – especially children – who have come over the border, in many cases for work or to escape oppressive conditions in Mexico or countries in Central and South America.   There was tension for a few minutes after two men holding Trump-Pence signs arrived and stood along Merrimac Street in front of the Fire House Center for the Arts.  John Parks and Victor Keller held signs and talked with people who came across the street from the rally. Keller said he called police after a woman grabbed his large Trump sign and tried to bend it.  By noon, at least seven police cruisers arrived with more than a dozen officers from Newburyport, Newbury and state police. Police stood by as the large crowd on the bullnose chanted in support of immigration.   The rally was one of hundreds across the country Saturday, all coordinated to send a message to the White House. Coverage of children being held in scores of detention centers has sparked outrage in many communities across the country, leading to the protests Saturday.  In Boston, police said they arrested a group of protesters outside the South Bay House of Correction during the final part of a daylong series of rallies against immigrant family separation. Boston police arrested 20 people Saturday night after more than 100 activists rallied at an entrance to the facility.  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency detains immigrants at the prison who are not in the U.S. legally.  The day began in City Hall Plaza with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling for ICE to be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.”   Thousands marched from City Hall to Boston Common, where they protested the federal policy of prosecuting people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally that led officials to separate children from their parents.  More than 600 marches drew thousands of people across the country, from immigrant-friendly cities such as Los Angeles and New York City to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming under the banner Families Belong Together, according to The Associated Press.  Immigrant advocacy groups said they were thrilled — and surprised — to see the issue gaining traction among those not tied to immigration.  “Honestly, I am blown away. I have literally never seen Americans show up for immigrants like this,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents nannies, housekeepers and caregivers — many of whom are immigrants. “We just kept hearing over and over again, ‘If it was my child, I would want someone to do something.”’  The rallies received money and support from the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and The Leadership Conference.  But local organizers are shouldering on-the-ground planning, many of them women relying on informal networks established during worldwide women’s marches on Trump’s inauguration and its anniversary.  Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, welcomed interest in the immigration system and said only Congress has the power to change the law.  “We appreciate that these individuals have expressed an interest in and concern with the critical issue of securing our nation’s borders and enforcing our immigration laws,” Houlton said. “As we have indicated before, the department is disappointed and frustrated by our nation’s disastrous immigration laws and supports action.”

[Image: 1-1G8A0638.JPG]  The local GOP committee on Saturday held a second rally at the home of chairman Jon Russell to show continued support for an immigration enforcement program between the federal government and the Culpeper County Sheriff’s Office.   By MARLA MCKENNA  On Saturday afternoon, Culpeper residents rallied both for and against the controversial 287(g) immigration enforcement program—so-named for the applicable section of the Immigration and Nationality Act—set to become official Monday in the county.  The Legal Aid Justice Center’s anti-287(g) gathering took place around a stage erected in Yowell Meadow Park, while at the home of local Republican committee chairman Jon Russell, residents in favor of the controversial agreement rallied for the second time in as many weeks to support the sheriff’s plans to train jail deputies to act in the stead of Immigration and Customs enforcement agents.  “We want the sheriff to withdraw his petition. There is opposition to this program. People are going to be afraid of the police and it’s going to cause more fear,” said Edgar Aranda, head of the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations.  Aranda’s group, along with the Legal Aid Justice Center, kicked off its two-hour protest with about 50 people waving signs reading “No human being is illegal,” “Race is not a crime,” and “Our children are afraid.” Kendra Hendren, a 23-year resident of Culpeper, said she’d rather the community invite an organization such as Welcoming America, which she believes would bolster the county’s economic and social outlook.  “We need to abandon this and fix what’s broken,” said Hendren. “Do you think they’re hunting down Canadians? This is a ‘brown people’ regulation.”  Sophia Gregg, a lawyer with the LAJC, said her group has been actively fighting the implementation in 287(g) for about six months and hoped that Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins would reconsider his plans to enter the agreement with Homeland Security on Monday.  “It’s a very divisive program,” Gregg said. “It erodes the trust between law enforcement and the community. People become afraid and ultimately it makes the community less safe.”  Gregg vowed that the fight wouldn’t end once the program became official next week. The LAJC, she said, would continue to monitor the sheriff’s actions and document any fiscal impact or allegations of racial profiling.  Culpeper Town Police and the Virginia State Police patrolled the park to keep the peace between the two rallies taking place within 100 yards of each other.  Lynn Bell, who moved to the county in 1976, said she found it difficult to park at the rally due to the law enforcement presence and felt “intimidated” trying to enter the area.  Bell said she came to show her support for the community and her desire that Jenkins would follow the lead of Fauquier County Sheriff Bob Mosier who explored, and ultimately abandoned, plans to implement a 287(g) program in April 2017.  “You have to show up for this kind of stuff,” Bell said.  No disturbances between the two groups took place during the hours set aside for the events.  Jenkins made an appearance at the Republican-hosted event where he also made a short speech.  The sheriff noted that under current operations there’s a small chance that undocumented inmates can pass through the county jail without their immigration status being investigated.  “The 287(g) creates a situation where there are 100 percent assurances that the person won’t slip through the cracks,” Jenkins said. “And it stands to reason that a person who isn’t here can’t commit crimes here.”  Jenkins again noted that the 287(g) program, as implemented in Culpeper, will not be a “street level” initiative, meaning only those people who are under arrest will be scrutinized by trained deputies with regards to their immigration status.  He also said that the 287(g) program as implemented in Prince William County’s jail had garnered no civil or legal actions during its 10 years of operation. He said citizens stopped protesting in that county when they saw its positive effects.  Finally, the sheriff said he wasn’t targeting Culpeper’s undocumented immigrants.  “No one talks about the people who are close to me and my family who are in that status,” Jenkins said. “We’re all God’s children and should be treated equally.”  Still, the sheriff went on, we are a “nation of laws.” Jenkins recalled several instances where residents without legal status committed crimes – stabbings, shootings and vehicular homicide.  Culpeper resident Janet McDonnell, who attended the GOP rally, agreed with the sheriff.  “Who wouldn’t support this?” she said. “It’s common sense. I’m not against immigration…I’m against illegal immigration.”  Russell said the Republican committee decided to hold a second pro-287(g) rally because the group wanted to send a strong message off support.  “We’re not going away, the issue isn’t going away and we don’t want the narrative to be that the community doesn’t support this initiative,” Russell said Saturday. “This is not about the sheriff. Once you’re here illegally, don’t exacerbate that by breaking our laws.”  In the park, Culpeper residents Rich and Jacki Keiser held signs to support their anti-287(g) views.  “My wife and I both support the Hispanic community,” Rich Keiser said. “I think most of them were afraid to come out, to tell you the truth. I think I’d be a little leery.”  About 25 people stayed in their cars, in the Blue Ridge Avenue parking lot, during the events although their motivation wasn’t clear. The Gardner Street lot, located between the two rallies, remained closed to cars and traffic during the events.  Following speeches, the 287(g) protesters chanted and marched down Blue Ridge Avenue and Main Street.  Keiser said, “My grandmother was Mexican and I don’t know if she was a legal immigrant or not. It never came up and it doesn’t matter.”  Mateo Gasparotto, a representative of the American Civil Liberties Union, said his organization believes the impending agreement will “further open the door to racism.”  “The Hispanic community will not tolerate the separation of more families, nor will we stand aside while being labeled criminals.  Mateo called 287(g) a “hateful” and “unnecessary” agreement.  Culpeper resident Susan Gugino attended the second pro-287(g) rally, because “there was no opposition to this the last time” and she wanted to show her support for immigration enforcement.  “If you break our laws, you should be subject to those laws,” said Gugino, who said she was “glad to see that our sheriff was here this time.”  The 19-page Memorandum of Agreement between the sheriff’s office and Homeland Security will be signed at 1 p.m. Tuesday during a special ceremony open only to ICE officials, law enforcement and the media.

258	3	Colorado Mountain College students Guadalupe Morales, Fernando Ramos and Raquel Vasquez chat before the start of the DACA Rally held on Grand Avenue in fron of Glenwood Springs High School on Dec. 4, 2017. Chelsea Self / Post Independent |  Young, undocumented immigrants and their supporters rallied outside of Glenwood Springs High School Tuesday as part of a statewide week of demonstrations pushing Congress to pass the Dream Act.  It’s now halfway through the six-month enforcement delay that President Donald Trump gave Congress when in September he rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA is an Obama-era protection of young immigrants brought illegally into the U.S. as children. That six months is the time frame that Congress has to pass legislation to protect those now-vulnerable DACA recipients, and immigration advocates hope the Dream Act of 2017 will be the solution.  Advocates at these rallies are calling on Congress to pass a “clean Dream Act” – meaning clean of other attached legislative agendas, such as the president’s border wall.  Dreamers do not deserve to be used as a bargaining chip, said Junior Ortega, a Garfield County employee and DACA recipient who’s been active as a local immigrant advocate.  “No more money for more border security, no more money for more immigration enforcement, and no more money for a stupid wall,” Alan Muñoz shouted at the rally.  Advocates in Glenwood Springs specifically aimed their message at Rep. Scott Tipton, who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District. Tipton is also scheduled to have a staff member at the Garfield County administration building today, from 2 to 4 p.m.  “We are calling on Congressman Scott Tipton to show moral fortitude, leadership and courage to stand with us for the youth and future of the Roaring Fork Valley’s economic, social and cultural communities,” said Ortega.  At the Glenwood Rally, several Dreamers told the crowd their stories of being raised in the U.S., where their families are rooted and set on a career path that’s now being yanked out from under them. One young woman said her dream has always been to be a nurse, “but my dream is currently on hold.” After studying for two years as a full-time student to meet the requirements of a nursing program, “I was told I couldn’t apply to the program because of my nationality.”  Ruth and David Sante, from Rifle, said they were attending the rally “to support our immigrants and our DACA students.” David, who runs a construction company, said he works with several people with children who are Dreamers. “One person I know, his son would like to go to college, but now he’s deciding not to because he’s afraid he’s going to get deported.”  When asked what he’d like Tipton to hear, David said, “Immigrants are what America is all about. We’ve all been immigrants. And if you want our economy to grow you need that population.”  The rallies across Colorado were a buildup toward a bigger event in Washington D.C. Twenty-three immigrant advocates from Colorado will today join a mass public demonstration at the Capitol to push Congress to pass the Dream Act. Organizations including Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition also want to use the occasion to push for permanent residency for immigrants who were granted temporary protected status, such as those fleeing humanitarian crises.  “The event will be marked as the largest act of civil disobedience organized by immigrant groups in the history of the movement,” according to CIRC.  “The goal of these actions will be to disrupt business as usual at the Capitol, and say that this cannot wait and you cannot play games with people’s lives,” said CIRC’s Sophia Clark.  In early November, Ortega went to D.C. for a demonstration at the Capitol that drew hundreds of undocumented young people calling for Congress to pass the Dream Act.  “It was an intense event, an amazing experience I’ll never forget,” he said Tuesday. He joined hundreds of Dreamers who flooded into the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building. “When you looked up there were floors and floors of people.”  During the demonstration the building erupted with chants: “What do we want? Dream Act!” From an upper floor in the atrium, demonstrators unfurled a large banner that read “CONGRESS WE DEMAND A CLEAN DREAM ACT NOW.”  Ortega had never participated in a mass demonstration like this. The atmosphere was exciting yet nerve wracking, he said, as he was uncertain what might happen. Dreamers usually try to stay under the radar and avoid causing problems, he said.  “It was emotional to see all those people, how many were there and willing to be arrested to demonstrate the urgency [of this bill]. I was speechless,” he said.  If signed into law, the Dream Act would protect young immigrants who were brought into the U.S. illegally when they were children. The act would provide a pathway to permanent residency and then citizenship to these young immigrants.  So far, Dream Act bills in the House of Representatives and Senate have been referred to committees, both controlled by Republicans. The question hanging in the air is whether this is a bipartisan enough issue to clear those committees.  A better shot in the House, said Clark, is getting a “discharge petition” passed. If it garners enough legislators’ signatures, such a petition would allow these bill to bypass the committee and go straight to a vote on the House floors.  “That would actually give it a chance, a much better chance,” Clark said. “And that’s also why we’re working hard to get Rep. Scott Tipton’s support, because we need Republican legislators to take leadership now, like Sen. Cory Gardner has. The more they can be leaders within their own party, the better chance we have.”
189	2	Immigrant solidarity rally held in Mohegan Lake May 24, 2017, 5:01pmUpdated on May 24, 2017 By: News 12 Staff   0:03 / 1:52    More than 100 residents joined together in a solidarity event for immigrants Wednesday night in Mohegan Lake. The rally, held at the Hudson Valley Islamic Community Center, was organized by the Coalition of Concerned Clergy. Leaders of 22 churches, synagogues and mosques across northern Westchester and Putnam signed a "Declaration of Concern," expressing their support for people in the community of Muslim faith and for any immigrants who have been experiencing fear and concern. Organizers Steve Axinn says his own ancestors were immigrants to the United States and were able to flourish. He says he wants that for young people who call the Hudson Valley their home. "That gift which I am living representative of today is the gift that I want to make sure that Muslim children have, Hispanic children have and all children who live in this area have," he says. A moment of silence was also held for those who lost their lives to terrorism in Manchester, England.
173	4	Northborough/Westborough – Rallies were held in Northborough and Westborough June 30, as part of a nationwide initiative protesting the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents as the families illegally enter the United States via the Texas border.  Although President Donald Trump, after a fierce public outcry, changed his mind, reversing that policy on June 20, and ordered that families can no longer be separated, approximately 2,000 children have still not been reunited with their families. Organizers hoped the rallies on June 30, which were held all over the country, would put pressure on the administration to rectify that situation as quickly as possible.   Northborough organizers Patrick Brady, Lindsay Brady and Lindsay’s mother Leslie Williams, had only 10 days to organize the event after asking themselves what they personally could do to advocate for keeping families together.  “We thought about marching in Boston or Washington, D.C,” said Williams, “but we asked ourselves, ‘Why not Northborough?’”  They worked out the logistics with town officials but noted they really had no idea of what the participation was going to be like.  That morning about 150 peaceful protestors of all ages participated in the rally which was held at Ellsworth-McAfee Park.  The organizers thought the turnout and the energy at the event was “incredible”. The summer heat didn’t deter people from lining the street outside of the park area displaying signs and taking shade when needed under the pavilion.  “People are starting to see that coming together in person gives you hope and makes you feel less alone,” said Williams.  Participant Judy Sugarman agreed.  “Being a part of today’s well organized and attended get together and demonstration and being with others who feel the same way I do, helped to lift my spirits,” she said. “Every day of this administration has been frustrating and depressing. Speaking up, voicing my opinion, fighting for others has been important to me- even more so now. Standing on Route 135 with others, holding signs, having drivers beeping their horns, and waving, gives the feeling that others agree. What is most important is to keep going, not give up, get eligible voters to register and then vote in November.”  Lindsay Brady said the expectation is to have another gathering later in the summer and in the meantime use social media as a means to keep the conversation going.  In Westborough, protesters from as far as Sturbridge, Mass. filled the downtown rotary. The latest of several recent protests in town held on the rotary, organizers said they were proud to be bringing politics to a local stage.  The protest, which included men and women of all ages, as well as children holding signs and peacefully waving to passersby, lasted throughout the day and came as the culmination to weeks of work by Cristin Hodgens and her group, Westborough WAVE of Women.  “I couldn’t sleep at night at the thought of children being separated from their families,” she said. “So I had to do something.”  Hodgens has been a fixture of political activism in Westborough and elsewhere in Mass. ever since the nationwide Women’s Marches in January 2017 reintroduced her to activism. After attending the march herself, Hodgens returned to Westborough with a sign and quickly started holding it in the rotary.  Hodgens said she was happy with the overall outcome of the protest June 30. As she and her fellow demonstrators smiled and waved at passing cars, some drivers responded angrily, with at least one shouting “lock em up” in reference to the immigrant families, according to Hodgens. But many more honked, waved back, or even joined Hodgens on the rotary later in the day.  Going forward, she and other organizers are eager to remain locally visible and vocal in a time of intense political turmoil.  “I would like to think that I would take care of my neighbors, that my neighbors would take care of me,” she said. “I think it’s important to have local conversations about politics because that’s where most politics are shaped.”
199	4	JACKSON, MI - Protesters and counter-protesters braved the heat Saturday in Jackson to express their views on President Donald Trump's immigration policy.  The "Families Belong Together" rally in Jackson took place at U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg's office, 401 W. Michigan Ave. A total of 160 people protested the Trump administration policy that has separated children from families. They were met by about 15 counter-protesters supporting the 45th president.   "Even though we were interrupted by counter-protesters, the fact we had the majority shows there's great concern for this (issue) in our community," said Heather Herrera, event organizer.  While the protesters planned to occupy the parking lot of Walberg's office, they were met by a group of Trump supporters. The Trump supporters hoisted American flags and blasted music, while the immigration protesters shouted chants such as "Shame on You" and "Love, not hate, makes America great."  The protesters moved across the street to the area of the Women of Service Military Monument, where speeches began.     Terri McKinnon, a Jackson Democrat running for the 65th District state House of Representative seat, and Steven Friday, a Democrat running for Michigan's 7th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, spoke at the rally.  McKinnon said all citizens in the U.S. are children of immigrants. She also said protesters should reach out to elected officials.  "We have to let them know we will not accept this," McKinnon said. "We will fight."  The protesters then marched eastbound on East Michigan Avenue to the front of the Carnegie Library, 244 W. Michigan Ave. After some speeches, the counter-protesters, including a man towing the "Trump Unity Bridge" halted traffic on East Michigan Avenue, leading to more chants and confrontation from protesters.   The rally ended after the counter-protesters departed and the protesters dispersed from the library. Herrera said she encouraged those in attendance to head to Lansing and attend their "Families Belong Together" rally.   Marcy Jankovich said she and other Trump supporters want the U.S. borders secure.  Trump signed an executive order June 20 ending his administration's policy of separating children from their families who entered the U.S. illegally. A U.S. District Court judge in California granted a preliminary injunction that orders all separated children to be united with their families within 30 days and 14 days for children under age 5.  The Jackson protest was one of many that took place June 30 throughout the U.S. and in Michigan, including in Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids.
180	4	Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct George North's name.  ADRIAN — Families belong together was the rallying cry Saturday afternoon at a demonstration in Adrian.  “They need to end this policy,” Rich Bogrow of Tecumseh said outside of the historic county courthouse while carrying a sign that read “End Family Separation.”  Protest demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s immigrations policies were held across the country Saturday. There were nearly 100 people at the one in Adrian.   Asked why he was outside under the hot summer sun, Bogrow said because he has empathy for other people and sees the policy as inhumane.  The Adrian demonstration was co-organized by local advocate Nicole Gestwite, who with along with some others spoke at the start of the demonstration.  “Today we stand together,” Gestwite said. “We use our privilege and our voices to speak for those who haven’t one, and we tell this current administration that their actions are not OK. Their actions are not humane. We shout to anyone who will listen that families belong together.”   Gestwite said studies prove that childhood trauma can lead to hardships as adults, including both mental and physical issues. She said as a former foster child she still is working through her childhood traumas.  World War II veteran George North, 96, was on hand as well and said he and others fought a war to get rid of people like Trump.  “I think it’s entirely wrong and it’s the worst thing for our country right now,” Norris said of separating families. “Think of those poor little kids. This is not the United States I know.”   Amber Pederson of Seneca Township said the demonstration was a community cause to give voice to the voiceless families impacted by the policy.  “We need to make sure we stand up in support of each other,” she said.
141	3	Immigrant and workers rights advocates, fueled by anger over President Trump’s policies, staged raucous May Day protests Monday that attracted thousands of people in cities in the Bay Area and around the nation.  While May Day usually inspires throngs of loud voices, Monday’s crowds were especially invigorated by the Trump administration’s priorities, particularly against undocumented immigrants.  “It’s our duty to unite together,” said Yadira Sanchez, 26, one of hundreds of demonstrators who blocked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in San Francisco’s Financial District. “There’s growing momentum. People are angry and upset.”  After circling the streets around the ICE building, the protesters marched down Clay Street to Justin Herman Plaza. By noon, the crowd had swollen to several thousand. Protesters began marching west, down the middle of Market Street. Traffic stalled and police held back cars on side streets.  Shoulder to shoulder at the front of the throng were San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and San Francisco supervisors Jane Kim, Katy Tang and Ahsha Safai, directly behind a banner proclaiming “Unidos Somos la Fuerza” (”Together We Are Strong”).  128 Veronica Gonzalez (left) and Miriam Cuevas (right) cheer as they protest immigration rights and fair pay outside of the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services building on Sansome Street in San Francisco, California, on Monday, May 1, 2017. 1 of 128Veronica Gonzalez (left) and Miriam Cuevas (right) cheer as they protest immigration rights and fair pay outside of the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services building on Sansome Street in San Francisco, California, on Monday, May 1, 2017.Gabrielle Lurie/The Chronicle At Civic Center Plaza, the crowd lay down on the scant patches of green, gulping water and slurping frozen treats, while speakers took to a small stage and Latino rappers did their thing.  “Today is a labor day and an immigration day,” said Yemeni expatriate Ahmed Abosayd, a vice president of the Service Employees International Union local chapter.  Abosayd, whose son, Mustafa, was detained at San Francisco International Airport in the opening hours of the first version of Trump’s travel ban in February, urged the crowd to “give a message to Donald Trump: No ban, no wall.”  In past years, protesters seemed to represent many causes. This year, labor unions, immigrant advocates, teachers and environmentalists coalesced around a single anti-Trump message.  In Oakland, a few dozen protesters gathered at the Alameda County Administration building. Four demonstrators were arrested after chaining themselves to the front of the building.  Demonstrators called on the county Board of Supervisors to “rein in the sheriff” and stop the agency’s cooperation with ICE.  “By connecting the fight for immigrants with the fight against police militarization, people in Oakland are standing together,” said Mohamed Shehk, a 28-year-old organizer with the Oakland Sin Fronteras activist group. “People are galvanized — they see a need to organize and resist.”  In all, about 100 demonstrators gathered in the plaza in front of the administration building a couple blocks from Lake Merritt, some with babies, dogs and bicycles in tow. It was a diverse coalition that included Asians for Black Lives, Critical Resistance and Third World Resistance.  “We’re just out here to demand the Board of Supervisors stop their reliance on military policing — specifically with Urban Shield,” said Woods Ervin, 34, of Oakland, referring to the police training program founded by Alameda County Sheriff Gregory Ahern in 2007.  Thousands of protesters rallied in downtown San Jose, where some buses were rerouted and many businesses were closed. Mayor Sam Liccardo welcomed the marchers and vowed to “celebrate our community as a welcoming and inclusive place for our immigrant neighbors ... in contrast to the rhetoric emanating from Washington.”  Other protests were being organized by the California Teachers Association. The events were expected to put a strain on substitute teacher rolls.  By early in the evening, thousands of people were still marching in Oakland, having made it deep into the city's Fruitvale neighborhood before switching course to the north, marching toward Lake Merritt.  Among the masses was 68-year-old Roy Wilson, an Oakland resident since 1998 and the executive director of Oakland's Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center, a group that builds civic engagement amongst local middle and high schoolers.  Wilson was opposed to a number of things: Trump in general, cutting back environmental regulations and the like.  "We the people don't understand, don't care, or don't know what it means," he said, referring to America's status as the most powerful country in the world and how the president is changing things, changing fast.  Dropping sweat and hoisting a sign with three students, Wilson, asked if he was tired after marching since early afternoon, didn't skip a beat.  "Tired?" he said. "I'm feeling great."
94	1	DPS is blocking the ramps at the I-10 and 16th St as people protest on a nearby overpass.   By: abc15.com staffPosted at 3:24 PM, Feb 17, 2017 and last updated 6:31 PM, Feb 17, 2017 A group of protesters lined 16th Street over the I-10 Friday afternoon with signs, to protest President Trump’s immigration policies.  Valley agencies closed traffic ramps from Interstate 10 to 16th Street before the group arrived in preparation, but the protesters have so far made no attempt to try to enter the freeway ramps.  The protest was promoted on social media to start at 4 p.m. a block away from the freeway.     In a Facebook invite called “Anti-Fascist march and #General Strike,” the organizer urged people to meet at Los Altos Ranch Market, near Roosevelt and 16th streets, at 4 p.m. on Friday.  According to a description on the page, they’ll be standing up for all immigrants, documented and undocumented.  DPS and Phoenix Police confirmed to ABC15 they "have a plan in place to work with other law enforcement and governmental partners."  So far no injuries and no arrests have been reproted as part of the protest.  Traffic on the main lanes of I-10 are flowing normally as of 5 p.m.
45	2	At least three local restaurants closed Thursday as part of a national effort to recognize the importance of immigrants to the U.S. workforce.  Mi Tierra on Route 9 in Hadley and Bueno y Sano and Paul & Elizabeth's, both in downtown Northampton, were shuttered as part of an action called "A Day Without Immigrants"  Mi Tierra owners Jorge Sosa, an immigrant from Mexico, and Dora Saravia, who immigrated from El Salvador, posted the importance of closing on their restaurant’s Facebook page.  "We understand that nothing will have any effect if we don't stay together,” they wrote. “I hope all of you understand."  Bueno y Sano, meanwhile, put on its Twitter feed that the Northampton and West Springfield locations would not open.  "Northampton and W. Springfield Buenos are closed today in observance of the Day Without Immigrants, to encourage awareness and support."  Bueno owner Bob Lowry said the action was an important issue for some of his staff, and that he accepted the decisions of those who took the day off.  "I just immediately got in the mode that what you guys need to do is completely fine," Lowry said.  Some at the Amherst location were less interested in making a statement and so that Bueno remained open.  Paul & Elizabeth's put up sign in its Thorne’s marketplace site that the closing was needed to support and show solidarity for staff and the restaurant community, with an intent to reopen for regular business Friday.  La Veracruzana kept its Northampton and Amherst locations open, in part because of the snowstorms that owner Martin Carrera said had affected business in recent days. But not because he is not sympathetic to showcasing how immigrants are an important part of the American economy.  "That doesn't mean me and my employees don't believe in what is happening," Carrera said. "In order to have comprehensive immigration reform, you need to really ask yourself what we're going to do with 12 million who don’t have documents; deporting them is not the answer.”  Carrera said it would be inhumane to remove so many people, especially after they have been given a tacit blessing to start businesses, and those who are undocumented aren't just restaurant workers and hotel maids, but businesspeople, scientists, doctoral students and developers for Google and Apple.
171	2	Two groups demonstrating for International Workers' Day nearly came to blows in front of City Hall on Monday in the culmination of a fight that began on the internet.  On one side, a man in a hockey helmet pawed the ground on all fours while over 40 others with homemade shields, hockey sticks, flag poles or gas masks shouted.  Across the lawn, a smaller, black-clad group chanted, clanking their Louisville Slugger baseball bats together. They began to move toward each other, but before they met, Metro Police swept in to create a barrier of bicycles.  When Nashville Antifa, a local anarchist group, organized the workers solidarity rally, Brandon Curran, of Rutherford County, and Michael Graham, of White House, Tenn., started planning a counterprotest.  "We're here simply to make sure that, if they want to protest and not mess stuff up, we don't have a problem with that," Graham said. "Because for us to try to come and stop it would mean we're turning into the very thing we hate, which is them."   Both men carried guns in holsters, something they said they always do.  Threats had been pouring across the internet in the weeks leading up to the May Day event. One man even made death threats, holding grenades and a gun up to the camera. He encouraged others to kill the antifascists. But Curran said they reported that to police.  Metro Police confirmed they were aware of the video.  "He was advocating for hurting people," Curran said. "And we reported that crime."  A member of Nashville Antifa turns and yells back at a counterprotester in the middle of Charlotte Avenue. The argument was broken up by police. He said seeing the smashed windows and fires at a protest in Berkeley, Calif., made him want to organize this protest to try and stop it from happening in Nashville.  The Nashville Antifa protesters said they were just there to show their solidarity with the working class.  Often called May Day, International Workers' Day has its roots in Chicago in the 1880s. It was started as a way to agitate for the eight-hour workday.   After facing off for nearly two hours, Nashville Antifa left for another demonstration, chased by the counterprotesters chanting "Trump" and singing the Pledge of Allegiance. Police continued to escort both groups until they dispersed.  In South Nashville and the rest of the state, Nashvillians participated in marches and a general strike. Workers' Dignity and Music City Riders United organized a march and celebration as part of the national "Day Without an Immigrant."  Around 200 demonstrators called for a living wage, an end to wage theft, affordable housing, better public transportation and for there to be not one more deportation. They also demanded the public divest from police agencies and invest in communities.   Fanne Lopez, a construction worker in Nashville, said she is marching for all the same reasons, but she said that she wants Nashville to be a better place for immigrants where they can have equal rights.  "We want Nashville to become a sanctuary city," she said in Spanish. "We want to receive fair wages."  She said that the majority of those who work in for the construction and landscaping companies responsible for the city's growth are Hispanic.  Black Lives Matter Nashville, the Justice for Jocques Coalition, UAW Local 737 and the Central Labor Council, among others, also had a presence at the demonstration.  The march, which began in Coleman Park, was peaceful.
107	4	HOLLYWOOD — Even as the heat index hit 100 Saturday, more than a thousand South Floridians took to the streets in Boca Raton, Hollywood, Miami and West Palm Beach to keep the heat on presidential policy that has separated some 2,000 migrant children from their parents.  They were part of the same movement that galvanized 700 nationwide demonstrations, organized by a collection of grass-roots groups including the Move On and Families Belong Together, organizations to bring about change in immigration policy. The sight of traumatized children united them.  “Our country was founded out of a concern for decency,” said Laura Samuels, who drove from Delray Beach to attend the protest in Hollywood, where several hundred marched outside the Diplomat Beach Resort, where state Democrats were holding their annual June conference. “There is no basic, fundamental decency to separating families of immigrants.”  After rallying with some words from notables such as U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, and West Palm Beach Mayor Jeri Muoio, about 550 people marched from the intersection of Southern Boulevard and South Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach, to the gates of Mar-a-Lago, estimated Jim Haug, 51, a Palm Beach Gardens editor, who was among the protesters.  ADVERTISEMENT  About 250 protesters were counted in downtown Boca Raton. And social media feeds showed hundreds of protesters gathering at Freedom Tower in Miami. Police shut down traffic on Biscayne Boulevard to accommodate the march.

(Yutao Chen / South Florida Sun Sentinel)  1 / 15 Some who showed up to the rally were seasoned anti-Trump demonstrators, others were new to immigration activism. Some parents said they feel compelled to show up after gut-wrenching accounts of children forcibly taken from their families as they crossed the border illegally.  In West Palm Beach, Haug said the past few weeks have been a nonstop stream of reasons to protest against the current administration. To the idea of children being separated from their parents, “I had a visceral reaction,” Haug said. “I just can’t imagine separating kids from their parents at the border after a harrowing trip through Mexico.”  Rucsandra Vitere, 23, is an Orlando area school teacher who joined the Hollywood demonstrators in support of some of her students who came from trouble-spots in Venezuela, Guatemala, and especially Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, she said.
104	2	In conjunction with a nationwide day of such assemblies, more than 600 people gathered for a vigil in Five Points Park to protest the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance approach to immigration and separation of families detained at the U.S./Mexico border.  “Tonight in Sarasota, we joined with over 700 nationwide rallies and protests demanding families be reunited now!” said organizer Dianne Perry of Action Together Suncoast Indivisible. “We value families and people,” she added.  Perry, who after reviewing photos later said she thought the crowd might have been closer to 1,000 strong, also praised the local candidates for office who attended and spoke at the event, calling them “courageous.”
205	4	More than 100 people rallied in locations across New Jersey on Thursday to protest a new "zero tolerance" policy of immigration enforcement that has led to the separation of children from parents caught illegally crossing the southern border, nearly 2,000 miles away.  A group of concerned citizens gathered at Rutherford Congregational Church before marching down Union Ave. The group participated in a national day of rallies and protests organized by activists behind Families Belong Together. The group is protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating parents and their children crossing the border for asylum. Thursday, June 14, 2018. About 50 marchers gathered at the Rutherford Congregational Church at noon, armed with signs that read "Don't Separate Families" and "Children belong with their Families." Then they walked nearly 2 miles to the Rutherford train station chanting, "Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcomed here."   "I was crying when I got here,'' Patricia Dahlman of Lyndhurst said after she arrived at the church at the end of the march, still reeling from news reports on the separated families. "It's a sad situation our country is in. We need to do these walks; we need to stand up to Trump and his people."   A group of concerned citizens gathered outside of Rutherford Congregational Church to participate in a national day of rallies and protests organized by activists behind Families Belong Together on Thursday, June 14th, 2018. The group is protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating parents and their children crossing the border. The walk and similar events in Highland Park and Princeton were part of a nationwide day of action denouncing the administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement.  Immigration:How many unaccompanied migrant children have come to New Jersey?  Enforcement:Delivery man detained by ICE being held at the Hudson County jail  Airport issue:14 New Jersey women alleging anti-Muslim bias at Newark Airport security  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last month that children would be detained separately rather than with their parents, as was the practice under previous presidents. The Trump administration described the new policy as a tougher approach that would serve as a deterrent to families seeking to enter the country illegally. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration over illegal border crossings, which have increased in recent months.  Administration officials said the aim is to prosecute everyone who is caught entering the country illegally.   By Wednesday, the government was housing more than 1,400 immigrant boys who had been separated from their parents inside a former Walmart store in Texas. The government also has plans to build tent cities at military installations around Texas to house unaccompanied migrant children, according to news reports.  Marchers on Thursday said the policy was cruel and not in keeping with the nation's values. Some said they had seen the images of the children in the former Walmart, which reporters were allowed to tour this week, and that they felt compelled to show their opposition to the separations.  Approximately 50 people gathered in Rutherford Thursday June 14, 2018, for a "Families Belong Together" rally to protest a new policy that calls for children to be separated from parents after they enter the country illegally. "I just thought that this is the kind of thing we have to stop, and I've been feeling helpless for a while at the things that are going on, and the people who are in a position to stop these things are not stopping them,'' said Chris Rywalt of Wood-Ridge, a father of three. "And so if this is what we have to do, this is what we have to do. If I could drive down there and chain myself to something, I would."  In Highland Park, about 75 people converged at the corner of Raritan and South Adelaide Avenues for a rally sponsored by the Reformed Church of Highland Park, which has offered refuge to asylum seekers. Participants there carried placards that read "Refugees Welcome" and "We Stand for Peace."   A rally for "Families belong Together" held in Highland Park on Thursday, June 14, 2018,  to protest the separation of children from their parents at the southwest border. Among the speakers was Jocelyn Pangemanan, 15, who was separated from her father, Harry, this year when he took refuge at the church to avoid detectionand possible deportation. She said it was painful to be apart from her father, who has since returned home to his family after a federal immigration judge temporarily blocked his deportation.   “Me being separated from my father is not something I want to stand for, and I don’t want other children to feel this kind of pain of being scared every day that their father, their mother, their family is going to be deported and separated from them with no chance of coming home,” said Jocelyn, a U.S. citizen. “We can’t let the government separate families again. We have to stand together to help these parents stay in America with their children without being separated from them.”    The Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, the co-pastor of Reformed Church of Highland Park, called for New Jersey to implement measures to protect families who might be targeted by immigration officers. His church has hosted several rallies supporting undocumented immigrants.  "We cannot, and will not, stand by as children are literally ripped away from their parents,'' Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, said in a statement that was read aloud at the ceremony. "This is not a one-time event, either, but is instead a systematic policy to terrify anyone looking to come to the United States regardless of their need of asylum. "  Samantha Boose, 35, of Montclair brought her 4-year-old daughter, Charlotte, to the march in Rutherford and held her close afterward. She said she could not imagine being separated from her daughter.   "There's a general feeling among moms and parents, just parents in general, that this is outrageous, and that my child could never survive without me and that children are not criminals, nor do they have the capacity to be,'' Boose said.   She said she had spoken to her daughter about the reason they had to march.  Genevieve Deely brought her daughter, Hope Deely, 8 months to Rutherford Congregational Church to participate in a national day of rallies and protests organized by activists behind Families Belong Together. The group is protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating parents and their children crossing the border for asylum. Thursday, June 14, 2018. "I told her children deserved to be with their moms and dads, and they deserve to be safe,'' she said.   The Rev. Ron Verblaauw, the pastor of the church, said the interest in the protest grew as the word got out via social media. He said it fit with the denomination's theme this year of loving children, loving neighbors, and loving creation.   Andrea Long, the donor relations manager for American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey and a congregant of the church, organized the march after she talked to others who were upset about the policy.   "We don't march in Rutherford very often, but there is a lot of interest and concern, and I feel great about this turnout considering its noon on a Thursday,'' she said. "This is an issue that touches a lot of people, it clearly has struck a nerve, and people want to do what they can because this is not what America is about."
255	4	Immigrant rights advocates gathered today outside of the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility at Batavia in support of undocumented women facing deportation. More than 50 people, including many from New York City — and one sporting an oversize Donald Trump head, orange skin and all, holding a "Deport Me" sign — stood close together to listen to women speakers tell their own stories and call for solidarity with local immigrants.  The rally was coordinated with an Upstate woman's appearance in front of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at Batavia scheduled for today. Arely, a Syracuse woman originally from Guatemala, and her husband were driving to Ithaca in 2013 when they were pulled over, and not having New York drivers' licenses, they were detained and turned over to Border Patrol.  Since then she had been having regular phone check-ins with ICE, but immigration authorities called for her to appear in person today in Batavia.  Rally organizers wanted to highlight women being detained in Batavia, which they said is a new development. "They're detaining women here in Batavia, and they didn't used to," said Fabiola Ortiz Valdez of the New York Immigration Coalition. "That means the deportation machine is growing."  Among the speakers was Dolores Bustamante, an Upstate apple farm worker who was pulled over in 2014 and now faces deportation. "Unfortunately, there are so many of us women who are going through this process," she said, through a translator. "We are being separated from our families."  In the crowd were organizers from the Worker Justice Center, Workers' Center of Central New York, the Hispanic Latina Women's League, ICE Free NYC, Washington State's Familias Unidas Por La Justicia, the Geneseo Student Coalition for Migrant Workers, and Black Lives Matter Syracuse.  "Black people are being criminalized and targeted. Also, we have black people who are immigrants," said Rahzie Seals, a BLM Syracuse organizer whose cousin was killed by police. "Our struggle for basic human rights is connected." Seals also shared her story about being recently assaulted and beaten by a group of men while she and her friend were shopping. While she was in the hospital, friends stayed with her and tended to her inured friend as well. "That was solidarity," she said.  A statement was read from a woman who was detained and separated from her husband after they were pulled off of a Greyhound bus. And another woman spoke about her husband being picked up by ICE from their home and detaining him in Batavia for 11 months. The man has epilepsy, and had multiple seizures a day. "He could have died in there," she said.  "Isn't it disgusting," said Nikeeta Slade, an organizer with the Workers' Center, "that this is a country that is obsessed with family values, but then it has the cruelty and the audacity to rip families apart?"
63	4	WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of people turned out from coast-to-coast Saturday in "Families Belong Together" rallies to protest the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy and implore their fellow citizens to turn out to vote in November's midterm elections.  While the thrust of the near 750 marches and rallies was to defend the 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, the tone was decidedly political.  In Atlanta, Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who once marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was blunt: "We've got to get out and vote like we never voted before," he said, prompting chants from the crowd," Vote! Vote! Vote!"  He roused the crowd by imploring them: "Don't give up, don't give in — keep marching."     In Dallas, where hundreds turned out downtown to call for a clear plan to reunify families separated by the administration policy, one sign said simply: “November is coming.”  In the nation's capital, thousands poured into Lafayette Square, across from the White House, to chant “We care” and “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA.”  Protesters waved signs in English and Spanish. One sign, sounding like a mother's stern rebuke, read in Spanish, “Trump te calmas o te calmo.” Translation: "Calm down, Trump,  or I will calm you down."  Another sign said, “Melania & Ivanka, stop the child abuse.”  While President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump avoided the chants in Washington, the protests followed them to their weekend retreat in Bedminster, New Jersey.   Only a few miles from Trump National Golf Course, more than 100 protesters lined the side of a major New Jersey highway, waving anti-Trump signs and chanting, “Where are the children!”  Jack Gavin, of West Caldwell, New Jersey, handed out miniature copies of the U.S. Constitution, “Facts Matter” pins and cold drinks. He said he also planned to attend rallies in Newark and Clifton, New Jersey.   In Washington, Shelley Kohl, a retired business owner from Johnson City, Tennessee, said she does not usually engage in politics, but the images of children being separated from their parents motivated her to travel here for the protests.    “Kids don’t belong in cages. Families don’t belong in cages, and kids absolutely don’t belong being removed from their families,” Kohl said.   In New York City, protesters at a Manhattan park chanted "shame!" and "shut detention down" as they geared up to march across the Brooklyn bridge to Cadman Plaza, near the federal courthouse.  Episcopalian Chaplain Jenifer Gamber, 52, said she hoped to send a strong signal to elected officials about the public's opinions on immigration.   "I am appalled at the Trump administration’s treatment of people seeking asylum in the United States that criminalizes asylum-seeking and separates families," Gamber said.   Organizers in the Families Belong Together Coalition included the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the ACLU, Leadership Conference and MoveOn.org.   In  El Paso, several hundred people took part in a rally at the front of the Paso del Norte international bridge downtown. "America will be defined by its borders ... not by Trump and not by walls," Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights, one of the rally organizers, told the crowd from the back of a white pickup truck.

"This administration is putting (immigrant) families in danger.  "Immigrants helped build our nation. Now, they come through the new Ellis Island," he said as he pointed to the international port of entry behind him, drawing cheers from the crowd.   In Boston, the “Rally Against Family Separation” began with a morning march from City Hall to Boston Common, where a large rally took place. The protest was meant to oppose Trump’s ban on travelers from certain Muslim-majority nations.   Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Joe Kennedy III, both Massachusetts Democrats, were in attendance, with the senator telling the crowd, “This is about children held in cages.”  Warren recently visited a Border Patrol processing center in McAllen, Texas.  Organizers demanded that local government agencies stop cooperating with federal immigration authorities.  Some 700 rallies were mounted in all states, ranging from cities like Austin, Nashville and San Francisco, to Fort Myers, Florida, and the Milwaukee suburbs.  Among the rallies:  — In Louisville, Ky., protesters sought refuge from the sweltering heat around Metro Hall. Art Baltes stood out from the crowd, pacing back and forth under the sunshine with a banner in hand: “Immigrants and Refugees Welcome.”  Baltes, of Louisville, said his Catholic faith spurred him to attend the rally. “That’s exactly where it starts — our faith,” he said. “We just want people to know that people in this town support immigrants and refugees.”  — In Nashville, Abigail Taylor, a 37-year-old mother of three, said she “can’t in good conscious pretend like nothing is happening and have my family go about like nothing is wrong.”   “The idea of someone taking them from me without saying goodbye, and them thinking I abandoned them, breaks my heart," she said.   — In York, Pennsylvania, John Terlazzo sat cross-legged wearing a sign bearing a quote from Buddha that said, "Hatred never ceases by hatred." Asked why he was attending the rally, he said, “Because I’m sane.This whole regime is an atrocity. And I don’t care who you are, you don’t mess with children.”   — In Ithaca, New York,  about 500 people turned out on the Ithaca Commons to protest Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policies and family separation.   Among the signs was one reading: "Nazi's separated families. We shall not."  — In Denver, where 4,000 people turned out for a boisterous rally, Joan Culwell of Littleton, Colorado, said she had never been to a protest but decided to go after first lady Melania Trump recently wore a coat that read, “I really don’t care, do u?” while traveling to visit migrant children.  Culwell wore a T-shirt saying, “I care!! Do you?”  — In Onancock, Virginia, an Eastern Shore town with a population of under 1,300, some 60 people turned out for a march and a "Rally for the Children" protest organized by a grassroots committee.       Karen Mallard, former Democratic candidate for Congress, told the crowd:  "We're in this mess because citizens haven't been paying attention. So, this is how America becomes great again — we all get involved; we all march, and marching is just the beginning."   The nationwide rallies were in response to a widespread desire among many Americans to take action against Trump's crackdown on immigration, said Lorella Praeli, ACLU director of immigration policy and campaigns.   "This is our country, and if there is something happening that takes us in the wrong direction, we can’t stay silent," Praeli said. "It’s on us to hold our elected officials accountable, to hold our president accountable and to demand action. So silence in this moment is complicity."   After Trump signed an executive order last week ending the family separations, a California judge ordered the Trump administration Tuesday evening to reunite the migrant families it had separated.  There are 2,047 children that must be placed in the same facility as their parents within the next two to four weeks. But U.S. law and a series of court rulings that limit the amount of time minors can be held in detention will further complicate those reunions.

123	3	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — An "interfaith procession" was held Thursday in solidarity with area immigrant communities.  Community members gathered at First Congregational United Church of Christ on Oak Street in downtown Asheville just before noon.    Members of more than 130 faith communities across 19 North Carolina counties, signed a "Declaration of Solidarity" since March 4, to show support for immigrants and their families.  The procession began with a unifying song for sanctuary as participants filed out of the church onto Oak Street, making their way toward the first stop at Beth Ha-Tephila Synagogue for prayer.  The procession then proceeded to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Asheville, where the declaration was presented to representatives of area immigrant communities.  Speakers from Nuestro Centro accepted the declaration. Miran Porrus and Geny Hernandez Lopez took turns reading the response in Spanish and then translating to English. They said, "As a member of the Asheville community, I receive this declaration in support of my community with an open heart. I give thanks for these efforts and would like to emphasize that this declaration is part of the reality currently lived in this country and that this country has lived in for centuries before."  The speakers emphasized the need for this support across minority communities.  Several houses of faith and worship are pledging to offer sanctuary to immigrants and their families, with many more considering doing the same or supporting congregations that do.  Land of the Sky United Church of Christ is pledging short-term sanctuary for those who need it.  "That means that we would house an immigrant individual or family for two to three nights," the Rev. Amanda Hendler-Voss said. "We don’t have a lot of shower and bathing facilities, and so we're unable to offer long-term sanctuary, but we would do it for two or three nights and really just provide a round the clock companionship, safety. We would do everything in our power to make sure that that family knows the extravagant radical welcome of our god."  Hendler-Voss said the shift in policy from the previous presidential administration has been dramatic. "We’ve recently in these times seen a crackdown that is impacting not only the communities that were previously impacted under the Obama administration, but really we're seeing people who are coming forward to report domestic violence being deported, we're seeing dreamers be deported, we’re seeing people who are what they’re calling quote unquote collateral damage be deported, where they are not violent criminals by any stretch of the imagination and yet they’re being taken from their homes.  "We as faith leaders feel that it’s so important across religious traditions, across faith traditions, to come together and say that we will not stand for this," Hendler-Voss continued. "That we believe in loving our neighbors as ourselves and we will protect our neighbors."  As of today, the declaration had collected more than 1,775 signatures and is open again to collect more signatures. It can be read in full and signed by visiting the website here.
9	3	PHOENIX — For the past four years, federal immigration authorities have given Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos a pass to remain in the U.S. rather than deport her back to Mexico.   Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos (center, at microphones) on Feb. 8, 2017, addresses supporters who gathered outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in central Phoenix, where she would later learn that she was being deported. But that changed Wednesday, when Garcia de Rayos went to check in as usual at the central Phoenix offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Instead of being released, she was taken into custody, while her husband, two children — both U.S.-born citizens — and a group of supporters watched in tears.  And by Wednesday night, her case had become the new epicenter of the debate over immigration enforcement, as protesters surrounded the ICE office on North Central Avenue in an attempt to block buses from taking her away. Garcia de Rayos apparently was in one of those vehicles, which are used to transport people in ICE custody to detention centers, or to the border for deportation.  Her family and supporters fear Garcia de Rayos, 36, may now be deported quickly to Mexico. That, they say, would make her among the first casualties under a shift in policy by ICE under President Trump.  After 9 p.m., police officers amassed on the south side of the facility as protesters continued to block access, chanting "Justice!" and "Power to the people, no one is illegal!"   The effort was organized by Puente Arizona, the same group that was known for blocking roads surrounding a Donald Trump campaign rally in Fountain Hills last year.  The Wednesday night scene remained peaceful past 10 p.m. MT, as most in the crowd complied with police requests to stay off the street. Police, in riot gear, stood by.  But as some protesters continued to block vehicles, several people were taken into custody. Phoenix police Sgt. Jonathan Howard said seven people were arrested, all peacefully.   Maria Castro, 23, was in the crowd. "Lupita was a victim of Arpaio's raids," she said, "and now she is a victim of Trump 's deportation machine."  The raids, from years ago, may be the connection to Trump's orders this year.  Syrian refugee family, seeking new life, arrives in Milwaukee  In one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 instructing immigration authorities to ramp up deportations, in part by broadening priorities to include undocumented immigrants convicted of any crimes or charged with any crimes.  Trump's order is a major departure from former president Barack Obama's deportation priorities, which focused primarily on deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes and allowing those with long ties to the U.S. and no significant criminal background to remain in the U.S.  In a statement, ICE officials said only that Garcia de Rayos was detained because of her prior conviction, which stems from a work-site raid almost a decade ago. They did not comment on whether they diverged from the previous check-in specifically because of the recent executive order.   "It has 100% to do with the executive order," said Ray Ybarra-Maldonado, a Phoenix immigration lawyer who is representing Garcia de Rayos. "Her case is no different than the last time she checked in. The facts are 100% the same. The only difference is the priorities for removal have now changed."  Supporters of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos comfort each other after learning she would be deported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix on Feb. 8, 2017. Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports Trump's immigration crackdowns, agreed.  "It could very well be," Vaughan said. "There were so many people exempt under the Obama administration's deportation scheme so it would not surprise me at all" that ICE taking Garcia de Rayos into custody is a result of "the scrapping of that scheme in favor of the Trump administration's executive order, which returns a great deal of discretion to ICE officers in the field to enforce immigration laws as they were written."  Get the Everyone's Talking newsletter in your inbox. Get caught up with the trending news you need to know  Delivery: Mon - Fri Your Email In anticipation that Garcia de Rayos could be taken into custody, the group Puente Arizona organized a rally outside the Central Avenue offices of ICE. The group advocates to stop the deportation of undocumented immigrants.  As Garcia de Rayos walked through the gates towards the building, some supporters yelled out in Spanish, "We are with you, Lupe." Others locked arms, while some cars honked as they drove past.  U Visa data give glimpse into local law enforcement-immigrant relationship  "To me this is an injustice," said Garcia's 14-year-old daughter, Jaqueline Rayos Garcia, standing outside the building in tears. "She has always worked to give us a good education."  Vaughan, however, disagreed that it would be unfair to deport Garcia de Rayos. She said Garcia de Rayos should not be allowed to stay if she has no legal standing to remain despite her long ties.  "I don't think it would be unfair, no," she said. "I think it would be unfair to all the other legal immigrants who qualify and go through the process, if she were allowed to stay, just because she has been here a long time."  Carlos Garcia, the director of Puente, said he believes ICE's decision to take Garcia de Rayos into custody will spur other undocumented immigrants who have been released on supervision to stop checking in and go into hiding.   "Most definitely, if what’s going to happen when people come to check in they are going to get detained and deported, I would assume most people will not turn themselves in," he said.  In a written statement, ICE officials confirmed that Garcia de Rayos had been detained based on a prior removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review. The order became final in May 2013.  Federal appeals court skeptical of Trump's travel ban  "Relevant databases indicate Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation,” the statement said.  The felony conviction stems from a 2008 work-site raid by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, said attorney Ybarra-Maldonado.  He said Garcia de Rayos came to the U.S. in 1996, when she was 14.   In 2008, she was swept up in one of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's work-site raids targeting the Golfland Entertainment Centers, which operated several water and mini-golf parks. Sheriff's deputies seized hundreds of employment records and later arrested Garcia de Rayos at her house in Mesa. She pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, the lowest level.  As a result of the charge, Garcia de Rayos was then turned over to ICE, Ybarra-Maldonado said. She spent six months in ICE custody at the Eloy Detention Center, he said.  In 2013, an immigration judge found Garcia de Rayos had no legal stance to remain in the U.S. and issued a voluntary departure instructing her to leave the country, Ybarra-Maldonado said.  After Garcia de Rayos appealed the voluntary departure, ICE gave her an order of supervision instructing her to check in yearly, and then every six months, Ybarra-Maldonado said.  Garcia de Rayos was scheduled for her six month check-in Wednesday but instead of being told to come back in six months, she was taken into custody, he said.  Ybarra-Maldonado immediately filed documents asking ICE to stay her deportation, on the grounds that she has lived in the U.S. since she was 14, has two children who are U.S. citizens, and she is fighting to have her felony conviction thrown out on the grounds that Arpaio's work-site raids were unconstitutional.  About 100 people gathered outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in central Phoenix in support of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos on Feb. 8, 2017. He also pointed out that she had been just a few months too old to apply for Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program granting deportation deferments and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Her felony conviction, though, most likely would have disqualified her from that program.  "She's built a great life for herself and her children, and her kids want her to be home at night. Her kids want her to take them to school, to be at the parent-teacher conference, to see them go to prom, and to see them graduate, and more than anything she deserves to live a life she has built."

219	3	A crowd of about 50 chanted outside the Neal Smith Federal Building in Des Moines Friday morning.  "Education, not deportation," they shouted. "No human is illegal."  The group was there to call on Congress to protect DREAMers and extend temporary protected status (TPS) to all immigrants in the U.S. without documentation.  "They need to know Iowans support undocumented immigrants," said Kenia Calderon, 24, of Des Moines, of U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst and U.S. Rep. David Young.  Register editorial: Congress should stop dragging feet on immigration reform  Guest opinion: DACA had to go, and here's why  Current Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protections will expire March 5, 2018 as a result of the Trump administration's decision to end the program. However, the administration allowed 154,000 DACA recipients to renew those protections.  According to the advocacy group Center for American Progress, 22,000 DACA  recipients missed the October 5 deadline to renew their protections.  Calderon said thousands of undocumented immigrants will lose DACA protections, emphasizing the urgency of her and the other protesters' pleas. "They need to act now," she said of Iowa's representatives in Congress.  "It's important because I'm a DACA recipient myself," Calderon said. "I know many other DACA recipients in our state who are living in fear. It's very close to home."  Calderon said Iowans can call their representatives to ask them to pass a Clean Dream Act, the term used for legislation that will give young undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship.
239	3	SAN DIEGO (NEWS 8/AP) - South Bay leaders came together Thursday to call for a permanent legislative solution for DACA recipients.  On December 5, the Chula Vista City Council unanimously passed a resolution urging the U.S. Congress to support the DREAM Act.   Local elected leaders, "Dreamers," and other community representatives will speak to the importance of passing a permanent legislative solution for DACA recipients before Congress heads home for the holidays.  DACA negotiations are still up in the air, as the year-end budget deadline nears.   The fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants living here illegally and facing deportation will be decided next year, a Republican senator says.  Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said Wednesday he received assurances from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the Senate will vote in January on bipartisan legislation. The promise came in talks with the GOP leader on Flake's backing for the tax bill.  "While I would have written a much different bill, this bill lowers the corporate tax rate in a manner that makes us globally competitive," Flake said in a statement. He said McConnell has made a commitment for a vote on the measure now being negotiated.  The White House and lawmakers are working out details of the bill, but Flake said in an interview with The Associated Press that the legislation will broadly address border security, asylum policy and a fix for certain young immigrants.  At issue is President Donald Trump's decision to rescind an Obama-era executive order that created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which gave protected status to about 800,000 of those immigrants who are in the United States illegally. Popularly known as "Dreamers," many were brought here as infants or children and have known no other country except the U.S.  In scrapping the order, Trump gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative solution.  Flake said he and other lawmakers have worked with White House chief of staff John Kelly and other administration officials. Kelly outlined a list of White House priorities at a meeting on Tuesday and pledged to present a detailed list by Friday of border security and other policy changes it wants as part of a broader deal on the immigrants, Flake said.  "The White House is committed to moving forward in good faith," he said, calling the administration's plans "eminently reasonable and well thought-out."  Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said he has been impressed by Trump's commitment to protect the young immigrants.  "The president's instincts are better than the advice he sometimes gets," Flake said. "He says he wants to protect these kids. I believe him."  Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who wanted to find a remedy this year, said in a statement that he was thankful for Flake's efforts to keep the measure alive. But Durbin did not immediately agree to a January timetable.  "Bipartisan negotiations continue and we're fighting to pass this measure soon," said Durbin, D-Ill.  While Flake is confident the Senate will vote, it remains unclear whether the House will back such legislation. In 2013, the Senate supported a bipartisan bill overhauling the immigration system and providing a path to citizenship for some 11 million living here illegally. The measure died in the Republican-led House.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has said that deporting the young immigrants is "not in our nation's interest." Ryan has said any immigration solution must include border security measures, though he said a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, which Trump has urged, doesn't make sense.  Flake also downplayed the idea of a wall encompassing the 2,000-mile (3,219-kilometer) border, saying, "The wall is kind of a metaphor for border security."  In reality, the border measure will include fencing and other barriers, including sensors and other high-tech security techniques, he said.  Under the DACA program, the young immigrants get two-year permits that let them work and remain in the country. Trump rescinded the program this year, but he let immigrants renew their documents if those documents were set to expire between September and March.  The government says 132,000 of the 154,000 eligible renewals applied before an October deadline, leaving more than 20,000 without any protection from deportation.  Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said he was disappointed that Flake would settle for action on immigration in January.  "Maybe that's the way he scrubs his conscience" to allow him to leave for the holidays, said Gutierrez, who has pushed for immediate action on Dreamers.  While Flake has been a consistent supporter of immigration reform, "it's not good enough," Gutierrez said.  "Sen. Flake was pretty good about giving a trillion-and-a-half dollars away to the wealthiest in the nation" by supporting the GOP tax bill, Gutierrez said. "Maybe he could give a little bit to those who want to be part of the nation."

Aranza Marmolejo is a first-year pre-nursing student at Nevada State College whose  parents brought her here from Mexico when she was three years old. Marmolejo is in danger of being deported next year to a country she knows little about.  "I'm not a criminal a murderer or a rapist or anything like that I am a student. I am a human a human being," said Marmolejo. "I'm a contributor to the economy. I pay my taxes. I have two jobs. I'm a full-time student."
273	1	Grand Rapids police worked to secure the northbound and southbound U.S. 131 ramps, according to a tweet from police.  GRAND RAPIDS, MI - Police estimated that 1,000 demonstrators showed up for an immigration march from Roosevelt Park to Grand Rapids City Hall.  The number has grown some as people in neighborhoods join in.  The group left north on Grandville Avenue SW from the park. Police closed Chicago Drive SW, between Clyde Park Avenue and Naylor Street.  Police have also closed Grandville between Martha and Olympia streets as well as nearby side streets.  The march has been peaceful, with demonstrators chanting and singing. Police have over 50 officers assigned to the march.  "Thank you for your patience as we work to keep everyone safe," police said on Facebook.  During the march, the group didn't follow police directions at one point. According to Grand Rapids police, the marchers broke through a road block at Bartlett Street SW, past police tape and police bikes. That part of the route was blocked in hopes of having the march avoid an area of heavy construction, police said in a Tweet.  As of 2:30 p.m., no arrests had been made.  "Group is peaceful, just non-compliant," police said in a Tweet.  Police said this morning that 4,000 to 6,000 people were expected.  The march is organized by Movimiento Cosecha GR which has protested deportations and violence against immigrants.

128	4	From a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor in Highland Park to a 3-year-old in Barrington, hundreds rallied Saturday in the north suburbs as part a nationwide day of protest against immigration policies.  More than 700 “Families Belong Together” events were held across the country. In Chicago, police estimated more than 50,000 people attended a march at Daley Plaza. Meanwhile, despite sweltering weather conditions north suburban residents gathered in Highland Park, Glenview, Arlington Heights and Barrington for their own rallies and marches.  Highland Park Police estimated the crowd size at 300, according to Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, who was one of the speakers at the rally. Some attendees estimated the crowd may have been even larger. Cathy Wilson, who helped organize the rally and march in Glenview, said there approximately 150 at that event. An event in Barrington drew an estimated 600 people while about 500 demonstrators gathered in Arlington Heights, according to organizers.  Suzanne Greenwald, one of the organizers of the Highland Park event, is a retired Elm Place Middle School teacher. She said the goal of the event was to demand the reunification of families separated when entering the U.S., an elimination of family detention and an end of President Donald Trump’s zero-tolerance policy.  ADVERTISEMENT  One person who came to the rally in the 94-degree heat at Port Clinton Square was Highland Park resident Nicole Terry, 94, a Holocaust survivor and immigrant herself. She said she knows what it is like to be separated from her parents.

It is now USA 2018. Never again.”  Terry said she was eventually reunited with the surviving members of her family and made her way to the U.S. in 1964.  Solomon Sommer, a Highland Park second grader, was busy sitting at a table drawing a picture to send to one of the children now in a detention center.  “It’s a good luck bug,” Sommer said. “It looks like a bug but it’s as big as a horse. It’s to bring luck to the kids so they can get back together with their parents.”  Phyllis Sommer, Solomon’s mother, said it was important to bring her children to rallies like these to experience a communal expression of support for a cause.

That message was read by Stephanie Jacobs Luger, one of Greenwald’s former students, and Michelle Kramer, the mother of some of Greenwald’s students. Luger said she responded to the Facebook post and a group formed to make the rally a reality.  The hour-long Highland Park rally consisted of speeches from elected officials and activists interspersed with protest songs.  Greenwald and Kramer made it clear this was not a political event and the messages of elected officials and those who want to unseat them in November were similar. Both state Sen. Julie Morrison (D-Deerfield) and Barrett Davie, a Lake Forest resident running against her, expressed their distaste for the separation of families.  When Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Deerfield) spoke he said “we must keep families together” and called for their “immediate reunification” citing legislation he is co-sponsoring to do just that. He asked for a show of hands of immigrants, children of immigrants or grandchildren of immigrants and nearly every hand was raised.

In Glenview, Wilson said the group gathered at the Glenview War Memorial and listened to speeches from both scheduled speakers and others who wanted to talk as well. After the speeches, the group marched on Waukegan Road from the memorial to Lake Street.  “There is no place for this kind of inhuman treatment of people at the border and it has to stop,” Wilson in a telephone interview.  Elected officials and clergy members spoke at the Glenview rally including Dilnaz Waraich from the Muslim Community Center in Morton Grove.  “The intentional separation of children from their parents is not only an immoral act, but it is also a practice that will likely cause irreparable harm to these children,” Waraich said in her prepared remarks.

Staged near village hall, which also serves as a satellite office for Republican U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, rally participants denounced the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and the U.S. Justice Department's zero-tolerance policy that has attracted widespread outrage across the country in recent days.  As 2,000 immigrant children still wait to be reunited with their parents, the rally in Barrington was meant to send a message to the Trump administration for trying to separate migrant families, said Evelyn Malone, a Crystal Lake resident who is a chairwoman of Indivisible Northwest Illinois, which organized the Barrington event.  “The rally is about the babies and the people that have been in a very unfortunate situation. They came here for hope and a new life and found themselves in prison unexpectedly,” said Malone, a former schoolteacher in Texas who said she taught many immigrant children from Mexico and El Salvador. “At the moment, they don’t have a voice. It’s a human thing to do to help them regain their dignity and know that there are people in this nation that have heart.”  The rally, she said, attracted an estimated crowd of 600 people, who gathered along Hough Street, from Lake to Station streets, holding signs supportive of the Families Belong Together rallies and reciting lines like “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” “Melt ICE,” and the Biblical passage, “For I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”  [Most read] Micky Dolenz, last survivor of the Monkees, celebrates the 1960s band in Rialto show » Near Arlington Heights Village Hall, an estimated crowd of about 500 gathered peacefully to show support for immigrant children, said Carina Homann-Santa Maria, one of the founding members of Voices of Community, Acceptance and Love of Arlington Heights (VOCAL), which organized the event with members of We the People/Mount Prospect.  Organizers wanted to stage the event within the center of the village to try and send a message to elected officials locally showing how important the issue is to area residents, she said.  “I’m so happy our community was able to get together and show support for what’s happened in our country,” Homann-Santa Maria said. “With the Fourth of July holiday coming up, we all do know America is a great country, and we want to make sure we keep the values that founded our country and support those who are oppressed by the policies that have come forth.”  The rally featured speeches from community leaders and elected officials who represent Arlington Heights and the surrounding area.  Organizers also collected cash, journals, clothes, art supplies and educational materials that will be distributed to the Chicago-based nonprofit Heartland Alliance and sent to immigrant children, who have been detained at the U.S.-Mexico border. Homann-Santa Maria said some people made cards with messages of support that will be sent to the border as a reminder to the kids.

At the Barrington rally, dozens of drivers honked their horns in support of participants as they drove down Hough Street, while attendees battled the humidity and heat. One woman collapsed because of the heat and hit her head on the sidewalk, but Barrington paramedics quickly responded and treated her, police said.  The woman was alert and talking when she left the scene, said Barrington Sgt. Jen Whitcher, who was the only officer to monitor the event. She said a handful of counter protestors, wearing Trump T-shirts, gathered near the rally and placed leaflets on cars, but they never approached rally participants.

People need to look at their kids and see Muslim kids, Syrian kids, Latino kids and not succumb to castigation or fearmongering and see them as our own.”  Alana Stephens, 37, of Round Lake, brought her two kids, 11-year-old Darren and 3-year-old Rory, to the rally to show support.  “We decided to come out because we feel these families and children need to be together, and we are their voice because they can’t speak for themselves,” Stephens said. “I would be devastated if my children were in that situation and I hope people would be speaking out for me.”
226	2	‘Infeliz Navidad’: DACA Recipients Sing Protest Carols at Texas Governor’s Mansion  Texas’ approximately 110,000 DACA holders have no idea if or when Congress will assure them a future in the U.S.  by Gus Bova  December 5, 2017, 9:25 PM, CST  Around two dozen immigrant rights activists sang Christmas carols outside the Texas governor’s mansion Tuesday evening as a reminder that nearly 700,000 young immigrants nationwide face an “infeliz navidad” if Congress doesn’t find a solution for DACA. President Trump is set to terminate the Obama-era program, which allows immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to live and work in the country, on March 5.  “As you see behind me, [Governor Greg Abbott] is ready for Christmas and the holidays,” said Luis Ortega, volunteer director of Immigrants United, as he gestured toward the wreath-draped mansion. “A time that should bring joy and comfort, but for many of us it will be a cheerless holiday.”      "Infeliz Navidad": Carolers gather at Texas governor's mansion as reminder that "Dreamers" may face holidays full of uncertainty.      Posted by The Texas Observer on Tuesday, December 5, 2017  Ortega, 23, is one of around 110,000 current DACA holders in Texas hoping for Congress to clear up their futures. Some have already lost their benefits either by failing to meet an October deadline or through official mishandling, and if lawmakers don’t act by March 5, DACA recipients will see their work permits start expiring at a rate of nearly 1,000 a day nationally.  Ortega, who’s lived in Texas since he was 5, works full-time in retail and studies in Austin’s community college system, on top of directing his nonprofit. He says he applied to renew his DACA status before the Trump-mandated deadline in October, but he has yet to receive his new work permit, which expires December 29. He said he fears the document won’t arrive in time and he’ll lose his job. “That will be the last day I can work legally and help support my family,” he said.  Yuridia Loera, a 22-year-old activist with the immigrant rights group United We Dream, was also present Tuesday and said she has yet to receive a permit that she applied for in April. Her authorization is now expired. Luis Ortega.  Gus Bova  Ortega and Loera were joined in downtown Austin Tuesday evening by a small crowd that shivered against a cold front as they sang their modified holiday songs of protest. In their rendition, the classic “El burrito de Belén” changed to a song of popular resistance: “con mi protesta y mi pueblo, voy camino a mis sueños.”  The future of the “Dreamers” is currently shrouded in congressional bickering. Congress members have introduced various measures that could offer a path to citizenship for DACA recipients and other immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. The preferred vehicle for many immigrant advocates is the Dream Act of 2017, which offers the least onerous path to status.  Meanwhile, Congress faces a December 8 deadline for passing a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, and Senate Republicans will need at least eight Democratic votes to do so. Some prominent Democrats, such as California’s Kamala Harris and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, have pledged not to vote for any spending bill that lacks a DACA fix.  On Monday, U.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, blasted them on the Senate floor. “That’s simply a hysterical and cynical ploy – putting their party and their agenda ahead of the nation,” he said. The Senate Majority Whip argued that lawmakers could easily assemble a DACA solution in January or February, and there was no need to risk a shutdown.  But advocates are wary of letting a decision slip into the new year. “If Republicans somehow manage to kick the can to next spring, what’s predictable is that they’ll load up an inadequate DACA fix with enough poison pills to ensure opposition,” said the pro-immigration reform group America’s Voice in a statement Monday.  Cornyn is also co-sponsor on a bill introduced Tuesday that would pair border security measures with a three-year extension of DACA that Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice Education Fund, has called “a witch’s brew of nativist poison pills topped by a stingy, temporary three-year reprieve.”  [Image: Will Hurd — trump] U.S. Representative Will Hurd, R-Texas  Office of Will Hurd  On Tuesday morning, 34 House Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan supporting a DACA fix before the year’s end. Two Texans signed the letter: retiring Congressman Joe Barton, and Will Hurd, whose District 23 spans one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the state’s most competitive. Though the Republicans fell short of promising to withhold votes on the upcoming spending bill, House GOP leadership currently favors a version that would extend only through December 22, which could create a second chance to include the immigration legislation.  Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration for its handling of the DACA program. The administration has fought to halt discovery in those cases to avoid releasing documents relevant to its deliberations on the policy. The Justice Department most recently filed with the U.S. Supreme Court to stymy a suit filed by six “Dreamers,” which accuses the president of “unconstitutional bias against Mexicans and Latinos.”  United We Dream, which has held frequent actions targeting members of Congress, held a die-in Tuesday afternoon outside the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Julieta Garibay, a Texas organizer with the group, said Tuesday they have actions planned targeting Texas Congress members as well, including Hurd and Representative John Culberson, a Houston Republican.

151	4	SOUTH BEND — More than 50 people gathered downtown for a rally Monday as part of the national “Day Without Immigrants,” holding banners that denounced the proposed wall along the Mexican border and wearing T-shirts that read “no human being is illegal.”  “This country has changed the rhetoric against people who are immigrants and from a lower socioeconomic background,” said Sam Centellas, director of the nonprofit La Casa de Amistad, which was one of the rally’s local organizers. “We have to turn it around and turn it positive.”  Centellas called on the crowd at Jon Hunt Plaza to “strengthen inclusion” in the community by speaking up for people, giving their time to help at charities like La Casa and homeless shelters and spending their money at Hispanic-owned businesses.  Local organizers then drove to Elkhart for a march, rally and festival with music and dancing that drew a couple hundred or more people. It's all an extension of May Day protests in major cities around the globe to celebrate workers and push for better working conditions.  “This country cannot function without immigrants,” Dámaras Alarcón read from a printed statement on behalf of Movimento Cosecha (or “harvest movement”), which calls for “permanent protection, dignity and respect for all immigrant workers.”  She was one of two undocumented immigrants who spoke — both are college students who are studying under DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that allows many undocumented young people to work and continue their schooling in the United States without fear of being deported.  “I struggle with the fact that I would be like everyone here,” Alarcón said, becoming emotional.   Now 23, Alarcón was 8 when she came from Bolivia with her family. She graduated from Saint Mary’s College two years ago with a bachelor’s degree in actuarial science and in June will begin working on a masters degree in business at the University of Notre Dame.  “My American dream is not different than the Hungarians and Polish,” said Luis Gonzalez, 22, who came with his family from Mexico when he was 9 and moved directly to Elkhart. “My dream was born in a valley so poor that there was no electricity.”  He will graduate with a bachelor’s degree from Indiana University South Bend in December.  Lewis Howard, a 57-year-old homeless man who sleeps in parks and where he can, stopped by as the rally started. As a black person, he said, the era feels like the 1960s when “they didn’t want us there.”  “Ain’t no human being is illegal,” he said. “In God’s eyes he made us all equal.”  Many critics argue that they welcome immigrants — as long as they immigrate legally or seek to correct their legal status. Immigrants counter that this country's laws pose overwhelming hurdles to doing so.  The national movement called on immigrants to stay home Monday from school, work and shopping — similar to a “Day Without Immigrants” held this past February to protest policies by President Donald Trump that many perceived to be anti-immigrant.  Jessica Bayer, who’s joined in protests over the past several months — including a trip to the women’s march in Washington, D.C. — came Monday with her 2-year-old daughter, Juniper, “just trying to be a presence in the community for people and missions that I believe in.”  Gary May of South Bend was walking by when he saw the rally.  “This country is based on immigrants,” he said in support. “Just to uproot them and say they don’t matter. … They work for peanuts and they rarely ever complain.”
73	2	GREENWICH — About 400 people rallied in front of Greenwich Town Hall to protest the family separations happening at the border in just one of about 700 “Families Belong Together” rallies held nationwide on Saturday decrying the policy.  The peaceful program, organized by Indivisible Greenwich, featured what founding member Joanna Swomley called a mosaic of speakers: U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn; the executive director of Stamford’s Building One Community; a psychotherapist; a Methodist pastor; a representative from the Greenwich Reform Synagogue; and a representative of the Democratic Town Committee.   The anchor event took place in Washington, D.C., with more than 100 organizations, including the ACLU, Amnesty International, Indivisible and MoveOn coming together to draw attention to the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy that calls for the prosecution of all individuals who illegally enter the U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week ending the policy of separating children from their parents when they crossed the U.S. border. His solution is now to detain families together, with attempts now beginning to reunite the already separated families.  All the stories, all the time Unlock Greenwich Time for 99¢ SUBSCRIBE “Each of us has an immigrant story,” Blumenthal told the crowd, clad in the white linen typical of Greenwich summers but worn Saturday as a symbol of unity and peace. “Each of us came from somewhere.” His father immigrated to the U.S. from Germany alone at age 17 in 1935, speaking no English, Blumenthal said. Blumenthal concluded by urging listeners to fight to uphold the United States of America.  U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4, and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy were not in attendance, but issued statements that were read to the crowd.     Maria Hamre, pastor of First United Methodist Church of Round Hill, delivered a discourse on the divinity of the family and the scriptural commandments to care for immigrants.  Hamre mentioned another Methodist, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who quoted a verse in Romans to provide divine sanction for his separation policy in a speech to law enforcement officials in Fort Wayne, Ind., on June 14.
