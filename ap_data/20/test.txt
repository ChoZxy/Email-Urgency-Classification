5367	O	Boatmen Hemel [Harry H. Corbett] and Ronnie [Ronnie Barker] receive orders for their pair, Banstead and Bellerophon, to take 50 tons of cargo from Brentford to Boxmoor, then run empty to Birmingham.
5368	O	From the start Hemel is shown to be proud of his job and his heritage and very unwilling to leave the canals, stating "The only way you'll get me off the canals is to fill 'em in!"
5369	O	The trailer for the film described Ronnie as "God's gift to women, returned unopened.
5370	O	At Brentford, while the boats are being loaded, Hemel plans out his journey, with what stops and what women.
5371	O	While he acts insouciant while mentioning most of the women, he is shown to have a particular soft spot for one, Christine.
5372	O	During the journey they come across 'the mariner' [Eric Skyes], as a gullible and irritating owner of a GRP cruiser, a boat that was becoming predominant on the canals during this time, and who would crop up throughout the film.
5373	O	At Rickmansworth Hemel meets with the first of his planned flames, Nelly [Miriam Karlin], at her pub 'The Boat Horse'.
5374	B	This does not go according to plan, first by Nelly suggesting that they should get married  and then during the evening she discovering he is seeing other women.
5375	B	He and Ronnie end up being chased out of the pub by Nelly wielding a knife and promising to skin Hemel if and when he returns that way.
5376	O	At Boxmoor while the boats are being unloaded; Hemel gets in a heated discussion with the foreman [Eric Parkes] about living on the boats.

5380	O	While passing a factory block, pressumably turned into an office block, Hemel's popularity with women is shown by having all of the female staff leaning out of the windows as the boats pass, shouting out for Hemel and going back inside disappointed when Ronnie informs them that Hemel isn't out because "he's having his dinner".
5381	O	Cynthia leaves the boat when they are going down some locks.
5382	O	The journey continues and Ronnie asks why Hemel is bothering with Christine .
5383	O	Hemel says that he happens "to think very highly of this one" and Ronnie warns him that he needs to be careful with her, because of her overprotective father.
5384	O	The film switches over to Christine's lock keeper father, Joe , shouting at a young man whom he has pinned to the floor, evidently having been fighting with him.
5385	O	When he goes back into the lock cottage, his daughter starts a heated conversation about his overprotective behaviour, which he counters by saying he doesn't want her to "get tied up with one of that lot off the canal" The argument is cut short by the arrival of Ronnie and Hemmel at the lock.
5386	O	Hemmel gives Ronnie some money and tells him to "keep him  lashed up 'till closing time" and Ronnie and Joe go off to the pub, leaving Christine and Hemel alone.
5387	O	This is apparently the pattern for Hemel and Christine's liaisons.
5388	B	While at the pub, the only way Ronnie is able to keep Joe from going back to the house  is by challenging his ability to handle drink.
5389	I	This turns into a full blown competition that all the pub takes part in.
5390	O	Meanwhile, Christine  questions Hemel about whether he ever wants children.
5391	B	Hemel answers the affirmative, but this turns into a row as to whether he would leave the canal for it.
5392	O	This is cut short by Hemel realising how quiet the nearby pub has gone.
5393	O	Back at the pub Joe is the only person left awake after the drinking contest.
5394	O	He has won after drinking 29 pints and Ronnie is left slumped on the bar, with the rest of the pub also asleep in various positions.

5405	O	Ronnie and Hemel are bringing the boats back and come across the backed up traffic.
5406	O	They go to find out whats happened and find out Christine is pregnant.
5407	O	They are about to back the boats up and run away when Christine is heard pleading with some boatwomen to let her go.

5409	O	Christine adamantly states that she wont marry him because she doesn't want to live on the boats.
5410	B	Joe comes forward and, after giving Hemel his blessing to marry Christine, punches him.
5411	O	Hemel is shown in a variety of land based jobs before the wedding, each one ending in him being fired.
5412	O	He is seen obviously missing the canals.

5555	O	Jack Robinson  is the rich CEO of a large company.
5556	O	Throughout his family's past, no Robinson male has lived to be over 40, and Jack keeps having a dream about his father and an angry giant.
5557	O	He tries very hard to stay healthy with the help of his Albanian butler, Dussan .
5558	O	The man who manages his business affairs, Siegfried "Siggy" Mannheim , convinces him to turn down a project involving alternative food supplies of genetically-engineered plants to feed the Third World, and also to build a casino complex in a small town to which the locals greatly object.
5559	B	During construction, the workers discover the skeleton of a giant.
5560	B	A strange young woman called Ondine  then appears and accuses Jack of being "a thief and a murderer" before vanishing in a flash of light.
5561	B	That night, a man sneaks into Jack's house and takes him to see an old woman whom Jack recognizes as a great-aunt who he believed was dead.
5562	O	The old woman tells him the traditional version of the fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk" in which the giant is portrayed as a selfish, gluttonous brute who cared for nothing and no one, subsequently giving him the last magic bean , suggesting that the tale that she has told him may not be the truth, and that the answers he seeks about recent events may be found at the other end of the beanstalk.
5563	B	Jack plants the bean in the forest near the location where the giant was discovered, and the bean grows into a huge beanstalk leading Jack into the world of the giants, a magical world where a single day passes for every year that passes on the ground below.
5564	B	Jack is left stranded in the giant world after the beanstalk dissolves, apparently cut down by someone back on Earth, and discovers that the giant Thunderdell  was an extremely benevolent person: kind, honest, and a loving friend and father who had also adopted Ondine and raised her as his own daughter.
5565	O	The protagonist of this film is portrayed as being "the fifteenth descendent of" the original Jack.
5566	O	In 1611, Jack obtained the beans, climbed the beanstalk, only to betray Thunderdell and Ondine's trust by stealing the singing Harp of Harmony and the golden Goose of Prosperity, and his mother killed Thunderdell.

5656	O	In late 1969, Billy Covington  works as a helicopter traffic pilot for a Los Angeles radio station, and the FAA suspends his pilot's license after breaking several safety regulations on the job.
5657	O	His piloting skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a mysterious government agent, who tells Billy that he can get his license back if he accepts a job in Laos working for a "strictly civilian" company called Air America; the stranger insists that "there is no war in Laos, you can take that to the bank".
5658	O	Billy, unemployed and unable to find work, takes the job and flies to Laos.
5659	O	He gets introduced to the unorthodox pilots and planes of Air America, being taken under the wing of fellow Air America pilot Gene Ryack , who is an arms merchant who uses official flights to buy black-market weapons for his private cache.
5660	O	His dream, which he refers to as his "retirement plan", is to make a sale big enough so that he can afford to quit his job at Air America.
5661	O	The next day, Senator Davenport  arrives in Laos on a "fact finding mission" to determine if Washington D.C rumors are true about Air America's drug smuggling business.
5662	O	Major Lemond and Rob Diehl, CIA leaders of Air America, have a cover-up in place.
5663	O	Senator Davenport is shown around refugee camps, shrines and temples, and major cities in a careful deception to keep him out of the loop.
5664	O	At the same time, Billy and Jack Neely are shot down in their C-123 cargo plane while airdropping livestock into rural villages.
5665	B	Air America stages a large rescue effort, which turns out to be nothing but a cover for the transport of opium; when General Soong's Pilatus PC-6 plane arrives at the crash site, his soldiers load the plane with bags of opium, but leave Billy and Jack behind, stranding them in hostile territory.
5666	O	As Communist forces move in, Gene and another pilot arrive.

5673	O	Soon after returning to Air America the pilots are informed that Jack was killed during his search for Billy and Gene, and Gene is offended when he later learns that the senator has been led to believe that Jack is the culprit behind the drug trafficking.
5674	O	In retaliation for this misinformation, and for Soong's earlier betrayal, Billy purchases grenades on the black market and uses them to blow up the heroin factory.
5675	B	Unfortunately, the guards see him running away, and General Soong and Major Lemond use him as their fall guy.
5676	O	The next day, Gene finds a buyer for his arsenal, allowing him to leave gunrunning, quit Air America, and take his family out of the country.

5678	O	When Babo and Billy are instructed to land at an airstrip for "routine inspection", Babo reveals that such a sudden inspection is actually a non-routine situation.
5679	B	Billy immediately suspects a set-up, and a search through their cargo reveals several kilos of heroin hidden in flour sacks.
5680	B	He refuses to land and tries to fly away, only to find his fuel gauge has been tampered with and he is nearly out of gas.
5681	I	Babo and Billy crash-land on the same airstrip where Billy crashed a few days earlier, and use the wreckage of the previous crash to hide the smaller plane.
5682	O	Gene, who is on his way to make his final, and largest, weapons delivery, makes a detour to rescue Babo and Billy.
5683	O	Despite Gene's desire to make his delivery so he can be free of Air America, Billy convinces him to respond to a distress call from the refugee camp, which has been caught in the crossfire between General Soong's men and a band of local rebels.
5684	O	Gene's plane is the closest, so they stop at the camp to pick up the USAID in charge of the camp .
5685	O	However, the aid refuses to leave without the refugees, and there is not enough room on the plane for both cargo and passengers.
5686	O	After some initial resistance, Gene reluctantly sacrifices his retirement plan by dumping his cargo to make room for the refugees, and uses the explosion of his weapons cache to cover their escape.
5687	O	After rescuing the refugees and taking off, Gene tells Billy that he is going to help Gene earn back the money he lost from dumping the cargo by selling the C-123 they are flying since it "officially" is not owned by anyone.
5688	O	Still in the air, Diehl and Lemond attempt to convince the senator that Billy's refusal to concede to inspection proves that he is the culprit behind the drug smuggling.
5689	O	The senator, however, sees through their lies and threatens to reveal their operation to Washington.
5690	O	Lemond argues that such an action would be political suicide on the senator's part because, as Lemond insists, "the President loves me".
5691	O	However, closing titles reveal that Diehl and Lemond were indeed exposed, and would later go on to lead checkered careers in Washington politics.
5692	O	This is all based on a true story.
