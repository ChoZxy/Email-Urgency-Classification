4058	O	Though Ben's father, Patrick Henry Gates, tries to discourage Ben from following in the family line, as he had spent over 20 years looking for the national treasure, attracting ridicule on the family name, young Ben is encouraged onward by a clue, "The secret lies with Charlotte", from his grandfather John Adams Gates in 1974, that could lead to the fabled national treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States and Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War that was entrusted to his family by Charles Carroll of Carrollton in 1832 before his death to find, and protect the family name.
4059	O	In the present, with an expedition funded and led by Ian Howe, Ben and his friend, a computer expert, Riley Poole track down a Colonial ship that is trapped in Arctic ice, the Charlotte.
4060	B	Aboard the ship they discover a meerschaum pipe engraved with a Knights Templar riddle that Ben connects to an invisible map written by Timothy Matlack on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
4061	B	When Ian reveals he will go to any lengths to find this treasure including stealing the Declaration, Ben takes a stand against him.
4062	I	A fight ensues, during which spilled gunpowder is ignited.
4063	O	Ian escapes the ship, leaving it to explode before departing with his team.
4064	O	Ben and Riley are trapped inside but survive the explosion by hiding in a smugglers hold, and return to the United States determined to stop Ian.
4065	O	When Ben and Riley try to tell various authorities, including the FBI, and Dr. Abigail Chase at the National Archives, they dismiss their claims, considering the Declaration impossible to steal.
4066	O	Ben and Riley concoct their own plan to steal the Declaration during a gala event, and execute it just before Ian and his own team arrive.
4067	O	Abigail, suspicious of Ben's presence at the gala, becomes caught up with Ben and Riley as they escape from Ian and the authorities.
4068	O	Ben's identity is tracked to the theft, and they are forced to go to his father's home, much to Patrick's surprise and dismay.
4069	O	Ben and Abigail find an Ottendorf cipher on the back of the Declaration which, using the riddle on the pipe from the Charlotte, they connect to the Silence Dogood letters, written by Benjamin Franklin, at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.
4070	O	Decoding the message, it points to where the Liberty Bell was, they then head to the top of Independence Hall at a specific time 2:22 where the trio find a pair of spectacles with multiple colored lenses invented by Franklin that reveal additional clues on the back of the Declaration, "Heere at the Wall."
4071	B	The group is caught by Ian, and even though they split up, Riley and Abigail and the Declaration are caught by Ian, while Agent Peter Sadusky captures Ben, still with the glasses.
4072	B	Ian, under the guise of a prisoner exchange, lures the FBI into a trap aboard the USS Intrepid, allowing them to grab Ben.
4073	O	Holding Riley, Abigail, and Patrick hostage, Ian forces Ben to use the bifocals and find the next clue, which leads the group to Trinity Church in New York City.
4074	O	Beneath the church through a secret tunnel behind the coffin of Parkington Lane they find an enormous shaft with an elevator system.
4075	O	When walking down the stairs the shaft began to collapse a little but manage somehow.
4076	O	At the bottom of the shaft, they find a room lit only by a lantern, which Ben and Patrick trick Ian into thinking that it refers to Paul Revere's Ride, and indicates the treasure to be at the Old North Church in Boston.
4077	O	Ian and his men strand Ben, Riley, Abigail, and Patrick as they ascend to the surface, unaware that Ben has purposely tricked them.
4078	B	Ben pushes a button of the unfinished pyramid the all-seeing eye on the wall and opens a secret door to an empty room.
4079	O	Patrick apologizes to Ben and admits himself that the treasure is real.
4080	B	Ben believes there’s another way out to the surface and kept searching then found a strange keyhole and uses the pipe from the Charlotte to open yet another secret door to reveal the vast treasure trove, for which he has been searching his entire life, as well as a route to the surface.
4081	B	When the four ascend back to the church, Ben calls in Agent Sadusky, who reveals he is part of the Freemasons.
4082	O	Ben and Sadusky arrange a deal: with the safe return of the Declaration and identifying where Ian and his men can be found, Sadusky will clear all of their names; the treasure will be distributed among museums throughout the world, and the Gates family will receive credit for the discovery.
4083	O	Ian is captured by the FBI at the Old North Church and charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, and trespassing on government property.
4084	O	The film ends showing that Ben chose to accept from the US government only a 1% finder's fee for himself and his team.
4085	O	That is still enough to make him and his friends quite wealthy, given that Ben's estimated value of the find is US $10,000,000,000.
4086	O	In addition, Ben has begun a romantic relationship with Abigail and bought a mansion they will be living in, and Riley bought himself a Ferrari.
4087	O	Detective Superintendent  Pierre Niemans , an investigator well known in Paris, is sent to the small rural university town of Guernon in the French Alps to investigate a brutal murder.
4088	O	The victim's body is found bound in the fetal position and suspended high on a cliff face, his eyes removed and his hands cut off.
4089	O	Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian, Remy Callois, and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes.
4090	O	Dr. Cherneze, once on the University staff, explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors, with increasingly serious genetic disorders.
4091	O	Recently the trend has reversed, with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy.
4092	O	Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands.
4093	O	Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment, where he finds images of athletic "supermen" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities.
4094	O	The Dean's assistant  Hubert translates the title of Callois' Ph.D. thesis as, "We are the masters.
4095	O	We are the slaves.
4096	O	We are everywhere.
4097	O	We are nowhere.
4098	O	We control the crimson rivers."
4099	O	Coincidentally Detective Inspector  {{cite web}} Max Kerkerian  is in the nearby town of Sarzac investigating the desecration of the grave of Judith Herault, a girl who died in 1982, and the theft of her photos from the local primary school.
4100	O	The girl was killed in a horrific highway accident, witnessed by her mother, who was so traumatized she took a vow of darkness in a nunnery.
4101	O	The mother tells Kerkerian that when Judith was ten she fell ill, and they went to get help in Guernon where she was born; she claims they were then attacked by "demons" and, when they fled, her daughter was killed in the road accident.
4102	O	She says the pictures were stolen to erase her daughter from history, and that her face is a threat to the demons who have returned to complete their mission.
4103	O	She tells him it all began in Guernon.
4104	O	Niemans questions Fanny Ferreira , a glaciologist and student, who is immediately suspect because of her climbing ability.
4105	O	Despite her contempt for the school and its arrogant professors, she works for the university to steer away frequent avalanches, and is incensed when Niemans implies she might withhold evidence to protect the school.
4106	O	She tells him that anyone with good equipment could've hoisted the body up the cliff, and brushes off his obvious attraction.
4107	O	Soon after, the pathologist reports that it was acid rain in Callois' eye sockets, which has not fallen in the area since the seventies.
4108	O	Niemans enlists Fanny to take him up the glacier to get ice samples to compare with the acid rain in Callois' eyes.
4109	O	On a hunch, Niemans follows a glacial melt tunnel to a cave that contains a second body, frozen into the ice.
4110	O	Kerkerian traces a car from the accident to Phillip Sertys in Guernon and meets Niemans while attempting to break into Sertys' apartment.
4111	B	Sertys is the body in the ice, a doctor that worked in the maternity ward at the University hospital.
4112	O	They find Judith's stolen photograph as well as evidence that Sertys was breeding and training fighting dogs - and then they find the dogs, and Niemans the "supercop" is momentarily paralyzed by fear, until Kerkerian coaxes him through.
4113	O	Sertys was also mutilated, and his eyes replaced with glass prosthetics, "Like you would find at an eye doctor's" remarks the pathologist, leading Niemans to race back to Cherneze's practice.
4114	B	The doctor is already dead, and they almost catch the killer, who fights off Niemans and races away after deliberately emptying Niemans' gun into the wall but not hitting him.
4115	O	Kerkerian gives chase but the killer escapes.
4116	B	Returning to the scene, where the killer has written "I will trace the source of the crimson rivers" in Cherneze's own blood above his body, they learn the prints on Niemans' gun belong to Judith Herault.
4117	O	Kerkerian goes back to search the grave in Sarzac, which is empty except for a picture, while Niemans goes to Fanny's home.
4118	O	Niemans tells her that although he sees her as physically capable of committing the crimes he doesn't believe her to be guilty.
4119	O	When he returns to the university, the local police captain tells him that Callois' thesis is full of Nazi-style eugenics, suggesting perfection can be achieved by breeding athletically gifted and intellectually gifted children together.
4120	O	Kerkerian returns with the photo which Niemans recognizes as Fanny and, on the way to her house, they narrowly avoid being run off the road by the Dean's son as they piece together the story.
4121	B	Due to the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring, the doctors at the hospital had been swapping healthy village children with the university children.
4122	I	Sertys, they deduce, must have swapped Fanny for Judith, and Callois arranged the matches in the college's breeding program.
4123	B	Once at Fanny's house they find the missing hands and eyes of the victims in her basement, but Fanny is now gone and so are her grenades.
4124	O	Niemans gives the order to evacuate the university while he and Kerkerian travel up the mountain to find Fanny.
4125	B	The duo confront Fanny only to be set upon by Judith, who is her identical twin.
4126	B	Judith tells Fanny to kill Niemans she refuses, and instead turns the gun on her sister.
4127	B	At the same time Kerkerian fires at Judith but hits Fanny in the shoulder and the gunshots trigger an avalanche.
4128	O	Judith is swept away and the rest are buried in the snow until a rescue team arrives with search dogs.
4129	O	Fanny is airlifted to hospital while Kerkerian asks Niemans to explain his fear of dogs.

4140	O	The two actresses are old rivals who hate each other.
4141	O	Marina, who is making a much heralded comeback after a prolonged "illness" and retirement, when she, in reality, has had a nervous breakdown, and her husband, Jason Rudd , who is directing the movie they are making, arrive with their entourage.
4142	O	When she learns that Lola will be in the movie as well, she becomes enraged and vents her anger.
4143	O	Lola and her husband, Martin N. "Marty" Fenn , who is producing the movie they are making, then arrive.
4144	O	Excitement runs high in St. Mary Mead, as the locals have been invited to a reception held by the movie company in a manor house, Gossington Hall, to meet the celebrities.
4145	O	Lola and Marina come face to face at the reception and exchange some potent and comical insults, nasty one-liners, as they smile and pose for the cameras.
4146	O	The two square off in a series of hilarious and cleverly written and performed cat-fights throughout the movie.
4147	O	Marina however, has been receiving anonymous death threats.
4148	O	After her initial exchange with Lola at the reception, she is cornered by a gushing, devoted fan, Heather Badcock , who bores her with a long and detailed story about having actually met Marina in person during World War II.
4149	B	After recounting the meeting they had all those years ago, when she arose from her sickbed to go and meet the glamorous star, Babcock drinks a cocktail that was made for Marina and quickly dies from poisoning.
4150	O	The incident is unfortunate for Marina's mental state, and she is beside herself.
4151	O	Everyone is certain she was the intended murder victim.
4152	B	Once filming begins on the movie, she discovers that apart from threatening notes made up of newspaper clippings, her cup of coffee on the set has also been spiked with poison, sending her into fits of terror.
4153	O	The police detective from Scotland Yard investigating the case, Inspector Dermot Craddock , is baffled as he tries to uncover who is behind the attempt on the life of the actress and the subsequent murder of the innocent woman.
4154	O	The suspected are Ella Zielinsky , Jason's production assistant who is secretly having an affair with him and would like Marina out of the way, and the hotheaded actress Lola Brewster.
4155	O	Inspector Craddock asks his aunt, the renowned amateur detective Miss Jane Marple, who injured her foot at the reception and is confined to her home, for assistance.
4156	B	The main suspect, Zielinsky, is then killed by a lethal nose spray after going to a pay phone in the village, where she called the murderer and threatened to expose him.
4157	O	Miss Marple, now back on her feet, visits Gossington Hall, where Marina and Jason are staying, and views where Babcock's death occurred.
4158	O	Working from information received from her cleaning woman, Cherry Baker (played by [[Wendy Morgan , who was working as a waitress the day of the murder, the determined elderly sleuth begins to piece together the events of the fatal reception and solves the mystery.
4159	B	By the time she has collected all the evidence to indicate who committed the crime, however, another death occurs at Gossington Hall, which sadly closes the case on who the murderer in St. Mary Mead actually is: Marina Rudd, who has apparently committed suicide.
4160	O	In the film's denouement, Miss Marple explains the murders that have occurred.
4161	O	Heather Babcock's story was Marina's initial motive.
4162	O	Ms. Babcock suffered from German measles — a rather harmless disease to most adults, but problematic for a pregnant woman.
4163	O	Heather Babcock innocently infected Marina when she met her during World War Two.
4164	O	Marina was pregnant at the time; the disease caused her child to be born with mental retardation.
4165	B	Upon hearing Heather cheerfully tell this story, Marina was overcome with rage and poisoned her without thinking.
4166	O	She then spread the idea that she was the intended victim, delivering the death threats and poisoning her own coffee.
4167	O	Ella, who made phone calls to various suspects from the pay phone, accidentally guessed correctly, prompting Marina to murder her.
4168	O	As Marina is now dead, she will not be brought to justice.
4169	B	Jason, her devoted husband, confesses to Miss Marple that he actually administered the dosage of poison to save her from prosecution.
4170	O	However, Marina didn't touch the hot chocolate he made for her and rather poisoned herself.

4186	O	Nevertheless, Howard is not worried about work; he confesses to Chad that he really loved Christine.
4187	B	At this point Chad, despite having previously told Howard that his girlfriend, Suzanne, had left him, shows Howard that she is still there, asleep in his bed.
4188	O	Chad says that he carried out the plan "because I could," and asks Howard how it feels to have truly hurt someone.
4189	O	Howard, who had never done anything like that before, leaves, horrified.
4190	O	Howard later travels back to the city and to a bank where he sees Christine, and tries to speak to her, but she looks away in anger.

4375	O	Clive and Paul jump into the RV and narrowly escape the town; Haggard and O'Reilly report to Zoil.

4381	O	She turns her gas cooker on to make tea, but is interrupted by Haggard and O'Reilly on one side of the house, and Zoil on the other.
4382	B	As the motley crew escapes and drives off with Paul, O'Reilly shoots at them, and the gas ignites, destroying Tara's house and killing O'Reilly.
4383	O	A winded Zoil attempts to follow, but Haggard takes off first, shooting at Moses, running him off the road and catching up to the RV.
4384	B	However, due to an error in judgement, Haggard accidentally drives off a cliff and is killed, leaving Zoil as the last remaining agent in pursuit.
4385	O	He reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within an hour, but she declares herself tired of waiting, and informs Zoil that she has ordered a military response.
4386	O	When Paul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and Tara arrive at the rendezvous, they set off a signal and wait.
4387	B	Eventually, eerie orange lights show up over the surrounding trees, and everyone believes that it is Paul's rescue ship.
4388	B	However, it is an army helicopter, with the Big Guy  on board.

4553	O	{{Main}} The movie of Rosewood relates the historical events of a January 1923 race riot in Rosewood, Florida, in which whites attacked blacks and burned the town down.
4554	O	A mentally unstable white woman, Fanny Taylor, claims to have been beaten by a black man.
4555	O	Historical accounts note that this was never proven.
4556	O	The movie shows a white man, not Fanny’s husband, in her bedroom where they have sex.
4557	O	Shortly after he finishes, he prepares to go back to work.
4558	B	She gets upset and hits him inciting him to beat her.
4559	O	Some black workers outside heard the events but did nothing.
4560	O	When they told about it, their account of a white man beating Fanny was not believed.
4561	O	Singleton presents it as looking as if Fanny was covering up her cheating on her husband by blaming it on a black man.
4562	O	The white residents readily believe Fanny's account, demonstrating the power of racial stereotyping and fears.
4563	O	The black residents of Rosewood quickly become targeted by the white males of nearby Sumner, Florida and others who arrive for a fight, including members of the Ku Klux Klan.
4564	O	Mobs formed swiftly.
4565	O	The movie features the fictional character of Mann, played by Ving Rhames.
4566	O	Mann is a WWI veteran who is traveling around in search of land.
4567	O	He meets and falls in love with a woman in Rosewood named Beulah or "Scrappie" and has stayed there.
4568	O	After Fanny tells her story of rape, Mann leaves town.
4569	O	He is afraid of being lynched as a suspected stranger.
4570	O	After the whites started generally attacking and killing blacks, all of the blacks fled from Rosewood or were killed.
4571	O	First the women and children fled, followed by men who survived.
4572	O	People left their homes and land and all of their possessions behind to get away from the murderous white men that raided their town .
4573	O	Some white men who lived in Rosewood helped black people escape from the mob.
4574	O	Railroad conductors smuggled people out of town on the rail cars that ran nearby.
4575	O	In the movie, Voigt as Wright asks the train conductors to pick up the women and children.
4576	O	Other blacks took refuge in white people’s homes, including Wright's.
4577	O	Racism was shown by the mob's avoiding Wright's house but burning down those of blacks.
4578	O	They did not bother with known white houses.
4579	O	Although it was dangerous for them to do, some white men like Wright protected blacks from death.
4580	O	In the movie, the mob believed James Carrier held information about the escaped convict Jesse Hunter.
4581	O	Wright let the Sheriff take Carrier, because the officer said he only wanted to question him.
4582	B	When Carrier said he didn't have any information, he was shot immediately by one of the mob.
4583	O	Wright gets upset and the mob accuses him of being soft on blacks.
4584	O	The scene shows that most of the white men didn't agree with what was going on, but were too afraid to face the mob.
4585	O	The movie portrayed towns near Sumner trying to prevent the violence from spreading.
4586	O	At one point the men of Sumner were following the trail of some men.
4587	B	But when they get to the border between their town and the next one over, white men stopped them.
4588	I	They protected their black citizens, saying they are law abiding and peaceful, and Singleton demonstrated that not everyone agreed with the riot.
4589	O	As word spread to the federal government and national newspapers, the media splintered in its portrayal of events.
4590	O	Some portrayed the murder at Sylvester Carrier's as appropriate to stop the black men from arming.
4591	O	They relied on rumors and fear.
4592	O	Southern white newspapers explained mob's actions as the way to avenge the rape of Fanny and keep blacks in their place.
4593	O	The Afro-American newspapers encouraged blacks and praised them for staying behind to defend their homes and property.
4594	O	Officially the death toll was eight people total, two whites and six blacks.
4595	O	Other accounts by survivors and the Afro-American newspapers were of a higher toll.
4596	O	The movie portrayed the newspapers as contributing to the riot; men came from neighboring towns and even states to put down the riot.
4597	O	At the end of the movie, a narrative states that some blacks and one white testified as witnesses in court in the a 1990s suit of survivors against the state for its failure to protect the people of Rosewood.
4598	O	This was followed by a state investigation and report.
4599	O	Florida was the first state to pay reparations to survivors and their descendants for a racial riot.
4600	O	The story is that of a conniving countess  coming between a gay sculptor, Claude Zoret , and his bisexual model and lover, Mikaël , ultimately leading to Zoret's death in a raging storm at the base of a statue of Mikaël as the mythological Icarus.

4645	O	In his eagerness to start the show due to the presence of the demolition crew waiting to start the job, Jerry accidentally breaks the only TV the store has, but a nearby DVD store owner loans them his video projector, allowing them to show the movie on a white cloth placed in the store's window.
4646	B	As their film ends, Mr. Fletcher, Mike and Jerry exit the store to find a crowd has gathered to watch the film through the window, including the city official and wrecking crew, and they are given a rousing applause by the gathered crowd.
