576	1	that's the scariest part. 6 years ago i got absolutely wrecked head on by a drunk guy driving without a license, this guy hopped a 4 foot tall median in an f350, which spun his truck sideways, his truck then continued it's sideways trajectory, totalled my car (f350 vs honda civic) and sent me to the hospital. you just don't know if or when that moment will happen that will completely change your life. luckily i'm still okay, but i remember the slow motion effect of witnessing my life potentially getting completely destroyed.

491	1	my stepfather is just like you. he gets so much stuff because he's always connecting with people and helping them out. for example a new guy who had just been hired at his job was talking about needing to move fast because of a bad situation with a roommate but not having the means to rent a truck yet. my stepfather connected him with a friend he knew had an available room and proposed his truck to help the guy move. it turned out that new guy was the nephew of someone high up in cirque du soleil, so my stepfather gets a lot of their discarded equipment offered to him, like tents, industrial washing mashines, etc. he also gets free eggs from an old lady he met at the vet and who was sad she wasn't able to bring back her recently deceased dog to bury him on her land because she wasn't quite strong enough to dig a hole anymore. he brought back the dog and they became friends. she even made my baby a lovely quilt when my mom told her i was pregnant with my first.

516	1	activision was considered a fairly safe bet at the time, the dip had already occurred, the scandals were blowing over and the shares were rising steadily and expected to eventually get back to around their original price. that doesn't take someone who knows a lot about tech, it takes someone with basic business knowledge and access to lots of funds they can accept a relatively small risk on. a billion dollars isn't even an eight of a percent of berkshire hathaway's current assets, this is the type of deal they have to make fairly regularly to keep their money going around.

170	1	I've always wondered, even within people who can see faces fine, we very often get cases where one person perceives two faces to be very similar, but to someone else they really don't. Is that explained by difference between how we perceive/process faces? Like each of us being partially faceblind to some subtle cues and not to others?
240	1	"our forearms, the area between the elbow and the wrist, need to be able to rotate, like when we are turning a door knob. another way to think of this motion is pronation (making your palm face downwards) vs supination (making your palm face upwards). an ""armcap"" or elbow cap would get in the way of pronation/supination. the feet and shins do not need to rotate in this way, we are unable to make our toes point behind us for example, therefore it makes sense to have a more stable and rigid joint where the knee cap can act as a fulcrum or lever for more powerful movement."

267	1	"the ban on heliocentrism was largely because of galileo's writings being seen as contradicting scripture. the attack on copernicism in 1616 was prompted by galileo's writings. moreover, it made a number of invalid assumptions (including that the stars must be orbiting the earth because they don't appear to move, when in reality they are simply extremely distant and parallax is in fact a thing, though it wasn't measured for two centuries). in february 1616, the inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as ""foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of holy scripture."" kepler figuring out that the planets had elliptical orbits in the 1620s pretty much was the realistic end of heliocentrism, and once newton's physical laws of gravitation were discovered by the late 17th century, there was a mechanism as well."

201	2	"> i wonder how they tell the attacker's dna from the victims? dna analysis determines which samples are the victims & which are not. the dna which is not the victims is then used to compare to other samples in the criminal database. any confusion in the two samples would lead to questions for the processing lab. >uploading the victim's dna on purpose doesn't sound like something a reasonable person would do deliberately. you don't seem to be familiar with the us law enforcement's ""i don't give a fuck about women"" stance in regards to rape & sexual assault. the number of untested rape kits in the us is well over 100,000 but police don't keep accurate records to get the exact number. keep in mind that less that 35% of rapes or sa are even reported and reports about the dna of a victim being used to arrest her will make that number fall even further."

317	1	the best way to reddit is by engaging in communities you love and have interest in. you find you get to know individual users, have funner or even deeper conversations, and engage (usually) in a more civil manner. the bigger subs are fun to check in once in a while and easily ignored when they're going off the rails which is usually once or twice a month. the biggest subs however are repost and crosspost city made only to draw in attention of the outsider, the potential user. /r/all is all about being a twitter/facebook hybrid for new users.

731	1	for several reasons: previous hammers were purely political and can only come down if you have a solid congressional majority. because trump replaced enough of the top of the republican party with loyalists he will always be able to evade those hammers. this one is a completely different because it's a legal hammer. he was immune to legal hammers as president, but he's not president any longer. legal hammers routinely take 3-7 years to come down because if you try to go too fast then safeguards kick in and prevent it from coming down at all. trump has also spent his entire adult life stalling legal hammers for as long as possible. there were many times when drawing out the process for as long as possible and then hitting any loophole or deficiency in the system hard at the right moment he was able to get out of trouble. that's how he handled civil rights claims and property disputes and bankruptcy cases. he didn't come out unscathed but he came out better than he should have. he tried to do the same thing with the election. file all of the lawsuits, make the loudest noises, stall as much as he possibly could, and hit any ambiguous wording in the rules as hard as he could. it just didn't work. it also doesn't work in criminal cases. the rules and standards that he has spent decades mastering ways to frustrate and defeat aren't the same. so, trying the same things that worked before is probably going to go badly. there's also a very real chance that the northern district of georgia is going to file election interference charges in july. the process is slow because those are not easy charges to bring and it's georgia. but, that call to the georgia secretary of state has a very real chance at making him ineligible for office ever again.

234	1	the orbits of planets and moons *do* change over millions of years, but they'll still be orbiting around their respective primaries (stars and planets). for instance, the size of the moon's orbit around the earth is expanding about an inch per year. the l2 position is unstable. webb is orbiting around the sun, and it will continue to do *that* indefinitely, but it'll wander away from l2 without repeated corrections.

445	2	"""who am i speaking with?"" you say holding your bible in one hand and a crucifix in the other. ""identify yourself!"" the woman strapped to the kitchen chair stops convulsing and turns her eyes to you, glowing with an unnatural light. a loud sigh, reminiscent of a poorly tuned diesel engine escapes her lips. ""it's still shaggroth."" ""god dammit!!"" ""hey dude, not cool. you oughta know better "" you pinch the bridge of your nose and exhale loudly. ""yeah i know shaggroth. you're not helping!"" the woman's eyes stop glowing for a second. ""oh hi, i'm so sorry, it's melissa. i'm back again too."" you plop down in an adjacent seat mumbling to yourself, ""this doesn't make any sense. the incantation was perfect the vessel was primed....it should've worked flawlessly..."" shaggroth's rumble is back, ""what turning it off then back on again?"" ""she's not a fucking computer shaggroth! jesus christ!"" ""dude! not. cool."" ""gah! look hellspawn..."" ""hey!"" ""not you melissa!"" ""oh sorry."" ""okay, lemme run through this again. melissa, you acquired the vessel containing shaggroth at a antique store a few days ago right? ""i think so? the timing is a bit fuzzy honestly. i remember the store, and looking around. i saw the cute jar on a shelf..."" ""it's not cute! it is one of the finest possession traps crafted by the damned ever made!"" ""then why does it look like a kitten with a bow?"" ""shut up! it works okay?!?"" ""knock it off you two! melissa, please continue."" ""like i said i saw the kitten on the shelf, and all of a sudden there was a sharp pain behind my eyes. i remember swaying a bit, some flashing lights and people telling me to hold on.....oh! and then there was a long monotonous beep and i heard a voice say something about a intramural annual scrimmage. next thing i remember is being back home in bed."" ""intramural annual scrimmage? that doesn't make any sense. what would sports have to do...."" you stop mid sentence when it hits you. ""do you mean intracranial aneurysm?"" ""that's it! yes, that's what the floating voice said."" ""are you freaking kidding me?!?"" you scream as you throw the bible across the kitchen. ""whoa dude, i think you need to calm down. leave melissa alone."" ""can it shaggroth! the reason you stay in the body and melissa gets punted out every time i perform the ritual? she died at the exact moment you possessed her! she's not supposed to be in her body anymore. the ritual sees her as the demon and you as the rightful inhabitant."" ""so what does that mean?"" shaggroth and melissa ask at the same time. ""well honestly? i have no idea. that's above my pay grade. i'm sorry, at this stage i can't help you. here's the direct line to the spiritual inconvenience department at the vatican. hopefully they can help you. i'll be going now."" you undo the straps holding shaggroth/melissa to the chair and start gathering your holy items and return them to your case. on the way out you stop and turn, ""oh and here's your invoice. have a good day"". as you walk out of the house shaggroth/melissa stare at you slack jawed. just as you close the door you hear, ""wow, what a dick."" ""i know right? i am so leaving a one star review."""

300	1	applicance technician here. after looking back at the data on my 17 years of service calls for residential repairs, it looks like only ~30 of my calls were due to stuck stepsisters. stepmothers made up 45% of calls, but we almost always lost money on these as there were often no parts needed, but only labor. the remaining 25% of calls were for temperature sensor, or door sensor replacement. those were the real money makers. however, those also never lead to getting laid by a damsel in distress.

447	2	"""you know and understand pain,"" tom speaks in a neutral tone distorted by the microphone, no word is accentuated more than another. he doesn't seem to register that you cannot answer, neither with your mouth or through gesture. ""in fact, no one knows pain better than you."" you're blindfolded, for your own psychological well-being. the world is easier in the dark than under the spotlight. you remember the white room, the smell of medical alcohol, the pricks of needles. it is still there. from the relative seclusion of your tank, you know tubes still enter your veins, can feel the rods in your back through the anesthetic. ""i readjusted the dosage, i hope you feel better,"" tom's voice goes in through a speaker, it is the only person speaking to you. the others think you can't hear them anymore, or rather, they convinced themselves you cannot. it's easier to go on with their job believing your consciousness is long gone, that your body lives without your mind. it wasn't for lack of trying, old scientists with glasses can be surprisingly creative when it comes to killing. first they gave you a drug and your heart stopped beating. they awaited the death of your brain for reanimation, this way they got to do science, not torture. then they decided to take over your vital functions one after the other, until your consciousness retreated forever in a dark corner. the tube in your nose gives you the oxygen, the tank both fully restrains and moves your limbs around to keep the flesh healthy. but your brain pulled through, so did your consciousness. torture became alright in the name of science and humanity. ""i heard south africa has pulled through, cape town and pretoria are still more or less functional. we will see the end of it, i promise we will,"" there, a hint of tearing up. not a single day goes by without you wishing for death. or what passes as a day in the dark, you lost the feeling of passing time and of yourself, except for pain. there. a burn, a bit, a sudden and violent tear, quickly soothed by the liquid going through your veins, and forgotten. ""i did it as fast as i can."" a life can be worth nothing, or it can be worthy enough to inspire a religion. yours is the only one that is both. when the dead rose, a group of scientists was quickly pointed out as responsible. they didn't deny it, science went wrong. you ran for your life like everyone did, you stumbled, you fell, and they gnawed at you, the vicious, rotten mouths... suddenly turning back to life. the first you saved were quickly eaten by the risen dead right behind them, and you would have died from blood-loss if it wasn't for the keen eyes of a child who witnesses the strange happenings from a distance. you're called a miracle from god. you, better than all, know there is no god. you knew from the moment the convicted scientists pointed out the facility used to create the virus was the only one with the machinery to keep you alive in a way to spread the serum to all the infected. ""i can't look people in the eyes anymore."" outside, they call the day you were carried to the underground facility a holy day, when you gave your life to save all of them. how many of them remember how you screamed and trashed against your chains? how many know the scientists working on you were the same who released the virus, believing to better mankind? it's easier to believe god intervened and forget the rest. belief. the tank, the drugs, the pain, all brought by someone else's belief. you lost yours long ago. here you are now. fed intravenously with substances made to help you grow the flesh back at a fast rate, a single being feeding billions of infected worldwide. ""it's going forward, one day it'll be over. it has to be. someone please tell me it will be,"" tom's voice sounds less robotic. you'd love to go insane or die, your idiot brain won't let you. they call you a martyr who will sit next to god. you wish for an afterlife to exist, if only to meet your zealots and show them how much you suffer. ""they grow restless. my colleagues. they know we'll only get to live for as long as we're needed. once it's over, there will be payback. it won't be pretty. we fear both the virus we unleashed and the end of it."" tom. you learned to pity the poor soul. he's the reason the group was spotted, he's the whistleblower, because he has a conscience, because he couldn't silence it. he can't ignore how you're still alive and thinking in there, it's his curse, just like miraculous flesh is yours. you're his morality pet. the kindness of words and voice he gives you is the only way to keep his tenuous grasp on sanity intact. it won't last long. you've heard him lose the soothing tone, the nihilism creeping into his words. for the rare times you hear his colleagues when they speak near the microphone, you know they are alright. they speak of everything and nothing, you're just an object with an assigned number. but tom, he has a heart, his sins weight on his shoulders. ""i'm thinking about you in there, okay? i won't forget you."" and that is why he's condemned to go insane in the end, the price to pay for empathy. from your tank, you can appreciate the dark irony. it's the only thing you can do."

268	1	well, as i understand it there were kinda two stages to the galileo affair. first was the edict to stop teaching heliocentrism. that was partly based on supposed contradictions with scripture, but mostly because the evidence (mainly stellar parallax) was against it. then galileo kept writing about it and teaching it while painting the pope as an idiot, so they put him under house arrest. that second part was pretty much dumb politics, but the initial edict was mostly based on science

838	1	"it's mainly film and development processes and calibration. look up ""shirley cards."" this meant that light skin tones would reproduce well, but dark skin tones were devoid of details. sadly, it were furniture manufacturers that complained most loudly at the time, because dark brown wood wouldn't render well on film and in print. a lot of photographers then, and also today, weren't trained in how to photograph darker skin tones. most advice still orbits around photographing light skin tones. this is still a problem with digital sensors, as those were initially also optimized for light skin tones, while anything dark would be lacking in detail. face recognition software still sometime isn't sufficiently well calibrated for detecting dark skinned faces."
968	1	eggs are cheap, nutritious, and keto approved. you can also use steamed veggies to bulk out a meal. depends on where you live but around me there are bags of frozen steamables for like a buck at walmart and kroger. big leafy salads are good for stretching your budget too. spaghetti squash is great too, you get a ton of food from one squash and you can use it very similarly to pasta. it doesn't taste the same but it's really good with a keto alfredo, chicken, and spinach or broccoli.

928	1	"just to give you perspective from the other side, or maybe why daycares have this policy: my daughter was born when my son was 17 months old. my son was in full time daycare before i went on mat leave, since my husband and i work full time. my husband got 1 unpaid day off when each kid was born. we decided to keep my son in daycare half time, since i couldn't physically take care of him (lift him into his crib, etc) but couldn't afford full time while i was on leave. a parent sent their child to daycare with ""just a cold."" my son brought home ""just a cold."" what presented as ""just a cold"" in toddlers actually was meningitis and my 6 day old daughter was in the picu for a week, where we weren't sure if she would live. this was pre covid. i understand how frustrating it must be to have your childcare solution be changed at the last minute, but i'm so grateful for daycares that have this type of policy to protect those that aren't able to protect themselves. while it might seem annoying to have to work around your work schedule with a runny-nosed child, it is probably easier than managing a hospital stay with a newborn. so i get it - but there is another side."

826	2	as an american, i stopped watching tv because i couldn't stand it.
167	1	"it's a superconducting magnet. you turn the current on, close the connection, and then the current will always* be flowing as long as it's kept cold. \* for a given value of ""always"". i've personally used magnets that were energized for 30 years without the field changing significantly."
378	1	pretty freaking impressive for the steelers to not just be the only team over .500, but also the only team over .400.
423	1	has been my homepage for the last 6 years, i love it.
908	1	why not both
196	1	makes me really claustrophobic just imagining being the first guy
925	1	i was bullied and assaulted on school grounds, and was coerced by the social worker *to apologize to my bullies because i made one inappropriate comment toward them*, and they didn't notify my mother. there was no faculty supervision when i gave my truly heartfelt apology over my callous and thoughtless words. they beat me up again (my mom was a single mom who worked nocs and was often forced into am shifts, so she didn't see me until after everything was said and done). the second time all students involved were permanently expelled from the school district and had to bus out to another county for the rest of their school career. i realize i was 14 years old, not a young child, but do not trust faculty to handle this situation in an appropriate manner without a parent present. especially *because* your child is a young child, it is even more important that you be present.
949	1	"in the third paragraph where it says ""3 x 109 letters long, or some 3 gigabytes""- should it instead say 10^9?"
655	3	seemed like the owner was in on it so fuck him too.
871	1	exactly! i had some carrots in the fridge that started sprouting leaves so i figured i'd chuck the tops in the garden, add water, & see what happened. i've never grown carrots before & it was interesting to watch the tops grow. the tops got *huge* so i didn't expect much to be happening underground. just soil, water, & sun. hope you & yours kids have fun trying this!
782	1	you can't make me cry
540	1	including hillary. she's not running again. it's just not happening.
653	2	dangerous animals should be put down. then they can get the dog a new owner.
52	1	here in the american midwest you hear it all the time during 90s throwback days on the radio. it was very much a hit, and still pretty iconic.

955	1	grr, 12
269	1	well, the biggest reason was that galileo sort of implied that the pope was simple-minded.
734	2	he'll pull some legal fuckery to delay and appeal until it ends up in front of his 6-3 scotus
279	2	are they holding this event inside a nuclear power plant? does mr. burns know?
613	1	he's using aternos and the max render distance, at least on my server is 15 chunks, and yeah aternos is a weak server, but free so i can't complain
477	1	they sound like they're just giving her a nice little fright. who doesn't like that?
197	1	this is the best use for instagram. i want to see cute dogs living interesting lives.
179	1	1. not ever dragon is an experienced carpenter. 2. please refer to the 5-second rule. here's an odd detail he may have missed: there are 37 days on the calendar in the dragon's cave. why? gotta ask dan on that one...
327	2	they were alive hours before they died.
202	3	regardless of if they caught the rapist it still will have a chilling effect on reporting. the police and da crossed a line here and deserve every bit of backlash they get.
641	2	then she's a moron.
402	1	"in this interview, philosopher slavoj zizek explains how ideologies are part of our material practices, rather than some sort of psychological condition or state. ideology, he argues, is part of our reality. identifying the start of the 90s as the point at which the developed west ostensibly moved beyond the era of ideologies with the end of communism, zizek claims that even in the current period in which common sense and expert opinion are seen to reign supreme, still ideological influence persists. ""we are effectively in an era of cynicism as a form of ideology,"" he claims suggesting that even the rational advice of experts is framed within an existing system and carries 'secret biases'. zizek argues that the modern mantra of tackling practical problems first and foremost makes for a dangerous circumstance, with ideologies already present in the definition of problems. he goes on to discuss the demystification of political authority with the rise of populism, and how it has led to a role reversal between the political left and right, and how capitalism has reinvented itself in the wake of the pandemic."
961	1	very nutritious but they smell like death.
292	1	she's always been the sexy one in the family
758	1	it's perfect for 1440p gaming. there are better cards but then you're getting into the big bucks top end cards
649	2	imagine the mind of a suicidal person, they literally think they are a burden to the world and that both them and the world would be better off without them existing. how the hell does showing them pictures of those with a far better life and possibly far more of a positive contribution to the world make them feel better?
453	1	the cat expected his name listed first.
80	1	it's very likely a uk gov source leaking to the mirror. there is a cobra meeting on today so my guess is this 'story' is actually one of several scenarios that ministers are being briefed on. someone has probably leaked a few details of the most 'severe' scenario and they've run with it.
456	3	both him and his cat.
194	2	are we witnessing child labour in this gif?
886	3	looooser looooser edit: yes this is an sb reference not a diss.

854	1	get out of here with your logic this is r/nba!
841	1	when i was 9 my mom took me to disney world. they have some of the best cinnamon rolls there. i was sitting outside the crystal palace, happily eating my cinnamon roll, when a crow or something swooped down and stole it right out of my hand. i'm still mad about it 30 years later.
360	2	so does this mean no more immigration from many muslim countries where homosexuality is a capitol offense? or places like china or russia, who view it very similarly?
85	3	the lord of the rings' legacy is they're fucking awesome
930	1	a death threat? easy. just call the police. that's way beyond school jurisdiction.
283	1	hmmm 1. odd numbers are bad luck (appearance) 2. makes 1 whole sandwich with a spare... why? (design) 3. it costs like a dollar a loaf... 50cents for 3 is outrageous (financially) 4. wasteful packaging (environment) probably cost more for the store to pay someone to package and handle it... the to give that away. some crazy times ahead!
811	1	i really like it. would be nice if it was a little more legible tho
922	1	in my opinion there should be no such meetings involving such small children without the parents present. there should possibly be a meeting between you and the school without any children first.
153	1	this.this scares me. edit: but also legendary.
160	1	the weight is half bone generally, probably more here given the length of the tomahawk here. granted 16 - 19oz is still a big meal for any dude.
966	1	i bulk up soup with cooked, pureed zucchini. it makes a good base for tons of stuff.
386	3	fucking kool keith.
82	3	the bomb. it's nuclear! nuclear!!!
189	1	i e always been told ice caves should be avoided unless it's really cold (well below freezing) due to potential collapse. the fact that this is gone after a few years would seem to confirm the danger.
677	1	as an amatuer graphic designer, i get annoyed of low quailty memes, so when i create one, i make an effort to find a hd template, and make it as good as i can.
644	2	that's really insulting to the monkey
746	1	hi exhausted, i'm dad.
771	1	well, thor and bruce are still around, but they are too high elo to play with you unless you have a full comp.
787	1	>it makes sense that they'd get back together, it must be impossible to find single immortals in your area. > >congrats on your genes. seriously. ops mom got younger what the hell. these people are going to live forever.
438	2	"can we be honest? fundamentally, there's no international body with the authority/will to ""ban"" autonomous weapon systems given that the nations with veto power over such agreements are the very same ones aggressively pursuing the technology. there's no scenario where military powers see a massive force multiplying technology that their (generally world order skirting) rivals are clearly investing heavily in and allow themselves to fall behind."
141	1	he didn't lie to his wife honesty is always best.
335	2	man im right there with you. i figured 2 minutes would kill her because it nearly killed me. how wrong i was.
373	3	where's the legend? i can make some assumptions, but they'd be just that.
313	2	sure, now give me back the free one.
287	1	tide pods has entered the chat.
777	1	i'm just impressed with the amount of detail
212	2	"""i don't think i'm better than them but maybe i do"" lol one of the most human things i've ever read just do your thing and find some other people who are interested in more mature books."
738	1	there's been a well-written, highly upvoted comment in r/politics saying trump is right at the cusp of total humiliation and disgrace every day for.. 6 years now. it isn't that i don't believe them or that they're wrong, it's just that i've heard this all before.
728	2	my man your reply is the equivalent of the 5th
596	1	my balls while running nah who am i kidding, i don't run...
408	1	"i like this. it reminds me of ""sonder"". the realization that everyone else is living a life as vividly and complex as your own. to most people, you're not even a back story character; not even a blur from a passing vehicle. you will never exist to them. it might sound simple, but we tend to live and act like this isnt the case"
254	1	lpt: start using netflix for dvds. they have just about everything including tons of more obscure stuff that doesn't stream anywhere. if they go, we're fucked.
776	1	brings nostalgia of me playing ps2 spider-man as a kid
123	2	agreed, and russian bots keep saying that the us is gaslighting and russia isn't going to do anything. we're literally just broadcasting what they're doing. it's back up by satellite pictures and everything.
116	2	"yeah, its a pretty rough one. whats that shower thought from forever ago? ""having a mid-life crisis is like playing an rpg and realizing half-way through that you hate your character but you can't respec skills and there's only one game ever."""
375	3	why yes, colorism absolutely exists. i'm surprised this is the only comment that even remotely alludes to it.
572	1	that's how my fallout character walks around most of the time
900	1	jesus christ in the year 33 before christ?
451	1	he was sentenced to life imprisonment, and then three days later nixon commuted it to three years house arrest. this after nixon had reportedly received 5,000 telegrams regarding the verdict and them being 100 to 1 in favor of leniency. it blows my mind that people were that willing to argue in favor of leniency for a mass murderer.
333	1	1080 graphics card an i7 and 8-16 gb ram should work for even heavy modding. just be sure to change the amount of ram minecraft has access to otherwise the game might have a hard time keeping up. i recommend setting it to 6gb instead of the default 1gb.
845	1	she makes the rules here
589	2	this looks like how a fancy restaurant would serve a $38 portion of banana
271	2	so he's anti-vax
91	2	that big of a sex gap raises some questions about the methodology on this one.
4	2	we should go back to just posting that picture of reddit silver with the s backwards and whatever instead of spending coins to have an official useless icon.
441	1	"loved it! soon as you said he was sweating, i figured something was off with javin. one small thing, though, this line: ruben shot up. ""i will not have you casting aspirations on my wife!"" not to be pedantic, and maybe it was a spell checker, but i think you were looking for ""aspersions"", no? lys kinda reminds me of my wife, lol"

675	1	>the guy had no clue what he was selling he probably posts here on r/pcmasterrace...
650	1	shoegaze dad is spot on with this comment. not a facepalm, unless one of despair at the fate of the working classes.
142	1	"exactly. i went from ""trying to be amused"" to ""worried where this is going"" real quick."
820	1	the bros at the frat will love it
794	1	"no. she's stressed. motherly instincts vs being a good ""pet"" to her owner. she's stress licking and staring at the person. dog's way of saying, ""back the fug up""."

958	1	spongebob ate them all, you can see he's got his cheeks full. guilty-ass looking piece of disposable kitchenware
293	2	Paying people in poor countries to astroturf is nothing new. Right now there is a room full of cheap smart phones, ziptied to boards, with a person in front of it pressing the orange arrow on the reddit posts they were given.Ê
214	2	start your own book club
331	2	yeah seems like karma farming
889	1	Excellent piece and tribute to your dad. I'm sorry for your loss
603	2	not meaning to disagree here, that's actually a great tip imo, but trying to add to this. about the awkwardness. girlfriend posted on her ig-account about some jewelry the op had given her, and within hours the ex was on the phone, demanding a meeting. just let that sink in. how often do you check your ex's current girlfriend's ig-accounts? perhaps weekly? sorry, this is creepy. op proposed to his girlfriend on the two-year anniversary of them dating. dating started one year after the ex herself had started dating again. that's three years total. and the ex was calling him up, on his vacation, against agreements about that, completely devastated. this fubar has already become so awkward, a few instagram account settings really aren't going to make a big difference anymore.
901	2	people don't realize this but in india there are times when a man is kidnapped by members of his own family and forced to marry some woman they chose for him. it's happened to many of my relatives and almost happened to my dad.
836	2	i value my glass so yes of course. anyone who doesn't is a sociopath imo
88	1	i dunno rocky and apollo up above is pretty good
652	1	thought this was going to be worse. my uncle had a nasty scar on his back from playing around with a double bit when he was a kid(think he was 10 or 11 at the time). went to whip it back to throw it, and put it right above his kidney. missed hitting anything vital or any bone. this sort of thing was a trend with my uncle. he is the same one that had an attempted diy firework(bunch of black powder in a toilet paper tube) blow up in his hand. walked away with only some superficial burns. he had a sort of uncanny luck.
429	2	do you feel like your job gives you unreasonably low stress levels? jack those numbers up you big baby! op has just what you need. life and death stress with every sloc! call today and receive lifelong ptsd for no extra cost!
203	2	similar styles of scam were already run through the mail and made illegal. they were encyclopedia sales, and they said if you didn't reply you were consenting to buy the books.
842	1	that bird got some massive brain freeze.
543	1	"i used to do some infrastructure work inside the eod squadron building on base and there was a big banner inside the front door that said ""not dead yet"" and another one on another wall in the building that said ""everyone's divorced"""
468	1	you might have to check the law on that. i'm pretty sure that they could evict on other grounds, but if they did then they would have to return the unearned months less damages.
436	2	hey, are they still using gobs of water to grow almonds in the desert down there? is that still considered smart, if so?
940	1	yeah what happened to bitcoin being not real or a scam? if it was, it wouldn't be on any watchlist.
278	1	i love the interview with kobe where he said if shaq had his work ethic he'd be the greatest player of all time and it wouldn't be close.
625	1	the best part is the mantis eating the leg like a piece of spaghetti.
282	3	because of the packaging waste.
662	3	there was a thread on (i think) unpopular opinion that stated children should be taught proper gun safety. 90% of people lost their fucking minds over it
898	1	i'd only want the best for them and to wear their face.
732	2	trump going to jail or facing consequences is always 30 years away just like nuclear fusion.
844	1	for extra flavour
33	2	story =/= lore. lore is background and setting, story is a narrative through-line that tells you why you are here, what you are doing and so forth. they aren't the same. games like doom and dark souls tells its lore through environmental elements, context clues and collectible doohickies you can find and read shit in menus. the story is the here and now, that you are just some dude, you woke up and now you gotta go kill shit.
399	1	as to your last point, a clock that is accurate at sea is essential for calculating longitude, but that problem wasn't solved until the 1750s, so i'm not sure that counts as antiquity.
130	2	when the white kid stood up, and both cops were attending the black kid, i thought for sure they would take that as a threat since their backs were basically turned. but no. no reaction from the cops at all. the white kids was obviously not considered threatening at any point.
127	2	the cop made sure the white kid was ok before leaving him to jump on the black kid, lol. it's so blatant one has to laugh.
342	1	was expecting something else based on your username.
442	1	fun story! i like the dialogue tags when ruben zones back into javin's voice. i'll have to try that sometime.
821	2	so your solution for something that is all-in-one is to have 20 different solutions on 20 different platforms? doesn't seem convenient.

943	1	awesome! my grandfather learned to make simple websites (just html) in the late 90s when he was in his 60s. then he taught me and i've been hooked with computers ever since.
383	1	this would fit well in scott pilgrim
431	2	"if water levels get too low in a nearby reservoir, they just turn off the water early and lawns go brown. a significant portion of utah is in the ""great basin"" where all water that falls for hundreds of miles ends up in the great salt lake instead of the ocean. our policy in the great basin seems to be to grow the population and not make any changes until the salt lake is empty. currently it's at its lowest level in generations in part because of the drought, but also because we refuse to make meaningful reductions in water use."
607	2	i don't know what is going on with her, but you are enabling it. just tell her you aren't buying all the things she wants and she should fend for herself. but you have to stick to it. it might eventually mean breaking up. by the way, it's actually cheaper to cook from scratch than to buy frozen entrees, etc., but it requires you to not be too fussy, and requires a fair amount of kitchen management - using up all you buy, keeping track of when things expire, etc. cooking from scratch also doesn't mean cooking every day. it's healthy and safe to make a relatively large batch of a stew, chili, etc., and eat that for several days.
465	1	talk to your school counselor and hopefully school social worker to see what types of options may be available to you. you might contact child services to see if there is a requirement to provide until you graduate. put in applications and check your credit history to see if it has been used fraudulently. it may not seem like the best option, but the military might be what you need. you can still go to college for reduced rates while on active duty, air force is your best choice. edit: keep your head up little sis

503	2	thanks for letting me know the forms are up, god forbid rh does
162	1	skin to skin contact soon after birth is especially important for c-section births to introduce the newborn to mother and parent's microbiome. depends on the hospital and baby's condition, but it can often be done in the or while the surgery is being finished up.
542	1	"al qaeda in iraq used to setup fake ""duds"", bombs they setup to lure u.s. bomb technicians, but they would have a live one nearby, or setup ambush/mortar attacks. one reason why we went to blowing things up, instead of dismantling the bomb."
17	2	plus textured hair is a bitch and a half to manage. i'm a dude with long hair and it's already hard enough. one of my smoking buddies from when i worked next to a cosmetology school also said the white girls would always ask *her* to do the textured hair so often it seems white stylists don't even bother to learn.

755	1	"assuming you're asking about the ""gaming oc"" part and not the 3070 as others have addressed what to expect out of a 3070. the gaming oc is a solid sku, above the reference style sku (evga black) but a bit below cards like the ftw3, strix or gaming x which have beefier power delivery and even bigger cooling solutions. the gaming oc still has a decent factory oc and solid triple fan cooling solution. if you're looking for a ""good"" sku that isn't as over the top as a strix or ftw3 it's a good choice."
398	1	the short version is that they didn't use them. for most of antiquity, the day was broken up between before noon and after noon. sundials and the like have existed for almost all of societal history but they weren't really ever in widespread use in antiquity.

251	1	this is the real lpt. streaming is fine if you want to just watch something. can't beat the dvd service if you want to watch a specific thing.
95	1	52% in men is a big motivator. 8% in women, not so much. such a big difference is fascinating
104	1	i lack some of the connective tissue you're supposed to have in your shoulders. because of this, if i relax i can pull my shoulders out of the socket at will. sometimes i'll do it accidentally, things like carrying heavy groceries can pull my shoulders out of place if i'm not careful. it doesn't usually hurt, but if i pull my arm too hard or in the wrong direction like that i can hurt myself. one night i fell asleep with my arms folded behind my head. at some point as i fell asleep, my shoulders must have relaxed and dislocated from the weird position. i woke up with both arms totally dead asleep, no feeling at all, both shoulders dislocated, and both arms tangled around each other. not able to feel anything and knowing i could really hurt myself if i moved wrong, i thought i was going to be stuck like that forever. took ages to manage to untangle one just enough to get it into a position that restored the feeling a little, which let me get it back into the socket. then i could finally use that arm to carefully twist back around the other arm and get it into the socket as well.
343	1	infamous pewdiepie bridge encounter?
252	1	change of scenery. if you're able to then go on holiday, or go and stay somewhere new in whatever country you're in. relaxing is all in your mind. a change of scenery and routine helps your mind separate from your normal routine and the stresses that come with it.
913	1	well i think gyro contains chicken , so basically no ! this is a dough like pizza dough and a herb called zaatar is spread on it with olive oil and is put in the oven then mint , onions , tomatoes , olives and cucumber are put on it and wrapped ! also you cam go to amy arabic store or pastry shop and order it !
633	1	it's like looking at a disney movie set. amazing.
192	1	note the practiced economy of movement, she's not even looking at the box as she slams into it. that kid has done that a lot.
671	1	might go the other way and you develop the power to trace rays next time you make a pizza.

860	1	my boy ayyyyoooooo rising to six!
988	1	this is really the area i'd like to see them improve on in future games. just general ui and menus. the clothing shop should list by overall clothing type first and only then open up a list of color options. the hairdresser shouldn't charge you until after you've selected options to change, being charged just to even look at the options even if you don't intend on changing your current style is silly. npcs that sell/buy unique things in bulk just need options to pick how many you want to sell/buy, not only have options to pick between like 1, 5, or 10 at a time. when selling things to the general store you really ought to have the option to sort your item box. just things like that.
93	1	it does happen though. my partner is 30 and was diagnosed last week with heart disease after he collapsed at work. and this is a dude who isn't overweight, exercises daily, runs, plays sports, doesn't smoke/drink, does meditation and other stress management things.

92	1	sorry for my laziness not reading the entire study. but is there an hypothesis on the vast difference between men and women? i understand that higher cardiovascular risk in general for men is a factor, but doesn't explain this enormous gap in benifit from exercise i suppose.

370	2	arnold was married to the daughter (maria shriver) of the woman who created the special olympics (eunice kennedy shriver) so it was always going to be a bad idea to say something like this to him
253	1	i know everyone uses the toothbrush example, but if thats difficult too it's better to start with larger motion exercises like wiping & dusting, vacuuming & ironing. also important to work the arms as it will help when you get to working the hands if you have stronger arms first... brushing hair and then teethbrushing, then practice writing. i was ambidextrous as a child but became more dependent on my right hand side (or just lazy lol) but have done all above in recent years :)

266	1	"it was the 9th ""planet"" by order of discovery and more distant than neptune at time of discovery, but if you count it as a planet and count the planets by distance from the sun, pluto was indeed the *8th* planet between 1979 and 1999 when it crossed neptune's orbit. this is of course also why it lost classical planetary status under the new definition and is now considered a dwarf planet. pluto and other kbo's like this do not meet the ""orbital dominance"" criteria of the new definition. they do not ""clear their neighborhood"" through the kuiper belt and would be heavily perturbed by an encounter with neptune."

467	1	wild. but yes this is totally normal. many initial estimates of escrow are low due to rising taxes and insurance costs. i've gotten an escrow adjustment several times since purchasing any home i've owned. also, those taxes are crazy. but i also believe that it's probably accurate. the hard pill to swallow is that property taxes in other areas are a fraction of what you're going to pay. in my area you'd pay less than 3k on a 400k home.
325	2	that's some homer simpson maths right there

995	1	orrrrrrrr just repeal the recent the law that prevents people from using the existing law that's been around for 100+ years which was created to help people solve this exact problem... bankruptcy. what do you think happens when colleges and those companies that issue college loans know that you have to pay the loans back no matter what? they charge more.
409	1	"i love this article. it's hard to conceive of time outside of its unfurling before us, or appearing to unfurl before us. one example that's always stuck with me with respect to this concept of ""tenseless"" time: imagine you're walking down a road. that's you, experiencing time, one moment at a time. things enter and exit your awareness - trees, passers by, clouds, birds, etc. as they enter your vision, it seems that they are coming into existence. as you pass them by, it appears they are ceasing to exist. but in reality, the things you experience on the road were there before you experienced them. let's say there's a mountain 100 miles down the road. it's already there, but you just haven't seen it yet. when the mountain comes into view, you might say that it has come into existence. your existence. this is how time exists. it's an extension of space. the time coordinate of a thing is another descriptor or property of the thing. right now, i am at x latitude and y longitude. and perhaps z height as well, in space, in the universe. but your place in time is similarly a property of you and your experience. we're just not very good at conceiving of future places in time, in the same way that an ant crawling on a piece of paper might not realize that it has a height dimension and can be rolled into a tube. the future is already there, just like the past. we're just locked into this road journey."
321	2	I mean it sucks that it's like that but most if not all of this is just plastic pollution in the ocean making it onto the beach, and that's something we're all contributing to

28	1	"i saw it before me in shadows of doubt - my means to salvation, my only way out. it sat there in silence, and captured me, caught - immune to my heartache, and deaf to my thought. ""i don't want a future,"" i solemnly swore - ""of sadness and silence and loss anymore. i don't want a witness to witness goodbye - i just wanted someone to care when i cry."" i looked at it, waiting, and muttered a vow: ""whatever. let's do it. it's never or now. i'm ending it here, of an evening, alone."" i reached out before me. and picked up the phone."
598	1	so much more protection when they need to go overseas. here in germany they just stand on the back of a truck in the rain on a sunday if they stay domestic / in europe.

757	1	all 3070s are more or less the same, the only noticeable difference between brands are temperatures, noise and customer service. if the quality of the card is a concern its a fantastic card, but ask yourself do you need/want a 3070ti or 3080 and are you prepared to pay the extra to get one?

446	2	that was a ride. it's incredibly dark and shows mankind at their worst and in a twisted irony also at their best. the message for me is, that there is no message. sometimes humanity just sucks, being human just sucks because you make mistakes and you have to make choices and sometimes all the options are horrible. there is no moral to learn here because history repeats itself as it always has and people make mistakes as they always have and then try to cover them up in the false sense that it will make it all better again. trapped in the illusion that everything will return to how it was before. very well written. thank you for sharing

711	2	ugh, people like this? grew up with parents who used too much pinesol... yuck. doesn't even smell like real pine.. which is lovely

733	2	the hammer is coming down. the hammer has been coming down for quite a while now. an uncomfortably long time, in fact. did they drop it from orbit? is that why it's taking so long?
119	1	it's catchy as hell no doubt. but the meaning is terrifying.
166	1	i don't think that any of the examples here understand the question. they're all giving examples of predators that, as babies, are sometimes hunted by adults of other species. op had an example where the predator-prey relationship reverses. in an immature stage, x hunts y, but when they (both) mature, y hunts x. since most higher species don't have young that do hunting, you'll probably have to look to less developed species for other examples. (i suspect that you might find other examples among insects, where larvae might be predators.)
965	1	bean sprouts are another awesome alternative. like cabbage, they're cheap and it's easy to cook in bulk if you're just interested in quantity of food. they can also be super nutrient dense. my favorite use of them is with stir fry, where they make a decent substitute for noodles.
246	1	this makes me happy, although i hadn't considered it when i made it. i love dishonored and the concept art made for it.
760	3	or at least a plastic shroud around the pins to make them easier to plug in, like for fuck's sake, guys, there is no reason for it to be this painful xd
998	1	"despite what schumer thinks can be solved ""with a simple stroke of the pen"", there is no easy road to blanket loan forgiveness under the higher education act. it doesn't matter if it's a $10,000, $50,000, or a complete write-off of the debt. the only certainly is this: an executive order which forgives student loans (in part or in full) will be challenged in the courts, and then it will die in the courts. in the meantime, this issue will be politicized even more, making it that much harder for congress to pass any sensible loan forgiveness legislation. congress has always been the way forward on this issue."
609	2	partly because you're accepting and enabling the behaviour. you need to set clear boundaries and a strong stance on this or she is going to keep walking over you.
823	2	goodluck doing any of that with btc
