548	1	most high explosives are extremely stable, you don't want them going off before you intend them to (like if the plane carrying it gets shot at). you can pound c4 with a hammer and it won't do anything. the fuse is a mini explosive that has enough kick to set off the main charge.

971	1	lucky those horns aren't sharp. same could be said about the dude
219	1	visual rhetoric combined with text is powerful stuff. reading *persepolis* early in graduate school made me keen on graphic novels as a medium for communicating different personal narratives. then work like the provocatively-titled collection *get naked* showed me how persuasive they can be about understanding other perspectives. since then, i frequent the graphic novel section of my library and check out at least one a month, whether it's focused on something like the history of beermaking or whether it's something like *rusty brown*. i wish i'd known titles like this were out there in middle and high school, when the chasm between fun, picture-heavy, low-grade reads about history and solid text-only history texts never felt wider.
440	1	this would be the equivalent of banning nuclear weapons prior to their creation. it's the best thing for humanity but to not pursue them while your adversary does would put you at a major disadvantage.

139	2	but some take it to the point of wanting to shelter them from all forms of sex education as if that'll keep teenagers from having sex. and that does more harm than good.
577	3	"there's no ego bruise in letting some asshole go up ahead of you. it's actually better to let them go create pressure somewhere else. good on you. i had a friend that was always trying to ride up on the person in front of them and block out anyone trying to squeeze in. i asked him, ""what are your options right now?"" ""what?"" ""you're nose to butt with the car ahead of you, and there's a psycho boxing you in to the right that may try to cut in at any time. the shoulder on the left is super narrow and full of debris. what if someone flys up from behind? what can you really do?"" ""don't tell me how to drive."" ""don't make me passenge like this."" person in front can brake hard any moment person on the side can run you off any moment anyone can hit you from behind, especially if the line ahead stops dead it's just never in the best interest of safety to be boxed in and close to others. if you can't make it around slow-moving groups of vehicles, then that's your life for a time. wait until a path opens up and then break free. until then, leave space. let the free radicals move about. give yourself an out if anything fly's toward you from any direction. calm your ego and be safe in the flow of the river of metal boxes. besides, the biggest ego validation is letting an idiot go ahead and go nowhere. if they're especially peppy and cause an accident ahead, you just slow down and go around them. if they think they cracked the code on traffic, they just keep seeing you there, same amount of progress, while you're just chillin. to stay on point. yes! the mirrors are where the predictive action is. as long as you're not barreling toward what's up ahead, it's whatever; the real spice comes from the rear periphery."

605	3	> trauma caused his behavior? yeah, and i'm guessing a girl accused at college of something he didn't do? i'm guessing sexual assault/rape, and further, he did do it. fits with the racisms as well, entitled, and resentful as fuck. if he's the golden boy in the extended family, then it fits.

163	1	if you are talking about the skin microbiome (this is the germs / microbes on all skin and eyelashes) then babies obtain a lot of their microbiome from their mother during birth. they they will have additional colonisation through any skin to skin contact as well as their food. this microbiome is made up of lots of different types of microbes and millions of each and transfer very easily. if you are talking about eyelash mites, eyelash mites can also live on general skin. these are transferred from people with them on their skin / hairs / eyelashes to the hair / eyelashes on a newborn by touch. keep in mind that everyone has hair all over so this could be to anywhere on the baby and they can then move. it is also worth noting that not everyone has these mites and the same goes for newborns.

921	2	yes, this. not saying it wasn't the appropriate move for those kids but your son has been put through it. and then you adopted kids to help. he has a lot of trauma. he is very resentful of the adoption. he is hurt by his father's actions. he is probably hurt that you took on more children instead of focusing solely on your own. he is not acting out because of nothing. he is a very hurt and scared little boy. he barely tries because he is scared of his future. he needs real help. he needs a bigger therapy course now. and you say you are in most of his sessions with him? he needs sessions all his own so he can actually open up.

329	2	"*pleasure. it would give you *pleasure* to have these things (the dog is both potentially pleasure and happiness but if you had no relationship with the dog, just got it because you could afford it, it wouldn't make you happy) the *lack* of money is the cause of a shit load of suffering and *un*happiness, so it's natural to feel that having loads of money would mean nothing but good times, but that's a big mistake. which is why so many extremely rich people are depressed af, medicated or self medicating with drugs to cope, spending more and more extreme amounts to get the same ""buzz"" but it's not real happiness."
590	1	works great for strawberries too!!
692	2	i'm low maintenance af and it's still more expensive to be a woman. bras cost a lot. menstruation products aren't cheap either. shampoo and conditioner and any home hair product is more than that can of murray's that lasts men 5 years. we even use more toilet paper. compare the price of men's toiletries to women's. just making a razor pink means they mark it up 10%. that generally applies across the board. obviously some shit is more luxury than necessity like the lashes she mentioned but don't say it's not pricey to be a woman. that's just untrue.

519	2	not that there couldn't be something shady going on here, but i find i interesting how many people are saying there is no way a historically successful investor could see anything in this crap company, while not batting and eye at the fact microsoft saw enough to buy them. perhaps they both saw the same potential.

396	1	it has been a mystery that some areas, like italy, were devastated by the black death, yet others, like poland, seem to be relatively unaffected. the popular theory is that less is known about poland than italy, so poland's devastation was unrecorded. it could, however, be if this paper is true that many regions were unaffected. if these differences in the plague's mortality are established, we can then move on to find out why it happened.

950	1	they were using a text format where each nucleotide was reprented by an ascii character, so it would've taken 1 byte even though there were only four combinations. as for *why* they were using a text format, i'm guessing it's because ease of processing was more important than storage space. if you squeeze in each nucleotide into 2 bits, you need to decode and re-encode it every time you want to do something to the individual letters, and you can't leverage existing text processing tools. i have zero evidence for this though, so take it with a bucket of salt.
800	1	yeah but straight from the tap??
164	1	normal flora start spreading to the newborn as soon as they lay the baby on the mother's tummy, and it's one of the reasons caregivers advocate skin-to-skin contact between the parents and the child. once the colonization begins, it's impossible to keep normal bacteria from spreading to the entire body via hands and feet and bathing. is that the question? there are larger inhabitants than bacteria, such as nits, but they don't inhabit every adult nor every infant.
172	1	sorry to disappoint. wife refused to model. maybe i should get a crash test dummy.
72	1	and reduce the probability of turkey (a nato member) from attacking or being attacked by russia. didn't turkey shoot down a russian military jet not that long ago?
298	3	yeah, hard to support her when she's clearly skewing details. like one interview she said she thought she could just do it for a short time without anyone knowing but she picked the biggest names in the porn industry to do videos for and kept her name after?
851	1	steph, 2 time mvp one time unanimous mvp, saying i'll take a back seat to kevin durant on my -own- team is what made it all work so well
190	1	ice caves come and go all the time. source: i have spent a lot of time on glaciers
640	2	"they probably also say they are 5'8""-6'0"" tall."
113	2	"ercot - electric ""reliability"" council of texas. gotta love how ""reliable"" the system was during that storm as people froze to death. gotta love the emails sent out to customers all year long every year suggesting that they conserve their energy use in order to minimize power outages. bitch, that's your one job!"
847	1	"yep: ""i am doggo, i'm here to report that i am goodest boy"""
256	1	establish a daily routine that you can keep doing during your stressful time. drink water as soon as you wake up. go on a walk or yoga or whatever excercise you enjoy. do small things, everyday, at the time you'll need to do them when you are on the stressful schedule. build the habit and it will serve you.
288	1	even knowing its soap, i kind of still want to eat it
774	1	it's been several years... my ps4 was a launch day console. the noise was getting unbearable. finally took it apart. cleaned it. applied fresh thermal paste. what a difference. don't quite remember my fan looking at crusty as yours. eventually passed the console on to my daughter when the ps5 launched. it still runs quiet.
773	1	or ever been with a woman. peach fuzz
15	2	i mean wouldn't you prefer it be staged over this actually happening? or shall we *enjoy suffering*
464	1	well, yes but it wouldn't be easy. i started grad school at 38 and doubled my income within two years of graduating. so, survivorship bias aside, it is possible to greatly improve income. your wife would need to go back to work and make a significant amount. consider that you are getting by with one income now and her second would be able to go toward your retirement savings, assuming the kids are past childcare stage. if you invest $1500/mo and get a 7% return, you'd have $1.5m by 70.
18	1	the wig holds the power
86	2	i agree, vin diesel was 34 when the first f&f movie. that's plenty young to get someone more age appropriate to the role and have a long lived franchise.
73	3	what are you talking about? it's completely normal to have military training exercises with an invasion level force on three sides bordering a neighboring country you previously invaded and are verbally threatening the sovereignty of daily. why is the west being so dramatic???
690	2	the hard way: he: hey sexy, wanna hang out with a real master player? her: get lost nerd!
34	2	that... and people are dumb, which us why movies are mostly just exposition. good movies are few. building it towards the crowd that needs exposition is better business, unfortunatly.
994	1	>ends lol
