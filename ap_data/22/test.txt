94	1	yeah, this has to be an element of this issue at times too. my mom was dismissed for weeks when she went to the doctors and er repeatedly with severe head pain. come to find out she had a brain tumour that was bleeding on her brain. a student in my graduating class at uni is a super fit young woman, even taught free yoga classes sometimes at campus. she was dismissed for her chest pain and exhaustion, they told her it was gas and/or anxiety. she ended up having heart disease. i went to the er once bleeding from a miscarriage, and they didn't believe me when i said i was losing a lot of blood. i ended up almost bleeding out in the triage room. i'm not saying that 100% of poor health outcomes for women are based in medical biases, but i think that people do underestimate how real of a problem this is for women.

205	2	"honestly, probably because to get help, he'd have to get through customer service. and to get through customer service he'd need to get the right number, and that number will probably transfer him to the actual right number, who will then transfer him to another number because they don't want to handle that right now because they're 10 minutes from break and don't want to miss out on that. so that next person will be new, will do their very best to help because they genuinely might want to but don't actually have the knowledge or ability to do so. they'll spend about an hour before lying and saying they got it fixed and a correction will be sent in the mail in 5-10 business days. it won't be. after all that is done, he'll call back and try to ask for a supervisor, only to be jerked around for an hour and be given another worker with similar, at best, knowledge and ability to the person who wasn't a supervisor/escalation agent, but they're allowed to say they're a supervisor. they'll say some nice words but end it with ""well, i'll make sure to get you to the right person and get this fixed this time"". and from there, there is maybe a 40% chance you'll get into contact with someone who can actually help. if you're being generous. i used to be on both sides of this while working in a customer service hotline for an insurance company. it's just an utter mess of undertrained, under paid workers mixed in with a few who actually know what they're doing, but you're lucky if you bump into one of those at any given day."

173	1	"you are correct. some mattress brands own review websites or they have a direct investment into a review site. mattress review websites generally aren't required to give a good review, but heavily influenced to do so. if you see certain suspect mattresses routinely at the top of various ""best of"" lists you can almost guarantee those mattress brands are simply paying the most money per sale. the mattress review industry by and large is dishonest. there are absolutely consequences if you you call out a particular mattress as bad or even just that don't like it as much as others. mattress brands stop working with you, remove you from their partner programs, reduce your commission, threaten legal action, sue you, they will negative seo your website (which causes rankings to decline), they will send dislike bots to your youtube videos (which isn't a big deal now that dislikes are turned off), and launch a myriad of other cyber attacks. all of the above have happened to me over the years."
175	2	when i was shopping for a mattress last year i ran across lots of review web sites and youtube channels, including sleepopolis. i came to the conclusion that most of these reviews are either paid for by the manufacturer or they are required to give a good review if they want to keep getting free samples to test. how honest is the mattress review industry? are there any negative consequences if you say that a particular mattress is bad?

""oh mighty dlanod, we offer unto you this virgin as a sacrifice to appease you. accept it from your humble servants!"" the creature turned to me and smiled, licking his lips as he noticed that i wasn't what he expected. i guess he was accustomed to female type virgin sacrifices. ""what is this? you call this a virgin sacrifice?"" ""it was the best we could do, your mightiness. you barely accepted our last virgin sacrifice."" ""a four-year-old child isn't much of a sacrifice! tasty, yes, but an hour later, i was hungry again!"" ""hey, demon-guy,"" i shouted. ""how about i make you a better offer?"" the demon looked at me with a raised eye-ridge. ""a better offer?"" ""yeah. a better offer."" ""what type of offer?"" ""ask yourself, exactly why do demons want virgin females as sacrifices?"" ""oh, the exquisite flavor as we rip their souls from their bodies is beyond compare."" ""you're a demon! do you know what that flavor is? it's the flavor of their terror and screaming! i know jack the ripper was a demon, and he loved ripping the souls of the least pure women in lodon."" he looked thoughtful, nodded, and came to the conclusion that i was hoping he would: the flavor is in the terror, not the purity. or, in this case, pure terror was the actual flavor he really enjoyed. ""i offer up for your dining pleasure this room full of your disciples. they will scream to, pardon the expression, high heaven as you take their souls, one by one. the flavor will be their screams as the tides turn against them. they did not come here to sacrifice themselves. if you don't believe me, try him,"" pointing to the demon priest. i won't go into detail on how the sacrifice worked, but there was a reason sacrifices were always naked. it took dlanod on a few minutes to perform his part of the ritual: only a few drops of blood could be found around as he devoured the priest's body and soul. oh, the screams were loud as they resounded around the room. they were followed by more screams as he attacked others in the flock. after consuming a half-dozen of his worshipers, he looked at me with a satisfied smile on his face. he walked over to me and brought his clawed fingers down in an arc that i accepted as being a prelude to my time on this earth. instead, his claws split the bonds that held me. ""you've fulfilled your part. they were delicious! now, let's talk about your future"" my future was to find the most fearful beings for sacrifice. i thought long and hard on it and karma ended up being a demon named dlanod. i picked people that, while they might be missed, would actually improve society. take that ceo that constantly laid off people to improve his salary. he sure didn't live long enough to enjoy his multi-million-dollar bonus. remember that con-man televangelist that disappeared. there was a special place in hell for him, and that place was in dlanod's gut. a lot of terrorists ended up going that way as well. me? well, i took over the cult leadership. i advised them that they should be prepared to sacrifice themselves at any time, because if they prepared for it, they wouldn't scream and be as flavorful. this happened over three-hundred years ago. dlanod has been eating regularly and society has improved: even moreso after we worked on adding corrupt politicians into the mix. life is good, but afterlife is hellishly better."

237	1	your food pretty much lasts the same length of time in your stomach one way or another. remember that your stomach is really only the second step of your digestive system - the first being your mouth, where you start the process by chewing the food into easily digestible goo. the stomach adds acid and enzymes, then the foodgoo goes on into the small intestines where bacteria gets to work and the useful proteins and nutrients are absorbed into the intestinal wall and enters the bloodstream to go whereever they're needed. you could (in theory) cut a hole into your abdomen and place unchewed food directly into the stomach, and it would still spend the same amount of time before being sent on its merry little way. but, by not chewing, the stomach and rest of the digestive system wouldnt be able to properly extract enough nutrients. meaning you wouldn't be getting the right amount, and would need to eat more...and you would be pooping a lot more.

567	2	ultimately, mcconnell knows there's really only one way he's going to be able to thwart trump permanently, and that is to support the findings of the january 6th committee (which will likely continue to implicate trump directly in the insurrection) and then whip \[read: ***buy***\] however much gop support he can for participation in the invocation of section 3 of the 14th amendment. i think all of that will hinge on how well trump-backed candidates perform in the primaries this year. if they fail, mcconnell has all the ammo he needs to see this through to the end, and that could come as soon as this summer. in fact, such action would probably be *good* for gop turnout in the fall because all of the legal battles over the 14th amendment would have republican voters foaming at the mouth. if trump's people win in significant numbers, buckle your chinstraps because mcconnell is not going to outright sabotage the gop ahead of 2 crucial elections in '22 and '24. if it's a wash, it will all depend on *where* trump's people win. if they only win nominations in rabidly republican strongholds, mcconnell may still move forward with a plan to extricate trump from the party to whatever extent possible, albeit more muted than he has been recently. if trump's people win nominations in races that will be competitive in the general election, everything will depend on their performance in the fall. tl;dr: if trump-backed gop candidates get wiped out in the primaries this year, mcconnell has very little incentive to keep giving him any cover. if not... our long national nightmare is far from over.

449	2	"""huh, well that's not terribly reassuring."" the words ""very special episode"" echoed in your mind as your first waking thought, much as every other day for as long as you could remember. a title for the day to come ahead, as it were. sometimes these titles gave valuable insight in to things you might want to try and avoid or seek out, but sometimes they were about as helpful as an anti-vaxxer in a pandemic. titles often repeated, *not very imaginative are we mister life narrator?* you'd often thought to yourself, but then written it down in your journal and carried on with your day. actually, repeated titles were the norm at this point, after 29 years on this planet with a title a day for your entire life originality was non-existent. today though? today was new. new was exciting. new was scary. new needed an extra shot of espresso in your first cup of coffee of the day. february 14th, the calendar on your phone said. oh yeah, valentine's day. maybe you'd finally find that special someone who might last longer than a second date? someone who didn't just want you to pay for their dinner while they went to 'powder their nose' all too literally several times through the course of a meal out in a fancy restaurant. maybe it was the opposite. maybe you'd realise that you'd be forever alone, or eat the best burrito of your life, or join that trashy looking mid-20s woman in doing the fattest line of cocaine of your life and turning your whole existence to shit by crashing your car into a police station. who knows? you'd decided that uninformative titles were bullshit years ago, and today was unlikely to change that mindset. it was monday anyway, and due to the vagaries of your job's working hours today was the end of a rare long weekend for you. yesterday had been a hangover day, sat eating chips rewatching a series you'd seen about fifteen times on netflix, regretting, as usual, your impulse to drink away a day that had started with a title that summed up your life in one simple phrase. saturday's title had been ""a surprise at the club."" sunday's title had been ""time to go back to the std clinic!"", which really summed up just how badly saturday had gone, and just how unhelpful these ""titles"" could really be for your life. surprise indeed. today was a new day though, and it couldn't really be much worse than the last two, so with a renewed spring in your step and caffeine slowly clearing some of the fogginess away, you set out to get some breakfast from your favourite local delicatessen. ""huh, closed. maybe bob has a date or something. rather him than me if my love life's anything to go by."" it looked like the options were either mcdonalds, subway, or maybe that new sandwich shop just down the road that'd opened recently. as you were walking along the eerily quiet sidewalk, you couldn't help but feel like you were missing or forgetting something. even if the titles were a bit cryptic at times, and you were absolutely sure that no one else experienced them, they usually gave you *some* direction. you tried to think back over the last few days, had anything unusual stood out? sadly the cocaine wasn't that unusual, or any of the hookers. it was a sad existence living your life by an arbitrary title that your probably-a-mental-illness was creating for you every day. nothing jumped out at you until you thought about that morning. yeah, a strong coffee was always great, but it wasn't your alarm that woke you up was it? it was a day off so you hadn't set one but you were sure something had woken you up. something tickling at the edge of your mind, something important. the street was still quite empty. completely empty actually. how long had you been stuck in your thoughts? *huh, the new place is closed too, what's going on?* then a title popped up. wait, what? titles only appeared at the start of the day, never midway through. you were that distracted you could have missed it, but you never missed titles, they were too important. *bang* oh yeah. that was what had woken you up this morning, a gunshot. second title of the day: ""what are you missing? try again"" ##### ""huh, well that's not terribly reassuring."" the words ""very special episode"" echoed in your mind as your first waking thought"

391	2	jews followed a few traditions that in effect were more hygienic than their gentile neighbors... for one, quarantining the sick/ unwell has been a jewish tradition extending even to menstruating women being confined to shacks even in old testament times. ritual bathing traditions meant jews would bathe far more on average than their gentile neighbors. in the era shortly before the plague, many catholic societies started believing that cats were evil pests that report directly to the man downstairs, and many were killed on sight/ for sport... which the local rodent populations and the plague carrying fleas that came with them greatly appreciated.. meanwhile, the jews were still cool with cats, to the dismay of rodents and their parasites. furthermore, medieval anti-semitic prejudices often led to jews being forcibly segregated away from gentile communities, leading to a reduction of their risk of transmission since they lived in separate communities removed from the hot-zones of plague transmission. of course, when gentiles saw everyone around them but the jews dying in the thousands, they quickly wised up and worked with the jews to figure out ways to help them reduce plague in their own communities.... lmao! just kidding... they blamed the jews for the plague itself and massacred them by the thousands!

924	1	"hi! i used to work with kids like yours. it's rough as fuck. there's no ""good"" way out of where you're at because you're already - more importantly *he's* already - way in over his head. so everything is going to feel like shit for everyone, but a key point to take away is this: he can't learn to make good decisions if he's not being provided with *useful* feedback. what makes feedback useful is basically three things: immediate, unambiguous, and brief. this feedback loop is actually exactly what makes video games so satisfying. they've been designed to make the gap between mistake and consequ short, clear, and let you redo. contrast that with what just played out with the chores: the feedback (consequence) was delayed (the week was already over), unambiguous, and permanent. you're going to need buy in from him, but that's only going to come by leaning on your relationship which sounds like it isn't doing so hot right now. he needs to really feel like you're on his side. that's going to take time reinvesting in that relationship. or, you can also quite fairly say that you've done enough. that he's nearly an adult and will reap what he sows. at a certain point, this has to be the next step, and where that point is can only be up to you"

997	1	i'm looking at the way back machine around the election for his website and see nothing of the sort. i'd be interested in seeing a specific date for such an easily provable claim. i see the same thing every click > we are the nation that built the hoover dam and the transcontinental railroad. landed a man on the moon. cured polio. built the internet. sequenced the human genome. and we will be the nation to end cancer as we know it. > this is the history of the journey of this country: it's one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. i believe that as much today as i did when i got elected to the united states senate as a 29-year-old kid. but we have to remember who we are. at our best, america has always thought big. that's why the negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics today drives me crazy. we're better than this. > it's time to reach deep into the soul of this country and once again give everyone and i mean everyone the opportunity to achieve the impossible. it's time to look beyond 24-hour news cycles and 140-character arguments. it's time to treat each other with dignity and respect. not as opponents, but as fellow americans. because that's what we are. > this is a time for big dreams and american possibilities. if that's what you believe and you're ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit then i'm asking you to join me today.

""thanks for having me amanda."" ""dr. stewart, could you tell us how this could have possibly happened?"" ""well i have a couple of working theories. the first is that this man was born the old way. what this means is that this individuals parents could have had sexual relations in an attempt to have a human child, leaving his entire personality, physicality, and everything else in between up to chance."" ""i didn't even know that was an option."" ""yes, well, most don't. people in the field have thought that we evolved beyond that primitive need a long time ago. my second, and quite frankly more likely theory, is simply that whoever chose this man's genes accidently chose one that was more prone to twitching, or tripping, or not paying attention to his surroundings than they should have. it's hard to say exactly which one it could be is before a report comes out."" ""well this is unsettling news, to say the least. i never dreamed i'd have to report on something like this."" ""well i wouldn't worry too much about this amanda, we do have procedure in place to handle this sort of thing."" ""i think i know what you're talking about, but could you remind me in case our audience is unaware."" ""certainly. obviously, this man is a danger in our world. today, a glass of spilt milk, but what tomorrow? bumping into his neighbor? not noticing a little girl out on the street while he's driving? in order to prevent this, we seclude people like him off from the rest of the world to ensure that he can't be a danger to anyone. then, we get our best geneticists on the job to see which part of his dna cause this malfunction, and we ensure it's never used in another living organism again. it's a bit of a barbaric practice, i must admit, but it's the best solution we have for the time being."" ""well it looks like we're running out of time for this segment, but it's been great having you on today dr. stewart."" ""thank you for having me, it's been a pleasure.""
