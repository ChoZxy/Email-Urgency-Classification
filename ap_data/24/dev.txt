802	4	Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
793	2	The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
859	1	Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
612	3	Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
47	1	She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
883	4	Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
284	2	Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
469	3	Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
977	1	Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
660	3	YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
578	4	Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
303	2	Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
828	2	One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
274	3	Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
84	2	They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
580	1	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
230	1	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
805	2	That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
585	2	You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
714	3	Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
740	1	We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
911	2	No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
118	3	First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
350	4	Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
719	1	Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
151	4	No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
390	2	But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
75	1	Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
417	2	Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
41	3	Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
725	3	And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!
685	3	I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
801	1	Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
594	1	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
669	4	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
501	2	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
619	2	I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
657	1	Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
299	4	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
766	1	I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
349	2	Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
347	2	You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
377	1	I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
779	2	That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
741	3	You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
810	2	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
923	1	Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
275	3	No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
960	2	Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
899	1	I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
171	2	I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
174	1	Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
137	3	What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
87	1	Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
42	2	Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
67	3	Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
241	2	I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
546	2	Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
969	2	Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
548	2	Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
784	1	No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
561	2	Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
987	2	You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
99	2	I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
971	1	Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
219	3	They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
440	4	You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
348	3	No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
139	3	Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
577	4	This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
336	1	Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
941	3	That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
161	2	But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
749	3	Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
289	3	Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
412	1	Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
627	2	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
334	2	Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
891	2	I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
909	3	That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
824	2	Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
926	3	What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
979	1	Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
682	2	I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
107	2	Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
505	4	Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
199	1	Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
967	4	Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
978	2	Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
588	1	London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
832	3	Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
102	2	A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
356	3	Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
206	2	Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
388	3	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
704	2	Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
522	2	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
638	2	Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
176	2	I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
472	3	Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
827	3	Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
223	3	I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
605	1	Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
39	3	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
833	3	Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
9	3	I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
134	3	Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
259	2	I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
579	1	Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message.
935	3	Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
163	1	Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
770	3	My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
318	3	I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
79	1	And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
834	2	He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
314	1	Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
49	3	We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
218	2	Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
129	2	Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
306	1	Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
61	3	Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
921	2	Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
647	4	Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
846	2	Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
329	1	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
590	2	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
692	3	You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
405	2	Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
963	1	Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
665	3	You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
537	2	About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
229	4	You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
462	3	Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
529	1	It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
712	3	Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
646	2	Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
226	2	The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
558	3	No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
831	1	Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
695	3	That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
519	3	If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
722	4	Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
972	3	You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
165	1	Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
737	2	I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
37	3	Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
150	2	Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
407	2	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
19	1	Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
231	4	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
22	1	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
443	3	What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
621	2	And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
985	1	All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
523	3	Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
748	1	He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
260	1	Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
112	2	You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
265	4	You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
193	4	Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
432	2	Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
352	2	What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
396	3	Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
320	3	God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
25	1	It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
117	3	Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
486	2	We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
509	1	Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
330	1	His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
892	2	You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
466	1	Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
302	2	Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
920	3	Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
664	1	Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
280	3	Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
673	4	You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
862	3	No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
950	2	Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
800	3	Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
164	4	The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
172	2	Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
72	2	Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
298	2	They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
851	3	Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
190	2	I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
640	3	Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
113	1	You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
847	1	Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
256	1	Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
288	3	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
774	3	What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
773	1	We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
15	1	Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
464	1	Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
18	2	Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
86	3	A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
73	1	Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
690	2	I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
34	2	Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
994	1	Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
