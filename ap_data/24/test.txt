565	3	... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
94	1	I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
186	4	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
599	1	Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
564	3	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
182	2	Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
651	2	The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
236	2	Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
29	2	The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
615	2	Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
470	4	Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
340	1	414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
628	4	A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
806	1	They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
639	1	Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
554	2	She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
552	3	I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
2	3	Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
355	3	What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
897	2	It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
366	4	And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
497	3	You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
424	3	A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
517	2	Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
857	2	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
568	1	Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
584	2	Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
374	3	That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
493	1	I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
58	1	Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
437	3	Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
211	1	My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
575	2	Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
797	1	Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
532	3	He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
133	1	All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
829	3	Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
525	3	What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
759	3	Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
803	2	I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
393	4	I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
6	3	Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
747	3	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
624	3	Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
855	1	I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
676	4	Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
276	1	Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
938	4	Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
362	3	WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
592	1	That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
353	2	Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
527	2	No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
415	2	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
238	3	He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
893	1	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
553	4	Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
205	4	Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
790	3	He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
13	2	Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
233	1	Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
515	2	Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
173	2	Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
175	1	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
663	3	You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
404	3	I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
593	1	My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
608	1	Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
630	1	I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
869	3	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
721	2	I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
316	1	You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
45	3	You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
481	3	I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
31	4	Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
751	3	You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
502	4	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
380	3	I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
906	3	I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
861	2	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
534	1	Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
168	2	Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
798	2	Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
111	1	I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
521	3	No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
680	2	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
450	1	All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
89	4	Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
384	2	That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
756	2	Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
691	2	Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
795	1	Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
720	1	He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
562	2	Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
376	2	Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
178	2	Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
681	1	Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
425	1	Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
414	2	Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
817	4	Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
762	3	... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
249	3	This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!
492	1	Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
36	1	So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
874	2	According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
604	4	Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
403	1	The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
518	2	We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
867	2	Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
512	2	If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
904	2	Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
602	1	I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
291	4	I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
311	2	We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
195	2	All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
687	3	Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
850	4	I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
520	1	Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
953	1	There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
513	3	How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
729	1	You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
970	4	Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
918	1	You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
341	2	Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
761	2	Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
124	3	Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
304	3	It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
881	4	Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
742	2	Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
645	1	Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
191	2	All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
103	2	English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
658	2	OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
570	4	Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
858	1	Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
427	2	He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
962	2	Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
297	3	I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
471	3	All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
991	3	Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
225	3	Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
694	4	Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
237	2	Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
354	4	Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
239	3	Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
567	2	Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
992	2	Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
449	2	You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
996	2	Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
228	2	Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
541	2	Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
982	3	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
744	2	How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
433	1	We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
222	1	Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
703	3	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
391	3	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
903	2	Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
10	1	Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
555	3	<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
666	4	Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
27	2	The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
23	1	Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
32	4	Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
326	2	People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
924	2	I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
105	1	Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
606	4	Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
235	2	A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
997	4	You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
739	2	He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
273	3	Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
457	2	Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
713	1	Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
3	3	I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
786	2	I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
781	4	Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
623	2	Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
444	1	Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
400	3	YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
856	1	First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
915	3	It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
30	1	Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
500	3	I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
97	3	She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
215	1	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
808	1	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
389	1	I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
668	4	Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
484	2	Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
461	2	You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
780	1	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
508	1	It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
121	3	The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
262	1	Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
65	2	WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
783	2	I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
822	2	Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
868	2	My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
583	1	I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
138	3	The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
