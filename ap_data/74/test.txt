45921.2	B-Exposition	"With his father dead and his stepmother remarrying a man he detests, Max runs away from home, taking his uncle's astrogation manuals."
45921.3	I-Exposition	"Most occupations are tightly controlled by guilds, most with hereditary memberships."
45921.4	I-Exposition	One such is the Astrogators Guild.
45921.5	I-Exposition	"Since his uncle had been a member and had no children, Max hopes that before he died, his uncle had named him his heir."
45921.6	B-Inciting Incident	He begins hitchhiking towards Earthport to find out.
45921.7	B-Inciting Incident	"Along the way, he finds a friendly face in hobo Sam Anderson, who later alludes to being a deserter from the Imperial Marines."
45921.8	B-Inciting Incident	"Sam feeds Max and offers advice, though he later departs with Max's valuable manuals."
45921.9	B-Inciting Incident	"At the guild's headquarters, Max is disappointed to find that he had not been named as an heir, but he is returned his uncle's substantial security deposit for his manuals."
45921.10	I-Inciting Incident	Max learns that Sam had tried to claim the deposit for himself.
45921.11	B-Inciting Incident	"By chance, he runs into an apologetic Sam."
45921.12	B-Rising Action	"With Max's money, Sam is able to finagle them a one way job/trip aboard a starship using forged papers."
45921.13	B-Rising Action	"Max signs on as a steward's mate third class, and then he absorbs the contents of the Stewards' Guild manual using his eidetic memory."
45921.14	I-Rising Action	"Among his duties is caring for several animals, including passengers' petsâ€”work with which he is comfortable."
45921.15	B-Rising Action	"When passenger Eldreth ""Ellie"" Coburn visits her pet, an alien, semi-intelligent ""spider puppy"" that Max has befriended, she learns that he can play three-dimensional chess, and she challenges him to a game."
45921.16	I-Rising Action	"A champion player, she diplomatically lets him win."
45921.17	B-Rising Action	"Meanwhile, Sam manages to rise to the position of master-at-arms."
45921.18	B-Rising Action	"When, through Ellie's machinations, the ship's officers discover that Max had learned astrogation from his uncle, Max is promoted to the command deck."
45921.19	B-Rising Action	"Under the tutelage of Chief Astrogator Hendrix and Chief Computerman Kelly, he becomes a probationary apprentice chartsman, then a probationary astrogator."
45921.20	B-Rising Action	"In a meeting with Hendrix, Max reluctantly admits to faking his record to get into space."
45921.21	I-Rising Action	Hendrix defers the matter until their return to Earth.
45921.22	B-Rising Action	"The Asgard then departs for Halcyon, a human colony planet orbiting Nu Pegasi."
45921.23	B-Climax	"When Hendrix dies, the astrogation department is left dangerously shorthanded."
45921.24	B-Climax	"The aging captain tries to take his place, but is not up to the task."
45921.25	B-Climax	"When Max detects an error in his real-time calculations leading up to a ""transition"", neither the captain nor Assistant Astrogator Simes believe him, and the ship winds up lost."
45921.26	B-Falling Action	"They locate a habitable world, and the passengers become colonists."
45921.27	B-Falling Action	"Meanwhile, the crew continues to try to figure out where they are, and if they can get back to the Earth."
45921.28	I-Falling Action	"Unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by intelligent centaurs."
45921.29	B-Falling Action	"Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is able to guide Sam and a rescue party to them."
45921.30	B-Falling Action	"They escape, though Sam is killed covering their retreat."
45921.31	B-Falling Action	"Upon his return, Max is informed that the captain has died."
45921.32	I-Falling Action	"Simes tried to illegally take command and was killed by Sam, leaving Max as the only remaining astrogator."
45921.33	I-Falling Action	"To make matters worse, Simes hid or destroyed the astrogation manuals."
45921.34	B-Falling Action	"Vastly outnumbered by the hostile natives, the humans are forced to attempt a perilous return to known space by reversing the erroneous transition."
45921.35	I-Falling Action	"Max must not only pilot the ship, he must supply the missing astrogation tables from his eidetic memory."
45921.36	I-Falling Action	"To add to his burdens, the remaining officers inform Max that he must take charge, as only an astrogator can be the captain."
45921.37	B-Falling Action	"The pressure is immense, but Max succeeds and the ship returns to known space."
45921.38	B-Resolution	"Max pays heavy fines for breaking guild regulations, but he becomes a member of the Astrogators Guild."
45921.39	I-Resolution	"However, he loses any chance for a relationship with Eldreth: she returns home to marry her boyfriend."
45921.40	I-Resolution	"Max accepts this with mixed feelings, but looks forward to his new career."

226080.1	B-Exposition	Charlemagne's army is fighting the Muslims in Spain.
226080.2	I-Exposition	"The last city standing is Saragossa, held by the Muslim king Marsilla."
226080.3	B-Inciting Incident	"Terrified of the might of Charlemagne's army of Franks, Marsilla sends out messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsilla's conversion to Christianity if the Franks will go back to France."
226080.4	I-Inciting Incident	Charlemagne and his men are tired of fighting and decide to accept this peace offer.
226080.5	B-Rising Action	They need now to select a messenger to go back to Marsilla's court.
226080.6	B-Rising Action	The bold warrior Roland nominates his stepfather Ganelon.
226080.7	I-Rising Action	Ganelon is enraged; he fears that he'll die in the hands of the bloodthirsty pagans and suspects that this is just Roland's intent.
226080.8	I-Rising Action	"He has long hated and envied his stepson, and, riding back to Saragossa with the Saracen messengers, he finds an opportunity for revenge."
226080.9	I-Rising Action	"He tells the Saracens how they could ambush the rear guard of Charlemagne's army, which will surely be led by Roland as the Franks pick their way back to Spain through the mountain passes, and helps the Saracens plan their attack."
226080.10	B-Rising Action	"Just as the traitor Ganelon predicted, Roland gallantly volunteers to lead the rear guard."
226080.11	B-Rising Action	The wise and moderate Oliver and the fierce Archbishop Turpin are among the men Roland picks to join him.
226080.12	B-Rising Action	"Pagans ambush them at Roncesvalles, according to plan; the Christians are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers."
226080.13	B-Rising Action	"Seeing how badly outnumbered they are, Olivier asks Roland to blow on his olifant, his horn made out of an elephant tusk, to call for help from the main body of the Frankish army."
226080.14	B-Rising Action	"Roland proudly refuses to do so, claiming that they need no help, that the rear guard can easily take on the pagan hordes."
226080.15	B-Rising Action	"While the Franks fight magnificently, there's no way they can continue to hold off against the Saracens, and the battle begins to turn clearly against them."
226080.16	I-Rising Action	"Almost all his men are dead and Roland knows that it's now too late for Charlemagne and his troops to save them, but he blows his oliphant anyway, so that the emperor can see what happened to his men and avenge them."
226080.17	B-Climax	Roland blows so hard that his temples burst.
226080.18	I-Climax	"He dies a glorious martyr's death, and saints take his soul straight to Paradise."
226080.19	B-Falling Action	"When Charlemagne and his men reach the battlefield, they find only dead bodies."
226080.20	I-Falling Action	"The pagans have fled, but the Franks pursue them, chasing them into the river Ebro, where they all drown."
226080.21	B-Falling Action	"Meanwhile, the powerful emir of Babylon, Baligant, has arrived in Spain to help his vassal Marsilla fend off the Frankish threat."
226080.22	I-Falling Action	"Baligant and his enormous Muslim army ride after Charlemagne and his Christian army, meeting them on the battlefield at Roncesvalles, where the Christians are burying and mourning their dead."
226080.23	I-Falling Action	Both sides fight valiantly.
226080.24	B-Falling Action	"But when Charlemagne kills Baligant, all the pagan army scatter and flee."
226080.25	B-Falling Action	Now Saragossa has no defenders left; the Franks take the city.
226080.26	I-Falling Action	"With Marsilla's wife Bramimonde, Charlemagne and his men ride back to Aix, their capital in France."
226080.27	B-Falling Action	The Franks discovered Ganelon's betrayal some time ago and keep him in chains until it is time for his trial.
226080.28	I-Falling Action	"Ganelon argues that his action was legitimate revenge, openly proclaimed, not treason."
226080.29	B-Falling Action	"While the council of barons which Charlemagne has assembled to decide the traitor's fate is initially swayed by this claim, one man, Thierry, argues that, because Roland was serving Charlemagne when Ganelon delivered his revenge on him, Ganelon's action constitutes a betrayal of the emperor."
226080.30	B-Resolution	Ganelon's friend Pinabel challenges Thierry to trial by combat; the two will fight a duel to see who's right.
226080.31	I-Resolution	"By divine intervention, Thierry, the weaker man, wins, killing Pinabel."
226080.32	B-Resolution	The Franks are convinced by this of Ganelon's villainy and sentence him to a most painful death.
226080.33	I-Resolution	The traitor is torn limb from limb by galloping horses and thirty of his relatives are hung for good measure.

184843.1	B-Exposition	" The play begins with the funeral of Henry V, who has died unexpectedly in his prime."
184843.2	B-Exposition	"As his brothers, the Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, and his uncle, the Duke of Exeter, lament his passing and express doubt as to whether his son (the as yet uncrowned heir apparent Henry VI) is capable of running the country in such tumultuous times, word arrives of military setbacks in France."
184843.3	B-Exposition	"A rebellion, led by the Dauphin Charles, is gaining momentum, and several major towns have already been lost."
184843.4	B-Inciting Incident	"Additionally, Lord Talbot, Constable of France, has been captured."
184843.5	B-Inciting Incident	"Realising a critical time is at hand, Bedford immediately prepares himself to head to France and take command of the army, Gloucester remains in charge in England, and Exeter sets out to prepare young Henry for his forthcoming coronation."
184843.6	B-Rising Action	"Meanwhile, in OrlÃ©ans, the English army are laying siege to Charles' forces."
184843.7	B-Rising Action	"Inside the city, the Bastard of OrlÃ©ans approaches Charles and tells him of a young woman who claims to have seen visions and knows how to defeat the English."
184843.8	B-Rising Action	"Charles summons the woman, Joan la Pucelle, (i.e."
184843.9	B-Rising Action	Joan of Arc).
184843.10	I-Rising Action	"To test her resolve, he challenges her to single combat."
184843.11	I-Rising Action	"Upon her victory, he immediately places her in command of the army."
184843.12	B-Rising Action	"Outside the city, the newly arrived Bedford negotiates the release of Talbot, but immediately, Joan launches an attack."
184843.13	I-Rising Action	"The French forces win, forcing the English back, but Talbot and Bedford engineer a sneak attack on the city, and gain a foothold within the walls, causing the French leaders to flee."
184843.14	B-Rising Action	"Back in England, a petty quarrel between Richard Plantagenet and the Duke of Somerset has expanded to involve the whole court."
184843.15	I-Rising Action	"Richard and Somerset ask their fellow nobles to pledge allegiance to one of them, and as such the lords select either red or white roses to indicate which side they are on."
184843.16	B-Rising Action	"Richard then goes to see his uncle, Edmund Mortimer, imprisoned in the Tower of London."
184843.17	B-Climax	"Mortimer tells Richard the history of their family's conflict with the king's familyâ€”how they helped Henry Bolingbroke seize power from Richard II, but were then shoved into the background; and how Henry V had Richard's father (Richard of Conisburgh) executed and his family stripped of all its lands and monies."
184843.18	I-Climax	"Mortimer also tells Richard that he himself is the rightful heir to the throne, and that when he dies, Richard will be the true heir, not Henry."
184843.19	B-Falling Action	"Amazed at these revelations, Richard determines to attain his birthright, and vows to have his family's dukedom restored."
184843.20	B-Falling Action	"After Mortimer dies, Richard presents his petition to the recently crowned Henry, who agrees to reinstate the Plantagenet's title, making Richard 3rd Duke of York."
184843.21	I-Falling Action	"Henry then leaves for France, accompanied by Gloucester, Exeter, Winchester, Richard and Somerset."
184843.22	B-Falling Action	"In France, within a matter of hours, the French retake and then lose the city of Rouen."
184843.23	B-Resolution	"After the battle, Bedford dies, and Talbot assumes direct command of the army."
184843.24	I-Resolution	"The Dauphin is horrified at the loss of Rouen, but Joan tells him not to worry."
184843.25	B-Resolution	"She then persuades the powerful Duke of Burgundy, who had been fighting for the English, to switch sides, and join the French."
184843.26	B-Resolution	"Meanwhile, Henry arrives in Paris and upon learning of Burgundy's betrayal, he sends Talbot to speak with him."
184843.27	I-Resolution	"Henry then pleads for Richard and Somerset to put aside their conflict, and, unaware of the implications of his actions, he chooses a red rose, symbolically aligning himself with Somerset and alienating Richard."
184843.28	I-Resolution	"Prior to returning to England, in an effort to secure peace between Somerset and Richard, Henry places Richard in command of the infantry and Somerset in command of the cavalry."
184843.29	B-Resolution	"Meanwhile, Talbot approaches Bordeaux, but the French army swing around and trap him."
184843.30	I-Resolution	"Talbot sends word for reinforcements, but the conflict between Richard and Somerset leads them to second guess one another, and neither of them send any, both blaming the other for the mix-up."
184843.31	B-Resolution	"The English army are subsequently destroyed, and both Talbot and his son are killed."
184843.32	B-Resolution	"After the battle, Joan's visions desert her, and she is captured by Richard, and burned at the stake."
184843.33	B-Resolution	"At the same time, urged on by Pope Eugenius IV and the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund, Henry sues for peace."
184843.34	I-Resolution	"The French listen to the English terms, under which Charles is to be a viceroy to Henry, reluctantly agreeing, but only with the intention of breaking their oath at a later date and expelling the English from France."
184843.35	B-Resolution	"Meanwhile, the Earl of Suffolk has captured a young French princess, Margaret of Anjou, who he intends to marry to Henry and dominate the king through her."
184843.36	B-Resolution	"Travelling back to England, he attempts to persuade Henry to marry Margaret."
184843.37	I-Resolution	"Gloucester advises Henry against the marriage, as Margaret's family are not rich, and the marriage is not advantageous to his position as king, but Henry is taken in by Suffolk's description of Margaret's beauty, and he agrees to the proposal."
184843.38	B-Resolution	Suffolk then heads back to France to bring Margaret to England as Gloucester worryingly ponders what the future may hold.

178842.1	B-Exposition	Milo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time.
178842.2	B-Inciting Incident	"He arrives home from school one day to find in his bedroom a mysterious package that contains a miniature tollbooth and a map of ""the Lands Beyond""."
178842.3	B-Rising Action	"Attached is a note, ""FOR MILO, WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME""."
178842.4	I-Rising Action	"He assembles the tollbooth, takes the map, drives through the tollbooth in his toy car, and instantly finds himself on a road to Expectations."
178842.5	I-Rising Action	"He pays no attention to his route and soon becomes lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where thinking and laughing are not allowed."
178842.6	B-Rising Action	"However, he is found there and rescued by Tock, a ""watchdog"" with an alarm clock attached to him, who joins him on his journey."
178842.7	I-Rising Action	"Their first stop is Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the Kingdom of Wisdom."
178842.8	B-Rising Action	"They visit the word marketplace, where all the world's words and letters are bought and sold."
178842.9	B-Rising Action	"After an altercation between the Spelling Bee and the blustering Humbug, Milo, and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift."
178842.10	B-Rising Action	"In prison, Milo learns the history of Wisdom."
178842.11	B-Rising Action	"Its two rulers, King Azaz the Unabridged and the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, who had settled all disputes in the kingdom."
178842.12	I-Rising Action	Everyone lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that letters and numbers were equally important.
178842.13	B-Rising Action	"They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the kingdom has been plagued with discord and disharmony."
178842.14	I-Rising Action	"Milo and Tock leave the dungeon and attend a banquet given by King Azaz, where the guests literally eat their words."
178842.15	B-Climax	King Azaz allows Milo and the Humbug to talk themselves into a quest to rescue the princesses.
178842.16	B-Climax	"Azaz appoints the Humbug as a guide, and he, Milo, and Tock set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis to obtain his approval for their quest."
178842.17	B-Falling Action	"Along the way they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy who sees through things and grows until he reaches the ground, and have adventures like watching Chroma the Great conduct his orchestra in playing the colors of the sunset."
178842.18	I-Falling Action	"In Digitopolis, their first stop is the mine where numbers are dug out and precious stones are thrown away."
178842.19	I-Falling Action	"They eat subtraction stew, which makes the diner hungrier."
178842.20	I-Falling Action	"The Mathemagician erases the mine with his magic pencil eraser, he and Milo discuss Infinity, and Milo proves to the Mathemagician that he must allow them to rescue the princesses."
178842.21	B-Falling Action	"In the Mountains of Ignorance, the three intrepid journeyers contend with lurking, obstructionist demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Senses Taker."
178842.22	B-Falling Action	"After overcoming various obstacles and their own fears, the questers reach the Castle in the Air."
178842.23	B-Falling Action	The two princesses welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom.
178842.24	B-Falling Action	"When the group leaves, Tock carries them through the sky because, after all, time flies."
178842.25	I-Falling Action	"The demons chase them, but the armies of Wisdom repel them."
178842.26	B-Resolution	"The armies of Wisdom welcome the princesses home, King Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day carnival celebration of the return of Rhyme and Reason, the princesses of the land."
178842.27	I-Resolution	"Milo says goodbye and drives off, feeling he has been away several weeks."
178842.28	I-Resolution	Ahead in the road he spots the tollbooth and drives through.
178842.29	I-Resolution	"Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour."
178842.30	B-Resolution	"He awakens the next day full of plans to return to Wisdom, but when he returns from school the tollbooth has vanished."
178842.31	I-Resolution	"A new note has arrived, which reads, ""FOR MILO, WHO NOW KNOWS THE WAY."""
178842.32	I-Resolution	Milo is somewhat disappointed but looks around and finds that the world he lives in is beautiful and interesting.

184847.3	B-Inciting Incident	"Upon reaching the parliamentary chambers in London, York seats himself in the throne, and a confrontation ensues between his supporters and those of Henry."
184847.4	B-Inciting Incident	"Threatened with violence by Warwick, who has brought part of his army with him, Henry brokers a deal with York whereby Henry will remain king until his death, at which time the throne will permanently pass to the House of York and its descendants thereafter."
184847.5	B-Rising Action	"Disgusted at this decision, as it disinherits Henry's son, Prince Edward, Henry's supporters, led by his wife, Margaret, abandon him, and Margaret declares war on the Yorkists, supported by Clifford, who is determined to exact revenge for the death of his father at the hands of York during the battle at St Albans."
184847.6	I-Rising Action	Margaret attacks York's castle at Wakefield and the Yorkists lose the ensuing battle.
184847.7	B-Rising Action	"During the conflict, Clifford murders York's twelve-year old son, Rutland."
184847.8	B-Rising Action	"Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; forcing him to stand on a molehill, they give him a handkerchief covered with Rutland's blood to wipe his brow and place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death."
184847.9	B-Rising Action	"After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York's death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret's at the Second Battle of St Albans, and Henry has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his deal with York."
184847.10	B-Rising Action	"However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward's brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged to do so by his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy."
184847.11	B-Rising Action	"Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague."
184847.12	B-Rising Action	"The Yorkists regroup, and at the Battle of Towton, Clifford is killed and the Yorkists romp to victory."
184847.13	B-Rising Action	"Following the battle, Edward is proclaimed king, George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, although he complains to Edward that this is an ominous dukedom."
184847.14	I-Rising Action	"Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his own machinations to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although, as of yet, he is unsure how exactly he might go about it."
184847.15	B-Rising Action	"After Towton, Warwick heads to France to secure for Edward the hand of Louis XI's sister-in-law, Lady Bona, thus ensuring peace between the two nations by uniting in marriage their two monarchies."
184847.16	B-Rising Action	"In France, Warwick arrives at court to find that Margaret, Prince Edward and the Earl of Oxford have come to Louis to seek his aid in the conflict in England."
184847.17	I-Rising Action	"Just as Louis is about to acquiesce and supply Margaret with troops, Warwick intervenes, and convinces Louis that it would be in his own best interests to support Edward and approve the marriage."
184847.18	B-Rising Action	"Back in England, however, the recently widowed Lady Grey (Elizabeth Woodville) has come to King Edward requesting her late husband's lands be returned to her."
184847.19	B-Climax	"Rather than granting her suit however, Edward marries her, against the advice of both George and Richard, driven by lust, and taken by her stunning beauty."
184847.20	B-Falling Action	"Upon hearing of this, and feeling he has been made to look a fool despite all his service to the House of York, Warwick denounces Edward, and switches allegiances to the Lancastrians, promising his daughter's hand in marriage to Prince Edward as a sign of his loyalty to their cause."
184847.21	B-Falling Action	"Shortly thereafter, George and Montague also defect from Edward's side, joining Warwick and the Lancastrians."
184847.22	I-Falling Action	"Warwick then leads an invasion of French troops into England, and Edward is taken prisoner."
184847.23	B-Falling Action	Henry is restored to the throne and appoints Warwick and George as his Lord Protectors.
184847.24	B-Falling Action	"Soon thereafter, however, Edward is rescued by Richard, Hastings and Stanley."
184847.25	B-Falling Action	"News of the escape reaches Henry's court, and the young Earl of Richmond is shipped into exile in France for safety."
184847.26	I-Falling Action	"Richmond is a descendant of John of Gaunt, uncle of Richard II and son of Edward III, and therefore a potential Lancastrian heir, should anything happen to Henry and the Prince, hence the need to protect him."
184847.27	B-Falling Action	"Meanwhile, Edward reorganises his forces and confronts Warwick's army."
184847.28	B-Falling Action	"At the Battle of Barnet, George betrays Warwick, and rejoins the Yorkists."
184847.29	I-Falling Action	"This throws Warwick's forces into disarray, and the Yorkists win the battle, during which both Warwick and Montague are killed."
184847.30	B-Falling Action	"Oxford and the Duke of Somerset now assume command of the Lancastrian forces, and they join with a second battalion newly arrived from France, led by Margaret and Prince Edward."

184847.32	I-Falling Action	"He is met by a father that has killed his son, and a son that has killed his father, representing the horrors of the civil war."
184847.33	I-Falling Action	"Henry is captured by two gamekeepers loyal to Edward, and imprisoned in the Tower of London, whilst Edward heads to meet the Lancastrian/French force."

184847.40	I-Resolution	"He is unaware, however, of Richard's scheming and his desire for power at any cost."

28230.1	B-Exposition	" On Novinha's request for a Speaker, Andrew Wiggin leaves for Lusitania, a colony turned into a virtual prison, with its expansion severely limited and its whole existence devoted to the work of xenologers who study the Pequeninos, the first sentient beings found since the destruction of Formics."
28230.2	I-Exposition	"Lusitania itself is remarkably lacking in biodiversity, featuring thousands of unfilled ecological niches."
28230.3	B-Exposition	"The other outstanding feature of Lusitania is the Descolada, a native virus which almost wipes out the colony, until husband-and-wife biologists Gusta and Cida succeed in developing counters."
28230.4	I-Exposition	"Unfortunately, they didn't find the cure soon enough to save themselves, leaving orphaned daughter Novinha to strike out for herself."
28230.5	B-Exposition	"At the age of thirteen, Novinha, a cold and distant girl, successfully petitions to be made the official biologist of the colony (roughly the equivalent of a master's degree); from then on, she contributes to the work of father-and-son xenologers (alien anthropology) Pipo and Libo, and for a short time there is family and camaraderie."
28230.6	B-Inciting Incident	"One day, however, she makes a discovery about the descoladaâ€”that it's in every native lifeformâ€”and Pipo rushes out to talk to the piggies about the discovery without telling her or Libo why it's important."
28230.7	B-Inciting Incident	"They can't figure it out on their own, and never learnâ€”a few hours later, Pipo is found vivisected in the grass; his corpse does not even have the benefit of a tree (The symbol of honor placed among all dead piggies)."
28230.8	B-Inciting Incident	"Novinha erases all the lab work, but cannot delete the information itself due to regulations; Libo demands to see it, but even their love for each other will not make her let him see itâ€”it appears to be a secret the piggies will kill to keep."
28230.9	I-Inciting Incident	"Now Novinha is determined to ensure they never marry, the way they always planned to: for if they do, Libo will have access to those locked files and, Novinha fears, will share the same fate as his father."
28230.10	B-Rising Action	"In anguish, Novinha calls for a Speaker for the Dead, hoping beyond hope that perhaps the original Speaker may arrive, to make sense of Pipo's deathâ€”and maybe of her life."
28230.11	B-Rising Action	Andrew Wiggin doesn't dare let himself be known as Ender anymore; the name is now an Epithet.
28230.12	I-Rising Action	Ender decides to leave his sister Valentine behind (she is married and pregnant) after traveling with her for many years.
28230.13	B-Rising Action	"He leaves as soon as possible, with his only companion being Jane, an artificial sentience existing within the ansible computer network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances."
28230.14	B-Rising Action	"He arrives on Lusitania after twenty-two years in transit (only around two weeks to him) to discover that Novinha has canceled her call, or rather tried to, as a call for a speaker cannot legally be canceled after the speaker has begun the journey."
28230.15	I-Rising Action	"However, two others have called, making Ender's trip not entirely in vain: they are Novinha's eldest son Miro, calling for someone to speak the death of Libo, who was killed the same way his father was; and Novinha's eldest daughter Ela, calling for someone to speak the death of Novinha's husband Marcos Ribeira, who died not six weeks ago from a terminal disease."
28230.16	B-Rising Action	"Besides attempting to unravel the question of why Novinha married MarcÃ£o when she really loved Libo (MarcÃ£o was sterile, and a quick genetic scan on Jane's part reveals that Novinha's children are all, in fact, Libo's), Ender also takes responsibility for attempting to heal the Ribeira family, and manages to adopt (or perhaps is adopted by) most of the children within their first meeting."
28230.17	B-Rising Action	"He also takes a strong interest in the pequeninos, and eventually (in direct violation of Starways Congress law) meets with them in person."
28230.18	B-Rising Action	"The Hive Queen has also managed to make contact with the pequeninos philotically, and has told them a number of things&mdash;including the fact that ""Andrew Wiggin"" is not only the original Speaker for the Dead, but the original Xenocide as well, which romantically involved Zenadors (a shortened form of the word xenologists) Miro and Ouanda do not believe."
28230.19	I-Rising Action	The Hive Queen very emphatically wants to be revived and freed on Lusitania.
28230.20	B-Climax	"Finally, in an effort to help Ender, Jane deliberately reveals to Starways Congress that Miro and Ouanda, continuing the legacy of Ouanda's dead father Libo, have been deliberately introducing new technology into the piggy lifestyle."
28230.21	B-Climax	"Both Zenadors are called away to the nearest world for trial (a journey that would take twenty-two years), the colony's charter is revoked, and all humans are ordered to evacuate posthaste, leaving no sign of ever having been there."
28230.22	B-Falling Action	"Ender holds a public speaking for MarcÃ£o, Novinha's late husband."
28230.23	I-Falling Action	"However, Ender cannot but help reveal secrets from the lives of Libo, Pipo, and even Novinha herself as their lives were all so delicately bound together by guilt, deception, and love."
28230.24	I-Falling Action	"The Speaker explains how Novinha blames herself for Pipo's death, and underwent a life of suffering and deceptionâ€”marrying MarcÃ£o so that to prevent Libo from accessing the information which killed Pipo, but secretly trysting with Liboâ€”because their love for each other never truly died."
28230.25	I-Falling Action	"The meaning of Pipo's and Libo's murders come out as well: the trees are the ""third stage"" in the life of the piggies."
28230.26	I-Falling Action	"Trees grown from piggies killed normally become brothertrees, but the ritually dissected ones are done so in order to make them fathertreesâ€”sentient, living trees that are, unlike animal pequeninos, capable of reproduction (the descolada is proved to be instrumental in these transformations)."
28230.27	B-Falling Action	"Finally, the Speaker for the Dead is able to work out a treaty with the piggies, so that humans and pequeninos might live in peace."
28230.28	B-Falling Action	"Unfortunately, it is not without cost: Miro, distraught to learn that Ouanda, his girlfriend in secret, is actually his sister, attempts to cross the fence, which separates the humans from the piggies, and suffers significant neurological damage."
28230.29	B-Falling Action	"With no other way to save him, the colony declares itself in rebellion, Jane shuts off outside ansible contact, Miro is rescued, and Ender enters the forest to negotiate the aforementioned treaty."
28230.30	I-Falling Action	"He signs it ""Ender Wiggin,"" and for the first time in his life, someone (Novinha) is prepared to receive the Xenocide with compassion instead of revulsion."
28230.31	B-Resolution	"Valentine and her family plan to come to Lusitania to help out in the rebellion, aided by Jane; Miro, with his crippled body, is sent into space to meet them; the Hive Queen is released, ready to begin the continuation of her species; and Ender marries Novinha."

31584.1	B-Exposition	" In the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British plane crashes onto an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean."
31584.2	I-Exposition	The only survivors are male children below the age of thirteen.
31584.3	B-Exposition	"Two boys, the fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy reluctantly nicknamed ""Piggy"" find a conch, which Ralph uses as a horn to bring all the survivors to one area."
31584.4	I-Exposition	"Ralph emerges as one of the survivors' leaders during the meeting, as does Jack Merridew, a member of a boys' choir that survived the crash."
31584.5	I-Exposition	"The survivors elect Ralph as their ""chief"", losing only the votes of Jack's fellow choirboys, who support their leader."
31584.6	I-Exposition	Ralph asserts two primary goals: to have fun and to maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island.
31584.7	I-Exposition	"The boys decide that a conch shell they found embodies the society they shall create on the island, and declare that whoever holds the conch shall also receive the respect of the larger group."
31584.8	B-Exposition	"Jack organises his choir group into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source; Ralph, Jack, and a boy named Simon soon form a troika of leaders."
31584.9	B-Exposition	"Piggy, although Ralph's only confidante, is quickly made an outcast by his fellow ""biguns"" (older boys) and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children."
31584.10	B-Exposition	"Simon, in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters, feels an instinctive need to protect the younger boys."
31584.11	B-Inciting Incident	"The semblance of order imposed by Ralph and Simon quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle and begin to develop paranoias about the island, referring to a supposed monster, the ""beast"", which dwells nearby."
31584.12	B-Inciting Incident	"Jack, who has started a power struggle with Ralph, gains control of the discussion by boldly promising to kill the beast."
31584.13	B-Inciting Incident	"At one point, Jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig, drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire."
31584.14	B-Rising Action	"After the fire burns out, a ship passes by the island, but does not stop as it has seen nothing amiss."
31584.15	I-Rising Action	"Angered by this, Ralph considers relinquishing his position, but is convinced not to do so by Piggy."
31584.16	B-Rising Action	"While Jack schemes against Ralph, twins Sam and Eric, now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire, see the corpse of a fighter pilot in the dark."
31584.17	I-Rising Action	"Mistaking the corpse for the beast, they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected and warn the others."
31584.18	I-Rising Action	This unexpected meeting sees tensions between Jack and Ralph flare again.
31584.19	B-Rising Action	"Shortly thereafter, Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island, where a heap of stones forms a place where he claims the beast resides."
31584.20	I-Rising Action	Only Ralph and Jack's supporter Roger agree to go; Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys.
31584.21	B-Rising Action	"When they arrive at the shelters, Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph, asking for them to remove him from his position."
31584.22	I-Rising Action	"Receiving little support, Jack, Roger, and another boy leave the shelters to form their own tribe."
31584.23	B-Rising Action	"The tribe, which receives recruits from the main group of boys, grows in strength and begins to adopt customs common to primitive cultures, including face paint and bizarre rituals including sacrifices to the beast."
31584.24	B-Rising Action	"When the tribe grows to a size that rivals Ralph's, they begin to harass those who remain at the shelters and make pronouncements encouraging them to abandon Ralph and the societal order he has imposed."
31584.25	B-Climax	"Simon, unable to bear the stress of his position, goes off to think."
31584.26	I-Climax	"Alone, he finds a severed pig head, left by Jack as an offering to the beast."
31584.27	I-Climax	"Simon envisions the pig head, now swarming with scavenging flies, as the ""Lord of the Flies"" and believes that it is talking to him."
31584.28	I-Climax	"Simon hears the pig identifying itself as the real ""Beast"" and disclosing the truth about itself&nbsp;â€“ that the boys themselves ""created"" the beast, and that the real beast was inside them all."
31584.29	I-Climax	"Simon also locates the dead parachutist who had been mistaken for the beast, and is the sole member of the group to recognise that the ""monster"" is a cadaver."
31584.30	B-Falling Action	"Simon, hoping to tell others of the discovery, finds Jack's tribe in the island's interior during a ritual dance and, mistaken for the beast, is killed by the frenzied boys."
31584.31	I-Falling Action	"Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric feel guilty about what they did not stop."
31584.32	B-Falling Action	"Jack and his band of ""savages"" decide that they should possess Piggy's glasses, the only means of starting a fire on the island."
31584.33	I-Falling Action	"Raiding Ralph's camp, the savages confiscate the glasses and return to their abode near the great rock heap, called Castle Rock."
31584.34	B-Falling Action	"Ralph, deserted by most of his supporters, journeys to Castle Rock to confront Jack and secure the glasses."
31584.35	I-Falling Action	"Taking the conch and accompanied only by Piggy, Sam, and Eric, Ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object."
31584.36	I-Falling Action	"Turning against Ralph, the tribe takes Sam and Eric captive while Roger drops a boulder from his vantage point above, killing Piggy and shattering the conch."
31584.37	I-Falling Action	"Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are tortured until they agree to join Jack's tribe."
31584.38	B-Falling Action	"The following morning, Jack orders his tribe to begin a manhunt for Ralph."
31584.39	I-Falling Action	"Fleeing through the forest, Ralph watches as the ""savages"" set fire to the forest, drawing the attention of a passing naval vessel."
31584.40	B-Resolution	"A landing party from the vessel encounters Ralph as he desperately tries to escape the onrushing ""savages"", and the British officer leading the party, at first mistaking the violence for a game, expected better from British boys."

24162.1	B-Exposition	" The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy, charming and social young bachelor, moving into Netherfield Park in the neighbourhood of the Bennet family."
24162.2	B-Exposition	"Mr Bingley is soon well received, while his friend Mr Darcy makes a less favorable first impression by appearing proud and condescending at a ball that they attend (this is partly explained in that he detests dancing and is not much for light conversation)."
24162.3	B-Inciting Incident	"Mr Bingley singles out Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane, for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other."
24162.4	B-Inciting Incident	"By contrast, Darcy slights Elizabeth, who overhears and jokes about it despite feeling a budding resentment."
24162.5	B-Rising Action	"On paying a visit to Mr Bingley's sister, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catches cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days."
24162.6	B-Rising Action	"Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr Darcy, who begins to perceive his attachment to her, but is too proud to proceed on this feeling."
24162.7	B-Rising Action	"Mr Collins, a clergyman, pays a visit to the Bennets."
24162.8	B-Rising Action	"Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer, the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self-important and pedantic nature."
24162.9	B-Rising Action	It soon becomes apparent that Mr Collins has come to Longbourn to choose a wife from among the Bennet sisters (his cousins) and Elizabeth has been singled out.
24162.10	I-Rising Action	"At the same time, Elizabeth forms an acquaintance with Mr Wickham, a militia officer who claims to have been very seriously mistreated by Mr Darcy, despite having been a ward of Mr Darcy's father."
24162.11	I-Rising Action	"This tale, and Elizabeth's attraction to Mr Wickham, adds fuel to her dislike of Mr Darcy."
24162.12	B-Rising Action	"At a ball given by Mr Bingley at Netherfield, Mr Darcy becomes aware of a general expectation that Mr Bingley and Jane will marry, and the Bennet family, with the exception of Jane and Elizabeth, make a public display of poor manners and decorum."
24162.13	B-Rising Action	"The following morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress."
24162.14	I-Rising Action	"Mr Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth's close friend Charlotte, a homely woman with few prospects."
24162.15	B-Rising Action	"Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns to London, and Elizabeth is convinced that Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley's sister have conspired to separate him from Jane."
24162.16	B-Rising Action	"In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent."
24162.17	B-Rising Action	"Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to Rosings Park, home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt; coincidentally, Darcy also arrives to visit."
24162.18	B-Climax	Darcy again finds himself attracted to Elizabeth and impetuously proposes to her.
24162.19	I-Climax	"Elizabeth, however, has just learned of Darcy's role in separating Mr Bingley from Jane from his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam."
24162.20	I-Climax	"She angrily rebukes him, and a heated discussion follows; she charges him with destroying her sister's happiness, with treating Mr Wickham disgracefully, and with having conducted himself towards her in an ungentleman-like manner."
24162.21	B-Climax	"Mr Darcy, shocked, ultimately responds with a letter giving a good account of (most of) his actions: Wickham had exchanged his legacies for a cash payment, only to return after gambling away the money to reclaim the forfeited inheritance; he then attempted to elope with Darcy's young sister, thereby to capture her fortune."
24162.22	B-Climax	"Regarding Mr Bingley and Jane, Darcy claimed he had observed no reciprocal interest in Jane for Bingley."
24162.23	B-Climax	Elizabeth later came to acknowledge the truth of Darcy's assertions.
24162.24	B-Falling Action	"Some months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, believing he will be absent for the day."
24162.25	I-Falling Action	"He returns unexpectedly, and though surprised, he is gracious and welcoming."
24162.26	B-Falling Action	"He treats the Gardiners with great civility; he introduces Elizabeth to his sister, and Elizabeth begins to realise her attraction to him."
24162.27	B-Falling Action	"Their reacquaintance is cut short, however, by news that Lydia, Elizabeth's sister, has run away to elope with Mr Wickham."
24162.28	B-Falling Action	"Elizabeth and the Gardiners return to Longbourn, where Elizabeth grieves that her renewed acquaintance with Mr Darcy will end because of her sister's disgrace."
24162.29	B-Falling Action	"Lydia and Wickham are soon found, then married by the clergy; they visit Longbourn, where Lydia lets slip that Mr Darcy was responsible for finding the couple and negotiating their marriageâ€”at great expense to himself."
24162.30	B-Falling Action	"Elizabeth is shocked but does not dwell further on the topic due to Mr Bingley's return and subsequent proposal to Jane, who immediately accepts."
24162.31	B-Falling Action	"Lady Catherine de Bourgh later bursts in on Longbourn; intending to thwart local rumour, she warns Elizabeth against marrying Mr Darcy."
24162.32	I-Falling Action	Elizabeth refuses her demands.
24162.33	B-Falling Action	"Disgusted, Lady Catherine leaves and drops by to inform her nephew on Elizabeth's abominable behaviour."
24162.34	I-Falling Action	"However, this lends hope to Darcy that Elizabeth's opinion of him may have changed."
24162.35	B-Resolution	He travels to Longbourn and proposes again; and now Elizabeth accepts.

250478.1	B-Exposition	" Jane Wilkinson, an actress, is suspected of murdering her husband, the fourth Baron Edgware, so that she can marry the Duke of Merton."
250478.2	B-Inciting Incident	The plot begins with Jane asking Poirot to convince her husband to agree to a divorce.
250478.3	I-Inciting Incident	"When Poirot reluctantly does so, Edgware says that he has already agreed to a divorce and written a letter to Jane informing her of the fact."
250478.4	B-Exposition	"When Poirot reports this to Jane, she denies ever having received such a letter."
250478.5	I-Inciting Incident	Lord Edgware is portrayed as a rather unsympathetic character.
250478.6	B-Exposition	"On the night of the murder, Wilkinson supposedly goes to the Edgware house, announces herself to the butler, and goes into her husband's study."
250478.7	B-Rising Action	"The next day, Lord Edgware is found murdered and Chief Inspector Japp tells Poirot all about it."
250478.8	I-Rising Action	"Numerous friends and acquaintances of Jane have described her as amoral, someone who only thinks of herself and would certainly commit a crime if it would help her get what she wants, without a care for others."
250478.9	I-Rising Action	"But in that morning's newspaper, they discover an article about a dinner party that was held the previous evening where Wilkinson was a guest."
250478.10	I-Rising Action	"At the party, there were thirteen guests at the dinner table."
250478.11	I-Rising Action	"One guest mentioned that thirteen people at table means bad luck for the first guest to rise from the table (hence the alternative title of the book, Thirteen At Dinner) and Jane Wilkinson was the first to rise."
250478.12	B-Rising Action	"Among the guests is an actor named Donald Ross, who spent a lot of the evening speaking with Jane."
250478.13	I-Rising Action	"So the police are, at first, baffled with the case, as is Poirot."
250478.14	B-Rising Action	"On the same morning Lord Edgware's murder is discovered, comedienne/actress Carlotta Adams, known for her uncanny impersonations, is found dead due to an overdose of Veronal."
250478.15	I-Rising Action	A mysterious gold case with the sleeping powder in it is found among her possessions.
250478.16	I-Rising Action	"The case bears an inscription reading: ""From D, Paris, November, 10th Sweet Dreams""."
250478.17	I-Rising Action	Poirot tries to decode this and arranges the evidence together.
250478.18	B-Rising Action	"A few days later, Jane makes an appearance at another dinner party where the guests talk about Paris of Troy."
250478.19	I-Rising Action	"However, the Jane Wilkinson at this dinner party thinks that the guests, again including actor Donald Ross, are referring to the French capital."
250478.20	I-Rising Action	"Ross can't understand this because, at the party on the night of the murder, Jane was speaking knowledgeably about the mythological Paris."
250478.21	B-Rising Action	"Ross goes to ring up Poirot about his discovery, but before he can say what he discovered, he is stabbed to death at his home, but Poirot is on the verge of solving the case, anyway."
250478.22	B-Rising Action	"Poirot gathers the suspects and details the trajectory of the crimes (the three murders): With Carlotta Adams impersonating Wilkinson, Jane simply takes a taxi to the Edgware house, where she murders her husband."
250478.23	B-Climax	She is overseen by her husband's secretary but the secretary's vision and impartiality were called into question at trial.
250478.24	B-Falling Action	"Later, Jane (in the person of ""Mrs Van Dusen"", an elderly American widow) and Carlotta meet up in a hotel where they toast Carlotta's successful ""performance"" and ostensibly so Jane can pay Carlotta."
250478.25	I-Falling Action	"However, Jane slips Veronal into Carlotta's drink, and Adams dies."
250478.26	B-Falling Action	Jane discovers a letter Carlotta has written to her sister and is panicked by how Carlotta talks openly in the letter about their arrangement.
250478.27	I-Falling Action	"Rather than destroy the letter, Jane sees a way she can use the letter to her advantage."
250478.28	I-Falling Action	"At the top left hand corner of the second page is the word ""she"" (referring to Jane); she tears off the ""s"", leaving the word ""he"", making it seem a man had hired Carlotta."
250478.29	I-Falling Action	Jane then puts the remaining Veronal inside the gold case to make it seem Carlotta was a Veronal addict.
250478.30	I-Falling Action	"Jane ordered the gold case the week prior (as ""Mrs Van Dusen""), which Poirot discovers when he questions the engravers."
250478.31	I-Falling Action	"Poirot also realises that ""November"" was engraved on the case specifically to throw him off."
250478.32	I-Falling Action	"Unbeknownst to Jane, Carlotta had been knowledgeable about Greek mythology, so she talked a lot about the subject with Donald Ross."
250478.33	B-Falling Action	"At the second dinner party, Jane realizes she's made a potentially very serious mistake about Paris, leaves the party and heads to Ross's home to kill him before he can tell Poirot."
250478.34	I-Falling Action	"Her motive for killing Lord Edgware was because the Duke of Merton was a staunch Anglo-Catholic and would not marry a divorced woman; a widow, however, is a different matter."
250478.35	B-Resolution	"In the last chapter, she writes a letter to Poirot, remarkably devoid of any animosity, which ends with her wondering why hangings are not done in public anymore."

199525.1	B-Exposition	" Esther Greenwood, a young woman from the suburbs of Boston, gains a summer internship at a prominent magazine in New York City under editor Jay Cee."
199525.2	I-Exposition	"At the time of the Rosenbergs' execution, Esther is neither stimulated nor excited by the big city and glamorous culture and lifestyle that girls her age are expected to idolize and emulate."
199525.3	I-Exposition	Instead her experiences frighten and disorient her.
199525.4	B-Exposition	"She appreciates the witty sarcasm and adventurousness of her friend Doreen, but also identifies with the piety of Betsy (dubbed ""Pollyanna Cowgirl"") and a ""goody-goody"" sorority girl who always does the right thing."
199525.5	B-Exposition	"She has a benefactress in Philomena Guinea, a formerly successful fiction writer (based on Olive Higgins Prouty), who will, later during Esther's hospitalization, pay for some of her treatments."
199525.6	B-Inciting Incident	"Esther describes in detail several seriocomic incidents that occur during her internship, kicked off by an unfortunate but amusing experience at a banquet for the girls given by the staff of Ladies' Day magazine."
199525.7	B-Inciting Incident	"She reminisces about her friend Buddy, whom she has dated more or less seriously and who considers himself her de facto fiancÃ©."
199525.8	B-Inciting Incident	"She also muses about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who are scheduled for execution."
199525.9	B-Rising Action	She returns to her Massachusetts home in low spirits.
199525.10	I-Rising Action	"During her stay in New York City, she had hoped to return to another scholarly opportunity, a writing course taught by a world-famous author."
199525.11	I-Rising Action	"Upon her return home, her mother immediately tells her she was not accepted for the course."
199525.12	B-Rising Action	"She decides to spend the summer potentially writing a novel, although she feels she doesn't have enough life experience to write convincingly."
199525.13	I-Rising Action	"All of her identity has been centered upon doing well academically; she is unsure of what to make of her life once she leaves school, and the choices presented to her (motherhood, as exemplified by the prolific child-bearer and vacuous Dodo Conway, or stereotypical female careers such as stenography) do not appeal to her."
199525.14	I-Rising Action	"Esther becomes increasingly depressed, and finds herself unable to sleep."
199525.15	B-Climax	"Her mother encourages, or perhaps forces, her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Gordon, whom Esther mistrusts because he is attractive and seems to be showing off a picture of his charming family rather than listening to her."
199525.16	I-Climax	He prescribes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
199525.17	B-Climax	"It is improperly administered, and she feels she's being electrocuted like the Rosenbergs."
199525.18	B-Climax	"Afterward, she tells her mother she won't go back: My mother smiled."
199525.19	I-Climax	"""I know my baby wasn't like that."""
199525.20	I-Climax	I looked at her.
199525.21	I-Climax	"""Like what?"""
199525.22	I-Climax	"""Like those awful people."
199525.23	I-Climax	"Those awful dead people at that hospital."""
199525.24	I-Climax	She paused.
199525.25	I-Climax	"""I knew you'd decide to be all right again."""
199525.26	B-Falling Action	Esther&#39;s mental state worsens.

28426.1	B-Exposition	" Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids (referred to as ""The Bugs"") of Klendathu."
28426.2	B-Exposition	"It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, and is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion."
28426.3	B-Exposition	"The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette Rodger Young (named after Medal of Honor winner Rodger Wilton Young), serving with the platoon known as ""Rasczak's Roughnecks"" (named after the platoon leader, Lt. Rasczak) about to embark on a raid against the planet of the ""Skinnies,"" who are allies of the Arachnids."
28426.4	I-Exposition	We learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry.
28426.5	B-Exposition	"The raid itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively brief: the Roughnecks land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering a single casualty in the process (Dizzy Flores, who dies in the retrieval boat of wounds received in action)."
28426.6	B-Inciting Incident	"The story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father, who disowns him."
28426.7	B-Inciting Incident	"This is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt. Col. Jean V. Dubois, Rico's school instructor in ""History and Moral Philosophy,"" and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation."
28426.8	I-Inciting Incident	"Some see Dubois as speaking for Heinlein throughout the novel; he delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, it ""... has settled more issues in history than has any other factor."""
28426.9	B-Inciting Incident	"Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with Dubois."
28426.10	B-Inciting Incident	"We learn, later, that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction."
28426.11	B-Inciting Incident	"Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's high school History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how in the Terran Federation of Rico's day, the rights of a full Citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service."
28426.12	I-Inciting Incident	"Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal Service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech, assembly, etc."
28426.13	I-Inciting Incident	"), but they cannot vote or hold public office."
28426.14	B-Inciting Incident	"This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the ""20th century Western democracies"", brought on by both social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas."
28426.15	B-Rising Action	"In the next section of the novel, after being denied all his higher preferred Service choices, Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie, on the northern prairies."
28426.16	B-Rising Action	"Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience there, including his adjustment to a very different situation, entering the service under the training of the leading instructor, career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim."
28426.17	B-Rising Action	Camp Currie is rigorous by design; less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training.
28426.18	I-Rising Action	"The rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training."
28426.19	B-Rising Action	"One of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a simulated combat exercise (he caught Sgt."
28426.20	I-Rising Action	Zim by surprise after being struck by the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise).
28426.21	B-Rising Action	"Another recruit, a deserter who murdered a baby girl while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police and return to Camp Currie."
28426.22	B-Rising Action	Rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in the Fleet.
28426.23	B-Rising Action	"At some point during Rico's training, the ""Bug War"" has changed from border incidents to formal war, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations."
28426.24	B-Climax	"The war ""officially"" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires (which kills Juan's mother who was visiting there), although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there had been many ""'incidents,' 'patrols,' or 'police actions.'"""
28426.25	B-Climax	Rico briefly describes the Terran Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu during which his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed.
28426.26	B-Falling Action	"Following Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which, chronologically would be placed between chapters 10 and 11)."
28426.27	B-Falling Action	Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak's Roughnecks.
28426.28	B-Falling Action	"This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers, personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal."
28426.29	B-Falling Action	"Eventually, Rico decides to become a career soldier, and one of his fellow troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for Officer Candidate School."
28426.30	I-Falling Action	He applies and is accepted.
28426.31	B-Falling Action	"It turns out to be just like boot camp, only ""squared and cubed with books added."""
28426.32	B-Falling Action	"Rico manages to make it through to the final exam, ""in the Fleet""."
28426.33	B-Falling Action	He is commissioned a temporary Third Lieutenant for his field-test and commands his own unit during Operation Royalty.
28426.34	B-Falling Action	"It is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor, Sergeant Zim."
28426.35	B-Falling Action	"Although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men, he passes the final exam, and graduates as a Second Lieutenant."
28426.36	B-Resolution	"There is also an account of the meeting between Rico and his father, who volunteered for Service after his wife, Rico's mother, was killed at Buenos Aires."
28426.37	B-Resolution	"The final chapter serves as more of a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in command of Rico's Roughnecks, preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major strike, his father being his senior sergeant and a Native American Third Lieutenant-in-training (James Bearpaw, known as ""Jimmie"") of his own under instruction."
