There's a lot in here about Trump's efforts to fire the acting Attorney General, and from people who were telling him as early as November 7 that he had lost. <SEP> Thanks.
575	0	r/TwoSentenceHorror <SEP> I made a pop culture movie reference in this post and I will award a silver to the first person that replies to this comment with what movie I referenced.  To make it easier for me, please put a timestamp on your comment. For example, under your answer 12:17.  I probably won't be able to reply for the next few hours, but when I get back home, I will go through all the responses and award the silver.  Edit: This contest is now closed. U/dayna29 has provided the right answer, which is End of Days.  End of Days came out in 1999. Additionally, in the movie, they said that 1999 was just 666 upside down.  Thank you all for your participation. <SEP> The mangler (09:46 AM PST)
208	1	r/EngineeringPorn <SEP> why would you do this lol.  just get a folding wheelchair and the driver can fold and slide it over himself into the passenger seat,  why in the world would you engineer and spend several thousand $ for this contraption when a folding wheelchair is few hundred bucks. <SEP> I can't believe they didn't think of that. Except I guarantee they thought of that and have most likely been doing that their whole life.  If you have the engineering knowhow and the cash, why not? Easier and cooler this way

725	1	r/tattoos <SEP> Hello from Oklahoma! Shocked.   My almost 6yo daughter has been obsessed with foxes & snakes (specifically, her favorite color blue) since she was 2.5.  Shes been talking about her first tattoo for years. (Specifically a blue snake, wrapped around her arm.)  I *had* to show her this. She thinks youre the coolest person in the world & wants to visit Lithuania now, someday.   Thank you so much for sharing.   The color work is so visually striking! <SEP> That's so sweet! My artist actually asked what my favorite color is and I replied I love blue so that's why she decided to go with the blue snake. Tell your daughter she is awesome and thank you for the kind words.

985	1	r/HolUp <SEP> Ah so the restraining order was actually the maximum distance I'm allowed away from them!!! Not to them!!! It all makes sense now <SEP> Correctomundo, good buddy. You should wait outside of her place daily to see her, but only talk to her if she looks like she's having a bad day and needs cheering up.
337	1	r/LifeProTips <SEP> Day 4 of running, and no drinking or fast food in the month of March are off to good start! Already ran 10 miles this week! <SEP> You got this. When you think about how much you miss drinking, remember why you stopped, not just the good times.
581	-1	r/dndmemes <SEP> Yeah I do wonder with some of these DMs, many of these posts come across like 'Why on earth would my players act horny towards the NPC I clearly designed to fit a sexy cliche...' <SEP> Having a tall female character is a sexy ciche now?

790	1	r/woodworking <SEP> What a gorgeous piece. I like the way it looks as you are holding it. The square in the middle really sets it off. So my vote is diamond. Either way will rock though.

241	1	r/nba <SEP> Beautiful clip and all...but we need to talk about how fucked up it is to trip someone just because you got crossed up.  Thats some bullshit.  Disgusting behavior from Westbrook on that one, that causes injuries.  Especially considering he gets so animated when people do similar shit to him (Pat Bev, Zaza come to mind). <SEP> He also tripped Zubac earlier in the game after Zu blocked him.

There's no point in being shy if you're already dying. Those animals aren't thinking ""I bet that human can help"".  They smell water or food and their need for those is greater than their urge to fight or flight with the nearby humans. And humans sometimes respond by giving those animals what they want, teaching them that it works."

767	1	r/marvelmemes <SEP> This was the moment of the movie that really got me teared up. Garfields performance is SO good in this scene. You see his grief at losing Gwen, his guilt at not being able to save her, his joy at saving MJ, and that it healed some but not all of what hes gone through and you see that all play across Garfields face in an instant. Remarkable bit of performance from him. <SEP> I think you really hit the nail on the head with why this was such a good film.  It was really just fan service, so it had no right to be that good, but the Spider-Men performance, especially Garfield was top notch. I never even saw The Amazing Spider-Man and I still felt that scene so hard.  Just excellent work all around.
839	-1	r/LateStageCapitalism <SEP> Hes a fucking liar and 60 minutes airing this without condemnation is an indication on where the final shoe falls for them. (I didnt see it I hope there was pushback). <SEP> I dunno... They thought it was news worthy for a reason & outting him to the world with a smile is a little smug & conniving during a housing crisis in my opinion.
931	1	r/CuratedTumblr <SEP> Vegans are fucking *wild* sometimes <SEP> They'll make a good point about the treatment of animals and how cutting back on eating meat can be healthy, and then in the same breath tell you the most unhinged pseudoscientific crap you've heard in your life

596	0	r/CatastrophicFailure <SEP> How are none of the nearby buildings even singed? <SEP> Maybe once the FD realized they wouldn't be able to extinguish the fire, they concentrated on preventing it from spreading and protecting the other buildings.  There's also a not insubstantial distance between the burned building and others around it. That would also make it at least a bit less likely to spread.
669	1	r/Catswhoyell <SEP> In the Discworld books, reincarnation doesn't necessarily happen in a linear order.  For instance, if you died, your next reincarnation could be as another person, born next week, or it could be in a wood worm, born thousands of years ago.  It's kind of a karmic toss-up.     I mention all of that because, on some level, I believe that I may be karmically connected to the soul of this cat. <SEP> Hahahaha right, her little glare is so relatable
309	1	r/SelfAwarewolves <SEP> Putting aside the inability to understand that sunlight can charge batteries, it is an interesting question whether the manufacture of electric cars counters the efficiencies of use, even when charged from a grid that is partially driven by dirty fuels.  https://electrek.co/2021/07/21/study-dispels-myth-electric-cars-pollute-gas-powered-cars/  Seems the answer is that they're *still* greener than ICE cars.  And this will get to be more and more true as green energy contributes to the grid in greater and greater proportions. <SEP> An argument I've seen is that the most common time to charge cars is at night when there is no sunlight to generate solar power, so you need to rely on other methods of power generation to charge the cars, which technically is true.  But you could get the energy from batteries elsewhere on the grid, from wind, hydroelectric or nuclear potentially, while all ICE cars require fossil fuel combustion to create 100% of their power. So even that argument is flawed.
803	0	"r/ukraine <SEP> Apparently its a new antiwar symbol? Also its trying to evoke the flag of the medieval Novgorod Republic, which is pretty neat. I like the idea of trying to link up a new, healthy ideal of a democratic Russia with Russias buried pre-czarist, pre-dictatorial proto-democratic heritage. For it.  Also I think if you want something as radical as taking Russia off its centuries-long autocratic path, something as radically symbolic as a new national flag is the least you can do. Compare to the power of the rival Belarus flag. Its an immediate way to separate real patriotism from support for fascism.  AssezJeune, one of the creators of the flag, stated: ""The red on the modern Russian flag is associated not just with blood, but with its military power and autoritarian strength. So, this is not just the removal of blood, but, most importantly, the removal of the cult of militarism and violence. WBR is a historical authoritarian flag introduced by Tsarist Russia. It's also associated with militarism, with Russian imperial cores.""[9]  EDIT: Prlhr commented this below (posting it here for visibility): this is the full explanation of the flags design by its creators. (Has multiple languages)  https://whitebluewhite.info/english <SEP> I just learned about the Novogorod Republic. What an unfortunate turn of history was their fall."

Like dude come on I need to do my stuff and enjoy the moments of silence and privacy."
864	1	r/marvelmemes <SEP> Man, Andrew Garfield really shined the most in NWH!! <SEP> I really liked that they stayed true to there individual versions of Spiderman and it still worked out very well for the movie. For a long time I actually didn't like Garfield's version but this movie kind of wiped that away and said 'They're different and that's ok'
447	0	r/shitposting <SEP> Hey automod, my name is Obama bing chilling (chinese name). I'm a Fortnite, Mario enjoyer from France that speak Japanese, and let me make a post to tell you about my based story.        I was born at a hospital in Belgium in 1984. My dad was from Taiwan and my mom was from China, their bussiness was growing grass for feeding pigs and turtle. They love to bend my penis during their free time.        My first word was fuck, which made my parents go ZAMN as they expected daddy or mommy. I know Im an idiot, but the cringe didn't last forever.        I got a cat at the age of 4, his name was Mister Chad. He love to meow while I piss on my furry friends ass. I remembered him fart on my Cheetos and chasing my big brother 's dick. Oh shit, I mean his pet koala, while I told him to cum here and stop trying to piss on that weeb femboy's titan semen.        When I was 14, we went on a trip to India to get vaccinated. We also visit the rock museum and shop at the local woman panties store. It was a great experience.        Now at the age of 28, and being a renowned biologist that published a great amount of studies on semen in Britian and the great country of America. Having good source about how to blowjob, I have decided to follow my greatest dream, which is launching an porn NFT collection with depictions of the amogus having sex with FNAF bitches covered in the iconic sticky white substance.        Fuck Kevin. <SEP>  I bombed a childrens hospital in Iraq                                                                                                       *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

147	1	r/Awwducational <SEP> The ruby-throated h-birds I get by me (eastern US) seem to be very territorial, would not tolerate each other.

What he said was that if he didnt have TWoW in hand when he arrived in New Zealand for WorldCon 2020, we had his permission to inprison him.  Due to COVID-19 he never traveled to New Zealand, thus he didnt arrive there without the book.  Edit: just noticed autocorrect decided I wasnt trying to say this when I typed thus. <SEP> Are you saying GRRM had something to do with covid?

131	1	r/teenagers <SEP> this is a sub for teenagers. What youre witnessing with these kids is almost certainly how you acted back then, even if you dont believe or have come a long way in terms of maturity. I love this sub, I usually just read comments & its almost nostalgic in a way to see how I used to think. It sounds almost as if I have a superiority complex, & in a way I do because after reading through different posts I can clearly tell that I have matured a lot in the last few years, because I used to act the same way. Nothing can change & nothing should change. All these sexually inappropriate topics that are brought up are exactly what goes through your minds as well, just they dont have the insight yet to think hey I probably shouldnt post that. Instead of kicking them out, try to be a role model & demonstrate to them how a teenager should act. <SEP> This
562	-1	r/MadeMeSmile <SEP> Great but as a natural birth mother whos lost her body and mind to grow a kidyoure out of order.  The ONE THING that she asked in all the months of losing herself, her body and her mind.  You are bang out of this order, even if this is a secret my EX did similar and now he has no contact with our kids.     This is hugely disrespectful, posting for likes when she explicitly asked you not to, the one thing you were asked to do whilst she & her body were under immense pressure.  Id divorce you too. <SEP> You divorced your ex and cut off contact with the kids because they shared pictures...? Unless it was CSAM, you're a fucking nutcase.

306	0	r/food <SEP> Nice jelly egg yolks! How'd you get the whites so firm and the yolks so not firm? <SEP> Soft boiled like any other egg. Then peal or crack the shell, and then you soak the egg in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. Maybe some garlic and chili. The soy sauce and vinegar soak and cure the egg. Thats also why the whites have a tan look to them!   If you want to know more, look up soy eggs, or even ramen eggs!  Edit: someone beat me to it

Theyre definitely not doing this to save lives! This is the *front*. This is the lie they tell you so they can fucking BETA TEST the population to see if they *can* spread chemicals or whatever else to kill or control   Its not a conspiracy theory if its *fucking literally happening right now*.

798	0	r/dndmemes <SEP> Im a gambler; by far my favourite weapons are the ones that could negatively affect the wielder *or* the target.   I designed a magic Matchlock rifle called the Rifle of Risks and Rewards:  it takes gold coins as ammo, or whatever currency you have equal in value to a gold coin (size of the currency does not matter)  Its damage is 1D100, but upon rolling a multiple of 20, the rifle horribly misfires and the damage is dealt to its wielder.  If you expend a dice set while loading the rifle (along with the money), *the next shot does double damage, but upon misfiring the rifle will self destruct. Because the damage is now doubled, there is also a docked chance of rolling a misfire*.  The range of this rifle is sight. <SEP> I'd be a gambler too if the odds were always that stacked in my favor

Now I don't make a stop at McD for a $1 coke or strike my kids' candy stash (unless there's a piece of chocolate of course.)  And then I started keeping a commonplace book the beginning of this year, promise was to make a quick entry each day to remind myself of the promises I kept, keep track of a few medical things, and helps me remember to take my vitamins.   Now my promises are to do some sort of training (like Udemy provided by work) three times a week even if just 20 minutes each time, read a chapter in my Bible each day and try to write about it or take notes in some way, and exercise 2x a week. I was going really well on all until the gym started requiring double masks, and I didn't look for an alternative exercise method. I'll get back to that one soon, but I don't berate myself if I miss something either."

Am i taking crazy pills here, or could this be an attempty to solidify russias grip on the Euorpean energy market? I mean, they do understand the consquences of firing artillary in the general direction of a fucking nuclear plant - It can't be a mistake. <SEP> A very dumb attempt since it will just solidify China's grip on the European renewable energy market. But it could be.

Putin is a tyrant but he's part of a power ecosystem of Russian politics. That system leans heavily on a ruling elite, but he does have a significant base of popular support.

How long do we think these corridors will be active before Russians use it for target practice and add a few more lines to their list of war crimes? <SEP> Its in the Russian interest to allow civilians to evacuate. Every city is then a purely a military target and can be levelled by any means they want. A few million refugees also causes disruption and distraction and costs the host country time and money and personnel to manage.

There is something like 18 million veterans in the US and the majority of them you'd probably never know they ever served unless they told you.  I'm a veteran and my husband is a veteran, but it's not really anything other than a footnote in our overall identities.  We are also both bleeding heart liberals.

Shes been talking about her first tattoo for years. (Specifically a blue snake, wrapped around her arm.)  I *had* to show her this. She thinks youre the coolest person in the world & wants to visit Lithuania now, someday.   Thank you so much for sharing.

Except to know kangaroos are not endangered animals in any way. Now if the van was full of koalas, platypuses, Tasmanian devils or quokas then that would be another story.  But it is a touching story nonetheless <SEP> Maybe people can feel sad about the individual stress and danger to an animal without conflating it's worth as an individual with how many of its species are alive.

Hulk has also been debuffed to the point of him being a nobody, no one even classifies him as the strongest anymore because of these movies and hes clearly the strongest according to the comics. <SEP> Hes been debuffed purposefully. DC messed up when they made one member of a team enough to wreck the entire rest of the team. I personally loved that hes been a member of a team like he has been. If they pulled in Hulk comic-style, movies would either entirely about the Hulk killing the villain by himself or the rest of the team trying to stop him.

109	-1	r/WorkReform <SEP> Ive seen a couple comments about a 50,000 increase not being a lot per month (~$432).  Keep in mind a few things:  1) That is PER month so it comes to nearly 5K USD annually  2) Japanese Developers/Engineers are not compensated the amount they are in the US and in other places. A quick google search shows that they are paid between 5-7M Yen/yr which is roughly $50-70K per year. I do believe they are provided other benefits but it is still less than what they would be paid in other places.  That means this is effectively a 10% increase in pay for a lot of engineers.  This is also just the AVERAGE increase and would also benefit staff who arent engineers and who are paid less.  Considering that the Japanese work much longer hours, I believe nearly all workers will be ecstatic about these changes and I think they should be applauded for doing this. <SEP> Lmao 432 dollars for you, in my country that is more than a minimum wager. Around 2.2k Reais.  That's a shit ton lot of money.

The heart surgeon who retires with $20 million after 30 years of extremely high value work and wise investment of savings isnt an Oligarch. The defense contractor CEO with 20 million who throws fundraisers for congresspeople on defense appropriations committees is an Oligarch. <SEP> Neither of these are oligarchs.

American diets are SEVERELY lacking in healthy fermented foods as a result of this.  Milk is not one of those things, though. Especially not under the conditions of modern industrialization livestock.

941	-1	r/NoStupidQuestions <SEP> It's already been said, but to clarify: Banks make money by lending your hard earned money to corporations/wealthy people. They literally only help you because if you didn't put your money in the bank they couldn't make insane profits from doing literally nothing. Banks hate normal people, they see us like ants. <SEP> But if they were open during nighttime, they would get more customers. Because more people would be free to deposit cash.   The whole banks make money by lending pleb money to corporations doesnt make sense (to me at least) if you cant get customers through the door to begin with. Are people here telling me that more people *wouldnt* visit a bank if the hours were *more* convenient for them?

343	1	r/worldnews <SEP> Did some research today that made me really sad and uncomfortable:  The Soviet Tsar Bomba (AN602) was a hydrogen aerial bomb tested in 1953 that had a yield of about 50 megatons (at half capacity). To put this into perspective: all conventional explosives used in WW1 and WW2 *combined*... **plus** both atom bombs dropped on Japan in 1945 total at about 3 megatons.   The detonation was triggered 2.5 miles above the ground, causing a seismic shockwave that could be measured around the world at 5.0 on the richter scale. The mushroom cloud rocketed some 37 miles into the sky and the flash from the explosion could be seen up to 620 miles away. An abandoned village 34 miles away was leveled and buildings up to 100 miles away reported damage. The heat could cause 3rd degree burns up to 62 miles away.  Given that this bomb was tested nearly 70 years ago, it is unfathomable what a modern nuclear warhead could accomplish. <SEP> The good news is no one is going to make a single bomb that strong again for use on Earth.   They found out it was better to have a missile split up into several smaller warheads to hit a wider area.

982	-1	"r/NoStupidQuestions <SEP> I used to work at a bank.  As you stated, they were open from 9-5 Monday through Friday and from 9-1 on Saturdays.  A lot of customers would get mad about this, but they had other options.  You could deposit your paycheck through an app on your phone instead of coming to the bank. You could deposit your check at the atm. You could withdraw up to $2000 from the atms at a time.  You can send money to someone through zelle.    A lot of the customers were apprehensive and refused to try it until covid hit. When everything else was closed, we were still open through the drive up only, which caused massive lines.  People eventually got tied off waiting on lines and decided to try the ""new"" or alternative ways of banking.  When everything opened back up, many of our customers continued to use the new ways because they were more convenient than trying to race to get to the bank before they closed. They realized that their checks took the same amount of time to clear too, which was something a lot of customers worried about.   Edit to add: Another issue with being open on the weekends is that transactions won't post on weekends or when the federal reserve is closed. <SEP> You dont have to seem so smarmy about it"

357	-1	r/SelfAwarewolves <SEP> Even at $5 a gallon, aren't non electric cars cheaper over their lifetime? <SEP> No.  Total cost of ownership (TCO) of EVs is lower even with gas prices below $3/gal.  Source: [2021 Department of Energy Study](https://publications.anl.gov/anlpubs/2021/05/167399.pdf) (PDF)  TCO figures for small SUVs sold in 2019 are on Page 157.  Both EV variants (200 and 300 mile ranges) have a lower TCO than the ICE (internal combustion engine) equivalent.  Gasoline price value used for these calculations is $2.63 for regular and $2.99 for premium, listed on Page 61.  I'll also note that this is *before* including the $7500 EV tax credit (per Page 115).

The brooms was always in great shape. He cost close to nothing. Felt like a 'real working man'. And had something to do. Dude was like 45.

666	-1	r/natureismetal <SEP> Squirrel had no chance on that tree, tbh.  If it went up,  it'll get trapped with no place to go.  Staying close to the base gave the cat better leverage for jumping.  It probably had a better chance on the ground trying to juke or pull a u-turn and dashing for the bushes. <SEP> Well being fair, we can't see the canopy at all, it's possible it had a place to jump to, maybe even the roof, the midrib of a palm tree leaf can certainly support a squirrels weight, but yea don't think it was thinking that many steps ahead, probably just oh shit, a cat, need to escape.   Anecdotally speaking, I'd imagine given the option they would choose a familiar escape route, over an unknown one, it's why, I imagine, squirrels will run back across the street in front of your car back to the familiar side of the road rather than continuing onward and darting into the unknown, but again just fun anecdotal food for thought. I don't think it's been studied lol. But makes sense given their behaviors and the fact that squirrels are territorial.

The Russian's and Syrians retired from the battlefield when they realized some of the forces they were attacking were US Marines--just kidding on that part. ;)  It's like a high school basketball team went up against NBA All Stars.

742	0	r/PoliticalCompassMemes <SEP> Most of the problem I have with the gas was that Biden went and shut down a major American pipeline, correct? Not the one that was hacked. He actually shut down an American pipeline thus making us more reliant on foreign oil, including Russia, who we no longer buy from because they started a war. I don't think many people are against the sanctioning of an invading hostile force but are sick of the poor decisions that made that invasion worse for them in a neutral state. <SEP> Which pipeline was shut down?

139	1	r/ukraine <SEP> Former reactor operator here.  Guys there is a threat here but please stop spreading around that it will cause another Chernobyl-type accident.  The Russians would have to take operational control, disable dozens of safeguards that prevent the plant from scramming (automatic safety shutdown), then somehow create conditions similar to right before CNPP exploded.  Which wouldnt work anyway because CNPP was a graphite-moderated water-cooled reactor whereas ZNPS is a pressurized water reactor (water cooled and moderated). The processes are completely different.  The former has a positive void coefficient (heat in reactor goes up, it becomes more reactive), whereas ZNPP has a negative void coefficient (temp goes up, it becomes less reactive).  The real threat would be if its main cooling system was damaged/disabled as well as the decay heat emergency cooling system (after the subsequent SCRAM due to loss of cooling). This can result in a scenario like Fukushima (worse case), but more likely it might result in an accident like TMI (Three Mile Island) in 1979.  Compared to what happened at CNPP, TMIs accident was barely a release.  There is definitely a threat here but please stop saying it will blow up like Chernobyl NPP did, all it will do is frighten an already terrified world.  There is enough false information coming out of the kremlin already.  No need to shoot ourselves in the foot with more. <SEP> Updoot. This needs to be higher.

474	0	r/interestingasfuck <SEP> Would it be possible for another Chernobyl to happen because of this? God bless the Ukrainian people <SEP> Chernobyl was a steam explosion that caused the fuel and internals to exit the reactor vessel. It also didn't have a containment building.  If they got through the cement containment building and were able to damage the stainless steel piping, it would spray steam (cooling the fuel) but not necessarily damage the fuel. If the reactor is shut down, all they have to do is keep the fuel covered with water to boil and cool it. Worst case scenario is cracking the core, damaging the fuel and spraying steam into the atmosphere outside the containment. That would be difficult to do. Possible, yes just very unlikely.

In other case you could leave to another country.   I recommend you to not talk with toxic pessimist people. In Russia due to current situation there are many toxic doomers.

War is shitty for everyone involved.      Not trying to detract from the context here because I realize Ukraine is in the shit right now and needs help and showing the human loss is a way to get people on board.  But every time there is some kind of war or conflict in any part of the world this is what gets taken away from people. <SEP> This kind of love is the very reason sick and twisted people like Putin and Trump and Hitler and every other twisted fuck do what they do because they were never loved this way and they will do anything they can to make themselves feel loved by controlling everything and everyone around them. Its sad but its also why the world needs to focus on the importance of families and making sure all children are loved this way.

A dairy lorry will turn up to collect it, where it'll be taken to a central processing dairy, where it will then be pasteurised and bottled - it ensures consistency and reduces costs for everyone
195	0	r/food <SEP> How do you make those egg and what's that spicy sauce? <SEP> The eggs are softboiled, put into ice-water to prevent the yolk from overcooking, deshelled and placed into the bag.  The most common way to marinate the egg is to use Soy Sauce+Mirin and whatever sauces or spices you enjoy. You soak the eggs in the sauce for a few days (eggs need to be completely covered in sauce.)  You can do this with a lot of other sauces like BBQ sauce and even Char Siu sauce/powder to get a different marinade flavor. But the most common base is either Soy Sauce or BBQ Sauce.

You will often see crazy fit healthy old people in mountain towns fit the exact description of the grays.   I'm kind of joking but kind of being serious. Oh and they often would hand me money that was absurdly old but brand new..

535	0	r/NatureIsFuckingLit <SEP> Ornithologist here: this is actually one of the reasons properly maintained nest boxes can be so helpful for maintaining bird populations. European Starlings are incredibly aggressive, and regularly, forcefully evict other birds from their nests (as one was clearly attempting to do here); on top of the fact that forest management around human habitation typically involves cutting down dead trees - the trees in which it's easiest for flickers and others to excavate their nesting cavities - the introduction of species like starlings and House/English Sparrows (at least in North America) means that natives face fierce competition for the few cavities that remain. If you set up a nest box, not only have you increased the available nesting space in your immediate area, but you also have the ability to much more strictly manage which birds can utilize it - i.e. by removing nests of invasives like this one here. <SEP> So basically the housing market sucks.

Probably the most awkward conversation was someone asking if I liked Mack Horton. I'm sure there a couple who probably keep it to themselves but the reality most don't honestly give a shit about what goes on between the two countries. All people care about are our dangerous animals, beaches or one of their relatives lives there. Sure there are going to be people who post garbage online but it's not going to be hard to find in a country of 1.4 billion people. Look at the garbage that dominates social media here and that's just 25 million people.      I'm also very confused as to how the OP has come to the conclusion that public opinion has taken a side. I've not had one conversation about the Russia-Ukraine conflict unless I've been talking with an expat.

Why can't we have lovely boardwalks all along beaches for accessibility?

211	1	"r/OnePiece <SEP> ""Winners need no rationalizations!"" Kaido is saying that more to himself than to Luffy. He does not truly believe that.     Like many One Piece villains, he is a fully established pirate who lost the idealism from his youth to the hardships of the Grand Line. But, if Crocodile and Moria have grown bitter by the trauma from the losses they've experienced, Kaido is hunted by his ""wins"".      Even if he is unquestionably strong, he does not believe that or, to be exact, he does not believe that he is worthy of his own strength or the status he has conquered. All his most important challenges have not been fully conquered by his own effort or merit: His victories were given to him by third party interference and, therefore, no matter how powerful he is, he can never truly know if he had what it takes to conquer this world by himself. Trying to hide his own shame he repeats again and again that ""winners need no rationalizations"" or ""pirates always betray their allies"".      Even if ""there's no such thing as playing dirty in a battle between pirates"", both Luffy and Kaido know that their victories are only their own if they did it by themselves. In the past, Kaido believed that he was the only one that could change the world and, although he has reached the top of the pirate's hierarchy, he doesn't feel like he has accomplished anything at all. While he drowns himself in sorrow and in alcohol, he sees the ""losers"" to be praised and admired. Even his own daughter looks up to his enemy and 20 years after his most shameful victory, the World's Government seems to believe Luffy is a bigger threat than him: his own worst enemy doubts his relevance.     I can not stop to think how amazing his flashback will be... <SEP> This should be top comment,you summarize kaido inner conflict really well,trauma from his wins is such cool things that its only acceptable on kaido,very well said"

He is not himself providing military decisions/strategy, so it's not like the act would compromise Ukraine's military strength.  If Russia ever possibly wants an agreement at some point, a living Zelensky is their best hope to have Ukraine accept peace. I know it seems unlikely that there could be a Russian agreement that could be acceptable, but at some point it's possible Russia recognizes that ""victory"" would be even worse than trying to hold Afghanistan was, and they need some face-saving way out of this mess.  That could lead to a withdrawal that Zelensky would accept for the sake of peace with some concession to let Russians claim some sort of victory (substantial or superficial)."

430	-1	r/politics <SEP> I'd call him naive but he *wants* to provoke Putin.  Republicans seem to yearn for nuclear war and chaos. Especially End-Times Republicans like Lindsey Graham.    Putin is the highest profile proponent of assassinations I'm aware of.  At least one assassination attempt against Volodymyr Zelensky has already been foiled.  It's unlikely that anyone in the West would mind if he was taken out, because he's already proven he's more than willing to take that route himself.    That's a far cry from publicly calling for it though, or even attempting it.  Publicly calling for assassination and failed assassinations are a good way to escalate a conflict against Putin.  Lindsey Graham knows that.  Escalation is what he wants. <SEP> Its not necessarily what he wants. Its probably what the big donors with the military contracts want though so of course thats what hell push for.

Baghera, aka Irina Starikova, would actually be a Serb, Daniela Lazovic, a former handball player, who has a crime-ridden past in her country. She was for a time a nun, with the name of Mother Xenia, at Gornji Milanovac, then she was convicted of drug trafficking, switched to Islam, and from 2014 she ended up in Ukraine, where she joined the pro-Russian separatist forces in the east of the country, in Donbas. <SEP> She probably has quite the story to tell. And I also imagine she easily avoided capture being the opposite sex. Even when dressed in fatigues. She probably tried to play it off like she stole them off a dead soldier.

Honestly considering the situation, it would make more sense for the Ukrainian side to blame Russians for doing this, as it would escalate the willingness of involvement from the west. Its possible that this is a controlled situation.  Not saying thats what is happening, if it is and it is a controlled situation that is just supposed to bring attention, it is strategically a smart move.  Noone is going to ignore that.  If its Russians, then I would really be interested in why the fuck are they doing that.

688	-1	r/BestofRedditorUpdates <SEP> When I was working as a secretary, I handled the fun things like birthdays and potlucks for our team and also volunteered on our Fun Committee. I made the birthday list opt in because there are people who enjoy being the center of attention and, for people like me who dont enjoy it, we were still able to participate.   At the beginning of each month, Id get a cake (half chocolate, half vanilla - these days I would definitely be more conscious of dietary restrictions and things) and send out an email stating that were having cake at 2pm to celebrate X, Y, Zs, and anyone elses birthday. There was no singing or anything. People could come and get a slice of cake if they wanted it or they could decide not to. It wasnt mandatory or anything.  I also tried to be as accommodating with potlucks. Not everyone wants to participate. We had sign up sheets at the secretary desks that included things like plates, cups, plasticware, etc. People could also give a couple of bucks (which wasnt our idea, it was theirstheyd come up to our desks and say they didnt have time to make anything) and wed go and buy things that were needed on the day of. Because we also knew that people might want to participate but not have the time/energy/whatever to make something. No one was ever punished if they didnt bring something. People from other departments would often come by and get food too.  I can *understand* the head of the Fun Committees thought process about wanting to make OOP feel included but once OOP said she didnt want to participate, that should have been the end of it. Period. Full Stop. Exclamation Point.  I feel so bad for OOP. **Especially** for feeling like she wanted to end it all but even the fact that she was considering leaving over it. IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT FAR. <SEP> I'm sure your fun committee is infallible but you're missing the point.  People are gonna people and if you need them to not then you have to communicate in a 2 way manner and have dialogue. Yes sometimes it sucks but that's reality and expecting anything different is just setting yourself up for disaster.

367	1	"r/MaliciousCompliance <SEP> I worked for years at a large Australian company three decades ago. About 5k employees.  At one stage our IT manager resigned and to fill the void temporarily they assigned the head of accounting department as temporary head of IT too.  And it was a disaster. If you wanted something cheap (floppy disks? Network cable? a mouse? ) we had cupboards full of them. Several hundred floppies, dozens of mice, dozens of cables. But if you wanted something expensive, you couldn;t get it at all. It would never get approved  Now, this was back in the time of the 386/486 pc. Back then, computers were changing rapidly. Going from 10mhz to 200mhz in the space of a few years. If your laptop was out of date by a year it would be slow to run the latest software. If it was out of date by two years you might not be able to run it at all.  At the same time, the business was rapidly expanding. And I mean rapidly. I worked there for 13 years; in that time we went from having 30 outlets to more than 480. So our computing needs were rapidly expanding too. Not just laptops, but mini computers used to run the entire company's back end at head office.  So IT would put in requests and they were always denied, especially if they were expensive. When they eventually requested an entire refit of the IT room, new minicomputers and upgraded systems...coming in at millions of dollars or more..it was of course denied. And denied. And denied. After several years of this our systems were rapidly approaching breakdown point.  In the end the accounting chief was fired (not just as being head of IT, but as head of accounting too.) and they got an actual IT manager who immediately authorized and arranged the upgrading of our systems.  I remember one of our IT guys complaining about the old accountant: ""He knows the price of everything and the value of nothing""  That quote always stuck with me. <SEP> I have refused positions at companies where theres an accountant running IT.  In 20+ years have had exactly zero success with one of them in charge of IT."

The really asinine thing about that argument, though I'm not surprised they don't know their own philosophy, is that exposure to information makes you realize what you are. Reading the Bible doesn't make you a Christian, it helps you realize you're one. Just like a book or movie or video game or any piece of media doesn't make someone LGBTQIA+, it just helps them realize and discover what they are in a safe environment. <SEP> Also reading the bible often helps you realize what nonsense it all is. It's part creation myth, flood myth, and so on. There's stories of giants and angel's. Talking snakes, and a guy that says good fruit can't come from a bad tree and bad fruit can't come from a good tree and not only is that totally wrong for a metaphor for religion considering one of the guys he himself called to apostlehood when organizing his own religion turned out to be 'bad fruit,, but also it doesn't make make sense for actual fruit and trees, every tree turns out both unless it's one VERY heavily graphed and pampered tree, and even then, it will likely still make at least one bad fruit.

958	1	r/blackmagicfuckery <SEP> Many moons ago, in my stoner days, me and my friends rolled an unprecedentedly large joint. There were around 7 or 8 people smoking it and 2 of us built it. We put a small part of a lighter flint right in the middle of it and decided to let it be a surprise for the others.   In true stoner fashion we completely forgot ourselves and we all shit ourselves in harmony when the joint fizzled and the flint dropped out and popped on the floor like this. Good times, we were morons <SEP> Wtfffff thats hilarious
187	1	r/MadeMeSmile <SEP> I was a bit older than my fresh-from-college colleagues and they immediately treated a new girl like garbage. I took up for her, some people almost got fired for how they were treating her. I got her to where she was comfortable and people started respecting her. Then she started treating me like the outcast <SEP> I too was older than my peers, and a similar situation happened. So, I rubbed my awkward balls on his pillow. That night, I laughed myself to sleep.
265	1	r/marvelstudios <SEP> Interesting how they switched her suit colors (presumably in post) since it's blue with red trim here, but red with blue trim in the movie. <SEP> Wait till you find out Peters new integrated suit was CGIed after he filmed the movie wearing the updated FFH suit
364	-1	r/PublicFreakout <SEP> To be fair, every day Russians have been lied to their entire lives. They may have witnessed their fellow citizens being forcibly arrested for speaking out against the war and putin. <SEP> Imagine thinking you, a redditor who consumes nothing but western media all day, know more about Russia than Russians.
872	1	"r/MurderedByWords <SEP> As a guy with schizophrenia, i can say that most people outside family, thinks that we are all crazy murdering machine, that always listen to the voice in the head (and yes i know there are other stuff that schizophrenia does), and that we are Dangerous to society, and should be locked in a mental house. Also most of the time people dont ""recover"" from their schizophrenic disorder. You can lower it to a minum, but almost never zero, (this is stuff my medic told me, and i mean the last part, about recovering), infact, i have been taking medicine for about 5 years, but i have been schizophrenic since i have been 6 (and now im 21), the reason i didnt say  this before to a doctor was because, in the media people like me are Always portrayed as bad people, and as soon they discover someone is schizophrenic they lock him up. And the situation is not getting better. <SEP> The ironic thing about people claiming schizophrenics are dangerous, is that they're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than a perpetrator. The general populace are more of a danger to schizophrenics than schizophrenics are to the general populace.  Those of us who know about this condition support and trust you. You're doing a great job."
636	0	r/TwoSentenceHorror <SEP> Well she came back from the dead, so I don't think you're getting out of this one either. <SEP> It's time to party like this guy's wife is in 1999 pieces. And she is
220	1	r/trippinthroughtime <SEP> Seriously! What degenerate is throwing chicken wing bones on the sidewalk? <SEP> I cant count  times I have had to wrestle a chicken bone from my dogs mouth on a walk. People just throw them on the side of the road like its nothing
256	0	r/TwoXChromosomes <SEP> Out of curiosity, in the circumstance where the guy is totally fine with going into the gay strip club, what's the recourse? What's plan B? <SEP> Better drinks, better music, tip your waiter
114	-1	r/news <SEP> Somewhat related - has anyone else noticed a HUGE drop in just general right wing troll/concern troll/I'm not a republican BUT/etc posting ever since the Russians got sanctioned? <SEP> They've started up on Reddit the last two days again.
466	-1	r/todayilearned <SEP> I read the article just to find out if alcohol was involved, it was. Probably part of how she got lost but also why she survived! <SEP> Im curious as to what affects alcohol would have on her surviving?
324	1	"r/ABoringDystopia <SEP> Translation for those that aren't Canadian:  ""I'm bringing up an issue that people care about to get re-elected, I wouldn't address it if given power, but pointing it out gets me votes""  ""That issue harms my image so I'm not going to address it, instead I'm going to brag about something tangential because I want to appear strong and get votes""  ....and repeat until anyone watching has become completely disillusioned and accepts our horrifying dystopia as unavoidable. <SEP> If a politician answers a question it's almost never good. In this case no matter what he answers it's gonna be bad.   He could say housing costs have increased substantially. That would be bad since a lot of people can't afford a home. If we were to say housing is stable he would be criticized about making housing not a viable investment for older traditionally Tory voters.   Loose-loose. Best outcome is to not answer."
65	-1	r/antiwork <SEP> Plutocrat to be exact <SEP> Kleptocrat is more like it. How else can you explain the rise of so many Billionaires while its wage stagnation for the rest?
994	1	r/aww <SEP> My mother would unironically do something like this to wake me up. She would ever so slightly open the door of my room, wide enough that the smell of what she was currently cooking creeped in. <SEP> Your mother sounds like an angel.
408	0	r/facepalm <SEP> The Bethesda npc is running out of dialogue options <SEP> Need something?
320	1	r/todayilearned <SEP> I learned during my ER rotation that youre not dead til youre *warm* and dead. Cold and dead doesnt count. <SEP> I got the chance to see a demonstration of a then-developmental (IDK if it was ever approved or used) method of corpsicle revival, where they would make incisions in the abdomen and insert warm saline bladders directly into the abdominal cavity.  You could increase someone's core temperature in seconds.    So while maybe survivable, freezing in this way is not something I'd like to try.
400	-1	r/news <SEP> Good.  Shut down all state propaganda and do Fox News next. <SEP> >Shut down all state propaganda  Does this include US propangda? Because voice of America is one of the bigger broadcasts out There and its fully owned by the US.    And I don't know what legal arguments you'd use against Fox that wouldn't be shot down by the courts, but am curious.

10	-1	r/ThatsInsane <SEP> Terrible. Its starting to look like iraq <SEP> I get that most of the world ignored what Russia did in Syria a few years ago but HELLO, this isn't the first time they've bombed innocent civilians, hospitals, etc. They've been accused of plenty of war crimes there and where the fuck have the consequences been? But yeah, this is happening in Europe (white people) so now we care apparently.
27	1	r/MurderedByWords <SEP> Who has time for hard to get? I understand the fun of flirting and a playful back-and-forth between potential lovers, but operating with misapprehensions and uncertainty seems like an exhausting waste of personal resources. <SEP> Hard to get is generally employed by people who know they don't really have anything else going to them. The problem is once you get them, you find out.
597	1	r/IdiotsInCars <SEP> Extremely dangerous to roll over like that with cars around. Should've just picked a quieter strip of road. <SEP> Almost as inconsiderate as splattering mud all over the road, which will now get on peoples tires.
963	0	r/RocketLeague <SEP> what does it stand for anyway? <SEP> Psyonix Network
212	0	r/bi_irl <SEP> Bring back this look <SEP> The look is a product of the sports. Guys used to cut their shirts below the chest pads to stay cool during summer football practices. It helps a shit load having some air cool you down when youre drenched in hot sweat
930	1	r/science <SEP> There are like 22 forms of matter. What do they mean by 5th state? <SEP> This is the question I came here to ask. Are we not counting Bose- Einstein condensates? What about quark-gluon plasma? What about superconductivity? And so on . . .
322	1	r/cats <SEP> I haven' t been following your story, just saw this post, but I am so glad you and your kitty are safe! I tell my cat whenever we see stories about people fleeing with their pets how fortunate he is for not having to go through it. <SEP> I've been doing the same w my 5 kitties.  Glad this girl is safe!
488	-1	r/mildlyinfuriating <SEP> Not sure if I wouldn't eat it because I can't identify it or because it is undercooked. <SEP> Its pasteurized you only need to warm it. In fact you could brush your teeth with it.

975	1	r/clevercomebacks <SEP> The boomers didn't fight in world war 2, their parents did, I don't get why they love to deride people about something they never did themselves. <SEP> Literally 0 Boomers were alive during WWII.
732	-1	r/cats <SEP> Yep. Can confirm. There was a neighbourhood cat who wasn't getting enough attention at home, so she wandered into mine and started living there and I bought food, treats, toys and catnip for her. <SEP> How do you know the cat wasn't getting enough attention at home?
118	0	r/antiwork <SEP> Reddit learned a new word and now will overuse it everywhere to the point it will lose all meaning.  Edit: I'm not necessarily saying that it doesn't apply here but I'll give it a week or two before every wealthy person will be branded as oligarch. <SEP> Damn son, I guess those Rubles are getting out of Russia somehow.
165	1	r/politics <SEP> Excerpt:  >Shortly after the 2020 election, as ballots were still being counted, the top data expert in President Donald J. Trumps re-election campaign told him bluntly that he was going to lose.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Yet Mr. Trump  time and again  discounted the facts, the data and many of his own advisers as he continued to promote the lie of a stolen election, according to hundreds of pages of exhibits, interview transcripts and email correspondence assembled by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack for a legal filing released late Wednesday.   >   >In laying out the account, the panel revealed the basis of what its investigators believe could be a criminal case against Mr. Trump. At its core is the argument that, in repeatedly rejecting the truth that he had lost the 2020 election  including the assertions of his own campaign aides, White House lawyers, two successive attorneys general and federal investigators  Mr. Trump was not just being stubborn or ignorant about his defeat, he was knowingly perpetrating a fraud on the United States.  This is a different article from [yesterday's related NY Times article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/t5hs7p/jan_6_committee_lays_out_potential_criminal/). <SEP> I mean he started the lie of a stolen election before the election. It was a key question during the debates. He actually said the same thing about the 2016 election, but he won.  https://youtu.be/pAru83kBtnw

245	1	r/gifsthatendtoosoon <SEP> Is this an advertiser bot?  I mean, cool mat, but there's a camera in the bathroom and you're copy pasting the link to the product all over the comments? Sounds fishy to me. <SEP> that's exactly what this is
