801	1	r/Catswhoyell <SEP> In the Discworld books, reincarnation doesn't necessarily happen in a linear order.  For instance, if you died, your next reincarnation could be as another person, born next week, or it could be in a wood worm, born thousands of years ago.  It's kind of a karmic toss-up.     I mention all of that because, on some level, I believe that I may be karmically connected to the soul of this cat. <SEP> Hahahaha right, her little glare is so relatable
792	-1	r/unpopularopinion <SEP> Thats like if you invited someone to a birthday party and they came just for the cake and goodie bag at the end. Its rude. <SEP> To be fair she did state they had to pay for they're dinner it's not free, it might be an open bar but it might not, if you pat for food and drinks the only thing left is socializing and congratulations which you can do at a supermarket, so they're not really taking them for a ride.
858	1	r/BestofRedditorUpdates <SEP> Sorry but I find it ridiculous that she needs to share her trauma to not want a birthday party. Like it turned out for the best as it finally encouraged her to get help, but if someone doesnt want a birthday party then they shouldnt get one  Edit: its bizarre that this is something considered as an accommodation like this isnt normal at work place locations for it to be considered an accommodation. <SEP> I was thinking the same thing, disability accommodations are for your actual job, not for personal things like workplace birthday parties. No means no, regardless of the context. It's really very simple.
611	1	r/clevercomebacks <SEP> There's nothing clever about this comeback, a basic bratty response. Why is everyone acting like it's weird to expect a compliment on a first date..? It's not the end of the world that you didn't get one but it's completely valid to be disappointed if you were interested in the person and they had nothing nice to say. <SEP> This is how the black community is. Up is down. A woman cant even expect a compliment

Does that mean they're going to have a hard time even buying a loaf of bread if it's not made in Russia? <SEP> Well difficult to say right now, but probably something like that, maybe not quite to that extreme, but considering the ruble lost 20% of its value, Russia won't be able to trade many products with Europe (both buying and selling), also many private companies stopped operating in Russia, so yeah, foreign products just became 20% more expensive overnight, at least, and local products will be more expensive because almost nothing is 100% produced in one country

40	-1	r/unpopularopinion <SEP> This is an incredibly popular opinion, as you can see by the comments.  Personally I like Starbucks, I find it to be much better than the other chains and if you arent getting complicated drinks its actually not that bad on pricing ($2 for a coffee). Plus the app is great for easy ordering and pick up, and the breakfast sandwiches are only a few dollars. Then you get rewards and free refills if youre a gold member.  At least it doesnt give me the shits like Taco Bell. <SEP> You must not be used to fiber if Taco Bell gives you the shits.  People always say this, but I've never known anyone that actually had the issue.

Funny thing is if they just stayed silent and didn't donate anything at all no one would have complained. <SEP> To be fair people absolutely do complain about huge companies not distributing their wealth to the right places. You just dont see coordinated backlash against any particular company for not donating because, why would you. Theres so many companies. Usually its a more broad scale discussion, because there is no incentive to unite against any one random big brand that hasnt donated yet.  This is definitely better than nothing and should have a good impact. I think people just wish it was more than this.

536	1	r/tattoos <SEP> Hello from Oklahoma! Shocked.   My almost 6yo daughter has been obsessed with foxes & snakes (specifically, her favorite color blue) since she was 2.5.  Shes been talking about her first tattoo for years. (Specifically a blue snake, wrapped around her arm.)  I *had* to show her this. She thinks youre the coolest person in the world & wants to visit Lithuania now, someday.   Thank you so much for sharing.   The color work is so visually striking! <SEP> > Shes been talking about her first tattoo for years. (Specifically a blue snake, wrapped around her arm.)  You might already know about this, but you can order custom temporary tattoos online or buy tattoo paper that lets you print them at home.

694	-1	r/TwoXChromosomes <SEP> It's perfectly possible he was being 'a little' emotionally blind and had no idea he was doing anything wrong by you at all, esp with drink involved. Men and women have different understanding of emotional situations. Talk your feelings through with him, help him understand you better. If it keeps happening and you don't like it then both review the foundation of your relationship.   Reddit people are often too keen to beat down on unpleasant situations like this, but it can be a chance for you both to grow.   Good relationships are rarely a bed of roses.Good luck!   (M) <SEP> Although I can appreciate alternative views to the majority for the sake of discourse and a broader perspective, respectfully, I have to strongly disagree. This comes across as if you are making excuses for his behavior while asking OP to coddle her ex fianc and reconsider putting herself first in a clearly disrespectful situation.   He complimented his ex in a way that heavily implies sexual admiration and said he wishes he was still there while his fianc is in the other room with his kids. That statement alone is enough of a reason to peace out, without factoring in any other flirting that occurred. He was testing the waters as far as Im concerned. That is definitely not emotional blindness. Its not like he was schmoozing at a company party and went too far to bond with colleagues (although even that isnt acceptable but perhaps may be more easily forgiven).  In my opinion, there is no reason to continue especially when he is mean to her independent of the ex being a factor. Relationships are not always easy but many people overlook glaring red flags and put up with things they absolutely shouldnt just to not be single. It sounds like this was the last straw for OP and I commend her for having the courage to disengage instead of pushing her intuition aside for a man that she will ultimately be unhappy with.

They're about 15 bucks more a pair, and totally worth it!
984	1	r/PixelArt <SEP> ... I really like this, but, at risk of being attacked by others, I wanna say that... The first two-part attack feels off somehow. Like, the motion of her body seems wrong. I can't put my finger on it, because she's rooted to the ground so she can't have the force of her movements push her back or anything... It's very nice though! The second half is perfect, too! <SEP> I think maybe it's how the first two hits are similar but the body movements for them are basically opposite, leaning into the first one but then pushed back by the second

If you aren't an experienced snowboarder rope tows are almost impossible (compared to a modern chairlift at least). Much much easier on skis. <SEP> What?!

508	0	r/DiWHY <SEP> My kids in a single day found 2 six leaf clovers and 2 four leaf clovers in our front yard. They cannot be that rare. <SEP> Once you find one, youre more likely to find another since the og four leaf clover often successfully populates the patch, spreading the mutation.  5 and 6 leaf clovers usually have a slightly thicker stem because they are most often the result of the two clovers growing right against each other fusing. Ive seen fused dandelions, too.  Even if the 1 in 10,000 statistic is true, a single walk through a park youll probably encounter many times that amount. So as a percentage of the population they are rare, but clovers are so common even the rare ones arent that rare.  Also, some folks are really good at pattern recognition. My mother and I both are quite good at finding four leaf clovers. ADHD and autism, since they result in good pattern recognition skills, can lead to this ability. In the case of me and my mother, its ADHD.
