93	1	r/WhitePeopleTwitter <SEP> My husband is a retired veteran. We always knew the GOP was full of hot shit when it came to military members and/or families. Watching Vietnam vets fight for anything told me all I ever needed to know. Officers get massive pay and retirement in comparison to enlisted, also. My husband joined because his family was sabotaging us constantly. Good thing we dont live over there now. My own FIL is making jokes about exterminating us in their coming civil war. Most of those cowards never served society in any way. <SEP> Better stay in practice with the guns then. I too think a war is coming, but Ill be on the side that takes care of veterans.

Edit: I mean nerd as a term of endearment. I myself am a bit of a nerd. <SEP> Intimidation in of itself in the right flavor is hot. Thus doms and domanatrixes. And for people into that tall is just a checkbox on the list.

Clearly it's mainly a display of skill, use of materials etc. posting this type of thing strongly disregards the idea of haute couture, even if it might be tasteless or whatever.   So in a sense it's like, ""awful taste (I'll disregard that though), but lacklustre execution"" for me.  Haute Couture here is like posting trump quotes on /r/PoliticalHumor"

Fun fact: this video got pulled because Tiktok thought i was actually wanting tohave sex with these people or something, which rewatching it, I maybe shouldve been a little lesssarcastic?  Its funny because i purposely said intercourse because i thought it was a safe word to use without getting banned lol  I dont know I was just fucking annoyed that day and seeing all these corny goofballs who post this boring trash with zero creativity and my breakdown was everyone elses enjoyment so win win baby! <SEP> Your ubrupt realization at the end, that you need to delete TikTok, is such an amazing payoff.

583	1	"r/BlackPeopleTwitter <SEP> For every 1 person who makes it, there's a thousand of us fighting for that very same progression who get pushed out and knocked down. I'm totally making up the numbers, but from what I've witnessed, society tends to treat the timeline of African-American progression as stepwise, where one person is somehow *willing* to beat the odds stacked against them and overcome systemic injustice through hard work and diligence.   The reality, actually, is that there are a fuck ton of us that are *willing* to fight against it, but that the systemic barriers are stacked high, as well as the (typically White) people who we would need to depend on for logistical support are shoddy at best. Often times, its the ignorant actions of someone who had the power to help us move forward that prevented us from success, or knocked us down. Less often (but still prevalent) is it (typically White) people's deliberate actions keeping us from success.   TL;DR - For every Kentaji Brown Jackson, there's at least a thousand others like her who ""didn't make it"" not because they didn't work hard enough, but because they were pushed out or knocked down. Society normalizes it and then glamorizes those who happen to beat such extreme odds. <SEP> Alladis! In June of 2020 I watched a panel of Black percussionists where one of them said the same thingthere are tons of us out here *willing* to fight, but so many are knocked down and pushed out, and a ton of people are fighting with no personal support system to have their back when it gets to be too much."
373	1	r/news <SEP> It would seem like he's trying to pull other nations into the war <SEP> Escalation is all Russia knows how to do. Since the days of the USSR their primary strategy in international conflict is to play the world's most dangerous game of Chicken, and win by being the most reckless, suicidal and deranged guy in the group, even if it meant causing disproportionate harm to themselves in the process.  The only thing they know how to do is being a guy wearing a bomb vest threatening to blow up everyone in the room if they don't comply with their unreasonable demands.  It has never worked before.

I guess because social media has made it easier for people to connect they now have easier choice, so they can reject ""shorter"" guys pretty easily and move on to the next... not like in the olden timesy days when you basically scoped out your little town for dudes to go on dates with and that was the jist your choices. <SEP> Yep, people have become incredibly shallow."

I can't seem to do big vague goals but I've been noticing that if I set smaller goals, fo them, I do feel a bit relieved afterwards.

I get that less hours allow access to more activities but I get paid per hour if i get paid the same way for 8 hours a day having 8 hours less of my pay per week wouldn't sound great maybe better overtime if I did work over 32.

892	1	r/DiWHY <SEP> My kids in a single day found 2 six leaf clovers and 2 four leaf clovers in our front yard. They cannot be that rare. <SEP> Once you find one, youre more likely to find another since the og four leaf clover often successfully populates the patch, spreading the mutation.  5 and 6 leaf clovers usually have a slightly thicker stem because they are most often the result of the two clovers growing right against each other fusing. Ive seen fused dandelions, too.  Even if the 1 in 10,000 statistic is true, a single walk through a park youll probably encounter many times that amount. So as a percentage of the population they are rare, but clovers are so common even the rare ones arent that rare.  Also, some folks are really good at pattern recognition. My mother and I both are quite good at finding four leaf clovers. ADHD and autism, since they result in good pattern recognition skills, can lead to this ability. In the case of me and my mother, its ADHD.

She thinks youre the coolest person in the world & wants to visit Lithuania now, someday.   Thank you so much for sharing.   The color work is so visually striking! <SEP> That's so sweet!

379	1	r/TheRightCantMeme <SEP> What these people dont realize is that kids dont care about stuff like this. Theyre mostly oblivious because they havent learned to be judgemental yet. <SEP> I'm sure they think it's programming kids to throw away traditional values and brain washing them to blah blah blah.  They act as if a purse is inherently for girls.  As if it's a something any female bodied person just pops out of the womb with.  It's just a fucking bag...
905	-1	"r/AdviceAnimals <SEP> Because most people who are pro-life are really just using it as an excuse to punish women for having sex. If you got pregnant it's because you're a bad woman and that's your punishment, and if you die in childbirth, well that's just another moral reflection on how you deserved to be punished for your sinning womanly ways. It's about being able to control women, and if they were better (ie waited until marriage to have sex or were wealthier and could afford a better hospital) they would still be alive and ""God wouldn't have punished them for sinning"" <SEP> Married women can't have abortions either, so your point of it being a punishment for having sex doesn't make sense."
860	-1	r/space <SEP> Is that why global warming and cooling happens? <SEP> No. Anthropogenic warming/cooling is due to humans, but the orbits (and the current tilt of the Earth) can and do affect the planets temperature, but only over tens of thousands of years and longer.

One that sadly I have fallen into in terms of having bad luck finding groups. So far only one out of the few i have found has actually been nice. The others were discord servers and weeelllllll..... The admin/DM team on the ones I ventured in where shit. Bad management and bad attitude overall. But it is what it is  i stopped search for a server/group for now to give it a break.
797	1	r/Catswhoyell <SEP> In the Discworld books, reincarnation doesn't necessarily happen in a linear order.  For instance, if you died, your next reincarnation could be as another person, born next week, or it could be in a wood worm, born thousands of years ago.  It's kind of a karmic toss-up.     I mention all of that because, on some level, I believe that I may be karmically connected to the soul of this cat. <SEP> This is so poetic
110	-1	"r/TheLastAirbender <SEP> Can we stop with this ""14 years old...""?  She's character, not real person. The writers wrote those lines not she. Writers are not 14 years old.  Sure those are great lines, and sound better if teenage character is saying it, but there is no 14 year old who said those words. <SEP> I think you underestimate the edginess of a brooding 14 year old with a power complex and a host of familial issues, all of which might describe any number of teenagers significantly less psychopathic than Azula. Im sure her character had plenty of time to come up with as many intimidating one liners as she felt necessary to boss around her underlings and friends during Prince Zukos exilefor whom Im sure most had been at the ready in case he should slink back to the Fire Kingdom further disgraced by failure to capture the Avatar.  We can all invalidate the wit of a character based on the skill of the writer, but a compelling character has their own internal dialogue which too can be fascinating."

I got mine online for $8/piece a few years ago. They run on AA batteries and have a sensor that only turns on the bright red light at night which helps make it last.  [These are the ones.

Edit: wow, my first gold award.

690	-1	r/marvelstudios <SEP> Of course he cant be gay. Cause God forbid you make Peter give an inkling that he might at least have 1% interest in dudes and society will collapse into a black hole because being gay bad <SEP> Or making a character who's been straight for his entire existence gay out of nowhere is stupid? Make a new character if you want a gay Spiderman so badly.
794	0	r/lotrmemes <SEP> How many did you eat? <SEP> No one wants to admit they are nine loaves of Lembas bread, but I did and Im ashamed of myself. The first loaf doesnt count, then you get to the second and third, the fourth and fifth I think I burned with the blowtorch then I just kept eating.
719	1	r/unpopularopinion <SEP> I completely disagree with anyone saying this is rude.  Most people I know prefer this.  The bride and groom are very aware of how long catholic services are and probably dont care who comes to the wedding.  Close friends and family to the wedding, all the friends to the reception is perfectly normal <SEP> 100% this. Im not sure what all the downvoting is about but I can tel you for a fact that Ive never been to a catholic wedding where there were more people at the religious ceremony part than at the party, mostly because so many of my family members are working class folks who cant exactly take extra time off work to go to everything.
561	1	r/BlackPeopleTwitter <SEP> I used to be embarrassed about having to go to community college because I couldnt afford the state school I wanted to go to. It changed my life completely and was the best educational experience I ever had. It helped me discover my true passion. Now Im a tenured professor at the same community college I attended 15 years ago and I cant imagine being anywhere else. <SEP> We had similar experiences. Some of the best professors I had were at my CC. It also felt great being able to graduate without any debt. Friends were forced to take whatever job in order to start paying off their debts. I was able to take my time with little stress.
375	1	"r/Undertale <SEP> okay, since I'm bearing that fact with me for years now, may as well point it out here.     Did you know, that....     It is possible to finish the fight against asgore in neutral/pacifist without delivering the finishing blow?   Similar to how Toriel stops the fight entirely after healing you, when you attempt to kill yourself successfully during her \*Fireballs avoid you\* phase, if the next attack against asgore will kill him (it was indicated by a specific text message appearing, can't remember it though), and you deliberately kill yourself during his attack (by either missing on purpose, or checking, or using a, preferably not healing, item), asgore will be like ""You'd rather lay down your life than take mine ? :'( What fool I was"", heals you and proceeds to deliver another usually untold line of dialogue before flowey kills him anyway. <SEP> What the fuck. I thought this was fanmade for a second  I still can't understand how there is so many obscure dialogue that a fan like me (on the fandom for 6 years) hasn't found out yet."

413	0	"r/iamatotalpieceofshit <SEP> Can someone translate or share a transcript of the conversation? <SEP> he seems to be speaking portuguese, he said ""I want my fucking money back"" and says ""I want my cell phone"" the woman says something about calling the police but you can't understand it very well, apparently the guy destroying the store wanted his money back and his cell phone back too, in the end he says that they can keep the cell he is returning and they will be arrested or something like that"

761	1	r/ukraine <SEP> Good to see our president out and about visiting them. <SEP> it sends a message to ukranians that the U.S. cares & to putin that he's f\*cked up !

35	-1	r/notinteresting <SEP> That might as well be my account.  I have one follower, follow one person, have one tweet. <SEP> youre not better than john
873	0	r/OldSchoolCool <SEP> peggy hill?!  also, how did she have enough hair for this style? <SEP> Hairspray, back combing and extra-wide rollers.  I think part of the reason womens hair got significantly smaller and less poofy in the 90s and never regained volume is that the ban on CFCs meant no more super-strong hairspray to support those kinds of hairstyles.
603	-1	r/CasualUK <SEP> I live opposite a park, watching kids kick and pull the heads of them adults while the parents sit there on their phones is kinda depressing. <SEP> You watched kids pulling the head off adults? I mean I've lived in rough places but that's going a bit far
402	1	r/Damnthatsinteresting <SEP> Fuck you Putin <SEP> Ditto!
517	-1	r/CasualUK <SEP> Hes not the weirdo slyly taking a photo of someone without their permission though. So hes got that going for him <SEP> You're a weirdo
866	-1	r/WTF <SEP> That damn thing is alive. Those parents are really anxious to get that inspection from the Child Welfare office. That damn thing is big enough to bite that kid's hand off. That's really stupid. <SEP> Such an American comment
511	0	r/nextfuckinglevel <SEP> When you're doing an impromptu jam like that, how do you decide who takes the melody line and when to hand it off? <SEP> You can use visual cues, natural pivots in the song, or slightly overpower. The goal is to compliment each other. Both these guys are skilled and can freestyle. They get it.
903	-1	r/movies <SEP> Lol just like twilight, comes, blow up, retires. On to the next big thing!   Honestly suprisse Harry Potter lasted for that long, <SEP> People still talk and think about Twilight a lot, especially with Stewart and Pattison having huge careers now

952	1	r/marvelmemes <SEP> This was a lovely moment <SEP> Even though its only a few seconds long, never fails to bring me to tears. So much is communicated through Andrews body language. Superb acting and writing.
512	-1	r/Damnthatsinteresting <SEP> Real threat to putin  Art   I guess now I know what to do with all those paintbrushes and crayons I have just gathering dust. Send them to Ukraine! <SEP> Youd be surprised how triggered Putin is with this flag. It was banned from his rally, along with the lgbt flag and the flag of Ukraine.
728	0	r/terriblefacebookmemes <SEP> I wanna know what studies they used to come to that 97% conclusion <SEP> Fun fact: 39% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
969	1	r/interestingasfuck <SEP> Nice gesture, but since the video cuts so quick, I have to say: one such bottle won't do much. <SEP> It's better than nothing but unlikely to be enough.
917	0	r/space <SEP> Is that why global warming and cooling happens? <SEP> Asking the important questions.
340	1	r/Military <SEP> General Patton wanted to use the Germans to fight the Russians. We should try to resurrect him or at least make a zombie version. <SEP> Yes. Interestingly enough too if I remember right in Otto Carius book he mentions towards the ending of the war Germans and Americans had a cease fire during fighting for a village and the officers of the two sides met to decide on an outcome. The American officers told the Germans to try and keep their guys alive because they may need them in the future to fight the Russians.
760	1	r/MadeMeSmile <SEP> Kids gonna be a great Jehovahs witness <SEP> This is a truly underrated comment

880	0	r/Unexpected <SEP> Is that Natasha lyonne? <SEP> Yes
741	0	r/Cringetopia <SEP> What was she planning to accomplish though? <SEP> well, if you asking unironically, she did that in hopes to erect officers penis, so him pressing her against a wall to arrest her could be considered sexual assault and she could get out of jail time/fine + sue the officer, gineous in a way if you ask me...
644	0	r/MovieDetails <SEP> I like the special instruction about the fact that keeping an amphibious rodent within city limits without a permit is illegal. Good to know.  Stepping back, I think the person who wrote Lebowski will be thrilled that someone found it. Cheers. <SEP> Sir, is that a capybara? Im gonna need to see your amphibious rodent permit.
190	1	r/LifeProTips <SEP> I had a pal who lived in an inner city pub. His car was broken into on a weekly basis, even if he left the glovebox open and the car completely empty.   I fitted two 10mm flashing red LEDs, on the dashboard just inside the windscreen, on a relay so when the ignition was on, the lights were off. When the key was removed, the lights would start flashing again, using virtually no power.  No one ever touched the car again. There was no alarm fitted, just two automatic big flashing red LEDs, total cost $10. <SEP> How do I purchase one of these??
102	-1	r/fuckcars <SEP> I dont get the hate for the car tunnel on here. If it was on a track would it be OK? Why? The Paris metro runs on rubber wheels. Is that not OK? Is it a capacity thing?  Yes, fuck cars, but the Elon Tunnel is basically just an underground people mover I dont understand why anyone would be against it. <SEP> In the sense of moving people it might as well not be there with how extremely few people it can serve. People are upset that so many resources were wasted on a useless bs project that took money away from actual solutions.
657	0	r/AnimalsBeingDerps <SEP> This was the first thing I saw when I opened reddit. I was not disappointed, lol. <SEP> Giving your pets static hair is so in right now. lol  Its always interesting to see the trends come and go.   I remember the blanket drop/disappear videos getting popular. Then there were a ton of videos of cats getting scared of lions/tigers.
569	0	r/wallstreetbets <SEP> Whats the answer? <SEP> 42
857	1	r/DiWHY <SEP> Pretty sure this is a joke? Especially given the ending lol. <SEP> Yes it's very clearly a joke. Doesn't really fit in this subreddit.... Although technically maybe it does but I think this sub is more about people who craft the weirdest shit and are serious about it
426	1	r/teenagers <SEP> I had a similar thing like that happen, it really is kinds sickening to see no one give a shit at the loss of a life <SEP> Life is just like. That no one cares for anyone unless they are of any use to them when they are used they are thrown out of life just like a soldier who's family knows his loss
961	1	"r/LeopardsAteMyFace <SEP> Jesus, is this real? This reminds me of the stories of black lung re-appearing. When we do things the right way for so long, it's like we lose the ability to understand the reason we do things that way.  I say ""we"" but I feel like it comes mainly from parts of society that reject science or safety protections until they have been personally affected. <SEP> >When we do things the right way for so long, it's like we lose the ability to understand the reason we do things that way.  It's like we have started thinking that people in the past came up with all these ornerous procedures just to be dickheads and not protect people."
296	1	"r/TheLastAirbender <SEP> My favorite line of hers was always Im about to celebrate becoming an only child I think thats how it goes <SEP> Dude when she says ""I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother"" and he replies ""No, you're not."" Is the coldest fucking scene"
470	-1	r/shittymoviedetails <SEP> This was literally posted a week ago. <SEP> why do people complain about this? the entire internet wasn't on reddit for the one day that you saw this posted. it's new to me and i'm sure it's new to hundreds of thousands of people that didn't see it the day you did *shrug emoji*
990	1	r/dankmemes <SEP> Not wife material. <SEP> And no big tities too.
224	1	"r/dndmemes <SEP> ""Nothing happened today and it was super uneventful""  Isn't news. It isn't worth mentioning. But murders? Thefts? Controversy? THATS worth talking about. Thus the only people who post experiences are posting BAD experiences. Most groups are fine and function perfectly well. <SEP> Agreed. Reminds me of Newsies:  *""How 'bout a crooked politician?""*  *""Hey, Stupid, that ain't news now more!""*"
693	1	r/MadeMeSmile <SEP> I always get scared that someone will smash their fingers in the door <SEP> We had glass windows next to the door, and I got locked out and banged my hand against the window and broke the glass. I'm so very fortunate it didn't hurt me
236	1	r/Superstonk <SEP> Anyone able to record the whole convo for those who missed? I was on dad duty w baby girl and missed the whole thing <SEP> If you go to u/dlauer s Twitter page. The link will still be there and it should have the recording
353	1	r/LifeProTips <SEP> Keep telling myself every morning Ill hit the gym <SEP> That was a big one for me.    I got really into running a few years back and at the start it as brutal.  But I knew I was just coming up with excuses: no its not too hot, no that tiny soreness doesnt mean I shouldnt go, I have time  I made it as easy for me to go as I could.  Plan to run today?  Get dressed for it early, shoes are downstairs, tell my wife Im running at X time.  MAKE it happen.
238	1	r/politics <SEP> Yes it's a good idea to publicly call for the assassination of a paranoid dictator with nuclear weapons. <SEP> Maybe they think the kompromat will go down with him and they can finally be free.
566	-1	r/UpliftingNews <SEP> The UK conservative government isn't doing this because they want to, they are doing it because they have to. In the UK today 100000s of people depend on food bank charities to feed themselves, this has been happening for years and could be solved. This government have no intention of doing so, and would rather se people starve. <SEP> >they are doing it because they have to  Youre comment doesnt actually explain this point at all.

995	-1	r/apexlegends <SEP> That's what the report feature is for, right?  <SEP> A dude being able to jitter aim isn't cheating, no?  It's quite bad that you see perfect out-of-combat aim and think they're cheating. Seriously, it's like 4x easier to aim when you're not thinking of enemy locations, healing, teammate status, etc.

9	-1	r/LateStageCapitalism <SEP> Lads. Its great youve learnt a new word and all but its not really about the USA right now. <SEP> Just because you're incapable of focusing on more than one issue at a time doesn't mean we all have to

Hooray!  <SEP> It's more like a water balloon that you keep filling until it bursts one day  It tends to leak a little when you get too drunk as well.
665	0	r/CuratedTumblr <SEP> I stopped drinking cow's milk ages ago and was literally prescribed dairy(including milk) this last month because I developed kidney problems.    being vegan would kill me, being vegetarian would land me in the hospital. :( <SEP> NGL being prescribed cheese and yogurt sounds excellent.
26	-1	"r/australia <SEP> As we all know, engaging in stunts to spite political opponents for cheap moral wins on technicality is the best way to reach peace, diplomacy and mutually beneficial terms, and not instead a main contributing factor to our currently strained and tenuous relations with China.  China isn't even supporting Russia, they're sitting on the fence and asking for negotiation and ceasing of conflict. Who cares about ""public opinion"", this is a political embassy, they should be engaging with Chinese politicians and their stances, not the citizens on the ground. Does not China's political stance being different than public opinion suggest that this pointless activism not be required, because China is already taking a more favourable position than we would otherwise expect of them?  ""No fucks given"" is not how you engage in diplomacy, it's how you further conflict. China is already asking for peace, what more do you want from them? <SEP> You...believe the CCP? You know Ukraine is part of their expansion initiative."
22	-1	r/fuckcars <SEP> Driving is really overrated <SEP> i actually dont think so. i think most people arent enthusiastic about driving everywhere, they just see it as the most viable option available because frankly, in america, it probably is

Ukraine doesn't stand much of a chance if they have to be the ones attacking to retake all their land.   *This is my very uneducated assumption*
325	-1	"r/ChoosingBeggars <SEP> Come on people. Are we gonna blindly believe shit just because it fits the sentiment of the sub? There's no other proof except for this one tweet. The students were scared shitless and you think they care abt USB ports and turbulence? <SEP> Also, sometimes people act silly to be tough.   I could totally see james bond escaping a war zone on and going ""the martini was stirred and the charger didnt work but the flight was alright""  Being facitous is pretty common. Instead of saying how you almost died andn your scared for your life you complain about the menu options. And tbf there are a lot of indians that are vegan for religious reasons"
923	1	r/worldnews <SEP> Finally someone said it! <SEP> As an official statement. Neat.
104	1	r/worldnews <SEP> Hey, here's an idea. Why doesn't someone assassinate Putey?  He's one fucking asshole trying to bully the rest of the world.  If anyone alive on this planet today deserves to be assassinated, it's the jerk who's threatening everyone else.    Before he is allowed to do any more damage, any more murders. <SEP> He's hiding in a bunker because he's paranoid (probably rightfully)
605	1	"r/nba <SEP> ""space jam 1 was just as much of a commercial as this one was, it's only nostalgia that makes you think it was better""  1 is infinitely more self aware, the scene where Wayne Knight goes ""**Get your Hanes on, lace up your Nikes, grab your Wheaties and your Gatorade, and we'll pick up a Big Mac on the way to the ballpark**"" is hilariously self aware and nothing from the 2nd one can compare.  And on the ""nothing can compare"" front, the best scene in Space Jam 1, the whole montage that starts with Barkley trying to play with the girls at the park, and them going from being really excited to not believing it's him, with Basketball Jones playing, and then the montage of all the players going to doctors and psychiatrists and church and so on...is perfect. Aint SHIT in Space Jam 2 coming close to that shit. <SEP> It's the difference in eras, I think. The original one definitely had a bit more of a cynical bend while this one was all brand and marketing obsessed."
234	1	r/2meirl4meirl <SEP> Honestly, if younger people normalised going to bed at 11pm instead of 1am it would solve a lot of problems. <SEP> Sleep is our only escape from reality. How are people not excited to sleep every night?

272	1	r/coolguides <SEP> I had a pager where my gf could page me 143 and it would display I LOVE YOU. 1999 feels very long ago all of a sudden. <SEP> Thats so cool! I wish my boyfriend in high school had that.  I remember that sending a repeat page with same numbers would just display a (2) or (3) etc, so I started getting creative and sending 143 a different way each time so each one would show as its own page.   114433 143143143 111444333 143114433 Etc.     I kept a little notepad on my desk with what I sent so I could keep sending unique codes.    Thanks for that nostalgia.
456	1	r/marvelmemes <SEP> Ive avoided trailers, except what was at the end of NWH. The best I can for the last 4 years. <SEP> I started doing this a few years ago for the Marvel movies and now I do it for movies in general. Am I definitely going to see it anyway? Then great I dont need to be spoiled, even by the style or the casting or anything at all. I saw Batman today and had no idea 3 big names actors were even in it. Its more fun this way! Im a big trailer-free advocate, no matter how hard it is.
712	1	r/unpopularopinion <SEP> Idk why people are upset with you. If you rsvp'd and are bringing gifts I don't think its even remotely rude. I wouldn't care at all at my wedding unless it was someone very close to me.  People are being weird. <SEP> Same. The bride most likely won't even know she wasn't there.
2	1	"r/IdiotsInCars <SEP> Car in front is an idiot for blocking and risking an accident. Just another dick swinging contest between two dumbasses. When a driver is obviously trying to rush, just let Them through. Best case scenario theyre reckless. Worst case scenario its a genuine emergency and youre holding them up. Also high speed crashes can kill. <SEP> Had someone come flying up behind me in the fast lane and rode my ass as I was passing a car in the middle lane. I changed lanes slowly to make a point and the dude pointed a gun at me.   Shit ain't worth it. Too many braindead morons with nothing to live for except ""respect""."
785	1	r/TwoXChromosomes <SEP> I ma so glad you are choosing you.   He is not going to be any better with her if they do get back together. He's asshole who wants what he can't have while denigrating what he does have. He lashes out at you and take you for granted. I'm so glad you aren't settling for less than you deserve. <SEP> Yep, I bet they were on rocky grounds before splitting too. It's easy to flirt when you know you're not going home at the end of the night. Noncommittal.   Doesnt excuse his behavior in the least.

855	1	r/marvelstudios <SEP> I mean, I'm all aboard with Peter eventually being with MJ, but it's still weird how insistent this is that Peter can't be gay, whether or not that would actually be a good storytelling idea. <SEP> Having a no gay rule makes you miss out on what could potentially be more compelling romantic relationships that develop organically over the course of the story between two characters of the same gender and is therefore a dumb rule that does nothing to further storytelling. Theyre lucky that in the MCU Peter has a cute girlfriend we all like and who is still alive and he and Ned have very intense wholesome friendship vibes so this may very well never come up as an issue but completely taking it off the table is just silly from a storytelling perspective
914	-1	r/ukraine <SEP> What the fuck is going on? Russia are meant to be a huge well equipped battle ready force. Whats next? China turns out to be a paper tiger too? If only all those nukes were fake that would be good. Maybe Putin thought the nukes were enough to use as intimidation alone? Im lost, the left are lunatics and the news stations I used to trust are full of lies. The right is a bit better but its got its fair share of lunatics. We are truly lost. We need some honesty in this world and less smearing cheating lying and stealing. <SEP> I am genuinely curious to know more about your point of view. I promise this is not a snarky Reddit comment, its coming from a good place. In the context of this war, why do you see the left as more lunatic than the right? From my pov, two of the *most* mainstream right figures (trump and tucker not some fringe part of the party) were openly praising Putin in February. Which mainstream left-side politician has done something equally foolish or lunatic (in the context of global relations)? Again, I ask because I really just want to know how you arrived at this conclusion.
29	-1	"r/UkrainianConflict <SEP> The fact the the FSB is warning him, means there are rational levers of power not under Putins control. As things get worse for Russia hopefully these forces ""alleviate the weight of leadership"" from old man Putin, sooner rather than later. <SEP> Or the info comes from western intelligence and he is just fucking around with Putins brain. Western intelligence says Putin is deeply paranoid. Spreading these rumors probably results in him not trusting anyone of his staff."

96	-1	r/memes <SEP> Just saw the video, if you dont know, DONT WATCH. <SEP> I watched it and seriously don't understand how it's sad  It's a badly drawn comic thing with cheesy music in the background, if it's sad I just can't take it seriously
214	1	"r/rarepuppers <SEP> Love the ending where he leans back and looks at the lady like, ""Hey, what's up."" <SEP> ""I know you saw everyone else petting me. Well, I'm waiting..."""
807	1	r/StarWars <SEP> Hey there was b-wings and wedge <SEP> Word. I put Snap Wexely. who's story with wedge in the Aftermath Trilogy takes you up to the Force Awakens. too bad they crapped on that storyline.

667	1	r/Cringetopia <SEP> Tee hee. Im just being an extra douche to show you what OTHER guys are like. Why cant you understand that you stupid bitch!?  Please call me. <SEP> That about sums it up for me.
483	-1	r/tech <SEP> Remember when he shared this wonderful tech with the Afghans we pounded for years? <SEP> You mean the tech that's just now being launched, including as recent as 15 hours ago?
460	-1	r/assholedesign <SEP> Good, let's not encourage homelessness <SEP> Fuck, man. You ever quit your job, leave your apartment, and choose homelessness because you saw a comfy ass bench that was just too good to pass up?
779	1	r/OneSecondBeforeDisast <SEP> I would really love to see the entire clip <SEP> Me too plz
507	-1	r/NoStupidQuestions <SEP> Who physically uses a bank anymore?  I am amazed they keep building them.  I am 54 and, as an individual (not a business), I haven't needed to go into a bank for decades.  I've bought cars, refinanced mortgages, paid bills, got cash, deposited checks via cell phone, moved financial assets around to different institutions, etc. without having to physically go into a bank.  I love technology!  It is removing so much inefficient bureaucracy from the system. <SEP> As an individual I literally never use the bank. As a business owner I tend to go maybe three times a week for deposits
120	1	r/sadcringe <SEP> Should of said 3 or 4. 13 is ridiculous. <SEP> I think the most orgasms a girl had with me in a night was like 3 or 4. And then she was fucking tired of it and simply didn't want any more. She didn't let me touch her anymore because everything was not feeling good anymore. Really, anything past 2 orgasms, it's rare that your girl wants to continue. Anything after that, it's chill and cuddle, shit's exhausting.
261	0	r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog <SEP> Why are there extra sounds? It's like there's a second sound track. <SEP> Dog smashed in a door with a bunch of stuff barricading it by the sounds of it

782	-1	"r/BlackPeopleTwitter <SEP> In b4 the ""college is useless"" bros.  <SEP> Certain degrees are ""useless"" if you view college as a financial investment."
821	-1	"r/news <SEP> In the list of ""Russia's lost generals"" in this article, with portraits of each general, one of them is a black silhouette. They don't have a picture of that particular general, but the silhouette looks familiar, doesn't it? It's just the guy from the thumbnail blacked out and flipped vertically, you can really tell by the edges of the ears.  I can picture the conversation between the editor and their graphics guy. ""We don't have a picture of Andrei, and the head cutout assets are already there for the other generals, let's just make a silhouette out of one of the others."" The graphics guy does it, they look at it and say, ""That's way too obvious, right? Okay just flip it vertically and let's publish this thing."" <SEP> Flipping it vertically would make it upside down."
867	1	r/nba <SEP> Lol I actually thought he was hilarious in it. The way he acted clueless about anything that wasnt basketball was pretty funny to me.  only watched half of the movie tho <SEP> I actually enjoyed the full movie! It wasnt as good as space jam 1 granted but the hate is completely overblown to me.
582	0	r/wallstreetbets <SEP> Well, whats the answer? I graduated law school in 2018 so we didnt have these updated textbooks <SEP> Lol my law books featured Ican and Milliken.
137	0	r/WinStupidPrizes <SEP> Bro did that actually go straight up her ass??? Look like that shit hurt. <SEP> I think it slipped up but not in. Quality of the video makes it look like it went inside. But the way she fell back shows that it was behind her. Likely scratched the hell out of her and left splinters on her cheeks.  Further inspection, looks like the top post split. One half going forward and the other half going into her ass cheek.
