2.15	P	There is an old and true saying that the Lord hates a quitter.

22.1	P	We are the United States of America.
10.15	P	There are, here and there, evil and baseless rumors against the Russians- rumors against the Britishâ€”rumors against our own American commanders in the field.

14.11	NP	Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the National Government.

47.17	P	The peace we make must remedy that wrong.

29.19	P	nothing, in the mean time, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United States have given such memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for national defense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their power.
0.6	NP	Most people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last 4 years.
12.10	P	Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago that I termed the Nation's welfare system "a monstrous, consuming outrage--an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly against the children that it is supposed to help."
11.18	NP	These restrictions within narrow limits of time and space give security even to our maritime cities during three quarter of the year, and to the country always.
4.14	NP	We should also open our doors to displaced persons without unfair discrimination.
1.20	NP	The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper means will not, I trust, need recommendation; but I can not forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a due attention to the post-office and post-roads.
9.3	NP	We'll work with the States to do it.
