298	1.0	"as a volunteer medical assistant I worked at an impromptu doctor's office in new orleans after hurricane katrina.. We set up tents in order to give our patients a little bit of privacy and unfortunately we were lacking in the equipment we needed. The doctors had to resort to somewhat extreme measures in order to help this ravaged population which meant reusing equipment that could be, and making sure everything was sterilized well in between patients. My job was to ensure proper cleaning. Due to the outdoor setup, the doctor I was working with had trouble determining the core temperature of patients using an oral thermometer, and began using a rectal thermometer, and instructed me to clean it using a 70 % alcohol solution. Obviously, no one really took well to this, but I guess for the most part, they had other things to worry about. But then one patient looked around the tent and saw the scarcity of tools and asked the doctor, ""is that the same thermometer you've been using on everyone before me?"" To which the doctor replied ""yes, but you shouldn't be concerned, my assistant has been sanitizing using 70% alcohol."" Visibly upset the man exclaimed ""what good is that when you've been sticking it in 100% butthole?"""

335	4.0	"A horse in a barn was listening to some rock and roll on the radio... And he was inspired. The guitarist was masterful, and the horse knew, then and there, that he needed to play guitar. More than anything he'd ever needed before.   So he calls up his buddy, who is a guitar teacher, and asks his buddy to help him learn guitar. The horse takes to it quickly and practices every day until he is just as good as the guys on the radio.  One day, while the horse was playing, the chicken overhears and is inspired, too. The chicken hops over to the horse and starts pecking at a bucket, creating a beat that perfectly accompanies the horse's guitar. The horse and the chicken play together every day for weeks. The chicken even found a drum set out back, and the two began making really phenomenal music.  A cow had been coming by to listen to the horse and the chicken play, and one day, she was inspired, too. She rooted around the back of the barn and pulled out a piano, and without a second thought, and nary a piano lesson to her name, integrated seamlessly with the horse and the chicken.  Now the horse, the chicken and the cow played some of the greatest rock and roll music anyone had ever heard. And, wouldn't you know it, a music producer just happened to visit the farm one day and heard the animals jamming out. He went to them with contracts and signed them that day.  The horse, the chicken, the cow and the producer wound up touring the country. They played everywhere and the people loved them. You could hardly turn the radio on without hearing one of their songs. The producer acted as manager and always made sure every gig ran smoothly and all their needs were met. It was a great arrangement, and everyone was very happy.  Then, one day, the horse got a phone call. His mother was very sick, and she asked the horse to come home to visit. So the horse tells the band and producer he needs to leave for a few days, but he'd meet them at their next concert.  The horse went home and saw his mother, and she was indeed very sick. She ended up dying shortly after, and the horse was devastated. He loved his mother, and wasn't at all prepared for her death.  The horse took care of what he could and prepared to fly back to his band at their next stop when he got another phone call. Their tour bus had been in a deadly accident, and the chicken, the cow and the producer had died.  The horse was dumbstruck. Such misfortune was unimaginable and he felt himself break inside. He had nothing left: his mother was gone and his career was over. He had lost his best friends and didn't know what to do next, so, in his depression, he decided to drink himself to death.  So the horse walks into a bar and the bartender asks, ""Hey, pal. Why the long face?"""

984	3.0	Jesus and Satan on computer Jesus and Satan were having an on-going argument about who was better on the computer. They had been going at it for days, and frankly God was tired of hearing all the bickering.  Finally fed up, God said, 'THAT'S IT! I have had enough. I am going to  set up a test that will run for two hours, and from those results, I will judge who does the better job.'  So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away.  They moused.  They faxed.  They e-mailed.  They e-mailed with attachments.  They downloaded.  They did spreadsheets!  They wrote reports.  They created labels and cards.  They created charts and graphs.  They did some genealogy reports .  They did every job known to man.  Jesus worked with heavenly efficiency and Satan was faster than hell.  Then, ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, rain poured, and, of course, the power went off..  Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld.  Jesus just sighed.  Finally the electricity came back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming:  'It's gone! It's all GONE! 'I lost everything when the power went out!'  Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours of work. Satan observed this and became irate. 'Wait!' he screamed. 'That's not fair! He cheated! How come he has all his work and I don't have any?'  God just shrugged and said,  JESUS SAVES.
522	0.0	A professional singer was contacted by a priest who asked if she would sing at the funeral of a homeless man with no family, who had recently passed away. Moved with compassion, the singer agreed. The priest informed her that, since he had no relatives or money, the man would be buried in a paupers grave in the countryside, and informed the singer she would have to drive herself. On the day of the funeral, the singer set out in her car following the directions she had been given, but quickly got lost on the unnamed backroads of the countryside. She drove around for over an hour, scouring the fields for anything that resembled a cemetery. Finally she came upon a field matching the priest’s description, and she could see people far off in the distance gathered around the open grave. She parked her car and quickly made her way through the field, but as she got closer she was dismayed to find that only the workers remained with their digging equipment, and they had already started filling the hole. The hearse, the priest, and any attendants of the funeral were obviously long-gone. Not knowing quite what to do, the singer approached the grave, only to find that the vault lid was already in place, and the workers had filled a considerable portion of the hole. The singer was crushed that she had missed the opportunity to pay respects to this unknown man, and moved with compassion, she began singing at the grave side. She poured her heart into the most beautiful rendition of “Amazing Grace” she had ever sang. The workers stopped shoveling dirt and took off their hard hats, and their eyes teared up. The singer was crying, the workers were crying, and everybody embraced as the singer finished her song. She picked up her things and made her way back to her car. One of the workers approached another, tears still in his eyes and said “that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been installing septic tanks for twenty years!”

Male reindeer drop their antlers at the beginning of winter, usually late November to mid-December. Female reindeer retain their antlers till after they give birth in the spring.   Therefore, according to every historical rendition depicting Santa's reindeer, every single one of them, from Rudolph to Blitzen- had to be a girl.   We should've known.
