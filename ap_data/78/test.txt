They eventually end up on an island, and the three decide to split up and meet back at the beach at sunset.   When they meet back up, the politician returned with 4 fish, the oil baron found what he needed to build an open fire, and the pilot found a mysteriously sealed bottle. With each man getting their one fish, the politician was going to grab the last fish when the oil baron slapped his hand.   They got into an argument, with the politician believing since he spent all day catching fish, he deserved his extra. The oil baron disagreed and said that he supplied the material needed to cook the fish and so it should be his. The conflict escalated, and as they were about to start a fist fight, the pilot sat back and was nervously rubbing his bottle.   All of a sudden, the bottle's cork flew off, and a huge green genie appeared in front of them, muscular arms crossed in front of him. ""You have freed me, weary traveler!"" he booms at the pilot. ""I was dropped in the middle of the ocean centuries ago, and now, to thank you, I shall give you three wishes, as is custom.""   The pilot stopped the genie and asked if instead of giving him three wishes if he could give each of them one, with which the genie generously agreed.   The pilot has thought about this before, and he was going to say his wish, but out of fury, the politician pointed at the oil baron and spit out, ""I wish all greedy people like him would disappear!""   The genie laughed, and was going to grant the wish, until the oil baron said, ""well I wish all power-hungry people like HIM disappeared!""   The genie looked concerned, and so asked the pilot for his wish. Thinking for a few minutes, the pilot then tells the genie ""I'd like my plane fixed, good as new.""   All three look at the pilot, confused by his modest wish. ""You can ask for ANYTHING. Why would you only wish for that?"" says an astonished politician. ""Well, I was going to wish for world peace,"" said the pilot, ""but you two seemed to have taken care of that."""

601	0.0	"8 Life Lessons — NOT OC I'll credit this as last posted by u/NinjaNoob99.  -----  *SHOWER:*  A woman gets out of the shower just as her husband is going to his room. Hearing a knock on the front door, she wraps herself in her bathrobe before stepping outside. She sees her neighbor, who says ""I'll give you $800 to take that bathrobe off."" Hesitant at first, she complies, and the neighbor gives her $800 before leaving. She heads upstairs, where her husband asks her, ""Who was that?""  ""Larry, the next door neighbor.""  ""Ah, classic Larry. Did he say anything about the 800 bucks he owes me?""  **LESSON 1** - Share critical information about credit and risk with your shareholders in time, or risk avoidable exposure.  -----  *GENIE:*  It's a tough day at the office, and 2 employees are having a lunch break. Out of the corner of their eye, one of them happens to spot a genie lamp, which, sure enough, summons a genie. They go up to their boss, and the 3 decide to try together. The genie says he can only grant 1 wish, so they better make their only wish a good one.  The first guy asks to be walking alongside the banks of the river Seine, taking in the aromas and sensations of Paris. Granted, although the French nearby are vexed about how he came to be here. Regardless, the first guy takes in the sights.  The second guy asks to be on the bustling streets of New York. Granted, and it's beautiful as usual. Crowds prove a bit too much for his liking, but it's what he wanted anyway, so he's satisfied.  Finally, the boss remarks, ""You know, I want them back here after lunch.""  **LESSON 2** - Let your boss have the first say.  -----  *VERSE:*  A priest offered a ride to a nun, who crossed her legs in such a manner that it was revealing. Too much for the priest to bother resisting, he began to move his hand up her leg.  The nun says, ""Remember - Luke 14:10"".  The priest remarks, ""The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.""  The nun nods. Pretty soon, they stop at the convent where the nun is scheduled to be at, while the priest goes back to his chapel to find that verse in the Holy Book.  Sure enough, it says, ""Friend, move up to a better place.""  **LESSON 3** - You'll miss great opportunities if you aren't literate in your job.  -----  *PERCHED:*  One day, a crow was perched high on a tree branch. A rabbit walks up and says, ""Can I do nothing like you all day long?""  The crow responds, ""Go ahead.""  The rabbit remains idle, before being devoured by a fox minutes later.  **LESSON 4** - You must be high up if you want to sit and do nothing.  -----  *AMBITION:*  A rooster talks with a bull about this one massive tree on the farm he lives at, and asks how he might be able to get on top of it. The bull says, ""I've tried this with some others; eat my droppings and you'll gain enough strength over time.""  The rooster tries. With the first few droppings, he's able to climb the lowest branches, but after finishing a few dozen, he manages to climb onto the top.  A hunter spots the chicken before shooting him out of the tree.  **LESSON 5** - Bullshit may get you to the top, but it'll never keep you up there.  -----  *WARMTH:*  A little bird was flying due south to escape the encroaching cold. Caught in a snow storm, her tiny wings froze, and she plummeted into a farmer's field. Suddenly, a cow dropped some dung on her. While initially disgusted, the bird noticed that she was being insulated by the dung, and she was warming up. Gladdened, she sang for joy, attracting a cat who proceeded to eat her.  **LESSON 6** - Not everyone who craps on you is your enemy...  **LESSON 7** - ...and not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.  **LESSON 8** - When you get into deep shit, best keep your mouth shut!"

The Phyics student replied saying that, since a border is a 2 dimentional object and humans are 3D, they would have to be buried in both France and Germany simultaneously.  The Law student stated that the families would have to decide the burial locations, therefore the question is unanswerable.  The Mathematics student put forward that they would have to calculate the shortest distance from the crash site to the closest cemetery, therefore the answer is the country with the nearest burial site.  Finally the Psychology student states that the answer is nowhere. Because why would you bury the survivors?

The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money.  Many people had tried over time (weight-lifters, longshoremen, etc.) but nobody could do it.  One day this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice.  ""I'd like to try the bet."" After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away.  Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man.  But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass.  As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man.  ""What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, what?""  The man replied, ""I work for the IRS."""

Jack, a man who is looking to explore himself hears about a wild fetish club where people can indulge in just about *anything.* He's a little nervous, but he finally talks himself into going just to see what it's all about.  When he gets there, Jack's immediately overwhelmed. The whole place stinks of sweat, jizz, and stale beer. The waiters and bartenders are all in gimp suits or chastity cages. Even the chairs and tables are just people in elaborate bondage gear.  This is *way* more than Jack was expecting, so he just hides in the corner for a while hoping to get his bearings. He almost wants to leave, but after paying the massive cover charge he's determined to get his money's worth. He orders a few beers, chugs them down, and pretty soon has to answer the call of nature.  Surprisingly, the bathroom is actually pretty normal. Two toilet stalls. A row of urinals. Two sinks under a big mirror. The only thing out of the ordinary is the blindfolded man on his knees beside the door.  While Jack pees, another patron emerges from a stall with his pants around his ankles, waddles over to the man, and sits on his face. Despite the blindfold, he doesn't even flinch. He eagerly licks this apparent strangers's asshole clean, and when he's done the man just pulls his pants up, washes his hands, and leaves.  Jack is absolutely disgusted by this, but also weirdly intrigued. When he's done peeing, he walks over to the blindfolded man and clears his throat.  ""E-excuse me,"" he says nervously.
