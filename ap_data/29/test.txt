564	convinced	 Honestly it is wired that they are giving this vaccine on day 1 No it's not. and I see no reason to give it at birth Noted, but this isn't a reason to delay it from birth. There's no substance in this comment.
93	convinced	I didn‚Äôt say you were anti vaccine. See how you haven‚Äôt actually progressed the discussion by telling me why what you‚Äôre arguing about even matters? You can argue with yourself without me, friend.
185	doubtful	"my mom gave me a vaccine at 7 and I almost died and I saw jesus and he told me ""Child you are a moron"" And since then I pee sitting and poo poo standing"
598	convinced	Sign this petition, everyone! Boys are just as human and deserving of disease preventing treatment as girls.
563	convinced	 Honestly it is wired that they are giving this vaccine on day 1 To belabor the point that this is a pretty vapid comment: Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g., in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred). Approximately 88% of commercially insured women and 84% of Medicaid-enrolled women are tested for HBsAg during pregnancy (27). In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003‚Äì2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32). So we have three good reasons( First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby is right there, after all). Now the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks. But, hey, glad you see no issue with it.
181	convinced	"A ""boosted"" immune system is what would be called an autoimmune disorder and is not a good thing. Vaccines provide the building blocks for your immune system to properly fight off a virus when it comes into contact with one. It allows your body to make antibodies to these diseases. Generally, without being vaccinated, your body has to have time to make these cell mediated responses and fight off the infection, then it's stored in your immune systems memory. Vaccines allow you to create this memory without contracting the actual disease. Some of the things we vaccinate for don't have a good prognosis either, like tetanus or polio."
650	informative	Because immunity the wanes after years of antibodies not being put to use.
235	convinced	I will go with supernatural she ain't a liar or anti vax and she doesn't care if nobody believes her anyway. She never believed in the myths. I am asking if something is possible to cause that like a life hack. I know this phenomenon is a myth for vaccines but what could it be? I am thinking if it could be possible if the coin was counterfeit. Most likely in my opinion she had a ring or something and it happened. It really got me curious knowing she doesn't lie or she is getting paranoid.
28	not sure	Please tell me what table salt is made of.
614	not sure	Dude if it's bigger you want it in front of it not behind. It's not a problem if nobody sees it. ;)
469	convinced	"I think I already carried a discussion with you on this subject. This is a 36 subject study. It's too short and doesn't offer certainty. Either way, will discuss it again. You missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. ""A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis."" Also other disclaimers: Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium 7, 56 ‚Äî a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis 8. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically. ________________________________________________________________ The aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity. Nobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis... Why? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to ""irritate"" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. This was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection. ""However, Merkel notes that there was a ‚Äústartling‚Äù difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: ‚ÄúAfter they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren‚Äôt sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.‚Äù When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals. A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks ‚Äî much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. ‚ÄúTo a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,‚Äù says Merkel."" Either way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated. Also, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. This remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised, or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster."
339	informative	This is a hard no for me and I know vaccines work. We've had pandemics in the past and we've overcame them without having to give public knowledge of who's been vaccinated and who hasn't. This is a violation of HIPAA and shouldn't be taken lightly if countries try to impose this rule.
627	not sure	that's a bit crazy in my opinion. Would your making it illegal to not wash your hands after you go to the toilet? It absolutally should be for anyone who interacts with the public (food prep, medical professions... dentists).
805	not sure	How do decide that the cons/risks of vaccinating are greater than the cons/risks of not? Was there one deciding factor?
638	convinced	Oh, where'd you get that statistic? Also, what heavy metals moron? How can i take you seriously if you think aluminium hydroxide is a heavy metal. üòÑ
553	convinced	It's not 'lifesaving medicine'. It is injected into a healthy individual as a preventative measure and as such needs to meet stringent health standards that, as of yet, have not been met.
551	not sure	Maybe because their brain is swelling...
1	informative	"What do you mean by ""your OP"". I am fairly new to reddit."
354	not sure	Misinformation propagates more misinformation. They will gobble up any info that agrees with them (makes them a kind of sheep too). Don't give them more ammunition.
896	informative	if a booster is required, that makes herd immunity sound llike an impossible goal. With medicine now trying to get adults to get new shots like hpv and the other litany in development, how many adults are not up to date with their old childhood shots? how many adults even go to the dr once a year for a checkup? when the efficacy of the flu shot varies from year to year, you realize the entire population would have to get the shot 3x to ensure a 50% immunized base that many say is needed for herd immunity of the flu because it has a low Ro (assuming 25% efficacy rate which is not implausible)
365	convinced	You can never win a debate with an antivaxxer. Knowing you have good information just makes it worse when they throw shit at you and declare victory.
496	informative	There is 0,125 - 0,82 mg aluminium in vaccines, in Applejuice there are 5 - 100 mg aluminium.
423	not sure	This is an extremely vague question. Like mortality rate overall as in all vaccinated vs all unvaccinated? For specific vaccines like all mmr vaccinated babies vs non? All babies who are current with their vaccines in general vs non? What exactly do you consider a baby because a 1 and a half year old is going to have more vaccines compared to a 6 month old.
516	doubtful	Yes. If they are enhanced by. Chinese get Shots. Their immune system is burdened as well as purged of natural disease detourants.

583	doubtful	It can happen. Case study documenting stroke after flu vaccination:
373	informative	the websites not up yet. but i can put it up tonight and maybe you can help me design better survey questions. we could drive traffic to the site.
492	not sure	Because the misinformation it spreads gets kids killed
57	doubtful	Can you provide a reference? 3rd request. Last try. Please read and respond to what I say or you're just talking to yourself, which you shouldn't need my help to do.

210	informative	Currently having a conversation on facebook with a woman who is a total antivaxer. Her friend has just dropped this PDF on me with its supposed 1000 peer reviewed papers proving the autism link. Googling isnt bringing much up about the legitimacy of it and because its facebook I dont want to invest too much time reading 1000 pages, Which I suspect is her way of shutting me down. Has anyone seen this before?
574	not sure	You mean that's not you in the pic? Well I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. I was going to compliment your shirt and ask where you got it. I am jk can't remember which movie
796	informative	Thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in 2001.( Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal. Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal. Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions. The table on this( page shows which influenza vaccines contain thimerosal, and how much is present.
531	convinced	No, there are no aborted fetal cells in vaccines. The production of a few vaccines, including those for varicella, rubella, and hepatitis A, involves growing the viruses in human cell culture. Two human cell lines provide the cell cultures needed for producing vaccines; these lines were developed from two legally aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines are maintained to have an indefinite life span. No fetal tissue has been added since the cell lines were originally created. Some parents are concerned about this issue because of misinformation they have encountered on the Internet. Two such untrue statements are that ongoing abortions are needed to manufacture vaccines and vaccines are contaminated with fetal tissue. The cell lines came from abortions due to congenital rubella syndrome resulting from a 1964 rubella epidemic. The vaccines that were developed because of these two cell lines have prevented an estimated 10+ million deaths. The rubella vaccine prevented over 633,000 miscarriages in the U.S. alone, and countless more across the globe, and it has prevented tens of millions of clinical health issues in children.
132	not sure	Oh. Another one yah! Money is not a logical motivator.. Interesting perspective.
828	not sure	No he said the opposite of what i said. Ive told you twice. Youre not a shill youre a child.
524	informative	Grab some books or research on DuckDuckGo. Google Firefox and Amazon block pro choice stuff so yeah. Dont use those search engines or order stuff online. Duckduckgo.com is probably the best way to find reliable info. Good link for modern non biased news :)) Edit: yeah aluminum is harmful for your body. The show covers it as-well.

392	informative	There is nothing wrong with adhd, you can live a normal life, just it is easier to get bored. Unlike shit like autism where you will need a lot of extra help and it is clear you are disabled, adhd functions just like the average person
5	doubtful	"Nope. I didn't say anything about childhood vaccines in my OP. The myth, as I stated plainly, is ""Vaccines do not contain mercury."" They do contain mercury. Not all, but some, so the statement is incorrect."
746	not sure	" So we agree on this point Sort of. It's now been extracted out of its origin by you, intentionally or otherwise. This part of the title ""vaccines don‚Äôt cause autism and said that if it were true there would be a higher rate of kids with autism and there is not."" made me think OP was trying to draw conclusions from one point in time, which I was saying is incorrect Yes you've said several times that's what you thought OP was suggesting. You've not unpacked why you think that is the case over alternatives, even when one of the responses to OP explicitly implies a rate change. The offhanded summary in the title is an ambiguous take on a different conversation. Considering there many different ways that can actually be interpreted--one of which you've already talked about, some others I've introduced--what are you trying to accomplish? What is this discussion supposed to be about?"
623	doubtful	No it‚Äôs the ‚Äúdoing what‚Äôs best to protect your individual rights from an overreaching government‚Äù in this case that‚Äôs lying about the profit driven industry of vaccines. Don‚Äôt confuse ‚Äúdoing what‚Äôs right‚Äù with ‚Äúdoing what you believe is right‚Äù because that‚Äôs relative to your knowledge and understanding of the issues. According to a large body of research, scientists, doctors and even the vaccine manufacturers and US supreme government vaccines are very dangerous. And in my opinion doing what‚Äôs right would involve radically changing the vaccine schedule if not abolishing all together.
854	not sure	And here we see the mythical grammar Nazi. I was starting to worry I was the only one. Have a nice day.
675	convinced	"Lol, a dumbass who can't even read tells me about the scientific method? Look here, you negative IQ thing, I didn't study medicine on YT. Nor did I ever open a study and said: A HA! There it is, proof to fit my bullshit views. Let's take just 2 examples out of your copy pasta from your pro disease friends. The metaanalysis puts all flu and ILI in one pot, so it's irrelevant. Not all ILI are flu and not all flu are deadly. It doesn't mean 1: AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. No studies on this, doesn't make it less efficient. 2: There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. Oh no, who would've thought, you moron, that strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year. Nobody claimed anything different. That doesn't make the vaccine itself harmful. What the fuck are you on about? Are you doing meth? As a former epidemiologist, I'm ashamed to read Jefferson T's ""review"" about the influenza vaccine. He uses SO FUCKING MANY fallacies. He doesn't take into account even the morbidity or mortality of the flu and claims that not even pregnant women should be vaccinated, because the less you do medical acts on them, the better. That's outrageous and bizarre as fuck. Do we live in 2019 or 1900? Do you even fucking know how flu pandemics wiped millions of people in 1919? Just look up Spanish flu. I'm sure those people would rather get a low antibody count from a vaccine, than fucking none. 40% less deaths is better than what happened then. Read some more about how much of an imbecile JT is. You should feel as stupid as this guy is. You said that the flu shot is less and less efficient if you get it every year. Again, your reading comprehension is out of this world. And that's not good. Cause you don't seem to be having a human brain. They said: ""Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system."" You know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND. SO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? I really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit. Yes, science evolves. But vaccines are proof that science also works and it's better to prevent, unlike your claims that drs don't want that, than to treat. Or bury your patients. AKA taking away an individual‚Äôs right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects Side effects from inactivated vaccines are mild and rarely occurring. I guess you'd like to see people suffering from a disease instead of admitting that your lack of chemistry and physiology knowledge is null. Like your smooth brain. Fucking imbecile, next time you wanna copy paste shit to bother people with it, go into an infectious diseases ward and visit some intubated patients who are likely to die because of the flu. /u/atheistbastard, get this troll outta here please."
275	convinced	You have strange ideas if you think an unanticipated drug reaction is someone's fault. Are you expecting to hire some antivax greedhead lawyer to sue someone if you break out in hives?
937	convinced	Dosage makes the poison dude just because it has it doesn‚Äôt means it‚Äôs toxic
361	informative	Quoting Ben Goldacre...I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that. Oh, and _citations needed_.
591	informative	Yes. It obviously is sexist towards men.
352	convinced	I think it‚Äôs absolutely fine to censor Anti-vaccine information on social media. Less people that see it the less that will be radicalized.
526	not sure	Unsure tbh, I don‚Äôt know anything else than what I linked in my above post, sorry.
414	doubtful	I know this is reddit amd I probably shouldnt say this im no karen im a 13 yr old kid btw- I dont use vaccines because I like to keep my body natural and to train my self to survive diseases. I dont care if I die I dont really fear death. I can see why people will hate this. sigh you cant even voice your own opinion anymore but hopefully you guys see my point. Someday a major disease could mutate to get past our vaccines that take years to build and wed have to keep making our vaccines stronger. Ive realized that its all about survival... Viruses and germs dont want to harm us but they naturally do... they naturally are a disease, they just use our body as a host, and you see how we slaughter cows to eat, (No im no vegan either, I love meat) thats how we survive, I know viruses are singlw celled and are not a complex lifeform im just showing you my opinion and I dont really care if anyone asked its reddit I just wanna hesr other peoples opinions too amd for people to get to know why some people dont use vaccines. peace guys
237	informative	She felt the coin slightly being pulled. Edit: before contact.
892	convinced	how old are you? or, a more anonymous question, are you within age to vaccinate on your own? if so, please PLEASE do so. also, im vaccinated and there seems to be no issue with it, so.........
552	not sure	Have you ever seen a 1 year old bashing his head against his crib and screaming for days within a hour of receiving a shot?
204	convinced	My mom is EXTREMELY anti-vax, and swears that she will never let me get any as long as she lives. Whenever I bring up the topic she will cherry pick articles from the internet showing that vaccines cause autism and brain damage. I can‚Äôt reason with her because she believes everything pro-vaccine is from the government and pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, I get the flu every year and got chicken pox last year. I would definitely like to stay on the safe and get at least some vaccinations, what should I do? I am 15, can I legally get vaccines without parental consent?
789	not sure	I'm not attacking you as a person, I am however heavily disagreeing with your willingness to debate topics whose nuances and basics you know little about. Seriously. How many times have I told you this? Do legitimate research in a legitimate lab or take a legitimate class. That's why there's a difference between a degree in biochemical engineering and doing occasional online research. You literally cannot can't define toxic without three important parameters: dose, method of delivery, and adjuvants. Ok, so palladium catalysts. They're not irelevant. Since you are making bold claims about organic chemistry concepts and pointing out supposed errors in my statement, why don't you explain my error in this statement: semi-sterically hindered palladium catalysts can act to cross couple multiple benzene derivatives with weak nucleophilic groups, replacing the bonds through a three-step process of transmetalation, reductive elimination, and oxidative addition, removing the steric group between second and third steps and adding a halogen after the first. Your quick expertise in organic chemistry, so quick to point out 'errors,' should very quickly pick this error up.
12	doubtful	You finally admit there is mercury in vaccines. You arguing with yourself kid. I never said it's worrisome. I just said it's in there and that's a problem when doctors and TED talks are saying it's not. You seem to only be able to disagree with things I didn't say. 100% of my argument is that mercury is in vaccines, which you seem to suddenly agree with after spending an entire day saying the opposite. I'm gonna let go of your hand now. ‚úåÔ∏è
232	convinced	She didn't become magnetic. Of that I'll bet my house. There's a simpler and natural explanation why a coin stuck to her hand, if one did at all. Try and get her to show you the next time you're together at work.
514	informative	The Chinese regiment means that their blood is effectively sterilized from antiseptics and medicines and nutrients and antibodies, the cells coated and the lymph nodes bombarded with medical ingredients. It would also be interesting to know how often an average Chinese home sterilizes their bathroom, floor, shelves, windows and counters. As you said, a sterile environment isn't the aim, BUT an artificial one needs a routine maintenance.
172	not sure	Hi all. They‚Äôre saying things like double-blind studies and aluminium and have provided sources and stuff but I don‚Äôt know how to combat that and I most CERTAINLY don‚Äôt want to walk away from this with a little bit of doubt about vaccines, just because I didn‚Äôt know enough to hold a discussion about it, but I also don‚Äôt want to cling to a belief even when I‚Äôm presented with good evidence. Problem is, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good bloody evidence! Where can I get sources? Would anybody who knows more about the subject matter like to ‚Äòcasually‚Äô step in to the argument? I feel like an audience member in a debate and I‚Äôve just been made to take part!

403	convinced	So she thinks that the govt would lie about the death of about a million people for shits and giggles
592	informative	The WHO doesn't care about men's health. They promote male genital mutilation in Africa as a quack preventative against HIV and numerous diseases including HPV, yet they want to restrict male access to first world treatment against HPV. They violate the rights of men and boys.
607	not sure	No sense in sticking your head in the sand about the way the world is working. We would be wise to make sure our health is not compromised by those who dont give a toss about us.
629	doubtful	I think censorship is generally bad, if a pro-vax sub wants to censor it's not that big a deal, but a whole site censoring any idea is generally not good, and government censorship, especially whey they censor criticism of there own policies (such as vaccination policies), is extremely dangerous
868	doubtful	1) Autism is not just... genetic, it's a behavioural diagnostic term for anything that leads to its criteria, such as brain damage, gut health, biology etc.. Or, genetic abnormalities. Or, environment. It's a biomedical, neuropsychiatric, and environmental disorder. 2) Various vaccine ‚Üí damage links. (yes a dreaded YouTube video, my goodness, what's next, a still image of a webpage that displays text? Oh my it's just a medium to present information for fucks sake). 3) Andrew Wakefield, who was actually never charged for falsifying data, that was Brian Deer's successful attempt at discrediting, attacking, and misrepresenting his opponent, and a claim that he spread to the masses, such that today, we have people still believing Andrew was jailed, and falsified and lied and made up data. When none of this is true. Extra) (ignore first image, I disagree with it, because vaccines are used in the dozens of MILLIONS whereas measles only occurred in the dozens of thousands (although we don't know for sure, since diagnosis of measles is difficult for doctors that rarely ever experienced measles prevelancy).
720	convinced	"It seems to me that even those from your link can't differentiate between thimerosal/Ethylmercury and methylmercury. Baaaad doctors, baaaad! Dr. Orenstein pg 1-2 ‚Äú(For) those who don‚Äôt know, initial concerns were raised last summer that mercury, as methylmercury (thimerosal) in vaccines, might exceed safe levels. And then ‚ÄúThimerosal is cleaved (in the body) into ethylmercury and thiosalicylate which is inactive‚Ä¶ The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.‚Äù Excuse me? Formaldehyde is toxic too. But what matters in a loooot of cases, the dose makes the poison. And in case you didn't know, the quantity of literally everything in vaccines, is so small, that ot couldn't hurt anyone. Ooohh good. He addressed that. ‚ÄúAcutely, it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death, from overdose This link seems so chopped. What even is this? Omg. I googled that last doc i quoted. Please read this. ""The article does not state that we found evidence against an association, as a negative study would. It does state, on the contrary, that additional study is recommended, which is the conclusion to which a neutral study must come."" Enough with the cherry picking, you pro diseasers! "
315	not sure	Also of course others OTF might even take you seriously. People have a responsibility to correct misinformation, particularly when that misinformation can kill.
44	convinced	"And you're still wrong--it's not an error. The estimate is actually 1-2 per 1000 which derived from surveillance data collected throughout the 1985-1992 measles resurgence. Read that( and then get back to me. Also, to state the obvious, you're conflating estimated cases with reported deaths, aka apples to oranges. As an aside, it is fun to note your wording stance change from ""Known calculation error"" to ""probably an error"". Finally, my link does not ""just"" say MMR doesn't cause autism. It's a chestnut for standard anti-vaxxer nonsense. For measles sequelae you can read any of the dozen CDC articles for laypeople or you can check this( for just CNS sequelae, if you're feeling frisky. You should probably stick to reputable sources, such as the CDC. "
480	informative	The actual answer is she isn't fully protected, but she's as protected as she can be for her age.
30	doubtful	I sure am, which is how I know there is mercury in vaccines when doctors have told me and millions of others the opposite... I didn't post this intending to be educated. If you claim to have knowledge I don't, it only makes sense for me to ask what it is, and for you to explain it, especially if it's elementary. Why not just educate me? Wouldn't that be easier?
750	not sure	My initial point that you seemed to think was wrong was that the rate of autism can't tell you if vaccines cause it, only the trend in the rate can tell you this, but not the rate itself Yes and you never explained how this is possible, what exactly that means, or why you're so certain this is what OP claimed. You have twice mentioned rates in general without much explanation, and several times asked me to clarify, but we never get any new clarification on your end. Just endless complaints about tone, supposed inferences about your motives, and anything else you can try to grab on to. So now's your chance!
501	informative	"TL:DR It takes time to read multiple studies, but I read though most of the first one and it looks pretty good, it suggests that around 1 in 168 kids have a side effect leading to an ER visit or hospitalization caused by the first dose of MMR and chickenpox vaccines, although most were just ER visits without hospitalization I will look into the rest of them in coming days (or hours), but looking through all 39(!) will take some time Analysis of the first study (sorry it's so long, science is just complicated sometimes): The authors appear to be from legitimate institutions, and the methods of the study look legit, they found that among kids who go to the ER within 28 days after the 12 month vaccines in Ontario, more of them went to the ER between 4-12 days after vaccination than when to the ER on days 20-28, and this was statistically significant, using a legitimate definition of statistically significant (95% CI, and p-value 0.0001) This suggests that that vaccines are causing kids to go to the ER between 4 and 12 days after vaccination, which is consistant with the expected timeframe for reactions to live vaccines such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccine, both of which are given at 12 months The most obvious form of bias would be to compare time periods of different lengths, but they are comparing a 9 day period to a 9 day period, so no issue there Another potential issue with a study like this study is that the rate of ER visits on days 20-28 is assumed to be non-vaccine related, and used as a control, so any vaccine related ER visits in this period would not only be missed but would contribute to a lower estimate of the number of day 4-12 ER visits that are attributable to vaccines, this bias would actually make the study underestimate the dangers of vaccines, but I don't know that it was a major issue based on the graphs provided The fact that they vaccine related ER visits had almost the exact same severity score as the none vaccine related ones might suggest that the ""vaccine related"" ER visits and non vaccine related ones, are for the exact same conditions, meaning that none of them are actually vaccine related (or that they all are, but this wouldn't explain the ER visits right before vaccination). However, there was no increase in facial injuries in the period of increased ER visits after vaccination, suggesting that the increase was actually do to different conditions, ie, they were actually vaccine related. Vaccine related and non-vaccine related ER visits could be the same average severity if this is a threshold at which parents take kids to the ER, and both vaccine related and non vaccine related ER visits are rarely more serious than this threshold The increase in ER visits after 18 month vaccinations (which include a second dose of MMR and chickenpox) was little to none, which is consistant with the fact that once you have had the 1 dose of a live virus vaccine you are usually vaccinated against side effects of subsequent doses, and this suggests that the increase in ER visits after the 12 months vaccines is either due to the live vaccines (MMR and/or chickenpox), or one of the non live vaccines that is given at 12 months but not at 18 months, although the timing 4-12 days after vaccination is more consistant with a live vaccine"
379	informative	You go to any laboratory and ask for a immunological profile for Sars cov2. You ask to have both IgM and IgG for Sars cov 2 done. These tests are usually paid by the patient, not by hospitals so expect to be paying. Shouldn't be too expensive though. IgM shows an acute infection, but in Sars Cov 2, they fade away slower. But the IgG shows the protective antibody number. Depending on the laboratory's ranges, you'll see if you have a high enough number to be protected. If the patient is protected, they don't need a new vaccine too soon.

375	informative	One of many reposter spam bots, report and downvote 20 of their posts.
177	convinced	It stemmed from an article published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues back in the 1998 in the UK. In the study, Wakefield looked at 12 children with gastrointestinal issues also had neurological deficits. Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences. His article was published in the Lancet, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped. The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants. What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion. Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.
680	doubtful	"Lol. These are quotes from the studies. And the studies are trying to figure out why the flu vaccine causes this decrease in efficacy. Feel free to read them and let me know your interpretation. As far as group immunity... Note the ‚Äúno decline in transmission‚Äù below According to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn‚Äôt reduce rates of pneumonia. And the insert actually lists pneumonia as a possible side effect. Cochrane review And... The Myth of Herd Immunity The Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that: 1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and 2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children. I‚Äôll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon. What are we told? We often hear statements from public health officials like ‚ÄúClusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity‚Äù. Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics. According to public health officials, ‚Äúparents who reject vaccines don‚Äôt consider the effect of their child on the rest of society‚Äù. We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated. What is truth? Dr. O‚ÄôShea, in his book: ‚ÄúVaccination is Not Immunization‚Äù explains: ‚ÄúDo not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don‚Äôt know what herd immunity is, you‚Äôll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don‚Äôt be fooled again‚Äù Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: ‚ÄúThis whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it."" In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we‚Äôre taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease. Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year. The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected. By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines. So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right? Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: ‚ÄúIn the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity.¬†But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period‚Ä¶ This is why they quietly began to suggest boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella. Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done. That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades. If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection. Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations‚Äù. Where is the Logic? Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well: Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they‚Äôve been vaccinated? NO Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO Do pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates. Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they‚Äôve been vaccinated? NO Do unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria. Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria. Unvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would."
424	informative	Companies =/= exploited people Some may, but that's simply false. Not saying you aren't allowed to use, but if you think people are being exploited working for a company, not exactly logical to use the exploited peoples products to complain about these companies.
413	doubtful	um... well I havent had one since I was born and I braved through the flu with my natural anti bodies but I guess
816	convinced	It is somewhat silly to say it is meaningless. For instance when antivaxxers say there is formaldehyde in vaccines, they usually don't even give a dosage. The Op gave the dosage and compared it to bananas. Then you complain because the OP failed to make an adjustment for how much of the formaldehyde in the bananas was not absorbed. Since most formaldehyde is absorbed by the GI tract,( this seems to be picking at straws.
761	not sure	You can't be doing that and insisting on one strictly incorrect interpretation of OP's wording in the title. Are you actually saying it's impossible to be wrong without being dishonest?
248	convinced	Causation doesn't mean correlation. Especially if nothing could be found. Same could be said if someone was hit and killed leaving a clinic after getting vaccinated. Were their vision affected by the shot? He's never walked out in front of a truck before, the shot was the only difference so it must of been the shot
491	informative	Not a shelf-stable film, but the oral polio vaccine( has been around for decades.
35	doubtful	You make a good point about natural infection antibodies being passed from mother to child. So if the child did contract measles, the body would recognize it & a lesser reaction would occur. Now that we're in the 3rd generation of lower quality vaccine immunity, children/adults contracting measles would have a more serious reaction.
873	convinced	VACCINES DON'T CAUSE AUTISM. There has be zero respectable peer-reviewed studies that have shown any causation relationship.
603	convinced	"Claiming that industry-funded studies aren't biased. This is simply not true When citing studies, make sure they don't have major conflicts of interest IMPORTANT This is NOT the most up to date evidence of the flu vaccine's effectiveness, I only cited this as a source for the fact that industry-funded studies are biased. Here are more up to date reviews: This isn't remotely in line with FDA approval standards. I also don't see how the Cochrane review in any way justifies your opinion here unless you misunderstand what 'bias' is meant in these reviews. Edit: So I missed what you're likely referring to with this link, the warning at the bottom of this (and only this) Cochrane review. This review itself has no particular issue with or statement against industry funded studies and, of course, included many. The actual study you're trying to refer to is this one( by another study author on these Cochrane reviews you've cited. Notably these reviews are in line with reported influenza vaccine efficacy which is common, that being ~45%. I've taken one example from the 2009 review you have meant to cite as an example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 in Table 2): Study was conducted over one year. Conclusions support recommendation of annual vaccination (one dose is sufficient in adults, as strong response has been observed). Authors note that vaccine effectiveness has been shown, even if it was possibly administered too late (in region where study was carried out peak incidence of influenza occurs usually in May). All totally in line with their results. They have strong evidence of an effect even with a later administration. Seasonal homogeneity isn't uncommon, so this is a bizarre complaint against strong statistical results and completely 'concordant' summary in the conclusion. In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. Comment: though authors state that effectiveness is shown for influenza related ARI only, and not influenza, they recommend vaccination for patients with COPD. Because it demonstrated statistically significant reduction for influenza related ARI or, as referred to in the study, ILI. This means recommending vaccine though it is not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations. Misleading or incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors are distinguishing ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing the pathology 'influenza'). As the original authors state, viral propagation from infection was only possible in 10% of those patients with ILI presentation. The paper does not demonstrate a lack of efficacy, but only fails to demonstrate presence of efficacy for lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering the serology confirmed increase in antibody titer, strong reduction in ILI, and lack of effect against non-influenza ARI, this is a terrible mischaracterization of the study and its conclusions. Usually there is no ability to distinguish between flu-ARI and non-flu-ARI. However in this case other viral agents were confirmed, giving much higher confidence in proper ILI designation. In addition, lack of comment on community viral circulation and vaccine content and matching make verification of effectiveness against ARI impossible. I have no idea what the Cochrane authors are saying here. Wongsurakiat et al do comment on circulating virus among the community, do comment on vaccine content, and do make a matching verification. The predominantly circulating type A flu was H3N2 at the time, of which the vaccine component was stated to be on target, and of which the majority of confirmed flu in the study was confirmed to be type A. moreover, they confirm specific titer increases for the study subjects in line with well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, the authors don't suggest the vaccine has effect against ARI--that is to say all acute respiratory infections--and instead say it is true for only influenza-ARI. This being a prime example in their table of discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem to dispute the sensitive nature of COPD patients to airway exacerbations and wholly ignore this supreme risk factor which any responsible clinician must weigh (risk) against perceived benefit of the vaccine (reward). See this excerpt: All the unvaccinated patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who were hospitalized because of influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One of these patients with severe COPD died because of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none of the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support because of ARI related to influenza virus infection. Now, these results might not be statistically significant, but they aren't evidence of it being ""not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations"" like the Cochrane authors state. Are the Cochrane authors really disputing the idea that influenza vaccination proved effective against ILI? Or are they just harping on the lack of distinction between ILI and lab-confirmed influenza? Because one of those questions has an obvious and practical answer for clinicians, and the other is an academic or philosophical exercise. I'm either missing something big, or this is a huge oversight on the part of the Cochrane authors. Cochrane authors are humans the same as all the other study authors. To conclude that industry funded studies are completely unreliable is not 'concordant' with the Cochrane authors themselves."
402	convinced	What nanoparticles? Your phone does a good enough job at tracking you with literally all social media, weather, and other apps having access to your location. What do you think a particle less than 100 nm in diameter is gonna do? It's a dead virus, not a fucking phone.

If they contain Evidence and science. 2) i never said Andrew Wakefield was jailed. But he did lose his medical license and has been discredited over and over again. Again, discredited doesn't mean fairly discredited. I can discredit Einstein all I want doesn't make him wrong. 3) you lose all credibility if you bring up Andrew Wakefield in any anti-vax argumen Well only if of course you believe that Andrew Wakefield was wrong. And even if he was, it still doesn't discredit my argument because that would be a fallacy of containment.. because something contains a false piece of information, doesn't mean that the rest is also false. It's just an easy way for you to ignore and to rationalize not being reasonable. ) not interested in reading any of your links. Are any of them links to credible peer-reviewed studies? If not, then don't waste your time posting them to me. Well, if you bothered to check, nearly all of them were peer reviewed. Andrew Wakefields paper was peer reviewed 12 times. And stayed published for 5 years, and then suddenly it was retracted.. as soon as it got mainstream.. hmmm strange that one.."
511	informative	You know that infants too young to have vaccines can die from illnesses like measles and whooping cough etc.
903	convinced	You're not going to die. Not from the vaccine at least. Go drink some wine and celebrate the fact that you have taken a few items out of the list of things that can kill you.
601	not sure	I didn''t mean that industry funded studies are entirely useless That is effectively what you said though but way too many people think conflicts of interest don't matter in vaccine research You might feel that way but that's not a fallacy. You need to adjust your wording to get to that more tenable position. Probably a good idea to update the citations too with the original paper since it's an interesting read on its own and worth highlighting
290	convinced	 I felt similar things after my 2nd Pfizer vaccine. It all passed within a couple of days. This only means the vaccine is doing its job, and your immune system is preparing itself to handle the actual Covid pathogens.
310	convinced	Fever and chills means the immune system is making the antibodies for the COVID spike protein, so that‚Äôs not an issue at all. I got the second dose on Friday, was sick all of Saturday, and completely fine on Sunday. Get your head out of your ass.
194	doubtful	 In 1933, Dr. Arthur W. Hedrich, a health officer in Chicago, IL observed that during 1900-1930, outbreaks of measles in Boston, MA appeared to be suppressed when 68% of the children contracted the virus.3¬†Subsequently in the 1930s, Dr. Hedrich observed that after 55% of the child population of Baltimore, MD acquired measles, the rest of the population appeared to be protected. It was¬†that¬†observation that formed the basis for mass vaccination campaigns.4 When the mass vaccination campaign for measles in the U.S. began in earnest in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Public Health Service planned to vaccinate over 55% (based on the Baltimore observation) of the U.S. population, and it announced that it fully expected to eradicate measles by 1967. When that didn‚Äôt happen, the Public Health Service came up with vaccination rate figures of 70-75% as the way to ensure herd immunity. When eradication was still not achieved at those rates, public health officials jacked up the rates to 80%, 83%, 85%, and ultimately to 90%. The process by which the decisions to raise the rates is unclear. Was it based on some scientific methodology or assumptions? Or were the decisions simply made because officials felt pressure to fulfill their promises to fully eradicate measles? Did they ever consider pausing and re-evaluating the original premise behind the theory of herd immunity? Or did they trudge on, arbitrarily raising the bar? Now the rate is up to 95% to achieve herd immunity. But as we see with the continual outbreaks, even at 95% we still do not have full immunity. In China, the vaccination rates are even higher‚Äî99%. But there are also still measles outbreaks there. So is the answer 100%? And what if at 100% you still get outbreaks? We‚Äôve gone from herd immunity supposedly achieved at 55% to herd immunity that is clearly not achieved even at 95%. At what point will public health officials have to confront the possibility that herd immunity may not be the best theory on which to base vaccination policy? 3 - Hedrich AW.

849	doubtful	r/iamverysmart You would think your oh so very high IQ would mean you possess some intelligence, such as understanding vaccines are healthy without seeking contrary proofs, but it is simply an excuse to have a superiority complex.
519	informative	 Is it more likely that Corona and other viruses like SARS, Avian and ZIKA What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains. The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered. I don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either. Putting domesticated food animals in close quarters with wild animals and humans is a receipe for disaster. Bats in particular carry all sorts of nasties and being routinely exposed to bat viscera will eventually cause problems whether you got a flu shot or not.
952	convinced	Yeah money does run the world otherwise what motivation do we have to go to school, to work, etc. You have a very abstract and childish view of the world that you need to grow up from.

So are you walking that comment back now and just couldn't own up to it clean out of pride, or continuing the bad faith? Because if it's the former, then I respect it. I've been an ass. If it's the latter, then I'll press on.

880	doubtful	We're talking about cancer which has a direct relationship with age. The greater that lifespan is the more prone we will be to cancer as we exceed previous lifespan limitations. That's just how genetics and DNA work. As you age your DNA becomes more damaged, when it becomes more damaged it will be more error prone. The more error prone the more likely cancerous mutations are to develop. Unless we can find a way of fundamentally changing our DNA and how it operates that's just the way the cookie crumbles as we age. Thanks for explaining what cancer is.. I I'm having a difficult time working out what points you think you made here. Cancer doesn't just come from ageing, you clearly have no idea what cancer is. Many children have cancer. Autism was just an example to show that statistics can be misleading without given proper context i'm not going to go into whatever that nonsense of a last statement was. And how does this example demonstrate that it's misleading? Autism rates are massively correlated with vaccination rates, in different countries, where health, food, living conditions, and hygiene are the same.

644	doubtful	"Herd immunity historically refers to the immunity acquired from getting the illness naturally and outbreaks happen a lot in populations with close to 100% vaccination rate. Why ignore this? And it was the shot I had twice actually, my bad grammar. Nice that you have resorted to name calling when you cant convince someone with your argument. I am not ""pro diseaser"" but if you're asking me to trust huge conglomerates that have repeatedly been convicted of lying about their products, have whistleblowers coming forward admitting fraud and you have governing bodies who do not remain at arms length from the industry and have multiple conflicts of interest well...no. Blatant lies? That's rich."
190	convinced	"Sorry, promise I'm not attention seeking when I say some of this, it is relevant... I was in a horrendous RTA 3 years ago, in which I sustained a fractured skull, bruised lung, lacerated scalp and two brain injuries. As a result I was in an induced coma for two weeks and only started being minimally aware after 5 months, in hospital for 13. I only started learning of the anti-vaxx movement 6 months ago. And I just don't quite understand... How are people THAT stupid? To think that vaccines are, in essence, ""BAD?"" I don't even care what retaliation I get from anti-vaxxers. They can say anything they want if they are really that idiotic!"

961	convinced	" Nope. There was a tiny subset in China in which there appeared to be some correlation between the virus and narcolepsy. Yes, Taiwan and China. Both prior to vaccine campaigns and after unadjuvanted vaccination, respectively. And by ""handful"" exactly how many cases are you suggesting happened in Europe following Pandemrix vaccination compared with China/Taiwan? You keep using spin despite your apparent disdain for it. No cases in Europe like that. They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus. Only Pandemrix, and there is no current hypothesis in which the vaccine was a risk factor outside of viral antigen (not specific to the vaccine) or other concurrent environmental factors (e.g. H1N1 infection, GAS). About 1300 cases. All vaccine, no virus. That's not even remotely true. You're literally just bullshitting: A biologic mechanism( to explain this observation has not been established, but it has been postulated that an interaction involving the immune responses to administration of Pandemrix-AS03 and infection with wild-type pH1N1 virus could be a contributing factor 20. This would explain the apparent presence of an association in Finland, Sweden and Norway where wildtype virus circulated coincident with the vaccination program, whereas no association was seen in Ontario where wild-type virus was no longer circulating at the time of the vaccination program. You also are greatly exaggerating the numbers of those with NT1 narcolepsy relative to the overall risk. It really isn't known exactly how and why some people who received Pandemrix even with the associated HLA did or did not develop narcolepsy. Over 11 million doses have been distributed total. Funny how genetics works, isn't it. You really wouldn't know. But, yes. And, wow, you seem to have totally given up and conceded the point with ASD. See you next time."
296	convinced	When I got my first covid shot I asked my nurse (I did warn her first I was totally joking) if my microchip would activate immediately after she injected it or if I had to do something afterwards. She laughed so hard. Glad I could make her laugh as she was having a busy and hectic day
470	doubtful	Source: In their study, Warfel et al. used non-human primates as a model for B. pertussis infection, and found evidence that individuals vaccinated with current acellular B. pertussis vaccines (aP) can become asymptomatically infected, and can then transmit infection to susceptible individuals. The potential for this type of vaccine failure has been observed in humans where reanalyses of aP vaccine studies revealed that individuals vaccinated with components of the aP vaccine were protected against disease, but not bacterial colonization \10( 11( This is in addition to the extant, but limited, evidence for natural asymptomatic infection \12( Warfel et al. point out that asymptomatic infection in aP vaccinated individuals, and subsequent transmission, may partially account for the increase in observed B. pertussis incidence. However, from a public health perspective, the presence of vaccine-induced or naturally infected asymptomatic individuals who transmit disease could have consequences beyond facilitating an increase in incidence. In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de Cell√®s et al. (2014) \15( argue that a reduction in incidence among unvaccinated individuals in a population with high aP coverage shows that aP must reduce B. pertussis transmission to some extent. It may be that aP vaccinated infected people are less efficient at transmitting B. pertussis compared with unvaccinated infected people, though it is not clear to what extent \16( Here, we examine incidence and genetic data to provide empirical support for asymptomatic transmission and then construct mathematical models of B. pertussis transmission to explore the public health consequences of asymptomatic transmission. Our results suggest that: 1) there is strong empirical support for asymptomatic transmission from both the epidemiological and genomic data; 2) the presence of asymptomatic transmitters will bias estimates of vaccine efficacy derived from observations of stochastic fadeouts across cities; and 3) asymptomatic transmission provides the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observed patterns associated with current B. pertussis dynamics in the US and UK (that is, the resurgence of cases, the changes in age-specific attack rates, the observed level of bacterial genetic variation, and the failure of ring-vaccinating, or ‚Äúcocooning‚Äù, unvaccinated infants). There is a Huuuge difference between being an antivaxer (who is biased against vaccines and not following science) and being willing to acknowledge that science shows not every vaccine is able to reliably prevent transmission
990	informative	I believe the issue was they didn't get ethical approval to do spinal taps on the kids. But you don't need approval if you clinically treat the patients after the study. And Walker-Smith treated them for years after, so no wrongdoing.

236	convinced	It isn't possible for a vaccine to make you magnetic. Some coins are not magnetic. Did you see your co-worker do this? You said she did this at her home, implying you weren't there...I would therefore argue that she's lying. Or something supernatural has happened. It's your choice.
353	not sure	De-platforming or not propagating dangerously false information is not censorship.
238	convinced	Was she using USA coins? If so, they are not magnetic. Sweat and surface oils help things like coins lightly attach to skin, and some people mistake that for a magnetic pull. Try picking up the same coin with a regular magnet, it won't work.
566	convinced	My understanding is that hep b spreads pretty easily and is ‚Äúsilent,‚Äù meaning most people who have it won‚Äôt realize until years later. Because of this, the idea is that we should provide protection as soon as possible. I am just sick of all the anti vax stuff she sends, regardless of what vaccine it‚Äôs about or which ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù is saying it.
991	convinced	 In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. This is called the Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for after this, therefore because of this) fallacy. Just because the two things happened in order doesn't mean that one caused the other. For example, most pregnancies happen in people who have previously watched television. Does this mean that watching television gets you pregnant? Of course not.
448	not sure	Yes, I know so shared about the myths through my blog
995	doubtful	Lol. My comprehension is comprehensive. You are just looking to post things so if someone comes by and ponders what I've said they can scroll down see what you say and go oh it's BS and move on. You haven't addressed anything I've said your talking in circles because you like so many of the brainwashed antiscience crowd are only interested in protecting your religion of vaccine safety and efficacy.
227	convinced	Pretty sure whatever shedding actually happens, happens in the feces, so as long as y'all aren't playing in each other's shit, you're good.
540	not sure	You have yet to respond. Are you conceding and admitting I‚Äôm right?
981	doubtful	Well if you have auto immune problems sadly live vaccines can cause some issues. I had to have the chicken pox vaccine last year (two doses). Because I was starting immunosuppressants. I knew the trade off could be a relapse or two. First round want too bad just a week of drop foot. But the second round caused both legs to have drop foot. Now it's permanent. The relapses are caused by the stress the vaccines/attenuated virus causes on the body. Relapses get triggered from stressful events anyways so it makes absolute sense that a vaccine would also do this. Now I've been on immunosuppressants I have to watch out with each live vaccine, most are an absolute no go. Although they still don't know entirely which vaccines on a whole will cause an issue. However it's still safer to have the vaccines in majority of cases. But it's a trade off we have to accept before doing so.

390	convinced	If your needle was the width of a Boba straw perhaps. And why 5G? Why wouldn't you use 4G or 3G, hell - even 2G is still used by trackers you buy on Chinese websites. Antennas need certain lengths to transmit particular frequencies, and need power. No, you're not fitting a power source, or a means of getting power from the body or radio waves, into something that a needle can inject. Or a transmitter. Although, while you're getting your vaccine, a hacker in the next room could hack your phone so it transmitted your location to whoever you want :) Seriously, if anyone is worried about body-trackers and still carries a phone, they are truly insane. I mean, they're probably not tracking you much even with your phone for anything other than delivering you ads, but still.
902	convinced	No you're not going to die, for one thing the large majority of babies who got the pertussis vaccine survived, otherwise why is the population what it is now? Also (Im assuming your in the US) back when you were a baby they used a whole-cell pertussis vaccine, and it could cause neurological problems for some babies, but now they use an acellular vaccine that is less likely to cause problems. Also, adults are given a smaller dose than babies, so there is really nothing to worry about
9	convinced	Kind of hard to avoid exposure unless you abandon being in contact with people completely - and even then, not all diseases that you can vaccinate against come from humans. It's not possible to (safely) avoid exposure.
554	informative	According to those that studied this very thing concerning misinformation, most of it is not actually misinformation. Presented at the WHO vaccine symposium in December 2019.
665	not sure	Ok that makes sense! I never had chicken pox, I‚Äôm pretty sure I got vaccinated for it, so I have like a passing knowledge of how it works. Thanks for clearing it up! :)
26	informative	I have not disputed this. Elements (mercury) are in compounds (thimerosal). Thimerosal, a compound, contains mercury, an element.

104	convinced	"Wakefield's study was retracted because the information was falsified, he was paid by a lawyer to manufacture evidence, and he had applied for a patent for a standalone measles vaccine. He lost his license for this and for performing unauthorized tests on children (not just blood draws, but lumbar punctures!) without the approval of an IRB. His paper said ""needs further testing,"" and 17 other much better designed studies were done, trying to replicate his results without success on millions of children worldwide. He may not have stated ""vaccines cause autism"" outright, but he certainly does now, and is making far more money than a single patented vaccine ever would have earned him."
605	not sure	That negative comment karma must feel good huh
234	convinced	There isn't anything I'm aware of that can make a person magnetic, let alone vaccines (of any sort). All US coins and most other modern coins that I'm aware of are non-ferrous meaning they aren't affected by even the strongest of magnets. The realistic choices boil down to either A, she stuck a coin to her slightly moist skin and has tricked herself into thinking it was more than it really was, or B, she's pulling your leg.
996	not sure	If you have trouble finding it, that's one thing. If you have trouble reading anything, that's another thing. But you're not even trying, so why would I? Clever quips work better when they aren't foiled by basic reading comprehension and, well, your own links.
738	informative	Technically there will be more autism because more people but the percentage won't increase
272	convinced	You can still homeschool if you have a problem with mandatory vaccines at public schools. It all depends on just how far you want to take this conviction to be against vaccines.
456	informative	The CDC says genetics are only part of the cause

2	convinced	When they say there's no thimerasol, they mean in the childhood schedule. That IS a fact.
785	not sure	I have addressed the accuracy of your comments, this isn't an ad hominem fallacy, you're ignoring my point. My intent was to make it clear that your lack of education on this subject makes you wholly unqualified to discuss it. Your level of education is almost irrelevant when it comes to debating political topics, but this isn't politics. These are concepts people spend their lives studying. Simply you saying my table salt analogy was a poor analogy shows that. It's genuinely difficult to accept that you aren't a child or a troll, given how inept you are regarding these concepts, even so delusional that you would correct undebated facts about chemistry and biochemistry. but your claim that elemental mercury is more toxic than organic mercury is simply not true, and the comparison to table salt was a poor analogy Explain, because, you need to be pretty specific if you're outright negating the foundations of biochemistry. To address your assertion that I'm wrong about mercury, I'm not. Here's an objective fact: elemental mercury as well as short-chain carbon derivatives are almost always more toxic that higher level mercury complexes due to reduced biochemical interaction opportunities and reduced ligand affinity. If you tell me that's wrong, it's clear you just don't know what you're talking about when it comes to this stuff. I'm sure I don't know anything about whatever you got a degree in. This is foundational biochemistry.
780	doubtful	if it were true there would be a higher rate of kids with autism How does the rate of kids with autism tell you that vaccines don't cause it?
622	not sure	Have you thought that blindly following an ideology without nuance regardless of consequences might not be a good thing?
443	convinced	The burden of proof is on those making the claim that there is a link between vaccines and autism. Since there is no evidence supporting the claim, it's not even necessary to disprove it.
399	convinced	That‚Äôs what I said. However there are folk lapping this up as gospel truth about vaccines. It‚Äôs scary to think that they are using this as a reason to put their kids at risk of iron lung among others
855	not sure	 To care about a websites name and not about the facts I don't care about its name, I care only about all the misleading and downright false things that are on it. Because I'm not afraid to find things out, I want to believe as many true things and as little false That's great, it's a very healthy attitude to have. I'd recommend working on some introductory biology classes, there's lots of open courseware-type materials from real universities out there
914	convinced	1 I'm from Israel 2 it's not working like that in my country unless you're in a real danger your parents choose what medical treatments they're child get. I wish I could get vaccinated without my parents permission because on high school I want to be a teen paramedic and I'm scared to get hepatitis (this is blood disease) and my sister is a teen paramedic and she is not vaccinated from hepatitis but she's ok right now. Hope I'll be too.
29	doubtful	"True or false- ""Thimerosal is a mercury-containing organic compound."" ???"
499	convinced	"May I ask if you are trying to convince your family, or yourself? You have to take a step back from all this stuff being thrown at you and ask- if even a small fraction of them are correct, why is it pediatricians, epidemiologists, and their various member organizations still recommend their use? If the answer is ""because big pharma,"" then you will have to reassess how much drug companies make off of vaccines. Hint: it's not a whole lot. Just a random study: that first one, let's say. Four to 12 days post 12 month vaccination, children had a 1.33 (1.29‚Äì1.38) increased relative incidence So, that works out to a 33% increased risk of whatever it is they're measuring, with a range of 29% to 38% increased risk (with a 95% confidence limit). Sounds like a lot! Ten to 12 days post 18 month vaccination, the relative incidence was 1.25 (95%, 1.17‚Äì1.33) which represented at least one excess event for every 730 children vaccinated. So.... one ""excess event"" for 730 vaccinations, or about 0.14%. That's.... not very much. And how many were bad enough to require hospitalization? There were non-significant increases in hospital admissions. So.... just about zero difference. The study primarily revolves around trying to reduce febrile seizures to a point lower than where they are, i.e.: reduce side effects even further. Secondly, many of the cited studies are going on about mercury. Thimerosal- the compound containing mercury used to preserve vaccines- has not been used in childhood vaccines for years, long enough that we should have seen a diminution in the rate of autism would that mercury was responsible. As it stands, all routine vaccines for use in those under the age of 6 do not contain thimerosal.( To be frank, if you're trying to convince your family, you're not going to be able to swim upstream against Facebook nonsense. Your best bet is to just say ""Thank you for your viewpoints,"" and go about vaccinating your kids based on the advice of an experienced pediatrician."
96	informative	I‚Äôve only heard about that with the chickenpox (which can also be deadly e.g. hemorrhagic varicella( ). If they did, it was highly misguided and irresponsible. People die from measles and the complications it causes. For example, it wipes out the memory of your immune cells, so you have the immune system of a newborn again and susceptible to everything you ever had before. They didn‚Äôt have the medical advances or knowledge that we do now. The vaccine wasn‚Äôt available until 1963.
214	convinced	My anti-vax aunt just posted this list( Has anyone seen this before? It seems pretty fishy, especially given that it only consists of the abstracts for these supposed papers.
807	informative	The WHO summarizes the conflicting research on this issue: The occurrence of encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccination has been an issue of intense scrutiny and debate. Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that ‚Äúthe balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccination‚Äù. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).
388	not sure	Biologically possible? Sure. Technically possible? No.
667	informative	just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they aren‚Äôt carrying the disease. According to the CDC once someone recovers from chickenpox they aren't contagious, but they may be contagious before they know they have it I think maybe having chicken pox as a kid makes you more likely to get it but I don‚Äôt think you have to have had chicken pox to get it. Shingles is an infection with the same virus as chickenpox, and can only happen if you have been exposed to the virus at some point in the past, and are not immune, it is usually a reactivation of the virus decades after chickenpox (no you are not contagious for all those decades) but shingles has been know to occur directly following exposure to the virus, and as a result of the vaccine virus as well
483	not sure	They actually have a point about the fact that you can't say that because something is safe to eat it must be safe to inject
460	convinced	Yay! People should teach their kids to be brave when getting vaccines.
779	convinced	"The Mawson study (not Mawsom, as the picture says) is not really a study. It's an online poll that specifically sought out anti-vaxx parents to be the ""unvaxxed"" population in their survey. Asking questions such as how frequently their child was sick over the course of many years from memory. No medical records were required for proof of non-vaccine status, proof of illness (or lack thereof) and so forth. You'll see it frequently touted by anti-vaxxers as the only study that investigates ""totally unvaxxed"" children compared to the general population. It's simply a joke. There's no way to verify any of the children that are supposedly data points in the study even exist."
507	doubtful	So? There are many people uncomfortable vaccinating their second and third children because their first child had such a bad reaction. What's your point?
120	doubtful	Oh I see. You assume I didn't read it and wasn't pointing out the hypocracy of what is reported.
261	not sure	I knew that you libtards weren't stupid, you legit just want people to die
64	convinced	Please don‚Äôt call it ‚Äúpro vaccination.‚Äù Call it modern, evidence based, life saving way that a human should participate in society.
782	informative	"The Mawson study has been retracted twice.( Both studies surveyed the parents of 666 home-schooled children, 39% of whom where not vaccinated, and concluded that vaccination increased the risk of neurodevelopmental problems, particularly if children were born prematurely. Even if it hadn't been retracted, a study group of not even 700 children seems to be a poor basis for statistical analysis. ""....the CDC (a drug company that owns over 52 patents for vaccines) says they're 'safe and effective'"" is an interesting assertion. This makes it sound as if the CDC is responsible for manufacturing vaccines used in childhood, and is making a profit from it, and somehow the researchers and investigators that are in the employ of the CDC are directly profiting. This site( is useful for viewing this assertion in context. Just a quick recap: The CDC buys a lot of vaccines from manufacturers for distribution. Aside from perhaps a few extraordinary and obscure experimental vaccines, the CDC does not mass-manufacture vaccines. The CDC does hold patents; more specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services holds these patents. Most of these technologies involve the vaccine technology, and ostensibly allow the government to control intellectual property such that what researchers have developed on the public dollar don't end up being capitalized by industry, where the price would get marked up. But I would generally recommend reading the whole darned page, not just my summary."
821	informative	"This isn't where the idea that vaccines cause autism started, but this ""study"" did make the idea much more widespread"
867	convinced	1) why are you getting so defensive about a youtube link? Did I say anything disparaging about learning through Youtube? Calm down. 2) i never said Andrew Wakefield was jailed. But he did lose his medical license and has been discredited over and over again. 3) you lose all credibility if you bring up Andrew Wakefield in any anti-vax argument. 4) not interested in reading any of your links. Are any of them links to credible peer-reviewed studies? If not, then don't waste your time posting them to me.
582	informative	Case study of one elderly male with significant risk factors. He would have had to have teetering on the edge of having a stroke for the minor inflammation associated with vaccination to have causal relationship.
137	doubtful	Why is it sounding like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel? Look at the actual study. The conclusion just asks for more study. Why does that upset anyone? Why did it first get published and then take so long to be retracted? Why is the statement of retraction basically the same as the study conclusion? You didn't answer these main questions.
