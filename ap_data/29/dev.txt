792	not sure	It's not a fucking analogy. It's an excerpt from the basics of organic chemistry. I'm %100 certain you've never taken a class in organic chemistry. Your ignorance shines through your words. Don't tell me there's a difference between heavy metal toxicity and simple unstable elements. There's a million differences but the CONCEPT that molecules are NOT the sum of their atomic parts ALWAYS shines through. Do you know what mercuric, gold, or palladium catalysts are?

611	informative	The pacific northwest outbreak didn't cause any deaths, you should edit your post to say cases, not deaths
46	convinced	" I meant it was an error to say the death rate was 1 in 1,000 before the vaccine I understand you're saying that. I don't believe it. I said the case-fatality rate may be going up as the number of cased dropped due to vaccination Which would be an interesting hypothesis considering the apparent mortality rate hasn't changed from pre-1963 to recent outbreaks. I don't see much support for it from where I'm standing. (more recent data actually shows 1 in 250) That could be something. What does it say then? If you're curious, read it. Did you miss ""but isn't a reason not to vaccinate""? Also note that in the comment I linked I also say the vaccine has reduced deaths No. It's still a good resource. I wasn't the one who said ""Known calculation error"", but even if I was, arguing semantic details is pointless It's not arguing semantics. And in any case, you'd be saying it's ""probably an error"" which is unsubstantiated. I am not OP, all my info is coming from the CDC Ah, I see that now. "
882	informative	Andrew Wakefield did get approval, from a parents involved.
283	convinced	Yeah that’s true. Good thing is she doesn’t see her too often. So that gives me enough time to continue talking her up to the vaccine. Plus I’m pretty sure my mom is committed to it. At least for now. It was a painless effort on her first shot. So thankfully she won’t think much about getting the 2nd.
468	informative	"The study doesn't say people are forgetting their boosters, it says there is evidence that the vaccine doesn't stop people form being asymptomatic carriers They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection. ""However, Merkel notes that there was a “startling” difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: “After they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren’t sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.” When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals. This is talking about vaccinated animals, not unvaccinated"
976	convinced	Sure. Just published recently.( Danish cohort study found no association with autism and MMR (and other) vaccines. This was compared to unvaccinated children. Of note is the observation that the unvaccinated children had higher rates of ASD than their vaccinated counterparts. Good news for you and your wife!
659	convinced	Yeah. Some cases happened in Europe too. A high number of vaccinated children would lower even more that number.
577	informative	As far as I know no vaccine requires the use of a tourniquet. Source....I'm a nurse.
302	convinced	When someone mentions the microchips, I say the same thing. I go along with it and ask how do you know you only get one and not several?! Their reactions are priceless.
827	convinced	Vaccines often cause a small fever in babies. It’s a result of the immune system doing its job. The fever in itself isn’t bad. But some babies already have epilepsy but haven’t had their fist seizure. A fever can trigger the first seizure. Now, this would have happened eventually when the kid got a cold or an ear infection. The vaccine didn’t cause his epilepsy. It did possibly however trigger his first seizure.
273	convinced	Some states have requirements for school and certain limit jobs, but that’s very different than someone “forcing” you to put something in your body. You are forced to go to school though...
83	doubtful	Same odds as getting struck by lightning, but would you carry an umbrella in a thunder storm?
579	convinced	"Honestly, thanks for letting the entire post know what type of person you are, who says ""Vaccines are evil""."
229	convinced	"I'm not epidemiologist, but the simple answer is that vaccinations that contain live, weakened versions of viruses (like the MMR vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, etc.) can cause you to ""shed"" the weakened version of the virus used in the vaccine. This is trivial because the weakened version of the vaccine is not enough to get a normal person sick in the first place- thats why they gave it to you in a vaccine. The COVID vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, so its literally impossible for you to shed anything since you're not taking a living, weakened version of the virus. Here is a children's hospital putting it a lot better than I can- Viral Shedding and COVID-19 — What Can and Can’t Happen("
804	doubtful	Um, well I was pretty unbiased looking into the issue... at first I found the low hanging fruit by the CDC and was leaning towards them being more beneficial than not. Then I started going through Suzanne Humphries lectures on her youtube page and many other documentaries and lectures, that's when the scales tipped in the other direction. Then I learned that there's never been done a double blind, placebo study of fully vaccinated verses fully unvaccinated. Honestly, I wouldn't vaccinate until a major such study is done by independent researchers. It could be done ethically by doing it on a voluntary basis. Or doing it an a large number of monkeys or what have you. Plus the HHS's requested report on how to improve VAERS finding that less than 1% of vaccine related injuries, including death, are even reported. The CDC ignored the results and are invested in the public perception of the vaccination schedule as being very safe. Those last two things made me decide not to vaccinate. I'm not really against them though, people can get them as much as they like, I'm merely against authoritarian-vaxxers, those who would mandate vaccination on the unwilling through coercion.
584	not sure	You almost definitely know more about this than me. XD
713	informative	"The final conclusion of the study( is exactly what they predetermined. Verstraeten was pressured to bury the link. “In phase II at HMO C, no significant associations were found. In no analyses were significant increased risks found for autism or attention-deficit disorder. “CONCLUSIONS: No consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes.” Dr. Bernier, pg 198: ""the negative findings need to be pinned down and published."" A belief system that’s not followed by the evidence. All laid out in the transcripts."
739	not sure	OH NO, THE PEARS ARE COMING TO KILL US
910	not sure	now im not gonna woosh you but this was a joke lol
117	doubtful	" recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine EXPERIENCE RASH AND FEVER which may be INDISTINGUISHABLE from measles The rash and fever are not the total of the measles pathology. Literally the entire point of the paper you cite is to distinguish in a rapid way wild type pathogenic measles from reactions to MMR. It is literally the justification for their assay, funding, and paper that MMR does not and cannot cause wild-type measles pathology. Some aspects make the distinction difficult. Try as you might, they are not equivalent and your source makes that clear. Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles. Yes the FEVER and the RASH can BOTH be SIMILAR in wild type MEASLES or a REACTION to the MEASLES component of the MMR VACCINE. NOWHERE do the AUTHORS suggest THAT wild-type measles IS clinically identical IN consequence TO the measles VACCINE component. True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever. And they also don't share other pathologies, hence the distinction being important from a public heath standpoint. You keep ignoring this. You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20. Death is about 1-2 per 1000 for wild-type measles, as well as immune repertoire depletion, deafness, pneumonia you mention, encephahlitis you mention. This doesn't happen with the vaccine component. The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine. Link it if you want me to consider it in our discussion. That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person And would kill thousands annually unnecessarily, along with the sequelae we've mentioned previously. But, sure, let's equate increased risk of a cold with measles pathology. and then gives you lifelong immunity. You can get lifelong immunity and avoid the disease with vaccines. Immunity isn't the goal--avoiding the disease and its ramifications is. Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles. We've literally mentioned excellent reasons, such as the unnecessary deaths of thousands and other bad sequelae. All of which has disappeared from the US due to vaccination. Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak? That's not my argument--that's what your study says. They didn't have the exact same physical reaction, they had a fever and rash. They were not shedding measles virus, they were potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus. They were not having a risk of pneumonia, encephalitis, or death. They were having an uncommon reaction to the vaccine strain. Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend. Vaccination failure exists. The solution is to titer and re-vaccinate, or rely on herd immunity. As for shedding from recent vaccinees, they'd be shedding attenuated vaccine virus. Which, again, is not pathogenic. There's no faith at play here. Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read? Either unable or unwilling, yes. Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD. Ah, here's that inability to read again. Let's fact check this bit. We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97. There are 400,000 infants in the VSD. That doesn't mean all were appropriate or selected for in their analysis. So you're already off base here. But it gets better. A 2-phased retrospective cohort study was conducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during 1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born during 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks for neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per increase of 12.5 _x0001_g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months of life So, no, they didn't use a smaller sample size. The exact inclusion criteria of the abstract presented isn't known, since only the abstract has been saved. And, no, phase II doesn't use a smaller sample size or remove the first. It is a comparison of a different HMO investigating rates found in the first two HMOs. And there was no association. And, finally, this study (both phases) looks at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th month of life whereas the initial abstract is just about the first month. This is also evident when you look at the sheer number of disorders found in the full paper's phase I as it clearly outnumbers the total of all disorders of the abstract. So my advice: work on that reading comprehension. You've got some words down, but the ability to interpret meaning is tripping you up. Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children. No, all associations and RR of significance in phase I were analyzed at a different site. It's not the ""most common"" but those with apparent RR of concern. It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant. How so? The sample size of the abstract isn't known. The paper has a combined sample size of 140,887. The significance of phase I isn't removed by addition of a smaller sample size. That makes no sense at all. Do you not understand how that makes no sense? Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation. Which they investigated. And found no apparent significance at different HMOs. And recommended further study with larger samples and consistent diagnostic criteria. In no way were the results buried. Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along. You're living in a fantasy land. They published the study. You (claim) to have read it yourself. Thanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study. No problem. Keep hitting the books. Read them, also, but keep hitting them, too."
349	informative	Summary of information from the AMA (source below): The pandemic slows down as we reach herd immunity through a combination of infection and vaccination. Experts estimate that, based on how contagious COVID-19 is, about 70% of the population would need to be immune for herd immunity to be effective. Keep in mind as well that none of the vaccines are 100% effective. But overall probably about 230 million people would need to be immune through a combination of infection and vaccination.
718	informative	Your talking about Walter? Lots of pharma associates and CDC attended the meeting.
150	informative	Hi, Just sharing my experience with the Pfizer Biontech 2nd dose covid vaccine. I received my 2nd shot yesterday around 630pm. This morning started like any other. I woke up at 630am, had my bkst, rode my bike up signal hill CA like I alway do, came back tobest, and all was peachy, around 1 pm, I felt extremely tired and bruised, my head started aching and I feel like I have a cold. Not trying to scare anyone, just plan your 2nd shot ahead of time.
389	not sure	Minions dosent exist why should your children
74	doubtful	"You said there's more mercury in what I eat every day than in a vaccine. I don't eat tuna every day. So would you like to change your statment to ""There's mercury in tuna."" or are you sticking with ""There's more mercury in what I eat everyday than vaccines.""?"
416	convinced	It's like poeple fail to understand the basic tennants of civilisation and the idea that every protection you have is a social contract.
40	not sure	Similar things can also be said about small groups of scientists who don't believe in evolution, or deny climate change. They're all still quacks.
724	convinced	Unfortunately there's not a study about this. Read here. They extrapolated the results from the use of methylmercury and didn't study ethylmercury separately :( which is sad. But it's pointless now, as only the flu shot has ethylmercury now. I guess you can point out how they're different compounds and their results are irrelevant. Antivaxxers won't care though.
684	informative	Flu vaccine less effective the more you take it. “Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.” Flu vaccine less effective if taken every year. And And “On Feb. 5, 2015, other Canadian researchers published interim estimates of 2014/15 influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalization. The figure for people aged 65 and over was −32.9%, according to findings from the Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network of the Canadian Immunization Research Network.” Not effective for very young and old, who would actually need protection “In 2 seasons with suboptimal antigenic match between vaccines and circulating strains, we could not demonstrate VE in preventing influenza-related inpatient/ED or outpatient visits in children younger than 5 years.” “Influenza vaccines are efficacious in children older than two years but little evidence is available for children under two. There was a marked difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. That no safety comparisons could be carried out emphasizes the need for standardisation of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies.” Flumist vaccine sheds: “we observed 6.3 (95% CI ‪1.9–21.5‬) times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons. “ - WHO dr talks abt influenza and vaccines, admits low efficacy - ave abt 30% - nurse on flu shots

668	informative	"Why is this mom excited about the chicken pox? Probably because chickenpox is more serious for adults than children, and is a virus that can build up long term immunity, so she is hoping that by getting chickenpox now will prevent a more serious case of chickenpox when the kids are older Is it not dangerous? Serious complications are not common, 1 in 300-500 chickenpox cases requires hospitalization and 1 in 60,000 results in death My kids are both fully vaccinated (4 and 2 years old), are they protected? No guarantee, the vaccine is not 100% effective, and the second dose isn't given until age 4-6, so it is still best to keep your kids away from sick people until they are no longer sick. According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox? Yes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected? This is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""? Yes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)"
500	informative	"OK, Here goes for the second study, it is paywalled so I can't really see the whole thing but it says Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life. This raises the possibility that some issue at birth is associated with both autism and postponement of vaccination, the including of 3 year olds who may not have been diagnosed yet, along with the use of ""parental report of autism diagnosis"" rather than medical record could also possibly create issues This study was also done before mercury was removed from hepatitis B vaccine in the US, so besides the potential for confounding variables it is looking at a vaccine with a no longer used preservative (still used in certain flu shots, but not hepatitis vaccine). I don't think this is an entirely conclusive study STUDY #3: This is comparing different countries, which is just asking for confounding variables, I'm not even sure I want to bother reading through a study that I can tell from the abstract is so inconclusive. Also, the only author is journalist who runs an antivax group STUDY #4 is a case report of an unusual event and is inconclusive because such case reports can't determine if the deaths were a coincidence or not STUDY #5 Is of an unsafe vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns and has now been replaced with a different version STUDY #6 Is just a temporal correlation, one of the weakest forms of evidence, and c an be used to draw all kind of ridiculous conclusions, examples here: This study also uses number of pediatricians in a state as the measure of access to care, which is ridiculous, as finance, transportation, population, geography, ect also affect access to care Also, the author is an economist, not a doctor STUDY #7 Just says a whistleblower said vaccines cause autism, a lot more info is needed to know what is going on here STUDY #8 is interesting but jumps to conclusions, as the info provided is insufficient to establish causation, it may be that an overactive immune system causes both the autoantibodies and the abnormal immune response to measles vaccine, rather than that the vaccines causes the autoantibodies. And if the vaccine does cause the autoantibodies, then measles itself likely also would, and may present a greater risk than the vaccine STUDY #9 is once again based on temporal correlation and comparison of different countries, see #6 and #3 for why that is bad I have to go to bed now, will look at more of these soon though"

376	informative	Quit stealing images. Downvote this poster.
778	informative	Depends on the specific hypothesis. If it's organic mercury, its inclusion and then removal from vaccines should be preceding a similar trend in ASD diagnosis. If it's alum or just antigen, then we would expect an increase depending on age or decrease over time, respectively There's no anti-vaxx hypothesis in which ASD rate remains constant across the time periods we can reliably analyze.

It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant.

(This study analyzed existing data in the VSD so they could literally have done this study with a computer in a few hours). Remove the Hep B vaccine indefintely for non-risk newborns until further study was completed. Only administer it to at-risk newborns if their mother tested positive for Hep B during pregnancy. It is a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease given on the first day of life. It would have made zero difference.

968	convinced	Also the study not broke out by race No reason to. now that we know that those of African descent respond differently to vaccination than caucasians (at least to the MMR) That's a hilarious assertion. So we have a study comprised of children all most likely of a single ethnic/racial background (white and northern European) with no racial/ethnic diversity considered whatsoever. The diversity is representative of the Danish population. So you concede there is no cause for concern among the Danish population. Excellent. Now we just need to walk you from this bizarre racial angle. If you think race is a better predictor of autism risk factors than sex, smoking during pregnancy, family history of ASD diagnosis, head circumference at birth, weight at birth, method of birth delivery, and, vaccination status...then yous an idiot. But you don't really think that, it's just the convenient way you try to remedy your cognitive dissonance. We get it. We can draw NO universal conclusions from this study. Not even your own logic supports this ridiculous claim. In the most conservative interpretation, even if we assume your hypothesis about race to have some merit, we can now rule out all medical, non-race, factors from influencing ASD development in association with vaccines. And by extension based on the Danish population we can confidently declare that anyone of caucasion descent also has no differential response, either. So good job, pal. You convinced nobody but yourself--again.
547	not sure	There was never a vaccine for the plague so wtf are you talking about? No one died in the north american outbreak of measles. As for other places (like third world countries) I'm gonna let you try and figure it out for yourself, genius. Why DO so many die in third world countries as opposed to first world countries? Come on, I know you can do it.

98	convinced	Although I don't believe this to be true about the COVID-19 vaccine, this recent conspiracy theory has got me thinking about this, can this even work? Wouldn't a tracker require a battery source? Would a microchip fit into a syringe?
970	informative	Also the study not broke out by race - now that we know that those of African descent respond differently to vaccination than caucasians (at least to the MMR). So we have a study comprised of children all most likely of a single ethnic/racial background (white and northern European) with no racial/ethnic diversity considered whatsoever. We can draw NO universal conclusions from this study.
218	informative	I bet the local health departments (who promote vaccinations) would be more than happy to cooperate in having random and repeated inspections of all Brinker properties... Please tweet or contact Chili's on Facebook to let them know your opinion
439	informative	The argument that there is a genetic component to autism is not by itself a proof that vaccines cause autism. I'm not saying vaccines cause autism, I'm saying many people say that autism is 100% genetic, which is not true I often argue the fact the people unvaccinated for MMR get autism at about the same rate as people vaccinated for MMR is good evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. This is correct, what is not correct is saying that one autistic unvaccinated person proves vaccines don't cause autism When talking about common arguments made on reddit, you have to realize that most people on both sides of any subject are often not educated enough to make adequate arguments, and both sides often have people making poor arguments. Which is exactly why I made a post trying to correct some of those poor arguments
347	informative	They had a web site that asked about 10 basic questions and it told you if you qualified for the trial. If you qualified then they said they would call you for your first appointment which lasts 3 or 4 hours. There is a trial search site online. They filled up the one I’m in for J&J, but opened a second one for a 2 shot version - my wife is getting her first shot in that trial tomorrow. You also get paid, I’ve gotten $260 so far, $150 for first visit.
138	convinced	Is that what the study said? Did you read the study? Did you actually read the conclusion? The conclusion is saying the same thing as the supposed retractions. That is a fact.
576	convinced	If that was what was on her mind, she would not be bare handing it and she most definitely would not be holding the freaking syringe in her mouth. Honestly, I'm not anti-vaxx. What worries me is uneducated people seeing this crap storm meme.
335	not sure	Good and accurate summary of debating points but would be far more useful if you added references to your statements
940	convinced	Ok I had three points 1. Vaccines aren’t perfect they fail to protect sometimes because they just teach your immune system your immune system is still doing all the heavy lifting 2. Your immune system gets worse as you get older you aren’t loosing antibodies you’re just getting older 3. Yes you people (antivaxxers ) are responsible for the measles outbreak
160	informative	Dear all, We have prepared a short #survey, where you can express your opinion about the #COVID19Vaccine #CoronaVaccine. If you are living in the #USA, we will be grateful if you will participate and share: COVID19 Vaccination survey( #COVID19 #vaccine #vaccination #coronavirus #pandemic #covid #research #publichealth #health #medicine #covid19insights Thanks for taking and sharing this survey!

748	not sure	I was doing my best to explain this until you started attacking my motives, anyway I don't think so. I suggested you were acting in bad faith after several back-and-forths where you never explained yourself or why you were assigning specific arguments to OP. And at each point you had every opportunity to explain what you meant and why you thought so, and you never did. I am saying that just because most people don't have autism doesn't tell you about what causes autism, only changes, or lack thereof, in the number of people with autism can tell you this You originally said that OP claimed a rate of ASD independent of change or what not was enough to determine if vaccines had any effect on ASD. OP never claimed this, and you never explained why one might presuppose a static rate of ASD was reasonable to begin with. And that was what I was trying to tell you. ASD rates have changed independent of vaccines. You cannot look at one point in time and conclude anything. You insisting that OP said that is bad faith, since there is nothing to indicate that's what they meant, you never asked them about it, and there are plenty of reasonable interpretations on the table. I think you've now tried to walk it back to a more general rebuttal of something that, well, nobody suggested was the case to begin with.
288	convinced	Chickenpox used to be almost universal among children before the chickenpox vaccine. So you probably had it when very young. 1 in 3 adults who had chickenpox can later get shingles, sometimes more than once. No relation to MMR.
411	convinced	They claimed that vaccines caused them numerous health issues- When I asked how and why, this was their response. @BewareTheNeedle. Instagram needs to remove this and other similar accounts.
626	convinced	It IS illegal not to wash your hands if you work in food service or other areas where people would be unwittingly exposed to your dirty ass hands. Vaccines are for hygiene. Like washing your hands, showering, brushing your teeth. It's meant to keep you healthy, but also to protect the rest of society. Like vaccines, indoor plumbing and the regular hygiene that comes with it is one of the many reasons that we don't die of preventable illnesses anymore. What you don't get is that vaccinations are meant to protect your health, but also the health of others around you. It is illegal to speed, drive drunk, not wear a seatbelt for the same reason. Vaccines have the same safety record as seatbelts. Why shouldn't people be forced to use them just like we're forced to use seatbelts?
333	convinced	SARS-1 and MERS dont exist any more so why should anyone produce a vaccine against them? People have been working on AIDS for decades but retroviruses are particularly difficult to vaccinate against. We could create an effective flu vaccine if we were sure which of the many variants would appear in a given year. At the moment current covid vaccines have moderate to great effectiveness against current strains but it is possible vaccines may need to be tweaked a bit if more resistant variants emerge. The mRNA technology fortunately allows more rapid development and modification of vaccines.
890	convinced	don't fell bad, my bud. learned about this garbage about... well idk but it was before the movement was so big. im confused af about it, tbh. to summarize what it is, well, it's a bunch of Karens just saying vaccines cause autism and taking essential oils instead. edit: the garbage is the anti-vaxx movement.
908	not sure	Adults are by far the worse side effect of any medicine.
823	not sure	This video is great. Thank you. I shared it. I can only hope now.
925	informative	There probably isn't a good macro analogy for it but I wouldn't worry about it. Analogies are just for the specific points, not every aspect on both levels
978	informative	I don't know that such a study has been done, the IRB would say it is unethical to not give vaccines to the unvaxxed group
681	convinced	Geezus, you're a prodiseaser, aren't you?
106	not sure	Still waiting. Why can’t you just post it here?
504	doubtful	Of course not all “pro vax” individuals are the same. Honestly I think most are just uninformed/ misinformed. But the ones that call for segregation, loss of medical autonomy, or charges of abuse are definitely fascists. You don’t have to be monitored 24/7 to be experimented on. Tests performed illegally, without the knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects are unethical experiments. They do not provide information on the actual harms before getting consent, they bully people into consenting, they do not study the population they will actually be giving the vaccine or for any appropriate length of time. Again, see the comment in regards to vaccination of pregnant women. “Human subject research is systematic, scientific investigation that can be either interventional or observational and involves human beings as research subjects.” Absolutely food is important! We avoid eating out and buy all organic and non-gmo. Also, you have to worry about lotions, shampoos, makeup, tampons, toothpaste, etc. you absorb chemicals though your skin too.
198	convinced	I am of the mind to report social media groups that identify as anti-vaxxers as dangerous and miss-leading. Whether it’s a YouTube video or a Facebook Page, etc. My thinking is that such groups simply become more and more influential through confirmation bias and thus promote more people towards dangerous actions. When you visit these groups the degree of critical thinking and criticism drops because every statement no matter how ridiculous reinforces the same misleading theme that vaccines are bad. So now the claims are not just vaccines cause autism, it’s vaccines cause cancer, diabetes, Down syndrome, depression, genetic mutations, and so forth. And yes I have read all these ridiculous claims made by anti-vaxxers. The evolving implied insanity is becoming that vaccines cause disease! My thought is that these anti-vaxxers do not deserve a social media platform to further nurture their growing ignorance. I encourage everyone to report all anti-vaxxers social media groups as ‘misleading’ and ‘potentials dangerous.’ Because there actions affect us, not just them!
966	informative	"Yawn. I'm ""caucasian"". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa. No, we can't draw ANY conclusions about the genetic history of anyone getting vaccines. Obviously. We don't understand shit about the role of genetics in immunity right now. Another example? Pandemrix and narcolepsy. That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger? That one was pretty bad."
977	informative	" Here it is. It's not exactly good news for the pro-vax crowd. You won't really find much else in the way of a comparison; ahem - ""ethical issues"" in studying vaxxed vs. unvaxxed, as cited by the other commenter."
587	informative	I don't think there is a particular irreversible point that has been identified but it possible that we would reach such a point, perhaps as early as the late 2020's, but this is not yet clear and we could have more time. What is clear is that we need to invest in new technology to generate power without CO2 emissions, and we need to do it now, but extinction of humans is in no way definitive, and talking about human extinction is a distraction from the very real problems climate change is causing and will continue to cause
831	not sure	Oh man you're really good at Internet conversations I want to keep this one up forever. Insult me more Daddy!
101	not sure	Don’t feel bad. I wasn’t in a coma & am also confused ab what is going on. I only uncovered it when I became a parent & saw people openly asking for pediatrician recommendations for doctors that don’t “push vaccines” in fb groups.
355	doubtful	Yes. That's because people are dumb and there are always going to be those two that believe everything. Also it's not a harmless conspiracy like flat earth. It's extremely dangerous as it can lead to the death of several individuals.
205	convinced	 And I'm completely fine, do some research lol.
387	convinced	Even the smallest computers will cause a blood clot. There are much easier ways to track you
703	convinced	"First of all, double blind studies need large masses of people and it's unethical. Like, if you give a placebo to some infants that could be saved from tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis etc, would you do it? What if they die from that disease? Example for the rotavirus vaccine A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. Another problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life! Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. See? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results. While this paper focuses specifically on the use of placebo controls, similar considerations apply to open designs in which a placebo is not used, but an unvaccinated control group is included. Another great article. For the other thing: First it was ""mercury"" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. The dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it. Doesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever they claim today. PS: skeptical raptor is an MD and his blog has done many articles debunking their bullshit, with sources."
521	doubtful	Well, that's besides the point. Is trusting in medical practices and or practioners, which is blind faith, a mental disorder?: yes. Is it a danger?: yes. Is it a detriment to our rights to discriminate against antivaccination beliefs or to favor vaccination beliefs?: yes. Is there grounds to stock faith in vaccinations?: no, and Ambiguity disqualifies the validity of vaccinations.
637	not sure	And why are you so incapable of having a conversation without becoming insulting? Grow up a little sweetie or f off.
175	doubtful	Dihydrogen monoxide is a deadly chemical that causes excess sweating, urination, and even death!! Read the ingredients people!!!
471	convinced	 Basically you can have antibodies against a toxin that the bacterium produces, so you are not harmed by the infection, but not have enough antibodies against the bacterium itself, so the germs are still in you, and can be spread, but you don't feel noticeably sick Nope. That's not true. Healthy carriers can exist, but not for preventable diseases through vaccination. They can exist for staph aureus, for some strep spp. for example. But not the diseases someone is vaccinated against. There are literally no asymptomatic carriers, like there are in COVID-19. cannot wait for that source tho ;) PS: I know you from the multiple comments you leave on a lot of subreddit about vaccines. I tagged you a loooong time ago for the half truths you're saying here and there. And let me tell you: i can smell your bullshit from far away. You aren't pro vaxx. Or if you're struggling to be, you're still very far from being pro vaxx. Do a better job if you're not antivaxx anymore, as you keep claiming!
826	convinced	The herd-immunity concept is based on a faulty assumption that vaccination elicits in an individual a state equivalent to bona fide immunity (life-long resistance to viral infection). As with any garbage in-garbage out type of theory, the expectations of the herd-immunity theory are bound to fail in the real world.
222	convinced	Less so but apparently with the booster Pfizer is fairly effective in staving off serious illness.
604	not sure	Yes 'cause the fact that opposing opinions from a site such as this REALLY impacts my life. Oh my. Whatever shall I do?
38	not sure	 neurobiologists ... lawyers Oh, good, that's relevant.
832	not sure	Yes, bitch, the shill went the opposite direction of what i said. Are you as retarded as them?
8	convinced	I'm saying that even if you live away from people, you can still get diseases from plants / funghi. Things like Malaria, Dengue and JEV can be gotten from animals. And if you're on Reddit, you got some piece of technology. This is pretty silly. :P
133	informative	So on the one hand you say a paper is needed, on the other you say read a commentary for explanation.
258	not sure	You may not be lying. Doesn't mean you're playing with the full deck and can be trusted in matters of objective reality.
578	not sure	I hope to god this is supposed to be satire
934	not sure	In a coma Wakes up Holy hell you guys seriously messed up while I was away
162	informative	Novel Coronavirus is a big threat to the world and all the doctors are trying to make the vaccine of COVID-19. But there is no such dedicated and preventive coronavirus vaccine( is available in the world medical centers.
769	not sure	"You clearly misunderstood what I said Maybe I did, could you clarify? if you're going to shut down like this All i'm trying to ""shut down"" is a ridiculous diversion into false speculation about my motives for saying the title is wrong, the reason I think it is wrong is because if vaccines caused something it could affect 1 in 1 million kids or 1 in 5, or anywhere in between"
317	informative	Understandable. But Imma tell a you straight away. Viruses don't need that in order to mutate. Especially the covid kind. There's a reason why there is a new normal flu one every year.
78	not sure	No that is not my point, which is why I didn't say that. I can't talk to you if you're going to ignore everything I say and respond only to your own perceived insinuations, as you've just done. Please re-read and respond to my previous comment/what I actually said.
833	not sure	No you didn't you just repeated what you had already said. The other poster and you very pointed and specific questions and you didn't even try to answer them.
313	doubtful	"Please cite a serious reference that ""everyone has swole polio in their brains""? Whatever ""swole polio"" may be. Everyone else sees that thanks to vaccines the rate of death or paralysis from polio has plummeted."
48	convinced	 Measles has never been eliminated. The Americas were declared measles free back in 2016. I'm guessing you confused 'locally eliminated' with 'globally eradicated'. There have been cases every year since the introduction of the vaccine. You mean since the virus has existed? Then take into account vaccine strain virus shedding after MMR. Reports of throat, blood, and urine samples all testing positive for vaccine strain measles infection up to 5 weeks from vaccination. Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations. During the 2015 California measles outbreak, many suspected cases actually occurred in persons who were recently vaccinated. Wrong( Among the 110 California patients, 49 (45%) were unvaccinated; five (5%) had 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, seven (6%) had 2 doses, one (1%) had 3 doses, 47 (43%) had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, and one (1%) had immunoglobulin G seropositivity documented, which indicates prior vaccination or measles infection at an undetermined time. Which is entirely consistent with vaccination efficacy. 194 measles virus sequences were collected in 2015, with 73 cases found to have actually been vaccine strain measles. Wrong again: The source of the initial Disney theme park exposure has not been identified. Specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last 6 months (1). Vaccine strain is not capable of causing wild-type disease. 2011 New York, report of 88 person measles outbreak started by a twice-vaccinated individual. Wow, let's hope this isn't a common occurrence. From your source: This is the first report of measles transmission from a twice-vaccinated individual with documented secondary vaccine failure. Impressive. You've convinced me fully. We should stop vaccinating. Can measles truly be eliminated if the live virus continues to be injected into the population with vaccines? Yep. Happened with smallpox, and from entire hemispheres with polio and measles. Did you forget that? And since you sent me a study discussing MMR, thimerosal and autism. You didn't read it. You should read it. The results of this study were never released by the CDC and an abstract was only obtained under FOIA request. Wait...you mean this unpublished study??? You'd apparently believe any bold-faced lie a fellow anti-vaxxer told you. Truly hot on the case!
217	convinced	"She's a little bit of a conspiracy nut and is super into homeopathy, but she also has a Ph.D. and has written books, so the usual idiocy isn't on display (at least rhetorically). If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were. Here's the post: ""Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be ""unavoidably unsafe"". Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine? Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism? Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia? Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their ""contamination"" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called ""herd immunity"", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning? Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will."""
128	doubtful	It is obvious. Vaccine industry is using the same tactics - My point. There was nothing wrong with Wakefield study at least nothing out of the norm especially when compared with the ludicrous vaccine safety studies. But hey the Danish paper right! It is all ridiculous.
305	not sure	sigh Am I really gonna go pull all my immunology notes from school? Well, I might when I get home from work. ;P
60	convinced	 “Thimerosal in concentrations of 0.001% (1 part in 100,000) to 0.01% (1 part in 10,000) has been shown to be effective in clearing a broad spectrum of pathogens. A vaccine containing 0.01% thimerosal as a preservative contains 50 micrograms of thimerosal per 0.5 mL dose or approximately 25 micrograms of mercury per 0.5 mL dose. For comparison, this is roughly the same amount of elemental mercury contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish”
920	convinced	Sorry for hy bad English. But basically, when you inject a vaccine, some cells called memory cells will be stocked in the ganglyon with a print of the antigene that a virus can wear, so if the virus come again with the antigene, your body will be able to recognize it and kill it. But those memory cells don't live forever. Some can live up to 10-15 years but that's all. That's why it's important to reinject the vaccine so memory cells can be created once again.
646	convinced	"No, it is their fault. Because they managed through fear mongering and blatant lies to lower the protection threshold of the herd immunity. If not enough people are vaccinated, the vulnerable ones are at risk! A lower number than 93-95% of the population who got the vaccines, will lead to epidemics or pandemics. Oooppss, never mind. I just saw you're a brainkess pro diseaser. Of course you wouldn't understand shit. Go away to your group of 💩 please, mr ""I had measles twice"". Lol"
845	convinced	Yeah I've run into them quite a bit, but they typically don't engage with me anymore. Normally she goes around searching for vaccine terms, places like /r/babybumps and tries to instill anti-vaxx rhetoric in variously cloaked or transparent ways. There's a couple others too that you can find if you profile dive me. If you went to a 2 month old thread you might like that ;)
328	informative	Do you have any idea of how vaccines work?
589	informative	Climate change is a major problem, but extinction by 2030 is totally unrealistic and not what scientists are saying, this meme is actually counterproductive by contributing to the narrative that concerns about climate are all just alarmism Crossposted to r/badscience
691	convinced	"Tell your mom you're extremely concerned about the nurse's belief in the vaccination and autism link (the original study on the ""link"" was eventually proven to have had falsified data). The fact that your dad is anti-vax is bad enough, but a medical professional should know better."
404	not sure	What the hell are you scared were gonna commence order 66 or something
962	doubtful	" ""To repeat: circulating H1N1 virus was correlated with increased narcolepys/cataplexy rates prior to vaccine campaigns in several countries."" Nope. There was a tiny subset in China in which there appeared to be some correlation between the virus and narcolepsy. No cases in Europe like that. They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus. About 1300 cases. All vaccine, no virus. Funny how genetics works, isn't it."
664	informative	Some. The oral polio and rotavirus vaccine can shed through fecal matter. But only to about a few days, a week.
536	convinced	I mean, it literally says 100 mcg/LITRE! But I guess lots of people don't know much a litre means? Or how much 100 mcg means? Anyway, definitely reminds of this ridiculous thing antivaxxers misread.
228	convinced	"The basic answer is, unless you can prove that the vaccine causes infertility then it doesn't. Ask her to find an actual published study concluding the vaccine caused infertility in any patient. I suspect no such thing exists, but if there is something in a trashheap ""journal"" feel free to bring it back here and we can look at their methodology and claims."
461	convinced	It is possible that some vaccines have been developed with fetus cells rather then animal testing it does not mean the cells are in the vaccine. A vaccine has dead cells of a virus/bacteria so that the immune system can learn how to fight the virus/bacteria off. The dead cells can not cause infection. (Because they are dead, duh).
528	not sure	I totally agree, and it is much harder to detox heavy metals once it is in the lymph nodes.
711	convinced	Conspiracy theories? You can believe that all day. Until you come up with answers the numbers will rise. You can call relative risk of 7.7 a correlation all day. LMAO SOCIETY IS FUCKED.
645	doubtful	"That's not what is portrayed in the media though is it? And surely they have done studies to verify a third dose is safe? Sorry but I know personally many people who ""should"" have immunity for measles and hep b but don't as verified by titer checks required for work. I must be bucking some serious odds in that case."
225	convinced	Smart girl. Stand up for your right to chose. We need a vaccine for Stupid is what we need.
557	informative	It does. It's highly infectious, like 0,0004 ml of infected blood can infect you with hep B, while only about 0,01 with HIV if i remember correctly. Also, hep B virus is veeeery resistant to usual disinfectants. Lasts even years in dry conditions on surfaces at room temperature. Aaand to top it all, it can give you chronic hepatitis as a kid in 90% cases. Whereas as an adult, in 90% cases you heal.
830	not sure	You were wrong. You tried to act like you knew what you were talking about. YOU tried to talk shit and defend him. Now youre shilling exactly like him and changing the subject.
694	doubtful	Every company manufacturing vaccines has been charged and convicted of lying to the public about the safety of its products. Vaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones. The ethical argument against double-blind placebo controlled studies is nonsense. In drug trial (vs biologics aka vaccines) a sick individual would be denied a drug that could potentially save their life in order to have a true control to determine an accurate basis of side effects for risk assessment. And in vaccine trials they will not only use a different vaccine as the “placebo”, they will also use a solution with the aluminum adjuvants in place of a saline solution. How is this beneficial to anyone? How is it more ethical to expose someone to the most questionable ingredient in the vaccine with no benefit of generating any kind of antibodies? It’s total nonsense. Aluminum does cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the body. The study “Flarend et al.” was a study of 6 rabbits over 28 days that looked at the absorption and elimination of Al adjuvants. The study admits we do not understand Al adjuvants in the body. “The disposition of aluminum containing adjuvants after intramuscular administration is not understood.” The study detected Al adjuvant in the brain, kidneys, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and heart. Most of Al still in the system after 28 days: “The cumulative amount of aluminum eliminated in the urine during the 28 days of the study was 6% of the Al hydroxide and 22% of the Al phosphate adjuvant dose. Aluminum from both adjuvants was still being excreted at a steady rate at day 28.” For Al hydroxide, about 100-5.6% = 94.4% of the aluminum remained in the rabbits after 28 days. For Al phosphate, about 100-22% = 78% remained in the rabbits after 28 days. We do not know the elimination rates of the Al still in the body after 28 days or what happened to the Al that travelled to the brain and other organs. Al and macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion “We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytosed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain. This strongly suggests that long-term adjuvant biopersistence within phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for slow brain translocation and delayed neurotoxicity” - mice show ASD symptoms after injection with AL - discussion of this study Immunologist argument against mandatory vaccination Vaccine fundamentalists cling to antiquated treatments not backed by true scientific process. No discussion allowed, dissidents will be shamed, and policy will be mandated. Thus preventing scientific progress and propagating pseudoscience. Science vs pseudoscience Scientific progress always takes a long time. And it is ever evolving. Even the now simple concept of hand washing took more than 20 years to catch on and Dr. Semmelweis was mocked and shamed for the notion that Drs may be spreading disease, suffered a nervous breakdown and died due to mistreatment in an asylum. This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo. Do not stop questioning just because you don’t understand the topic. That is when you should ask the most questions.
518	not sure	No one asked if they were engineered. So please, address the docket. Made. Triggering, infers, Not engineered.
721	not sure	What even is that? How did they establish a causation? I'm sure you heard that correlation doesn't imply causation.
971	informative	1st one is a questionable source. Seems slanted toward autism in general. 2nd one doesn't actually mention autism, that I could tell. I saw other ailments, but not autism. I also question the research methods, as it includes a sample that is very specifically white, homeschooled, Christian families and by survey (which doesn't have to be answered truthfully, and statistically aren't). These sources aren't much help to OP in either direction.
164	informative	So a nurse friend of mine is antivax(idk how she gets a job). She posted some cdc vs icandecide supreme court case. I'm trying to find formation about the case but cant find anything online except for what she provided. Apparently the ruling was that the cdc doesnt have any proof that vaccines did not cause autism. Any help or clarification?
736	not sure	Good luck getting this through their thick skulls, they ask for peer reviewed papers, and even then will ignore it. Trust me, i've tried to tell them this.
36	convinced	See my comment above, this probably is a error on the part of the cdc, but isn't a reason not to vaccinate Also, your link doesn't talk about the effects of measles, it just says MMR doesn't cause autism
149	convinced	"""Can any person say what may be the consequences of introducing a bestial humour into the human frame after a long lapse of years? Who knows beside, what ideas may rise, in the course of time, from a brutal fever having exercised its incongruous impression on the brain? Who knows also, that the human character may undergo strange mutations from quadruped sympathy; and that some modern Pasiphae may rival the fables of old."" Benjamin Moseley (early antivaxxer objecting to Jenner's use of cowpox in preventing smallpox infection. Pasiphae was a mythological being, half-cow, half-human). Moseley seemed to be suggesting that giving people cowpox might turn them into cows. The resemblance to modern anti-vaxxer rhetoric is striking. Moseley too suggests implausible outcomes and sets them in the distant future so their absence now won't invalidate his argument. Quote derives from 1853 issue of Lancet as quoted in Berman, Antivaxxers:How to challenge a misinformed movement"""
406	convinced	Hello. I am a nursing student displaced from clinical rotation due to Covid-19. I found your post regarding your concern relating to your child’s safety with updated vaccines. As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked here( According to the CDC, “everyone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season. Disclaimer: I am not a medical doctor. Please follow the advice of your Primary Care Physician. I can answer questions, but my information does not take the place of what your primary physician states. References: CDC, (2020, April 28). Influenza (Flu). CDC. (2020). 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old Mayo Clinic. (2018, July 11). Measles vaccine: Can I get the measles if I’ve already been vaccinated?
18	convinced	Think about this. When you eat french fries, chloride isn't one of the fucking ingredients. So why do vaccines that have thimerasol, in your mind, contain mercury?
230	not sure	Try to get something stick to you through a handkerchief. Then I'll be impressed.
21	doubtful	"So you agree with the statement, ""Thimerosal is a mercury-containing organic compound.""?"
442	doubtful	Usually the burden of proof is on the one making the claim, yes, but if you are telling someone to take a vaccine, the burden of proof is on you to show that it is safe
620	not sure	I don't, I read papers and go through the methods and analysis myself
984	convinced	This greatly upsets me. My comment? or the OP? I agree with much of what you say, but I will say that the fraud you refer to was in 1998, but the idea of vaccines causing autism started in the 1980s
522	not sure	Doea that tin-foil hat ever get itchy?
747	doubtful	"I'fe been trying my best to explain this, and I am having trouble explaining it well,, but I am definitely acting in good faith You cannot look at one point in time and conclude anything. So we agree on this point This part of the title ""vaccines don’t cause autism and said that if it were true there would be a higher rate of kids with autism and there is not."" made me think OP was trying to draw conclusions from one point in time, which I was saying is incorrect"
259	doubtful	Gene editing experimental mRNA frankenshot that killed every animal in every study, go brrrrr
111	convinced	Everything is okay in modesty. Sure Mercury is poisonous, but so is literally everything else att the right amount. Simple.
264	doubtful	"This is what you call Stockholm syndrome, Fauci is your kidnapper and your savoir The ""vaccine"" is deadly, wake up. This will be the most unfortunate I told you so of my life, I've already had two family members die from serious reaction to the vaccine, and I know dozens that are having bad reactions already. 2 years from now, we will see mass death, 7 years, the world will be unrecognizable, they will say covid variants till we're 95% of us are dead, under the United Nations plan: Agenda 21"
192	informative	"and yet... ""Flu vaccines in multi-dose vials contain thimerosal to safeguard against contamination of the vial. Most single-dose vials and pre-filled syringes of flu shot and the nasal spray flu vaccine do not contain a preservative because they are intended to be used once."""
431	not sure	Gee I'd hate to think of what kind of device your posting on.
351	informative	Do your research and not on Google. Yes it is possible
395	informative	Nanotechnology just refers to the size of the media being used. Tiny Lipid nanoparticle droplets to carry the vaccine as fat soluble and not water soluble. People out here thinking Stark Industries is real.
319	not sure	One last question! If you think it’s bullshit, why are you arguing with me? Why are you trying to prove me wrong? If u think i’m an idiot why would you shrink to my level? As I can see you have a lot of time.
24	convinced	That's not how chemistry works, Dr. Dumbass. If this were the case, table salt would literally kill you upon ingesting.
116	informative	And Wakefield's colleague, John Walker-Smith, had his license reinstated.
485	informative	 This law professor explains the case. Also, you can see the court document published by ICAN if you scroll through my comments or I imagine google the relevant details.
508	informative	Did you know that some mothers cant breastfeed and have to resort to formula because they are uncomfortable with using another person's breastmilk.
329	doubtful	 they contain a weakened form of the virus False. Sure, in theory they could tell us that that was what was in them and put something else in Exactly. There is no telling what is in that bottle. They all could be the same exact thing from all companies, just withdifferent labels. Could be anything under the sun. the results we see from taking vaccines are exactly what you would expect from the stated ingredients Death, vision issues, increased heart rate, more death, chills, fevers, prolonged headaches, nightmares, hives, death, the wobbles, sunken face, death, etc. Yeah.
891	not sure	anti-vaxxers on this thread be like:
465	convinced	Both studies. On both animal and humans have mentioned waning immunity. But none quantified it. And I already explained to you yhat because the vaccine is acellular, the immunity will wear of completely. So it becomes irrelevant if they're vaccinated, because they have no immunity if they don't get boosters during adulthood. Hence why they're carriers.
301	informative	This needs sources EDIT: look at OP's userpage, this is a downvotes troll
919	not sure	You are a true survivor. Thoughts and prayers
663	not sure	I didn't even realize that one is live?
279	not sure	Aha. Fauci won't let that happen here :) But seems like it might not need too, we're hogging the vaccines
672	not sure	Yes, because that's how you do science. smh
861	informative	Half are about autism, sone are about brain damage, some are about how vaccine causes the damage.
949	convinced	You literally followed this exact protocol. You asked why don’t we expose our kids to disease anymore to get immunity. Several people responded me being on of them. You went to the top comment and tried arguing that because that vaccine damage compensation is a thing so therefore vaccines must be bad. Another person came in with the metaphor that just because car insurance exists doesn’t mean that cars are made to deliberately crash. You said it was moronic and tried to stop responding I came in and this all happened. Sounds extremely similar to what’s up in that list. Also I didn’t say what you were saying had double meanings I said your actions and arguments are contradictory. You said you’re pro vaxx but you’re arguing and hiding like and antivaxxer who had been beat if we you guys were arguing the same point wouldn’t you just take the info they gave you and leave.
799	not sure	Bro tHis is four months old... And if you read the whole thread I apologized for being so pissy
163	convinced	This might be a stupid question, and forgive me but I would very much like to know. My daughter is 2, up to date on vaccines, no underlying health issues. Is she fully protected from the diseases she is vaccinated for? Do I need to worry about if she is around unvaccinated children? I don’t know all of the vaccine arguments and debates, but I do know I believe in them and they save lives. Any info would be appreciated
171	convinced	Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I don’t know where else to post this. My dad is dying of congestive heart failure. He has temporary home healthcare due to procedures he just had done on his heart, and the latest nurse shared that she believes in the autism-vaccine link as well as “bad chemicals hurting people”, and she agrees with her daughter about delaying vaccines for the grandkids. My dad is also anti-vax. I brought up vaccines hoping that she could talk some sense into my dad about getting a pneumonia vaccine but instead ran into this baffling BS. It’s so frustrating. My dad is already hard headed enough. I’m starting to get frustrated with nurses and PAs stepping on doctors’ orders after talking to my dad for less than 30 minutes and taking a brief history. The last PA he saw also cleared him to stop taking one of his heart failure medications that his cardiologist prescribed. We had to badger him into taking his meds after that. I can only hope his cardiologist talked some sense into him today.
71	not sure	In this instance, yourself. Broader, that Vaxfact site.
297	not sure	Quality shitpost for this fine fine holiday.
850	convinced	Okay. Answering a question with a question. My IQ, though kinda irrelevant, is in the high 130's, possibly a bit higher, possibly a bit lower. I found this sub today, trying to find a non-joke anti-vac community, so I could better understand their line of thinking. I, personally, am pro-vaccine, but I don't think people against vaccines want their children to die, nor do I think that they're all retards. Finally: my question was a joke. If you didn't get it, then sorry, I guess? IDK what to tell you.
189	doubtful	"Can't wait to see your disqualificarion of this truth on all the usual websites. If vaccines are so safe and effective why does the industry need to tell lies? The local news just advertised 1 in 4 measles patients needs to be hospitalized... According to In 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a ""retraction"" which stated: ""We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient."" So just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - ""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue. If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988... ....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine."" Isn't the 2004 ""retraction"" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. The study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long? Some of the claims of fraudulent activities aim at Dr. Wakefield's payment to be a witness or a supposed link to an application for a vaccine patent. Have you seen how much money Dr Offit and Plotkin make from all the vaccines. They have the patent on the R in MMR yet they are often called as witness against Dr Wakefield or give expert witness for a news report. These two are part of the vaccine club, they are luteal millionaires as a result of vaccines and if Dr Wakefield's credibility is questioned over a 55 thousand pound payment and possible vaccine patent how much more should these other two be muted."
639	doubtful	Seriously? Testing a baby for potential problems is a bad thing? Yet they shoot them with 10x the recommended max for heavy metals on the first day of life? Do they assess any contraindications then? How does this all make me a troll? You haven't answered any of my questions satisfactorily. You've just resorted to childish name calling.
112	doubtful	Over 3,000 studies and 0 inert placebo controls. There’s none for the current vaccines we inject into children. Untested.
846	convinced	I applaud you good sir. You made a (who I assume to be an) Anti-Vaxxer rage quit.
255	informative	"""VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem, but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This way, VAERS can provide CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern."" - F. A. Q. answer of What is VAERS? of said website."
287	convinced	Actually if you want to take your argument to its logical conclusion, you cant prove the world exists. Maybe all the antivaxxers are trapped in some kind of Matrix nightmare. Maybe you are the only sentient being in the universe and everything you experience is an illusion. You cant prove it isnt so!
773	not sure	Op just mentions ASD rate offhandedly in the post title. As far as I can tell there's no justification for your reading other than just wanting it to be wrong to begin with. There's several ways it's entirely correct and I don't get the discussion value in assuming the opposite.
772	not sure	I dunno, how would I know? That's something only you can answer.
14	doubtful	"Good thing I didn't say thimerosal is mercury, but there is mercury, in the form of ethylmercury, in thimerosal. Jumping off a 5-story building is ""relatively safe"" compared to Jumping off a 10-story building. Why are you saying ""ethyl""? Would it make you look stupid to say ethylmercury? Yeah probably."
463	convinced	Actually minus the insults, u are dead on here. It's so hard not to insult them tho, I know. It's just DOESNT help our cause. THAT being said I just cant grasp how they can still think that vaccines cause autism. Science is an asshair away from coming our with their finding on how genetics cause autism. Which is what I've been saying for like 10 yrs but thats besides the point rn. If you take a step back and look at the situation as a whole all signs points to genetics. But I think, and I'm just speculating here, that anti vaxxers are petrified that the autism in their child is their failt. And I can almost undestamd why they dont wanna think that. But they are adults who are capable of lying to themselves very easily. And they are als8 very capable of their causing a lit of9 damage to themselves, they they are uneducated and dangerous and that scaryl B
17	doubtful	"Not in my mind, but in the FDA's mind, ""Thimerosal is a mercury-containing organic compound."" But you are correct, chloride isn't one of the fucking ingredients of french fries, unless they're salted, in which case it is, because there is chloride in sodium-chloride. That's why it's called sodium-chloride. Bye now."
85	informative	There are still 100,000 deaths from measles every year world wide and the numbers 1 to 1000 do match up to the global deaths
72	informative	Turns out hg is used to measure the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 1 inch (25.4 mm) in height at the standard acceleration of gravity. I live in south america so I dont know much about these types of measurements, so yeah, if that helps or if you know how to use hg against % of mercury please tell me, then I will be able to transfer it and tell you the comparison between mercury in food and mercury in vaccines.
689	convinced	I’m a very provax nurse. But I don’t understand the reason why you would badger him into accepting a pneumonia vaccine if he is already dying of congestive heart failure. Let him live out his days in peace.
33	convinced	Yes, that can be a few vaccinations. I've been vaccinated a number of times, personally. I travel a lot, so I get vaccinated more then most.
993	not sure	Citation please. Has there never been an adverse reaction of any kind? Why should the brain be my only concern?
