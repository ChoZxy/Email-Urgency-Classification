801	1	Going down to LA for Spring Break?  Hi guys, how do you usually get down to LA (like for spring break)? Roundtrip tickets are almost $300 now... is anyone looking to split costs on gas if you have a car?
792	2	Get good at coding  what would you guys recommend as the best way to get really good at coding? I'm in CS61B right now, and while I'm doing okay, I see a lot of my peers who are far ahead of me in terms of skill and how fast it takes them to finish projects/homework. Since I feel like I have more free time lately, I want to practice more CS, so what do you guys suggest I grind/use to help?

611	1	Looking for a roommate - why is discriminating based on sex OK but discrimination based on race is not? The Double Standard.  I see these roommate ads all the time on this subreddit:  "Looking for room mates (female only). When you call them out and say that it is sexist, they say it is not and give this response: "It's not sexist. Females are cleaner than males and I feel safer living with an unknown female rather than an unknown male." Imagine if you said the same thing but changed "female" to "whites" and "male" to "blacks." "It's not racist. Whites are cleaner than blacks and I feel safer living with an unknown white rather than an unknown black." There would be scores of outrage. But this is a blatant double standard applied to men. Where is the outrage? ​ Edit: I am not saying I am looking for a room mate or a place to stay. I don't care if they are male or female Also how dare some of you assume my gender? I'm greatly offended ​ Edit 2: to the "male" who said they would "punch me in the face", nice job bro. you hear an uncommon opinion and you are going to resort to violence. clearly not perpetuating the stereotype that men are violent at all. Also, how dare you threaten to hit me? What if I was female? Good thing I sexually identify as an attack helicopter. You would punch an attack helicopter? You'd be blasted into smithereens like those Iraqis holding AKs...or where they cameras? ​ Edit 3: JDD you the goat bro, keep being the people's champ. I would reply to your comment but don't wanna mess up my comment karma. Kappa. Attack helicopters ftw. Btw, looking for room mate (attack helicopters only)

I'm worried that I'll end up in a triple room since I have no priority in the room bid process, and I don't know how small/big the triples are (being in cramped spaces make me anxious) Sorry for all the questions, the house tour video I found on the co-op website doesn't really show much.

910	3	panicking  Does anyone who gets accepted into Berkeley got rejected or waitlisted by UCD?  I'm really panicking right now, I just got waitlisted by UCD, and I'm afraid that I screwed my UC application as UCD was one of the low-ranking colleges on my list, and I thought I would get in. btw my GPA is 4.00 UW, five AP 5s, two AP 4s, and taking the most rigorous courses at my school. And I'm an international student
117	2	CMU CS or UC Berkeley EECS?  So I got into both programs, and I'm having a really hard time deciding what to choose. I'm in-state for UC Berkeley, so tuition would be significantly cheaper. But other than this, I love both schools, and I don't know what to choose!
349	2	ETHICAL funding solution to the $5M EECS deficit  Apparently the EECS department has [major money issues for years and nobody bothers to inform new admits](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tkn8cn/the_eecs_department_is_a_fucking_mess/i1s5m6i/) of the ramifications until right before the department is about to collapse (when the info go out via Reddit.com) >But one thing I hate is the lack of communication even internally. EG, the budget problems have been brewing for years, but just a month before the chairs announced to the department just how bad it was there was a vote on hiring a person “using department unrestricted funds”, aka the same pile of money we are worried about. So yeah, its ‘just’ a $150-200k addition to the $4-5M deficit, but its actually more significant in scale than some of the cuts the department is talking about. So it's clear that:  1. EECS ran out of funding  2. EECS cannot control the size of L&S CS admits to fix this problem (proposal was rejected).  The solution the department came up with was to [wipe out ~2 years of progress for some current CS-intended freshmen and sophomores](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tjnxcd/whats_up_with_eecs/), 3 years of progress for transfer students :(. *You dig yourself out of the pit by putting other people in the pit.* There's no need to say how atrociously unethical it is for the #1 CS program to do this when there is a better, more appropriate, solution for the department in this position. The obvious solution is: 1. Keep your promise of the 3.3 GPA cap to all current admitted students. No tricks, no retroactive gate-keeping.  2. Suspend the L&S CS major for all future admits until there's enough funding to resume offering of this major. In the meantime, all future applicants who want to do CS must apply to EECS. This is how you control enrollment numbers until you get more funding. Heck, you can even allow "discoverers" to apply to transfer to EECS like the original proposal. A final note about screwing over current students: It looks like the department plans to announce their policy changes [will take effect in Fall 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tjnxcd/whats_up_with_eecs/i1swzcb/), not Summer. Conveniently, this is after the decision deadline for Fa22 admits. > Summer school is profitable in itself to the department, the only reason to cap it at 200 is to keep people from being able to take the class and therefore be able to declare the major before restrictions go into place in the fall. If the EECS department intends for their changes to affect Fa22 admits, they better notify admits now (admission letters will be out tomorrow), so that people can make an informed decision and not believe in lies before committing. Imagine how unethical it would be for the #1 CS program to let a transfer admit finds out, on their first day at Cal, that they can't declare CS after spending two years on the Major.

150	2	Subleasing for the summer with option to extend to school year  Currently a graduating senior looking to sublease apartment with an option to extend the lease to a yearlong one. Rent is $1200 for one bedroom and my housemate is also moving out so if you need two bedrooms that is possible too. My bedroom is really large as well. It's a two bed one bath and i've been living here with one housemate. Large backyard that can be used for gardening. Bus stop for 36 and 52 a 5-7 minute walk respectively, close to Trader Joes in DT Berkeley.  Looking for someone to take over the sublease around mid to end of May, most likely can extend to year long lease after the sublease. Preference given to whoever can move in around that time range. Pet friendly, large living room. Comes with a friendly cat owned by an upstairs neighbor, comes to hang out sometimes.  Send me a message if interested!

I stayed there from 11 am to 1 pm, Mar 12 Saturday. I have contacted info desk of Doe Library and sent email to UCPD, but it was not turned in in either place. Here's a photo of the model: ​ https://preview.redd.it/433888lebmn81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3706c220fb8662442796f13ebdb71e6776499b8e It was in a black leather case which is about the size of a soap.

Kinda used to having my own kitchen to be honest but Blackwell do be hella swanky. Also don’t really care about the social aspect considering Ive been here for two years already lol.  Too be honest, I’m not too keen on taking up the offer in general but just wanted to make sure that I’m not making too hasty of a decision by rejecting the offer.

740	2	Calculating acceptance rate of transfer  Hey everyone. I’ve applied to Berkeley for the coming fall semester as a transfer student, and as the time to know the answer comes closer I’m getting even more antsy and nervous. I’ve applied to other UC’s, but Berkeley is my top choice and has the best programs for my major I can find (Linguistics) in state.  Is there a way to calculate my acceptance chance as a transfer student? For reference: I’m transferring from a CCC as a junior with 60 credits minimum. I have a 3.75-3.78 GPA. I followed the transfer IGETC track and I have all A’s in my required courses except for one B in my math requirement. I feel I wrote strong essays, but I’m not sure in comparison. I’m wanting to major in Linguistics.
809	3	Will dropping a class late into the semester impact my financial aid?  I am currently stacked with mental problems and school is beating my ass in particular one class that without a doubt I will not pass. I have been putting lots of effort into said class and I am confident that if I dropped it I can focus on my other classes and pass those instead of maybe failing all of them. I have a EFC of 0 so I really can't pay for college would it be possible to drop this class and not have any of my financial aid affected by it(I would go under 12 units). I know with withdrawing after a certain period you don't owe any financial aid back and I am wondering if the same thing applies here. I want to know if anyone has done this and can give me info it would help me immensely, Thank you!
922	2	What is Enclave like and is it worth being in?  I just got a housing offer in Enclave (APT Double-Small 7P). Is this worth accepting? Considering we have to share it with 7 people and its super expensive (16k). What are people's experiences with Enclave? Is it too small/cramped? How overwhelming was having 6 other roommates (for people who had a 7 room apartment). How many bathrooms are in the apartment? Is it possible to accept the housing offer and cancel it later if we find something better?
274	3	Urgent Help: Will I get Rescinded?  Got into Berkeley L&S (history major) yesterday, super excited of course. However, one of my conditions for acceptance was that I need to get at least a C in all of my senior year courses.  I was sadly unable to do that. And in one of my final A-Level exams I got a D (I sat the exam in November so the grade wasn't included in my application, although my predicted grade of "A" was). Now I have never ever done this poorly in an exam, especially not maths.  I am really really worried that my offer will get rescinded, like really worried. I do have a very very solid explanation to why my grade was so poor, and the grade is clearly an anomaly if you look at my academic record (A's in maths throughout school, 780 on SAT Maths). What shall I do? Do I contact admissions and explain the situation? Do I submit the form on my portal regarding the "lower than C" grade? And do you think I will end up getting rescinded? Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation?  Thanks a lot.

86	3	Math 16B: Unsure about whether to PNP vs letter-grade  Title says it all. For context, I'm don't need it to declare/graduate my major but I took it because I had no calc from HS and I though it'd help me w upper level econ courses.  Now, there was a small scandal in my Math 16A class last sem that caused me to panic and PNP the course even though I didn't really need to. I had originally taken the course for a letter grade. Rn I'm getting whooped by Math 16B. But idk if I should PNP my current math class, since then I'd have two PNP calc courses in a row. Deadline is in a couple days so I need to decide quick.  Would it look suspicious or weird on my transcripts? My plan is law or grad school for policy/IR type stuff, so it's not like Haas where the transcripts are incredibly scrutinized. Still, I have some reservations. To make matters worse I'd decided to take 20 units this sem like an idiot. For the last midterm, I was literally so strapped for time and desperate. I don't like being in that place mentally and it's not good for my performance in other classes. I feel like I could scrape by with a B or something but it is a lot of pressure and this class is compromising my ability to do well in Econ 2, another challenging course where I actually do need a good grade to declare my major.

I know there is GMP, but that doesn't have the engineering portion, which I am interested as well, so that's a no-go for me.

I've been accepted to Loyola, UW-Madison, and Reed, but I feel like I want to go to Berkeley. However, I'm nervous about the tuition costs and the housing issues.  Is it easy to get financial aid from Berkeley? The OOS cost is really high, and even though my family is wealthier than average and could probably pay for a majority, I still feel bad for the price tag. Are their ways to get scholarships easily too? Regarding the housing issues, is on-campus housing easy to get now, or is looking for places outside of campus better? I'm not entirely sure how to start looking for affordable housing (aside from scrolling through Google Maps), so do any of you have any tips on how to begin or what places I should look at first? I hope this flair and post fit the subreddit rules. Thanks in advance.

160	2	Recent admit looking for advice on literally everything  Edit: Before you read this LOL just know that I have a ton of interests and not a clue what I want to do for sure, so if it seems like I'm trying to pursue a ton of impossible goals at once, it's because I'm confused and interested in everything. I was recently accepted by Berkeley with a mechE major. Unless I get into Harvard or some shit, which is unlikely, I'll be committing in a week! I'd really appreciate any advice from current students at UCB. * I plan on majoring in business in addition to mechE, since I want to ideally work in investment banking after graduation or at a company with name recognition like Apple * I also want to apply to law school * I'm thinking about rushing a business frat and joining some investment clubs * I have no clue how I got into mechE at UCB since I avoided STEM classes in high school and took 0 STEM related extracurriculars Questions I have: 1. How do I survive the mechE major when I haven't taken a STEM course in a year? 2. What is the girls to guys ratio of mechE classes? 3. What classes or teachers in general do you recommend staying the fuck away from? 4. Which clubs should I join as a mechE major to stand out to companies like Apple and Facebook? 5. What is UCB's social scene like? 6. What law schools does Berkeley funnel to and what should I do to maximize my chances at getting into a top 3 law school? 7. What are the most competitive clubs on campus? 8. What are the most toxic clubs on campus? 9. Should I switch to computer science? If so, how difficult would this be? 10. How can I maximize my chances of getting into Haas when I apply sophomore year? 11. What is the general vibe of UCB? For example, UPenn is known for being a "work hard play hard" school and MIT is known for not really being a party school 12. What do you wish you knew as a freshman? 13. Best dorms at UCB? 14. Any other advice is amazing! I'm really grateful for the opportunity to be a student a Berkeley, and thank you for reading my post if you got this far!

I've kind of been "cheating" these past few nights by taking melatonin to sleep since I don't feel like dealing with having to sleep in this state.

The school-wide commencement is on a Saturday, the one for Rausser is Sunday. During the actual commencement, they don't call out every name, I'm assuming, but will they do that for the college-specific one? Will she walk up to get her diploma? Just want to figure out which one to do go.

355	2	What happens to my housing offer if I decide to take fall semester off for an internship?  I have a housing offer, but have a remote internship offer for Fall. Would I be allowed to still stay in the dorm, or would I just lose the housing offer completely? Would I be allowed to retain my housing offer for Spring?

I want to study astronomy but with a focus on space robotics. My questions: 1. Is there an astronomy major at UCB? 2. Can I do a BS in astrophysics at Berkeley? A web page I found confused me a little because it talked about a BA in astrophysics. 3. Would the minor in electronic intelligent systems (EIS) work for me to study robotics as well? Are there other minors or different opportunities that might work better? Thanks a lot in advance! Berkeley is definitely one of my top choices and I’m looking forward to joining if everything works out.

Thing is I only received my readmission letter last week and am still in my process of completing NIF and later to apply for new F-1 visa (I took a gap year so I have to start a new SEVIS record). I wonder if I'm actually allowed to sign the contract (and also paying the 1/3 of rent for a semester), or I have to wait until my visa to be approved to do so? EAP students/international students who are living in coop or other housing, please help if you know anything! Did you guys wait until your visa is approved to sign a contract?

I was wondering what Berkeley students think or know about how Berkeley plans to solve these issues.

Is it a bad idea to late drop the course to retake in the summer? I didn't have prior programming experience but did slightly above average on both midterms. I'm not a great test taker but I feel that if I retake 61A with the knowledge I have now I could probably do better.
406	2	wait what's gonna happen now  I've spent almost a whole year doing cs and data science classes because I liked 61A last semester and I'm absolutely loving 61B now, I'm even an AI for 61A and was hoping to join course staff sometime in the future too. The clubs I'm part of have to do with CS and I have a CS internship lined up for the fall, I'm basically fully invested in the CS major at this point.  I was also planning on doing some courses for the CS major over the summer too (not CS 70 tho), should I not anymore? The only class I have left to declare is CS 70, and I was planning on doing this in the fall. I remember the UC Berkeley application only let me apply for one major and there were no second options. I'd put down MCB because I really wasn't sure at the time and all my HS activities had to do with comp bio and only UCSD had a bioinformatics major. If I won't be able to register for CS 70 anymore, am I supposed to just go back on everything? Start over as an mcb major/transfer? this is in reference to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tivxvq/cs70\_summer\_waitlist\_help/i1hebgb/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tivxvq/cs70_summer_waitlist_help/i1hebgb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

351	3	The EECS Department Is A Fucking Mess  There was no reddit boom about "waitlist reordering" or "graduation crisis" in Spring 2022. I thought it was all going better and now the other shoe finally dropped. You thought denying declared CS students the right to take more upper div CS classes than strictly needed for graduation was a fucked up proposal? Guess what? Current students are being turned away by the CS70 gate-keeper based on what major they picked in their high school application. Like with waitlist reordering, this is a fucked up way of pitting current students against the university out of sheer desperate lack of funding. No, it's not punishing students who "gamed the system" in high school. **LnS freshman admission rate never depended on your major in the first place.** You're punishing the desperate high school kids who blindly follow advice on College Confidential, not knowing better.  Maybe for transfer admission that would make sense, but already CS has 2/3 as many transfer as the school as a whole. Not very diverse there. So, you needed a convenient way to justify gatekeeping a bunch of already admitted students out of the major, this is what the #1 CS program come up with.
395	2	EECS funding  I'm wondering if the enrollment limit will only apply to cs 70 and not the 61 series and eecs 16a and eecs 16b for at least fall 2022? I am trying to change major to eecs from coe major and is almost sure that cs70 is not needed.

116	2	Everyone has been asking for limiting cs enrollment and when the school actually decide to do something, everyone is angry that they are being affected🤣🤣  C'mon\~ Everyone's just asking for the next incoming class to bear the burden lol. Saying that they didn't know when they applied (that they might not be able to game the system. That the door might close in front of them not behind. 🤣) You just want to be the last one to go through the backdoor, right? Sorry, you are the first one to be blocked, mate. Also, we just don't have the budget and we need to do it NOW. We can't wait for next cycle. We should have done it already and we didn't and we need to do something at least to stop this madness. So, sorry but current students and the incoming freshman should be affected.  Plus the current plan is not to block you from majoring cs. It's just that there are too many people trying to do what you are trying to do and there just isn't much seats for certain classes and thus the school has to prioritize some people because they specifically came to Berkeley to do cs and they stated it (honestly) on their applications. There still are other routes to declare cs. Like doubling math and using math 55 etc. As long as school doesn't block this route, you can't blame them for stopping you from majoring cs. It's just that cs70 might be hard to get in. It doesn't mean the school has lied to you. It's just that there aren't much seat!! There still are other ways to declare and it's just that you are too lazy to double math and cs 🤣  🤣  🤣
485	2	Thoughts on this CS schedule?  Planning on CS 161 (Assuming they find a replacement for weaver...), CS 168, CS 164 From what I can see, 161 is generally considered a 'lighter' load relative to other upper divs. Not sure about 168 because it hasn't been offered in a while, but the HKN guide says it's 'lower' workload too i think. Doable to balance recruiting with this schedule?

329	3	Is the emergency fund application a grant?  Hello my emergency fund application was processed recently and I was surprised with how generous they were. Long story short I had a very significant hospital bill that I attached as proof to the application and financial aid was gracious enough to cover it all(an amount over 10k), which I would have never imagined. Now I am nervous if this money counted as a loan that I need to pay back due to how big it is, or is this a grant where nothing is expected to be returned. In the original emergency application I did not see anything noting that it was a grant. I will appreciate it if anyone has insight for this, as the email DID reference that it existed due to HERRF being gone. I am NOT talking about the emergency loan app but the  email we got around late January. naming as a fund is a bit ambiguous

663	4	Just another Berkeley rant   Granted I have not put in much effort, I’m so burnt out and I feel like I just can’t keep up. I know my poor performance is a result of my mental health but it’s not like I can do anything about it. I feel so incompetent and tired all the time I just want to lay down and never wake up. Although I have people around me I’ve been hesitant to bring these issues up because I know I’m the problem. I know my hesitations are also due to the fact that my relationships at Berkeley (platonic and romantic) arent quite as healthy and supportive as they should be, ie toxic positivity. It’s just hard to be vulnerable with people here without being looked down upon or perceived as crazy/lazy. All I wanna do is get hit by a bus so I have a valid excuse to give up. I’m really sad and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I feel like I’m dying inside

71	3	staying safe at berkeley  so basically, i’m an admitted student who fortunately lives in an area where the biggest crime is $2 shoplifting, and i never really had to learn any basic safety measures. my parents don’t really have up to date info on these kinds of things so i was wondering if anyone could just give me some basic guidelines of don’t-be-stupid-and-do-this?  i definitely could not defend myself in a fight so i assume i shouldn’t walk alone in creepy alleys as a woman at night but what else? thanks! edit: thank you everyone for the advice!!
297	1	Berkeley Restaurant Week Meetup?  In case you haven't heard, it's now Berkeley Restaurant Week! [https://www.visitberkeley.com/food-drinks/restaurant-week/](https://www.visitberkeley.com/food-drinks/restaurant-week/) As such, many restaurants have special Prix Fixe menus to try!  I was wondering if there are any people who would be interested in going to some of these restaurants together. I was particularly interested in Donato & Co., Gather, and The Berkeley Boathouse, but I'm pretty open to suggestions!

112	2	I suspect that Berkeley’s yield rate will lower. Do you agree?  See title. Reasons: 1. The whole lawsuit from the residents of Berkeley 2. CS department is underfunded 3. Pandemic might mean that folks from the Bay really want to get out of the Bay Area for college Further detail on 1: Uhhh the whole fiasco where the residents of Berkeley sued UC Berk and so Berk had to reduce their enrollment but then Governor Newsom overruled it and Berk resumed normal increases to enrollment. edit: I was hoping this would be true because I’m on the waitlist and want to get in …. but yeah it looks like it’s not too far off from normal years
846	2	Taking Summer Classes  I'm looking for housing this summer as i intend to take summer classes but do some places offer housing only for the summer? Is it advisable to do that or should I look for a spot that covers summer and the remaining school year? Thanks.
255	2	What is the Fall Program for Freshman?  Hi all! I just received my acceptance to Cal this afternoon, and I’m really excited for this opportunity, however, I wasn’t accepted into my top choice major (Philosophy) and instead got into the Fall Program for Freshmen.  Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what exactly is the FPF/ what is it for? I understand the basics of you spending your first semester attending classes off campus with a smaller group of students - but why? Is it kind of Berkeley’s way of admitting “less qualified” students, and sort of catching them up to speed?  Thank you!
287	2	Is the Berkeley L&S CS department really underfunded?  Hello all, I have heard that the CS in the college of letters and sciences is underfunded and understaffed. I am unsure if this is true. I am a current high school senior who is waiting for my admissions decision. I am unsure if I want to go to Berkeley if L&S CS becomes more difficult to declare. But I might do data science instead since it's a bit easier and is more aligned with my interests anyway. I'm also planning to double major in economics. Please let me know. Thank you. Edit: unrelated stuff- but I've been accepted to EE at UCSB and have been waitlisted at UCSD, and if I get in, I will study Math + CS there since it's easier and in the math department. Please PM me if you are knowledgeable about the three schools that I have listed. EDIT 2: I got waitlisted at Berkeley. To be honest, I think data science is better for my interests and abilities. Also, please PM me about how hard it is to get in off the waitlist and if you know anything about data science. Thank you all for the responses, I really appreciate the information.

14	2	For Current Students: What is something you heard about Berkeley that turned out to be completely true and/or false? (In your experience)  A bunch of kids have just been admitted (congrats btw!!!) and I’m sure they’ve heard a bunch of stuff about Berkeley, true or false. I’m hoping this thread helps them determine what to take into account when deciding where to go to school.  This is what I heard when I graduated high school in 2018: (sorry, I’m Berkeley Haas c/o ‘22)  True: 1. Going to Berkeley will be the best decision you’ve ever made 2. Sports are not a major focus of the school and there isn’t a ton of “school spirit” around sports 3. The school is highly competitive  False: 1. As a result of that competitiveness, other students will frequently try to cheat and snake you. 2. There’s never time to have any fun I love Berkeley (and was deciding between here and Ohio State), and would honestly recommend any admitted student come here. You will not regret it.
463	1	Why does Berkeley have such a thrash student gym?  Lots of other cal states and UCs have better student gyms.
17	1	Moving company that stores overnight/1-2 day storage  My lease dates for my old/new housing doesn't overlap so I'm going to have to store some stuff overnight or for 1-2 days. Looking for a local moving company that offer short-term storage and can help move, anybody got any recommendations? If it helps, I'm moving within Berkeley and it's like a quick 7 min drive at most between the two places.
85	2	Taking CE 122, CE 126, CE 166, CE 167 in Fall 2022  Is there any senior civil engineering student guide me? I want to ask is it doable taking all these classes next semester, CE 122 (steel design) CE 126 (Dynamics), CE 166 (construction management), CE 167 (Project management)? How much workload gonna be? Also, do I need CE 93 for CE 166 and CE 167?  P.S: I am pursuing both construction and structural engineering. Taking part in both Cal Construction  (Hopefully gonna be team lead next fall) and Steel Bridge.  P.S.S: It's not mandatory for me taking all four upper div tech because I can graduate in Fall 2023. I am yet to take 132, two applications and CE 93. Edit: There's another possibility, I can take 155 (App) instead of 122 (Des) and can take Design course in Spring instead of Application.
72	2	UCB (L&S) or UCI (BioE)?  I have recently been accepted into UCB’s college of L&S (I’m planning on studying CS but am also keeping Data Science in mind) as well as UCI’s engineering school. I’m stuck on which school to pick. I know some people would roll their eyes and pick UCB, but I’m also taking into consideration the campus environment, faculty, resources, job prospects after graduation, career outcomes, etc.
689	1	it's all coming together
33	1	Future Boar  Hello everyone, I have been accepted into the UC California University of Berkeley. Since I’m sure you all are dying to know, I am planning on majoring in EECS, math, physics, and business. While this may be difficult, I got A’s in high school so I am very smart. Since I will have much free time, which clubs or frats should I join. I’m thinking of trying out Berkeley Consulting or Blockchain at Berkeley, but I’ll probably just join a bunch.
