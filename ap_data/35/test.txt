564	2	stressed senior in desperate need of advice!  hello! I was just wondering if a current Cal student could give me some advice/hope for Berkeley admissions:   I have a 4.0 capped GPA, 4.1-4.2 UC GPA, and excellent EC's. I've published abstracts, some of which have gotten accepted into big medical conferences and have presented my research as posters. I've interned with a doctor as her MA for a whole summer and even translated and published a book in Spanish \[my 3rd language\] available for purchase. I'm ASB President, President of 3 other clubs, Dual Enrollment at CC, Leader of our Ambassador Program, Chief Editor of Yearbook, Award from my county's medical association, Volleyball Captain, Varsity Athlete all four years, Club Volleyball for 2 years, Dance for 11 years.  I got rejected from UCI, UCLA, and UCSD today + UCD and SDSU. do I have a chance at berkeley???? ​ go bears!

185	4	Admitted, failed to meet conditions of admission  Hi, so yesterday I was admitted to Berkeley’s Rausser College of Natural Resources in the major of Molecular Environmental Biology. I was so happy when I saw the acceptance, Berkeley has been my dream basically my whole life and I’ve worked so hard to get in.  However, I haven’t met one of the conditions of admission. Please don’t judge me too hard for this as I swear I really have been trying my best, but last semester I got a 3.75W/2.75UW, which is below their 3.0 UW requirement. This semester I am set to make a 4.0W/3.0UW GPA, but there’s nothing I can do to change last semester. It’s not like I just got that GPA because I was lazy. I took 8 APs, and the workload was insane. My mental health has also been an issue for me, and I actually wrote one of my essays about my struggle with depression (and kind of about the stigma around men’s mental health issues) and obviously that essay resonated with them because I got in, you know? But yeah, I have been working on recovery, I’m in therapy, and I am doing better than I was last semester. I’m going to fill out the admissions update form today or this weekend and defend myself. I’ll be sure to explain that I have been doing better, and I would really regret losing this opportunity, and if I went to Berkeley I’d work hard to do well. I’m getting letters of support from my therapist and my AP biology teacher. My therapist can explain how she’s seen me working through my OCD and depression, and how I have been improving. My AP bio teacher can explain how she’s seen that improvement transfer over to my academics, how I’ve been doing better in school, making more of an effort, etc.  I really hope this is enough. I’m on track to meet the conditions this semester. I hope that I didn’t lose my chance. Does anyone have any advice? Please don’t be too brutal. I’m really scared right now. Please give advice or encouragement if you have any, and please share if something similar happened to you. Thanks guys  -Hopefully still a UC Berkeley future freshman

181	2	deciding between UCLA and UCB  hi guys, I understand that this chat would have some bias but I would really appreciate some advice based on my situation.  so I got admitted into the college of Letters and Science for both colleges but im considering maybe switching to bioengineering or like biotechnology smth related to that.  1. How easy is to switch majors?  2. Can I double major or minor easily?  3. For biology technology, does UCB provide opportunities and majors like bioinformatics etc 4. How is it applying for the bio+business program? thank you so much in advance :)
650	2	Math Prerequisites  I failed my math1A class last semester and my intended major is microbial biology. I was wondering if I could take math n1A over the summer to fulfill this prerequisite. I saw on Berkeley’s website that a deficient grade in math 1A could be removed by taking math n1A.
235	2	How long do I have to pay for courses when enrolling?  Hi everyone, I heard that when enrolling in courses I have about one week to pay for them? Is this true?

Thank you in advance!
28	2	Friend admitted to UC Berkeley and wants to change intended major within L&S  Hi everyone! My friend and I recently got admitted into Berkeley. She initially applied as a Dance major but recent events have convinced her to change career paths and major in English instead. Both majors are under the College of Letters & Sciences. Is it okay for her to deviate from the major she put on her application? Who would she need to contact to figure out course selection for this? Thanks!

Needless to say, I have been failing the class and I don’t see it possible for me to be able to pass. I want to drop the class and retake it next year in first semester but if I do this, I’d be below the minimum 13 units. Is this an issue and is there some way I can work with it? Thank you!

57	2	Please Help Berkeley Admit#149529232202  This year, I was lucky enough to be accepted at Berkeley for Econ! I'm super super super (super!) excited! However, I have a few questions. 1. Do I need to do anything for housing? My friend told me that he had to fill out the housing form for UT Austin right when he submitted his application as it wouldn't be guaranteed for him otherwise. Is there something similar here at UC Berkeley? Would committing asap guarantee me better housing? 2. How bad is the housing situation and how much worse will it get? If my facts are right, Berkeley admitted 5k more students this year than last year. Although I'm grateful (as one of those kids may have been me!), I'm kind of scared abt the housing situation. I've heard pretty negative things about it and it seems that it will only get worse. Is this true? 3. Similar to above, how will the number of additional students impact me getting into courses that I want to take, especially the popular ones? I've heard that it's already pretty hard (and stories about people making bots to sign up on time for them), especially for the CS courses. How hard will it be for me? 4. I came in intending to do a double major in Econ + CS L&S (yes, i'm a sellout). What's the situation with the CS department? I heard some stuff last year about CS-eligible (where they tell you if you can transfer into CS or not). Is that true? If I don't get CS, would majoring in math give me a lot of the same interviews/positions as if I had a CS degree? How hard would a double major be with Econ? 5. It seems that there aren't any tours available until June. How should I explore the campus otherwise? 6. In the application, I said that I'd take Differential Equations and Linear Algebra at my local CC over the winter and spring quarters respectively, if space permitted. Well, I took Diffeq and one other course during the winter quarter, but I wasn't able to enroll in Linear Algebra. How should I report this? Will there be consequences? Thank you in advance!

132	2	On Campus Housing Rounds  Hello! I was supposed to apply for on campus housing a month ago prior to the February deadline but at the time I made a mistake of not making my options open and strictly wanted off campus housing but my prospective roommate decided to seek out other options. So me being stressed decided to apply on campus housing a week ago. Can someone give me an estimate of when I receive a housing offer? Thanks!
828	3	EECS 16B Rant  Why did we have one of the longest homeworks the week when almost everyone had other midterms to study for? Then, the week right before the 16B midterm, we have to do the lab, a midterm lab report, and again another pretty long and confusing homework. I feel like so many of the questions on the Piazza HW threads are also never answered. On top of all that, we still have homework next week, even though there’s a midterm. why is this class so stressful
524	2	Why is the Berkeley community outraged at the cutting of admissions while simultaneously outraged at the ongoing housing crisis?  Pretty much what the title says. I'm genuinely confused at why the Berkeley community has expressed such passionate disagreement with the supreme court decision to cap admissions while also agreeing that the city lacks the infrastructure to house the current population of the student body. We don't have the resources to account for the intake and externalities of thousands of students our city and school can't adequately provide for, right? So what's the problem with the decision to cap the increase of admissions when the consequences of an overstressed population density have clearly been shown? No one is entitled to a UC Berkeley education. I'd be disappointed and stressed if I was applying to UC Berkeley as a high school senior, but why should this demographic's desires be prioritized when they aren't even an official part of the university or city's community to begin with? Is there something I'm missing? I'm not trying to start a debate or provoke outrage, and there's a chance I'm genuinely misinformed about the situation. My current understanding is that the supreme court has no reason to shit on UC Berkeley out of spite, so their ruling has to be somewhat derived from evidence and data. UC Berkeley's administration is pissed because they're losing millions of potential income, but is this not a consequence of failing to provide the resources to begin with?

802	1	Anyone down to hangout anytime this week and/or any nice restaurant recommendations around campus?  Hey everyone! I'm a USC undergrad, I'm staying right beside UC Berkeley from this Tuesday to Sunday. Since I'm staying so close to campus I was wondering if anyone would be down to grab some lunch or coffee on or off campus, or I'm planning on exploring San Francisco and the Bay Area at scale these next few days if anyone's down to tag along. But I understand it's midterm week for you all and if I'm choosing a horrible time to ask for people to hangout with and no one's down as a result. At the very least, if there's some nice restaurants to dine in the Berkeley area that y'all recommend, or cool places to visit at Berkeley since I've actually never been on campus before, that would be of immense insight to me during my time here. Thanks and have a great rest of your night!

623	4	Attempted bicycle theft at Dwinelle around 2pm?  I heard what sounded like an alarm going off in the direction of the bike racks. Initially I thought fire alarm but it wasn’t as loud so I was wondering if some bike locks have built-in alarms? There was a guy fiddling with what I first thought was a key on a U-lock (maybe could’ve been a lock pick or similar tool in actuality). He seemed a bit frantic when looking around the people going to and from Dwinelle so I’m thinking he might’ve been trying to steal a bike. It didn’t register at the time since in my mind there was still a doubt that he could just be stressed from midterms and rushing to class. But I thought now that it was strange to be fiddling with your lock if you’re just trying to lock up your bike. He ended up walking away from the bike rack towards the Dwinelle entrance, though without any backpack. Thought it was suspicious after the fact and didn’t get a picture of the guy at the moment. Since someone else recently posted about a possible attempted watch theft, I thought I might as well make a post. The guy was maybe around 5’6”-5’8”, late twenties to mid thirties, roundish plastic glasses, pink hoodie with a green shirt jacket over it, hair sort of like Napoleon Dynamite but maybe a little longer.

361	2	Complete guide to joining course staff:  Hi everyone! I’m a current uGSI, on my 6th-course staff position. I've worked with a few different departments and on 4 different classes. I'm graduating this may and realized I'm going to miss course staff :((. I thought I'd post a guide to getting course staff positions, with the hope of demystifying the process a little bit! Please note that this is my personal advice, and ugsi experiences vary. Hope this is helpful: **Course staff positions available:** **Lab assistant:** Help out in lab sections, typically unpaid, \~3 hrs/week. **Tutor:** Lead small group tutoring sessions and/or do grading & host office hours. Paid hourly. **uGSIs**: Lead a section/lab/workshop, host office hours and grade. Sometimes have piazza responsibilities. Montly salary. Typically 8-hour positions, some 20-hour. **Lead uGSI:** uGSI responsibilities + manage logistics. This includes managing course staff, handling scheduling, test logistics, and helping the professor with whatever is needed. Typically 20-hour positions. **Readers:** Only grade. Sometimes host office hours. Paid hourly. ​ **Departments that hire uGSIs:** Computer Science and Data Science hire the most- mostly all 8-hour positions, some 20-hour, on ugsi-only course staffs. Both have structured & large course staff ladders (see below for typical tracks). Economics hires as well (only 20-hour roles alongside PhD students- need to be an SLC tutor or a previous ugsi in another department to qualify). Astronomy and math also hire occasionally- less clear processes. Statistics used to hire a lot but hires less lately. You usually need an A minus (preferably an A) in the class to teach, and overall decent grades. Usually the track is: tutor -> uGSI OR lab assistant -> tutor-> ugSI. Leads have typically taught 3+ semesters. ​ **Pros of being a uGSI at Cal (note the following is my own individual experience. uGSI experiences vary).** **Responsibility-** uGSIs in Berkeley get an invaluable experience of really teaching and leading their own section and are given a tremendous amount of trust and responsibility. In many colleges, uGSIs just grade or pass out papers, etc. But I’ve had the chance to build actual teaching curriculum, teach my own section the way I'd like, and as a lead, play a major role in shaping the direction of the course. I feel like I actually had an impact on my students and the course as a whole. **Faculty access**\- it’s a great way to get to know faculty and have access to them as a mentor. **Learning**\- being a uGSI forces you to become much better at the material. You also learn communication skills, emotional intelligence, and how to become a better listener. It is so wonderfully rewarding- I love working with students and helping them gain confidence & love for the material. **Pay-** It pays far better than a typical work-study job (\~$28/hr or so?), you paid fully for the beginning/end months of the semester, and you get some tuition reimbursement (\~30% for 8-hr, almost full for 20-hr). **Cons of position (again only my own experiences):** **Workload**\- it’s a lot of work- to do it well. Teaching, grading, meetings and office hours will take you to 8-hrs alone. But then add prep, emails, helping students out, etc.I feel like I’ve always had to choose between just doing the work I’m paid or doing unpaid hours to do the best for my students. It’s really easy to spend way too long and overwork yourself because you want to do your best for the students. **Learning curve**\- it’s hard to teach. The resources are limited. One pedagogy course alone won’t teach you everything you need to know. The responsibilities aren’t that different from those of teachers at small liberal arts colleges. And you quickly learn two things: (1) you can get an A/A+ in a class and still not truly understand half the material; (2) just knowing the material really well still doesn’t mean you can teach. **Discrimination/elitism & other interpersonal challenges:** there’s a lot of racism/sexism/elitism in both the course staffs and the general student body as a whole. So women/poc/first-gen TAs have to deal with that on top of everything else. I have dealt with aggressive students, microaggressions/discrimination, and even flat-out sexism/ sexual harassment from both students and fellow uGSIs, and I  know many other underrepresented staff who have as well. **Tips on recruiting for course staff positions:** 1. Engage deeply in the class. Notice I said “engage”- not just get a good grade. Ask/answer a lot on piazza. Get to know your GSIs and your professor. Go to office hours. Actually learn the material- not just what you need to get the A, but understand it at a deep level, understand the big picture...understand it well enough to teach it. And yes, try to get an A as well. 2. Get a summer role- they are usually easier to get and can help you “climb” up the course staff ladder faster. 3. Be flexible on which course you teach, especially initially. It can be easier to get into a course staff in a smaller/less popular class, become a uGSI and then jump to another uGSI position. It’s a lot easier to get a uGSI position anywhere once you make uGSI in some (any) class. You can even switch departments/teach a completely unrelated course, and will still get priority because of your uGSI experience.    1. Obviously, choose a class you would like to teach. But it’ll be harder if you only want cs 61a or bust. 4. Choose a good supervisor- an invaluable part of this experience is getting to know faculty. Remember this is your boss- and being a good supervisor is a distinctly different skill from being a good lecturer/teacher, even if they overlap. (happy to answer DMs on suggestions of great supervisors :) )    1. This applies 10000x for a lead TA. You work with the professor very closely in that role. And a lead TA can range from helping the professor with logistics to basically running the entire class for them in their name. Once you are in a course staff, to “go up the ladder”: 1. Do your work- don’t be the reader who never turns in things on time. Go to meetings (on time), meet deadlines, get the basics down. Sounds obvious? You’d be surprised how many people can’t do that. 2. Engage with the teaching community- ask questions, give feedback about how students are feeling, offer suggestions to improve student success in meetings. Built a relationship with the professor & other TAs. Even if you are not a uGSI, you can still give your feedback & suggestions on how best to support students.    1. Obviously, don’t kiss up- but take advantage of being part of this community. Be genuine about your passion for teaching and ask for help/advice & give feedback- and your passion will come through when hiring decisions are made.    2. And also when recruiting time comes, directly express how interested you are in a specific ugsi position if you know the professor. A final bit of advice: Before you apply, please reflect on why you would like to be a teacher. This job is hard and you are given significant responsibility. It’s important that you take the role seriously and treat students with respect and kindness. You can learn to be a better teacher but you cannot “teach” empathy & kindness. That has to come from you and it’s absolutely essential. Remember, you might be the worlds next Turing award winner, but if you don’t have compassion for students and passion to help them succeed, nothing else matters. I love being a uGSI. It’s genuinely my favorite part of Cal and it’s the thing I will miss the most. It's also the hardest thing I've done at Cal. My students taught me so much and most are a joy to work with. I highly recommend that everyone apply and try out teaching at some point :) . If you are an underrepresented student, especially, please apply! We need more ugsis from all backgrounds that reflect the diversity of experience and backgrounds of our students! I hope this helps anyone interested in teaching at Cal. Please DM me if you have any questions :) .
591	2	CS 61A summer vs school year  currently trying to decide what summer classes I should take and I'm thinking of taking 61a just to get it out of the way since it's just a major pre-req and i'm not a cs or super stem-y person. not sure if taking it over the summer is a good idea tho? on one hand—I feel like taking it during the summer would allow me to dedicate more time to the class since my other course load won't be too heavy and I don't have much else going on during the summer.  on the other—I'm worried it'll be harder over the summer since it's shorter than a semester so the class will be more fast-paced. also I feel like there are more tutoring/academic guidance resources during the school year than there are during the summer (if anyone knows more abt this pls lmk!) and I'm definitely going to need all the help I can get. and I'm also not sure how I feel about having to stay in Berkeley over the summer since the class is in person.  if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, please let me know and thanks!

237	2	UCLA CS + UC Berkeley CS  Hey guys! I was recently admitted into UCLA for computer science and linguistics and UC Berkeley for Letters and sciences. I just learned about the situation with LAS CS and I ended up putting data science as intended which may end up hurting me. While I really value academics and job opportunities, I also hope to enjoy a nice social life so I made a list of pros and cons. UCB Pros (undeclared CS in letters and sciences): \- #1 Program in America and Best academic wise \- Close friends from high school attending, so easy access to good roommate and friend circle UCB Cons: \- too close to home in bay area (i wanna have some independence and distance from fam) \- biggest con = stressful/toxic environment from what I've heard (looking forward to a fun college experience and don't always wanna be studying) \- high gpa cut off to declare CS (3.3 GPA) creates added stress and uncertainty of actually getting CS; might not even be possible after this situation UCLA (CS+Linguistics at LAS) UCLA Pros: \- Awesome social life and activities to do around \- Guaranteed my major- Favorable distance from home \- Strong program \- Good dining + well rounded school UCLA Cons: \- definitely not as good as a program of UC Berkeley academic wise \- BIGGEST CON = Only admitted for CS+Ling major, but I am not that interested in the linguistics part; may result in some difficulties when trying to get jobs

Since Santa Monica is the top feeder to Berkeley. As I have very limited knowledge on how to be an outstanding transfer applicant, I would be very grateful if someone can help me out in this one. I want to major in CS in L&S. How can I improve my chances? Thank you!
789	3	PSA: Don't use Bank of the West  I'm sure many of you have seen all of the Bank of the West sponsorship banners around school. After seeing these I decided to open an account with Bank of the West because if their banners are all around school, they must be legit? Basically, it's impossible to do anything with Bank of the West without waiting an inordinate amount of time for someone to respond. I've probably been on hold with them for 6+ hours total over the last 3 months, 3 of those just being waiting to close my account. Sending messages to them over email, they take upwards of 3 weeks to respond, and every time let you know that "they're experiencing higher than anticipated call volume".  In just trying to close my account, I've been accidentally charged multiple fees that have been mistakes on their part too. If that's not enough reasons to not use Bank of the West, consider how their ownership changes so frequently, isn't that at least a little bit suspicious? Go with a credit union

174	2	how hostile is the environment at uc berkeley?  hi, i recently got into ucla and berkeley, but now i’m really stressed about making a decision between the two.  i have heard/read a lot about the stressful and ultra-competitive nature of berkeley, and it definitely scares me as i want to try to go into business.  is this speculation true and is it worth going to a different school over? edit: school name changed for the person who will hit me. i didn’t know that was wrong my bad
662	2	Anybody know when community colleges release their summer schedules?  I'm wondering around when I should expect to see Summer course catalogs for California community colleges. Obviously every college is different but like a general estimate for those who've signed up before.
403	2	I have some questions about UCB.  I applied to UCB as a transfer student for the political science major and I have some questions: 1. How hard is the major? Is the course-load so much that it’s hard to have a social life with a part time internship at UCB? I’ve heard rumors of a stress culture there. My mom and I visited UCB in the fall of 2017 and she thought the students looked stressed and miserable. 2. Will the school provide me with good internship opportunities? 3. Should I be concerned about how unsafe Berkeley is? 4. Should I be concerned that UCB won’t have enough housing? I’ve heard people saying that some students might have to sleep in their cars if there’s not enough housing? 5. Are the student clubs and organizations active on campus?  6. Is there a good social scene?
592	2	Does anyone know how to get in contact with the billing department?  I tried the number on the notice they sent me. I tried reaching out through cal central/financial aid, and the financial aid officer I got opened a case for me, but I haven’t heard anything back in days. She said she doesn’t know when they’re open or how to get in touch with them directly. Anybody have any insight?

629	2	Any grad students in the Demography program who will let me pick their brains?  hi there, I’ve set up some time to speak with an advisor for the demography program and learn more about it, but if anyone has insights or is willing to talk to me about this program so I can see if it’s a right fit for me, that’d be awesome.  some background about me, I studied public health at a local liberal arts college, graduated a couple years ago, have about 4-5ish years working in nonprofit fundraising and higher education. The program interests me because it seems to focus on the things I was most passionate about while I was in undergrad, and applies to what I want in my career for the future.  thanks in advance!
868	3	Aggressive professors?  Hi bears,  I’d like to ask everyone what their opinion/experience is when it comes to harsh behavior from professors.  I’m dealing with one who is known for being cold and impersonal, which is fine, but where it’s starting to cross the line for me is that he is known for making cutting, sarcastic remarks about people’s work in front of the whole class. It can be amusing at times and doesn’t always come off incredibly belittling and alienating, but other times, his level of disdain just feels aggressive and inappropriate.  Unfortunately, our field is not one that can be judged objectively, so we’re somewhat at his mercy in terms of how our performance is perceived. It’s at the point where I’ve become afraid to face him because of the mean things he might say and the ways in which I’m afraid he’ll misunderstand where I’m coming from and snap at me more or make more snide comments. I’m having trouble working on our latest assignment because I’m so afraid of how mean he might be. To be clear, I don’t mind receiving critical feedback (his judgement is usually very good), but his delivery is just feeling inappropriate to me for a learning environment. Maybe I’m out of touch with how much we’re just supposed to accept rude, sarcastic remarks as students. I’m sorry to not be more specific, but hopefully I can ask about this in a vague way and still solicit some helpful feedback. Thanks in advance for any help you all can offer.

44	3	Does anyone know any dentists that offer affordable services around Berkeley or anywhere in the Bay Area?  Hello! I went to the dentist a couple of days ago, and I apparently need root canal surgery (lmao wtf that was unexpected). I'm not on SHIP and it's not covered by my parent's health insurance. The surgery is usually 700 (the cheapest I can find so far and it's not even in berk) - 1600 in the Bay Area, and I am a broke college student. If any of you have good dentist places, please let me know! At this point, I should probably just pull out the teeth myself instead of paying 1600 just to get a single tooth fixed. FML. Time to sell a kidney :)
480	1	Possible Unpopular Opinion: Build on Clark Kerr  The actual space of Clark Kerr is huge and can respectively fit like 6 unit 2s comfortably. (possibly even more). Building in this area would be easier because the land is huge/underdeveloped.  The pros are many. Building resident halls close to each other helps build community, while dealing w less complaints from NIMBYs. In addition, the university has the possibility of keeping the athletic vibes by adding sports related facilities like basketball courts, etc. Berkeley has an opportunity to make a high density resident village that I cant imagine them logically not doing.

Other ideas?

167	2	I want to go to a top10 med school  I was admitted to Berkeley as in-state, but I’m considering whether I should go to private schools instead of berkeley. Major concerns is berkeley’s grade deflation and having to compete for resources, whereas for private schools resources are generally there. Does berkeley send a lot of ppl to top10 medical schools? premeds at berkeley, what do you think is a better option?

110	2	Entering eecs with no prior coding experience  Hello I've been admitted to eecs with my only related experience being an introductory course in web development (css HTML5 javascript). What are some languages i should start preparing for over the summer? I'm really nervous about the rigor of classes and fear that I won't be successful.
520	3	adhd diagnosis in berkeley  I have recently noticed that I had so much trouble staying focused and this has been going on for quite a while. I’ve been reading about adhd and I’m suspecting I might have it. Those that have been diagnosed around here, how does the whole process work? How long does it take?
679	1	Any interest in a commuter club/group?  Like, a group for those of us who commute in from other cities across the Bay where we could talk logistics, plan carpools, take trips, or get food together? Seems like this should exist, given how big of a commuter population we have here.
449	2	If you were place on academic probation in the fall, can you take classes in the summer to boost your GPA and possibly clear probation.  My midterm 2 score for CS61A just came out, and now I’m very worried I won’t make the cumulative GPA requirement for clearing probation this semester because my dumbass decided to take Math 1B this semester instead of retaking Math 1A. I’m doing fine in math 1B, but I should have retaken math 1A just to clear the D+ I got last semester. It would have made clearing probation a lot easier. Assuming so don’t make the cumulative GPA requirement for this semester, am I allowed to take math 1A in the summer to replace the D I got in the fall, or am I just automatically dismissed. Do I need to write a letter to continue probation and just hope for the best?
88	1	EECS 16B ruined my gpa last sem
383	2	Why should the department grandfather the current students?  They are not blocking cs declaration. They are just prioritizing those who indicated they are going to major cs in their applications. Door is open to anyone who take cs61a,b, and 70 and get average gpa higher than 3.3. Berkeley never said it will accommodate everyone L&S students to every cs classes or cs classes required to declare the major. Berkeley just said that you are free to declare any major as long as you meet the requirement. Berkeley is not the one to blame. Department is not the one to blame. Is there any moral or legal responsibility for the department to accommodate all L&S students? NO. So why do they have to grandfather the current L&S students? They are not blocking anyone. It is just that the seats are limited and they have to prioritize those who indicated that they will major cs. Actually, it will be more problematic if the department does not prioritize those who explicitly stated that they will major cs. Then, the school is at fault but they are doing their best to prevent those situations and I think the school and the department are very responsible in handling the current situation. Besides summer classes are open to all those "discoverers" or "gaming the system-ers" or whatever to take cs70 so the door is still open. Berkeley never lied. It's unfortunate that so many students cannot major cs but this is the best the school could do

561	2	So.. about that 61a midterm…  I’m not the only person who thought the midterm was long as fuck right? Like they jammed two practice midterms together and gave us 2 hours to do the whole thing. Zero multiple choice on the code writing questions, data abstraction which shouldn’t have been in scope (or I might have been mistaken), and implementing fucking Hogs all over again. Ngl it was kind of fun using new concepts to recreate Hogs but man was it stressful for being the “last problem”

That, and I'm also a little concerned that I might be charged for "damages", since I saw from a Google review that they charge you for the smallest renovations/damages.

Are they very successful with just that degree or they don’t get much of a career boost with the additional degree or they just become lazy?

866	4	It finally happened—the stress of Berkeley sent me to the hospital!  Had a mini-stroke from stress, had to be hospitalized, am out now but very fragile and very stoned on all the meds they gave me.  But because it’s Berkeley and nothing ever stops around here, my ass is right back to campus the next day, loaded up on so many drugs that I don’t remember my own name because I have too many commitments to have cancelled at the last minute.  Send me some luck so I get through today. I feel more lost than if I were actually drunk off my ass. 🙃 This school is literally going to kill me. Edit to add: academics are not what I’m struggling with. I’ve had several incidents on campus and around it (been robbed, assaulted, etc.) that have made the campus itself feel very unsafe.

310	2	Wouldn't have chosen to go to Berkeley if I knew there wasn't space for me🙄  When I applied for berkeley like almost every other stressed senior I indicated that I would do data science on my app because frankly I thought I was playing it "smart" esp because I was told over and over again that the major you put on your high school app has "no impact." I know that the funding crisis is definitely a very real thing that has to be addressed but I feel like this backdoor approach should only be implemented to those who are fully aware of the ramifications of putting another major on the college application because Berkeley wouldn't be making false promises and admitting people that they don't have the capacity for. Honestly for one of the top universities in the nation, I can't believe they don't think to resize and support these impact majors as demand grows.... ​ EDIT: to the people saying that I took a back door approach in, how is it a backdoor approach if ls says that the major you put down has no bearing whatsoever?? I could understand how it could be seen as back door if there was a direct admit to cs and I used another major to get into the university and then tried to get into the cs program, but that's not the case.
194	2	Hey guys! Just got into Berkeley! Film major questions  So I head the UC Berkeley film classes are pretty good but they're like more theoretical than practical. Was wondering if anyone had advice for some pointers to clubs or other classes that could give me some practical experience with making films. I also heard there are a lot of film festivals and contests, how do you join them? How do you win? Also Also, I'm specifically super into animation, and it would be great if there was like an animation club or some sort of class that focused in that if anyone knows. Obviously I'll research all of this stuff outside of reddit but any pointers are appreciated. Super grateful I got into Berkeley, very excited to be with yall next fall!
686	3	What do you think about these quotes from Berkeley professor Grace Lavery?  >"There's something about being treated like shit by men that feels like affirmation itself, like a cry of delight from the deepest cavern of my breast... To be the victim of honest, undisguised sexism possesses and exhilating vitality." -Grace Lavery >"A woman is a person who is, or has been, presumed to adopt a passive role in sexual intercourse and a reproductive role in economic life." -Grace Lavery These are real quotes from Berkeley Professor Grace Lavery. I find these quotes to be very troubling and very sexist, yet when I brought this up I was accused of transphobia. I am not transphobic but I honestly don’t see how anyone could read these quotes and have 0 issue with what she’s saying. Can someone explain to me so I can convince myself these quotes aren’t sexist? I don’t understand how saying this things are okay nor do I accept that these definitions are what “women are”. Throwaway because sensitive topic.
849	2	Off campus housing for summer  **Looking for summer housing** I am looking for a studio apartment or 1 single bedroom with walkable distance to campua. I will be staying from mid May to mid August.  Feel free to contact me if you have an offer, thanks.
519	2	What do you think is the cause of the Berkeley grade deflation (especially math subjects)?  Are the exam questions too hard? Do the classes cover wider range of topics compared to other schools? Or are problems similar to other schools with grade inflation but do professors grade it more harshly?(like taking a lot of points off for minor mistakes)
952	3	My biggest regret is attending UCLA  Growing up in the US, a daughter to the typical immigrant parents, my elderly father who works long 12-hour days at a factory warehouse packing boxes, I’ve always had the pressure on me to be the one to step in, and bring the change for us. My mother who’s condition medically has left her unable to work, just further puts the burden on me. I have to commute 2 hours and 30 minutes everyday (one-way) to come to school. I can’t dorm because I’m left to take care of my little siblings and night and my mother. The public transport system itself is terrible, feeling unsafe, weird looks from the homeless it’s just a horrible experience. When I first got in, I was very excited, but now I realize how sharp this double-edged sword is. I’m stuck here for another 2 years at-least. I often feel stuck and tired. Really really tired. Of everything.

340	1	Seeking a male-identifying roommate for next year  I’m a current sophomore in CS seeking a male-identifying roommate for the upcoming schoolyear. It’s a 2-person apartment on College & Durant (less than a block from campus!), and we have an in-apartment kitchen and bathroom. The lease itself is for 10 months (August 2022-May 2023), as opposed to the 12-month leases you need to sign at a lot of other places. Vegetarians preferred! Please PM me if you're interested!
760	1	A potentially hot take: Snackpass is overrated  I do have to admit, it is super convenient and fast to be able to order your food ahead of time, but I think there’s other aspects of the app that make it not worth it. These may not be things that directly affect the users of Snackpass as much as the restaurants, but potentially things to consider before using Snackpass. My thought process is, if there’s a third-party company (that has VC funding and has to pay its employees) in-between me and the restaurant I’m ordering food from, someone has to be paying a price for the convenience of it and the infrastructure of the app, from what I’ve found, It’s the restaurants that end up paying that price.  ​ 1. Snackpass tips go to Snackpass, not the restaurants. On top of that, they collect a small fee for each transaction. In some occasions, I’ve even noticed that some food is cheaper if you order any way other than Snackpass. If you don’t believe me, the Snackpass website says that it allows them to “Upsell every customer and increasing your average ticket price”. 2. Perhaps this is a personal bias, but the ordering kiosks and tablet inside restaurants make the restaurants seem lifeless and dystopian. Even the Snackpass website says “With Kiosks…Save thousands of dollars every month on labor costs”. By using Snackpass, we’re essentially deciding that it’s okay for restaurants to replace people with kiosks, or replace cashiers because we order on our phones, even if it does save money.  3. Snackpass feeds into the increasing homogeneity of restaurants and businesses in the US. People are comfortable with things that remain the same, such as how every American rest stop has the same type of fast-food places, but from what I’ve seen Berkeley is one of the more diverse places in terms of food. Each restaurant has a unique atmosphere and smell and as the process of getting food through Snackpass is sped up and compressed, each restaurant becomes merely a distinct place where you grab your plastic bag with the Snackpass logo sticker from. It is quick and convenient, but is it worth it?

9	2	Berkeley vs. University of Nevada, Las Vegas  This will seem like a dumb question, but i'll elaborate further below.  ​ I've been accepted to Berkeley and, of course, accepted to UNLV. I'm a resident in Las Vegas, and I'm worried that I'll be limited to opportunities in a big school like Berkeley. Classes are harder and there are more students on campus, but my goal is ultimately to get into as many internship opportunities and gain a solid connection to professors as much as possible. I'm pursuing a degree in Neuroscience, and I hope to be able to get into tech internships while also focusing on college; but I also think UNLV will be the place where it's easier to do that typa stuff as the classes are less competitive and professors are easier to reach out to (along with being able to still stay with my family at a full-ride).  ​ What do you guys think? I'm sorry if this sounds stupid, but I'm first-gen and I don't know anyone that has accessed Berkeley before.

I didn’t get regents, but are there any other merit scholarships I could apply for? Or could I reach out to the financial aid office to see if I can be considered for any? Basically is there any chance I could get even a penny from Cal because i really wanna go here 💀
325	2	Possible Loophole around CS 70 Enrollment Block  I've been thinking about ways to circumvent CS enrollment without finishing the math major and I think the following plan might work: 1. Take Math 1A/1B/53/54 and CS 61A/B (or equivalents) 2. Take Discrete Math at a community college. This should transfer as Math 55 credit. 3. Declare the Math Major. Since you took Discrete Math at a community college, it should transfer as Math 55 and allow you to declare. 4. Declare a CS Double. Now that you are Math major (which means you've taken 55), you can declare CS. 5. Take CS 70. You're a CS Major now, so nothing blocks you from taking CS 70. Since you took Discrete Math at community college and not at Berkeley, I believe you can replace the credit and receive credit for CS 70? This might be wrong, correct me if I don't understand how community college credit works. 6. Drop the Math Major. But now you have 61A/B/70, so you have all the prereqs to declare CS on its own. Assuming this works, this means you can take the CS major and only really need to take 2 extra classes (Math 53 and discrete math at CC); correct me if I'm wrong. But this definitely feels like an imperfect workaround.    EDIT: Yes, I know you don't get credit for taking CS 70 after taking Math 55 at Berkeley, but I believe my proposal works because you take 55 at CC instead of at Berkeley. I'm not entirely sure this works, but I used CC discrete math to declare the math major (from high school concurrent enrollment) then took CS 70 at Berkeley later for credit, so it might be possible for this scheme to work.

29	2	Switching into CS with current issues (CO2026)  Hey all! I'm a newly admitted student to Cal. I originally applied as an Industrial Engineering major, but I've recently been advised against it and took a class on computer science which has opened CS up as a possibility for me. From my understanding, crazy amounts of incoming freshmen are in the same predicament, and the school may just disallow switching into CS in that manner. I'm wondering if I should give up on Berkeley given that fact or if it would be possible for me / if they'll ever state whether or not we can or cannot switch majors to CS. I'd personally prefer LSCS over EECS, but I do have adequate STEM background and would be happy to switch to that instead. I did read from other threads to take classes such as CS61A over the summer, which I'd be more than willing to do if that would make a difference. Thank you all for your help!
499	3	Lukewarm take: Fuck NIMBY's, but Cal should still lower their enrollment  More housing is always good. If Berkeley wants to pay for it, and the accompanying infrastructure, they should go for it. But fuck increasing enrollment. If anything, the past decade has shown us that even though the university has made more money from tuition, the quality of education has not changed. Until the school can staff more people and provide resources so kids dont need to sit in overflowing lecture halls with underpaid and overburdened GSI's/TA's, raising enrollment does not help the students. Also the fact that we can't even guarantee freshman housing, when plenty of other schools guarantee 2-4 years of housing, is pathetic. If we do get more housing, it should go towards making sure a bigger percentage of the student body is housed affordability. Not so we can just stretch housing thin again and overcrowd the school. Sure, you can argue that as a public institution, Berkeley is obligated provide the increasing amount of applicants and students around the country opportunity. But the fact is, a decent amount of Berkeley students do not thrive at Berkeley and should not be here. Rather than admitting more people, the school should have a more stringent and wholistic admissions process, and provide a better education for those who get in. There are plenty of other accessible UCs and state schools, people aren't entitled to an intrinsically gatekeeping process, especially when the quality of education would decrease as a result. Lastly, and this comes from a more elitist and personal perspective, but the reputation of institutions of higher education is partially based on how exclusive they are. More people = diluting the quality of graduates = lowering the perceived value of a Berkeley degree. You can really see this in fields like CS or business/econ where we pump out thousands of mediocre graduates. If we were to increase enrollment, it's better spent on more high quality grad students and research grant money.

214	1	Berkeley is freaking AMAZING!  Berkeley is great! Don’t let the posts about the issues about CS/EECS department have weight on your choice about coming to Berkeley. The learning and physical atmosphere at Berkeley is amazing. There’s great people and places in the area. The professors, in any field, here are world-class. Majority have an open door policy — speaking and getting to know such accomplished people is inspiring, and extremely helpful in your career as well. For example, some math professors would regularly invite/have students to luncheons. Professor Ribet (highly-respected professor in mathematics) is notorious for this. For example, if you’re thinking about Physics, there’s a freaking national lab in Berkeley’s backyard! (I’m pretty sure undergrads get positions there; while hard it’s not impossible to get in) Chemistry department is freaking WORLD CLASS. Even for the social sciences and the arts, the people I know in majoring in those areas speak highly of their field here at Berkeley. Choose a random major at Berkeley is it highly likely, almost a guarantee, it is top 5 in the WORLD. Yes, it is driven by the professors & grad studies, but undergrads do get research opportunities in their labs and are still able to talk with them. Just being in the room with the people is a boon to anyone. Who do you think gives the recommendations for grad school, med school, law school? Even for industry, professors here are highly connected. For example, Janet Yellen, current US Sec of Treasury, her ex-colleagues? Berkeley professors. I’m not familiar with every field; thus, I would appreciate if people in all majors chime in and tell prospective applicants about their major here. This sub get flooded with CS issues that it feels like Berkeley is all CS and trash otherwise. Not true at all! This post and comments here helps get an idea as well — /r/berkeley/comments/tia4w4/uc_ranking_by_major/ edit: I posted this on a new account because I forgot login to this one, and auto mod deleted but I remembered the password so posting on this.

261	3	Did anyone manage to appeal the conditions of admission?  For context: I'm an international student that applied to UC Berkeley. These are my conditions for admissions:    * I understand that I must complete all senior-year courses listed on my application with a minimum unweighted 3.0 GPA for each term, and earn no grade lower than a C for any individual courses. * I will graduate from high school/secondary school. * I will submit all required official documents in a timely manner for admissions verification (review documentation requirements below). * I will notify Undergraduate Admissions via the Undergraduate Admission Update form available on MAP@Berkeley if:    * I do not meet the 3.0 GPA condition for any term of my senior year.    * I receive a grade lower than a C in any course    * I have made/will make changes to my senior year class schedule.    * I am having difficulty sending a final transcript from my school I was not able to attain above a C for one of my final grades (I got an E), and now I don't know how to proceed. What are the chances that Berkeley will cancel my admission offer? Has anyone been in the same situation before and managed to get in? Is there anything I can do now to potentially let them overlook this grade (maybe take the SATs)? I would definitely speak to an admissions officer, but the timezones are not working out at the moment so I would like to hear from the people in this sub about your thoughts first. I am truly just a mess right now. I really hope to be able to get into Berkeley and I would literally try my hardest to appeal :")) Thanks in advance for all your advice!
