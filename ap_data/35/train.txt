836	2	housing question!  so I got an access code for a coop but ik that doesn‚Äôt guarantee housing, but if I select something at my time that means I got housing for sure? Bc if I get to select a building, housing contracts don‚Äôt come out until April 6th so I‚Äôm a little worried. I got a RH housing offer and i have to make up my mind by 3/17 but I‚Äôm not sure and I don‚Äôt want to cancel it later bc it can be expensive. Any advice would be appreciated !!
280	2	I'm an incoming grad student and I have questions about housing  Hiii I'm an incoming grad student. I'm just starting to look for housing and new roommates for this Fall. I have a few questions: \- I have heard that it is difficult to find decent housing in Berkeley. In your experience, how hard is it to find a single room that's around $800-1200? \- What are the safe areas/ unsafe areas that I should avoid? Thanks

It's *really* good if you love superpowers, morally grey characters, out-of-the-box thinking, great combat scenes, dark themes, super-intelligent protagonist, and charismatic villains. Contains a lot of trigger warnings. It's very long but definitely a good read. I've read it once but forgot a lot of details. It's free and I'll post the link here in case anyone's interested in checking it out: [https://parahumans.wordpress.com/](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) Please dm me if you are interested! Would love to read together :))

155	2	Would love some advice  I got in Cal (YAYAYA) and I‚Äôm super excited to begin the next chapter.  I‚Äôm an international student and I‚Äôm willing to transfer to Haas in my junior year. I know it‚Äôs TOUGH to get in (I‚Äôm ready for the worse too) but I‚Äôm pretty confident that I will get through.  Just wanted to ask: How should I choose my classes for the first year? There‚Äôs a lot of info on various sites but I still prefer to hear what Bears have to say.  Got straight A‚Äôs in high school (was not very good at math tbh) but I had a thing for entrepreneurship and innovation. To me, extracurriculars and club activities are NOT overwhelming. I enjoy them, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm incomplete without that part. Just concerned about how I should structure my first year.  Would love some tips :))

790	2	Berkeley screwed me on my commencement  I'm graduating Spring 22, and wanted to order some reserved seating tickets to my commencement for my family. I tried ordering them on 3/8. On the ticket ordering site, whenever I tried adding reserved seating tickets to my cart, I'd get charged the general admission price for some reason. I double, triple, and quadruple checked just to make sure I was correctly adding reserved tickets to my cart. This pricing mistake was definitely an issue on their end. I purchased the reserved seating tickets, and what do you know, they sent me general admission tickets instead. I reached out immediately to a contact email linked in their commencement announcements. I get no response, and today I find out reserved seating tickets were sold out on 3/10(2 whole days after I tried ordering mine).  At least I wasn't overcharged or anything but I'm just beyond annoyed at this situation. I work so ridiculously hard for the past few years at this school, and the moment it's time for me and my family to celebrate the culmination of all my hard work, this school shafts me on the commencement. I know it's not the end of the world, but I really wanted that day to be perfect with my family. This experience has seriously soured my feelings on my commencement.  I'm annoyed and needed to get this off my chest. Fix your dumbass ticket ordering site, Berkeley. PS: Ik it's early but anybody looking to sell 3 or 4 reserved seating tickets

839	3	Exposing the CO-OPs/ Casa Zimbabwe  Purpose: Explain the downsides of living in Casa Zimbabwe because when I was researching  "CZ" as potential future "CZar" I only ever saw posts explaining why the co-ops are great and no good information on why they are bad. I hope to help future folks with this post especially as housing arrangements are being made around this time in the school year. This is not to bag on people who live there (super amazing people live there), but instead to raise awareness of what to expect. Definitions: CZ=Casa Zimbabwe, Czar= resident of CZ, fishing= living in CZ unofficially ‚Äã Background: As a transfer student I was looking for affordable housing and a dorm like atmosphere after having missed the dorm experience as a underclassmen. The co-ops seemed like a really nice fit for what I wanted... affordability built around a community. Like most transfers, there is a lot of ambiguity of what to expect going into new housing since we lack opportunities to explore and chat with people already in the co-op ecosystem. After finding a few positive positive posts on reddit, reading through their website, and reading articles such as "demystifying the coops" on the daily californian I proceeded to apply to the co-ops. To most new co-op folks the only housing options are CZ and Cloyne and in my case specifically the only thing left was CZ. Reality of CZ: 1. The demographics are completely bananas. The ages of folks living in CZ was wild with CZars ranging from (<18) to at least 40. I also assumed all or at least the vast majority of people living in CZ would be UC Berkeley students. The reality is that Berkeley students make up maybe half. The other half is composed of Berkeley City College students, students from other colleges, and a few folks just working and not currently in school. There are are also a decent amount of grad school students and international students. As you can imagine, this was a bit problematic especially around the most important time periods such as during finals and midterm season bc we would being having these tests the same time BCC would have spring break or already have their summer started. There were literally giant parties *during* finals week. 2. Too big to fail. The house has roughly 130 folks living there regularly but one thing that was not mentioned when I was planning to live there is the quantity of unofficial people living there, add at least another 20 people. Since part of living in the coops means we share food and share workshift this means the fishing people don't pay anything for food, pay anything for rent, pay anything for drugs/alcohol, or do any workshift. They are supposed to but in practice this is not done at all. The quality of fish is also sometimes really really low. A regular fish was a hardcore drug dealer, another was psychotic and sometimes violent, another was a proven serial thief. 3. Drugs/poor grades. While some view it as a plus and others as a minus the quantity and variety of drugs in CZ incredible. The problem is I witnessed so many people become addicts, overdose, and need to go to rehab throughout the year i was there. I understand a lot of the problems  black people have with the police but as a house, there was  a policy of never calling 911 no matter what even when people would be literally overdosing. Most people who move into CZ have significant drops in their gpa after moving in. 4. Hypocrisy. Every wall and corner of CZ is filled with art/graffiti/tagging which is either very cool or really not depending on the person. Some people relish in the freedom of walking around a house filled with drawings of butts, dicks, vaginas, swastikas, hammers & sickles etc. others aren't too fond of it. I think a telling moment was when a star of david was drawn one time and *that's*  what caused an uproar. I am not jewish btw but this was really strange to me. The co-ops are notoriously a hub for liberals and during the pandemic it was a hoot for me to watch the uproar against frats/sororities partying during covid  in CZ with constant bitching and complaining about it while at the same time there were constant parties and guests at cz too. The culture is super against monetary fining as its a regressive tax system but also fines you for a not attending a weekly workshop about some topic, consent I, consent II, consent III, etiquette, drugs, workshift standards, etc. Almost no fining for not doing your workshift but constant fining for not attending each of maybe 25 workshops throughout the semester.  5. Next point is no accountability. Everyone has 5 hours workshift mandatory. Say its my job to clean the bathrooms for 2.5 hours. There is no one that checks you actually did shit. I could walk in put new TP in there and walk out and say 2.5 hours done. Say my job is to sweep the floors... I just have my buddy sign a sheet saying I did it. While most people do their workshift (or at least an acceptable portion of it) a lot dont too and that makes the ones who do feel angry and cheated (not to mention the fish). Also imagine ur friends with the workshift manager or social manager, or are a manager, you are not going to get fined for not doing your workshift. The workshift is super broken and only works if friends are willing to rat on their friends and fine their friends which no one actually does. 6. This could probably be in the hypocrisy section or drugs section but I guarantee there a more sexual assault, rape problems, fights, overdose, theft, alcohol poisoning, etc.  than any of the frats that get protested. Other: Expect mold in the kitchen, I have never not seen mold in the kitchen. It will always be loud even if you are in your room with headphones. There is no security at all, random people just walk in the house. People's park residents make appearances and we had one instance where they folks that live in peoples park were invited inside just to find out they stole a bunch of crap out of people's rooms. Website says you will be in a single double or triple but its a seniority system so you will be in a triple your first year there. ‚Äã Conclusion: This is a biased and negative post. There are really great aspects and great people. Other co-ops are very different. This just shares the things not mentioned in other posts. Hope this explains why it has a 50% turnover each year and why so many people leave and what to expect on the negative side of things. I will edit if more things come to mind/ respond to comments if needed.
931	1	Favorite Berkeley cafe to study at?  I have exhausted Strada, Milano, and the Musical Offering cafes. I‚Äôm looking for a new place that has tasty coffee and snacks, and also has a good study spot - I need to put some serious studying hours in this weekend. What‚Äôs your favorite?
300	2	Waitlisted. Please advise.  Hello, I have been waitlisted. Please advise. I applied for undeclared math and physical sciences in the College of Letters and Science. According to this link, and on page 7, Berkeley accepts between 20-60% of waitlisted applicants, varying annually. There's a whole section on the waitlist. It was published in March 2022. [https://apply.berkeley.edu/counselor/freshman\_FAQs.pdf](https://apply.berkeley.edu/counselor/freshman_FAQs.pdf) Please explain what the Fall Program for Freshmen is and what the implications of choosing it are. Does it result in greater or lesser chances for acceptance? I'm genuinely so confused. I didn't see this "small liberal arts style" whatever stuff on the application last year. Why is this an option now? I'm perplexed. Help.  If it matters, I plan to study data science and political economy because those are my interests.  I have heard that very few people were accepted off the waitlist last year but I am choosing to believe that last year was extremely random and bizarre for students and that this year will be more normalized.  UC San Diego seems to have waitlisted an extremely high number of applicants, so I am curious to know if Berkeley did that as well.  I am choosing Meta as the flair because I am assuming that is the one for general stuff. I apologize if it is the wrong one and will gladly change it if needed to accommodate others.

There was [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r1nkxu/16000_dollar_medical_bill_for_a_necessary_surgery/) on here not too long ago from someone whose surgery was denied by SHIP's underwriters, Wellfleet Student/Blue Shield.

I also will have to miss a portion of summer school to attend (I have to get a credit of american history to graduate). I would like to go but I am unsure, if its worth it due to the time and cost.

I almost feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. Even after a whole year, I barely know what I want to study, and I feel anxious at the thought of putting myself out there to meet others.

Additionally, what's the likelihood of adding a CS minor (or) DS major? Do IEOR kids have a hard time getting into EECS classes?
556	4	Feeling trapped, helpless and depressed  To preface this off, I‚Äôd like to say please don‚Äôt feel bad for me because I brought this upon myself by being a stupid lazy shitbag. I‚Äôm mainly posting this here to bring myself solace and also so that other students won‚Äôt make the same mistakes I did. However, I would also appreciate advice to help with my predicament. I‚Äôm currently a Freshman in my second semester and I initially planned on majoring in Physics and CS. I was previously interested in Physics and decided to also try majoring in CS to try to appease my parents bc ‚ÄúpHySiCS diDNt pAY wElL‚Äù . Anyways, in addition to a foreign language class, the only classes that I‚Äôm taking this semester are Physics 5B and CS61A for a total of 12 units. Compared to my peers, 12 units was barely anything so I remember going into the semester thinking everything would be a breeze. How wrong I was‚Ä¶ Being the lazy procrastinating shitbag I am, I just couldn‚Äôt find the motivation to do homework or attend lecture/discussions for either of the aforementioned classes, and now I‚Äôd be lucky to pass either. It didn‚Äôt help that I was prescribed this anti-anxiety pill right before the semester started: The pill did help a bit with my anxiety but it made me feel lethargic and apathetic to the point that the sense of urgency from missing assignments just didn‚Äôt register to my tiny brain. Ironically, this was gonna increase my anxiety in the long term. To make matters worse, whatever interest I previously had in Physics just seemingly vanished. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of the difficulty of the class or something else but this is just depressing. I guess I could use both my emergency drops on those classes know but then I‚Äôd have to explain to my parents what happened and they‚Äôd kill me probably. Also, there‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôd never be able to use those drops again. All in all, I‚Äôve been inadvertently digging my grave for the past 2 months and now I‚Äôm screwed Lowkey wish I could just snap my fingers and disappear or something Anyways thanks for putting up with my rant I guess Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that, oddly enough, I think I‚Äôm starting to develop an interest in CS lol especially when we reached that section about Object-Oriented Programming. If I somehow do manage to use both emergency drops, I think I‚Äôll continue to try to major in CS and maybe minor in Physics to see if I can rekindle the lost interest
323	1	Thank you math 55  I wanted to take discrete math as an exploratory course this semester, but math 55 was only offered at 8:00AM, so I decided to take CS70.

Looks like I would not have been able to do so if math 55 was offered any time other than 8:00 AM (I'm not a morning person lol). Thanks guys

Anecdotally, it seems like every high schooler nowadays wants to go into CS. The department is actually screwed at this rate unless they do something for next cycle at least. I don't think it's fair to gate the incoming class, but I definitely think the new CS direct admission proposal for next admissions cycle is seriously needed

95	2	Tip for Incoming CS Freshmen: take MathH54  I took MathH54 last semester and it's one of the only reasons that I'm doing pretty well in 70 right now. The class is super helpful because it's pretty much entirely proof-based (except for the diffEQs portion), so you get to learn all of the basics of how to do a proof properly (i.e. how do you prove iff? what methods can you use to prove things?), common mistakes you run into when writing proofs, and just gives you a lot of practice with them ahead of 70. Since 70 is also very much proof-based, knowing how to write proofs well (and especially how to read proofs) is really helpful for the homeworks and for understanding content from the notes to know why certain things are true. Not only that, but it can also substitute for EECS16A (although you will have to self-study a small amount of circuits to go into EECS16B after (but you learn diffEQs in MathH54 which are a big part of 16b!)), and you get to learn so much about linear algebra, which is a basis for a lot of cool upper divs in math, econ, stats, and even some CS classes. Plus, it's honestly just a really interesting class :))   The one warning I would give is that the class can be really hard, especially if you're taking it because you want to gain some experience with writing proofs. Our class went from ~30 people to ~10 by the end of the semester due to its difficulty. I already had taken linear algebra before coming, and I struggled really hard due to a lack of proof foundations, and because the HW problems are just really difficult. Having said that, I think if you're trying to declare, it's way better to do not-so-good on a class that's not in your declaration GPA than to do badly on one that is. Taking MathH54 means that you can do a lot better on 70 because you already know how to tackle proofs, and the class is a good long-term investment that I'd definitely recommend.
808	3	What is Greek life (sororities) like here?  I've been *really* stressed lately (lol, see post history) and I had a healthcare provider who recently said I should look into doing more social things here to feel connected, blow off steam, loosen up, and have fun. So, ofc I'm trying to join some clubs for outdoor stuff, but I'm also strongly interested in Greek life (sororities) here since I love the idea of being connected to something bigger, forming bonds, and working toward common goals. I also love the social aspect and feel like I could really use something like that to find my bliss here. I'm not super familiar with it, but is fall rush for PHC (I think that's the name for it) open to any female student here?  What is sorority life like here on the Cal campus? I think I'm asking specifically about Panhellenic ones, so is there anyone who is part of one of those orgs who could tell me a little bit about what it's like? Edit: Dang, y‚Äôall really don‚Äôt like Greek life, do you?
82	1	long distance relationship  Can y'all drop your successful and positive experiences doing an LDR for four years at Berkeley? I have the choice to go to UCSD (where my BF of 3 years is going in the fall) or Berkeley. I want to take advantage of my offer at Berkeley, but I'm just really scared and confused about a long distance relationship. Obviously, I'm not going to pick a school just because my boyfriend is going there. I was hoping you guys could drop some of your stories and tip for managing a long distance relationship : ) I truly love this guy, and we got through a whole 6 months of not being able to see each other bc of COVID-19 issues. He's seriously my best friend and my everything. As much as he wants me to be close, he wants more for me to take the environment best for me.

4	2	CS70 Protest  I feel like as students we should organize something to protest the proposed measures. Regardless of whether or not the policy actually goes through, the fact of the matter that a "pulling out the rug" option is even in consideration is unacceptable and causes a lot of undue stress on students, not to mention the CS department's funding crisis, which will likely impact all CS/EECS students moving forward, not just people impacted by this CS70 issue. After all of this, I honestly cannot recommend Berkeley CS to incoming students in good faith - the problems are numerous and glaring and admin's attempts to resolve them have been disappointing. However, we can try to push for change. We need to unite our voices if we want to be heard - we can/should talk to people like Professor Hug, Weaver, etc. in addition to admin and potentially news outlets. If there's already an organized group for this, drop it down in the comments below. Otherwise, message me and I'd be happy to get something started. This can't go on for longer - if there was a good reason to protest, this would be one of them.

889	3	[Not a rant, more of an existential realization] I realized that I was hoarding experiences and activities not items...  I never really hoarded any items and am not scared to throw things. However, I just made a realization that I have been hoarding experiences and opportunities. I am having too much on my plate because I am scared that an opportunity I am going to lose if I drop it. Like hoarding items, I find it extremely difficult to prioritize and parting with my commitments and have this perceived need to continue them. It became a point where it is negatively affecting me but I am blinded by it. I balance all my part time jobs, regardless of whether or not it brings value or not. I say yes to most things (frat parties, kickbacks, socials, meetings, club events) because I'm scared of missing out on something. There's an excessive accumulation on things and experiences that I don't need that ultimately fogs up my core values and forget that I should be living for myself. My google calendar is packed to the brim with study sessions, lunches, classes, and activities throughout the day that I have no space for myself and to breathe. Like hoarding items, whenever there's free space (blank time slots on my google calendar), I feel the need to fill it up because then I am not being productive with my time or living life in college.  I feel like being at Berkeley promotes this toxic "hoarding" culture. People's LinkedIn profiles are stacked. There's a notion that one needs to do more to be successful and be more to feel wanted in the Berkeley community (especially with the toxic club culture and their applications). I just had this existential realization that doing more seems great and all, yet it makes you lose track of yourself and the purpose of being in Berkeley. I came here to row and learn. Yet, I have been experiencing such bad burn out lately that I am just existing, not growing or learning. Anyways, this is just some of my 5 AM thoughts. Today was a punch in the face for me. I realized that maybe I was emotionally burnt out because I kept saying yes to everything that I did not have time for myself. I became indecisive on what extracurriculars I should do and started avoiding certain tasks because I didn't want to face the truth. The truth was that I was overwhelmed by the experiences and activities that I have signed up for.  Just a reminder that your mental health is much more important than another thing to put in your resume. It's more  important than having a 19-20 unit course load. There's people out there in Berkeley who are goated and take 20 units, started a start-up, president of their club, doing research, get good sleep, have a good social life, etc. Yet, I think it's important to remember that everyone has their own pace for things. I want to do what's right for me and what keeps me sane. I want to choose the extracurriculars that help me grow and appreciate the relationships I have. Just some food for thought <3

294	2	Any FPF Direct Admits?  Hi, I just got direct admission from UC Berkeley today to this program called FPF (fall program for freshman)? I'm really not sure what it is, and all the information online seems to be seriously outdated because I was not waitlisted nor am I a spring admit. Does anyone know if these students must go through a different orientation process, live in different dorms, commute to classes out of the main Berkeley campus, have completely different experiences from other students, and will be alienated from regular freshmen? Will we have to learn how to navigate UCB ourselves without the experience that other undeclared students get bc of different classes and schedules? Will people think we're dumb for going through FPF? My apologies if I sound paranoid - the information online is very vague. Thanks so much

I tried emailing them, but they are sending braindead replies. Normally, I could just walk over to Sproul Hall and fight them on this. But they aren't working in person due to the "unprecedented and challenging circumstances" (lmao) of the COVID-19 pandemic. How often is this particular office available virtually? About 1 HOUR per DAY. Yup.  I couldn't make it for today's 1-hour window. No problem, I could just go on Monday. Oh wait, it's spring break next week! So I guess I'll just die. Go bears

909	1	Is an iPad + Apple Pencil worth it?  Hi everyone! I'm looking for some advice -- I see tons of students at school taking notes, doing their homework, making cheat sheets, etc. with their iPads & apple pens. I am thinking of buying one too because I also want to digitally write my stuff, instead of always writing on paper and then scanning/uploading later. For those that use iPads to do their homework and take notes, how do you like it? Is the Apple Pencil really accurate, and are there any features or anything that you don‚Äôt like? Also, does anyone know of any cheaper options for tablets + pens for notetaking? Thank you!! Edit: Thank you all so much for the suggestions!! I am an EECS major, and after reading your responses, I think it really would be helpful to write on a tablet, especially for CS notetaking and doing discussion worksheets. I will look into buying an iPad and Apple Pencil! Thanks!!
895	2	Questions about upperdiv eecs courses from a scared student  Background: only took 61a and 61b (hug), questions were definitely harder than high school in that homework isn't a copy of examples in lecture, but you just had to dissect the problem (especially in projects, knowing wtf it was asking for) and  apply the concepts.   Why specifically are the homework assignments so tough (talking about cs70, 170, and probably upper div ee)? I've heard people spend 8-12 hours on them when they're around 7ish questions, while i've heard upper div math with the same amount of questions taking max 6 hrs. Is this an accurate difference, and if yes why does it exist? Is it not like lowerdiv questions, in the sense that you have to make leaps of insights on your own (basically literally learn things about the concept through these problems)? Is it basically like some olympiad shit where you're not doing homework to reinforce what you learn but to do problems that have immense skill expression? And why do people go to lecture if it's expected to read the reading notes anyway? Haven't dealt with this yet in lower div cs

863	2	Clark Kerr Housing Offer.  I currently live in Unit 3 (triple) and it's not that bad, to say the least. I got a housing offer at Clark Kerr, but I don't really know what to make of it because I've never been to Clark Kerr. I once again got a standard triple, but some say that triples are bigger at CK than in the Units. Is that just a myth? The 20min+ walk doesn't bother me that much, but how safe is it to walk from campus to CK at like 9 pm.  I usually like to stay at the libraries until 9 pm and when I walk back to Unit 3 I feel relatively safe. I've honestly been considering requesting a transfer of location. Do the pros of living in CK outweigh the cons?
955	2	I Miss This Place and Encourage You All To Make the Best of It  I know, I know. This reddit is for memes only. But these past years seem to have been shitty for all, especially for what I've read about college students forced to go virtual, and I saw that in-person classes are starting again, so just wanted to share random thoughts from a geezer approaching middle age who somehow misses being at UCLA: ¬† -Study hard and do well in school, but try to find a balance. I'm trying my best not to sound like an arrogant dick, but I was a South Campus major and I ended with some high ~3.9 GPA and I can safely say IT WASN'T WORTH WHAT I GAVE UP. Don't get me wrong, yes, you need to study so that you can find a job [to perform services in exchange for currency](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3454#comic). But my obsession with "doing well in school" resulted in some really random regrets that I STILL THINK ABOUT ~20 years later: there was a cute girl in my Chem 30AL class that INITIATED CONVERSATION WITH ME and I still regret not following through on that. All I'm saying is, BALANCE. You know what, I was one of those assholes that looked down on people with "useless" majors, and now that I'm in the age range where people are established in their careers, married with kids, etc. I can safely say that IT DOESN'T MATTER as long as you pay a REASONABLE amount of effort. Yes, your life will probably be shit if you play Fortnite all day (or whatever you youngins play nowadays) and fail out of UCLA. No, your life is not ruined if you decide to major in English, but you're not pre-law (one of my best and more effective work friends was an English major). No, your life is not ruined if you're premed but you have a 3.0 GPA (but I'm also going to be realistic: if this is the case, this MAY be a sign you would truly struggle in med school, so you need to re-evaluate something, either your academic approach or your goals). I've seen PLENTY of smart people who graduated UNSURE about their career path or in NON OPTIMAL situations about what they wanted to do and pivoted their way into successful careers. You will find your path. Just WORK HARD AND PLAY HARD. ¬† -Some of you are already in unfortunate circumstances. Maybe you're an intentional student and have to deal with your exorbitant fees. Maybe your family isn't well off so you have to work and deal with work-study etc. Maybe you're an actual, primary caretaker for your family. Maybe you're having a hard time adjusting to the difficulty of college. I'm sorry. BUT, MAKE SURE YOU AT LEAST ASK PEOPLE ABOUT RESOURCES THAT EXIST. I used to be a tutor for a program that has been sunset at UCLA (lol - cut to save costs I think), and in retrospect, I realize that UCLA does a shitty job of advertising this stuff. Your website is already miles ahead of the website that I had to deal with, but I'd vaguely start here: https://www.studentaffairs.ucla.edu/student-services For me, I only used the Career Resources, and my impression from my time at UCLA is that some of these places are truly underutilized. You're already paying ridiculous fees, so go ahead and USE IT. ¬† -If you're so lucky that you have an adequate amount of free time to spend for yourself, try and revel in the "good stuff." Probably like the rest of you, I was introduced to Diddy Riese early on and thought it was just propaganda/an exaggeration that they sell the best ice cream sandwiches ever. But you know what, I don't live near LA anymore, and they absolutely are the fucking best (and I heard that the prices increased which sucks, but I feel like I'd pay 10 bucks each for those delicious, crack sandwiches). I am not at all interested in sports (I'm still not) and it may sound strange, but I regret not getting swept up in the hype of UCLA Basketball/Football, etc. COVID sucks dick, but I hope they reopen Spring Sing, probably my favorite yearly event. But even if they don't, find something. ¬† -The people: I don't know if this is the same as for North Campus majors, for but South Campus, I realized that I ended up meeting the same people in my classes over and over again. If you're on reddit, you're probably like me, and NOT a natural social butterfly. That's OK. If you're also like me, you'll naturally make friends with some of these people just by shared commiseration about how shitty Chem 30BL/CL is (I was not at all surprised that when I heard a student was [stabbed](https://dailybruin.com/2009/10/08/student-stabbed-chemistry-lab), sure enough, it was from that class). But don't take these people for granted -- some of these people will help you in unexpected ways and have really interesting backstories, if you only take the time to ask them. I seriously regret not having deeper relationships with some of these people. ¬† -Seriously, look into those damn opportunities: in retrospect, my favorite classes at UCLA were stuff that is completely unrelated to my major (History of Opera and Chinese language class). I would have also looked into study abroad if I felt then how I felt now (I have a newly formed interest in Korean culture). ¬† Anyways, this post is already super long, so thanks for making it through this far lol. I want to say something corny as shit in closing: I also thought it was propaganda/stupid life advice when people would say things like "college is the best time of your life." I still don't know if that's a true statement, but I DO KNOW that it is certainly one of the most UNIQUE opportunities that you won't be able to replicate, even if you go to grad school/go for a professional degree/go for a doctorate. I can only imagine how much COVID has jacked up your plans, whether you are a returning student, a newly enrolled student, or a newly graduated/soon to graduate student. So instead of giving you that advice I'll give you this: DO THE BEST WORK TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU ARE ABLE AND NEED TO (only you know how MUCH you need to do and whether you're truly doing your best or not), KEEP AN OPEN MIND, AND GRAB AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU CAN, NO MATTER WHAT THOSE WOULD BE. ¬† Thanks for listening to this geezer. Peace.
295	2	Another reason why EE16B must go  It‚Äôs ironic that people who follow the age-old pre-COVID advice of ‚Äúdeclare CS ASAP first to get enrollment priority, only take EE16B after you declare but before you graduate‚Äù are now full CS majors, regardless of what they put in their L&S application. Meanwhile freshmen/sophomores who were threaten to take EE16A/B ASAP or else you can‚Äôt graduate might never get to declare CS to start with.  So all the crap they endured went to waste because CS70 is now gated the very semester they need to take it. Never before does one semester makes such a difference to your education. Thanks EE16B, not only did you take away one semester of enrollment priority, you also took away the last semester where declaring CS is ever possible to some students.

378	3	What's Up with EECS?  Important Note:  This is based on my observations at Minion Level.  Theoretically the chairs and deans could do something.  The EECS department is shattering under load due to having gone from 400 graduates a year a decade ago to 1400 graduates/year now. 15% of the University is graduating in either EECS or L&S CS, a load that is breaking the department through a combination of both budgetary pressure and the grind of so many students. The TL:DR is that the University formula for how teaching funds are distributed (the ‚ÄúTAS budget‚Äù) is broken.  The department gets roughly $200 for a student in a typical 4-unit class, but costs roughly $375 to hire all the TAs necessary, with the remaining $175 coming out of other departmental money.  This departmental funding comes from ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù programs (M.Eng, extension, and summer) and a portion from the University that is basically a function of the size of the faculty in the department, which clearly hasn‚Äôt scaled with demand. So the EECS department is running a deficit of a few million dollars a year and the only ways to fix it are for either the University to actually fund undergraduate teaching or for EECS to drastically cut enrollment by over 50%!  And it isn‚Äôt a lot of money.  Perhaps $4-5M a year. But the budget is almost an excuse.  The teaching load is ridiculous and things are failing.  If we lose one or two critical must-teach-every-semester upper division classes (e.g. 161, 186, 188, 189) we lose the undergraduate talent pipeline necessary to support 1000+ students a year in that class.  Even someone like me, who likes teaching, has grown exhausted from teaching just the same two classes on a continuous basis. The department has to take drastic action.  Last year there was a rejected attempt to reduce L&S by turning it into an EECS-style freshman admission.  Since that failed there is a pending vote to cut the size of the major through the back-door.  By restricting CS70 to just those who were admitted as EECS or CS through L&S, this would cut in half the number of students who declare CS or EECS. There is an asterisk in the proposal for existing L&S and non-EECS Engineering students but that is ‚Äúbudget permitting‚Äù and, as clearly visible, the budget doesn‚Äôt actually permit this.  And if the department was serious about allowing existing students they wouldn‚Äôt have capped CS70 this summer at just 200 students, since summer classes (due to their profitable nature) normally scale to support however many students wish to take a class. What does this mean?  First, nothing is official yet.  The vote result is unannounced, and even then there could be a miracle and Berkeley actually decides to fund EECS to a level necessary to meet demand.  But color me unhopeful. So assuming it passes, what does it mean? If you are considering Berkeley for CS starting Fall 2022 but didn‚Äôt select ‚ÄúCS‚Äù or ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù on the application form you will need to go someplace else.  I doubt any policy will protect you, and the department‚Äôs failure to communicate this already infuriates me. If you were admitted as EECS or selected ‚ÄúCS‚Äù for a Letters and Science admission you should be OK.  Well, in the same sinking boat as everyone else if the department fails in maintaining the upper division. If you are L&S but didn‚Äôt check ‚ÄúCS‚Äù, or a non-EECS Engineering student, it may be impossible to get into CS if you can‚Äôt get into CS70 this summer.  The only thing that can save you is if somehow the University is willing to provide enough money to actually teach the demand. If the department had the funding it could possibly develop the will to continue to teach at our scale.  But since I doubt the money would ever come, there is no sense trying to cultivate the will.

358	2	So the department knows that the L&S will not approve the new proposal  Fyi, cs department proposed to L&S to change the cs admission to something like UW/UIUC, that is direct admit only. But as you, and I, and the department, and everyone knows, this won't pass. Just get the additional tuition fee per each CS majors. That's the easiest way to solve this problem. As for the economically disadvantaged instate students, department should just waive the additional fee. Btw there are numerous backdoors to this way(reducing cs70 class size) of limiting L&S cs as well. If money is the problem, only money can solve it. PERIOD \-> Based on some posts, it's not much. It says each cs majors owe $2,000 to the cs department until they graduate. So why don't just add additional fee of $1,000 per year for cs majors? It will solve the issue quite easily.

For context: on the final, I need a 62/75 for an A- or a 45ish/75 for a B+
585	2	Yo where do I get a "green book"?  I have a midterm for a class tomorrow and the GSI just sent an announcement that I need to bring a "green book" to the exam tomorrow. Apparently its the same thing as the blue book but green. Anyhow, where the hell would I get a green book? Do they sell them at the Cal student store?
34	3	Am I the only one freaking out about the Math 1B midterm on Tuesday?  The second half of the practice midterms are ridiculously hard for me. I have never been so scared in my life. I'm freaking the fuck out.
634	1	BEWARE - scammer  My boyfriend got scammed today Southside by an Italian guy who claimed to work in high fashion.  He was looking for directions to the airport to fly back to Italy after being here for two weeks for a couple of events. He said he needed $3200 in cash to pay off his rental car because he just hosted a big event with his credit card and the credit card company was waiting 24 hrs before letting him make another charge with it.  He said he would pay him back tomorrow by sending money to his bank account through Zelle.  He also offered my boyfriend ‚Äúcollateral‚Äù in the form of a watch and 5 leather jackets that he took a lighter to to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that it was genuine leather. He said the jackets were unreleased and each was worth about $3500 and he could take them to Nordstrom to exchange them for cash.  Ultimately, the jackets were a completely unknown and most likely fake brand and watch is most likely fake as well. Just wanted to share this to warn people so hopefully no one else gets scammed! EDIT: stop telling me how dumb he is, i could tell him that myself but i don‚Äôt see a point in kicking someone who‚Äôs down already. and it‚Äôs not why i posted this üôÑ EDIT: wow did not realize how toxic the berkeley community is. literally just wanted to psa no matter how stupid it might sound in case it could save even just one person from being scammed and the comments are just filled with people kicking someone who‚Äôs already down and downvoting my comments where i‚Äôm literally just explaining what happened??

331	3	Petition: Remove the EE 16B Requirement for L&S CS Majors  [https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley](https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley) There has been so much negativity surrounding EE16B for a while now, and in light of the EECS funding crisis, I think it‚Äôs a good time for us to finally bring this course to attention and petition for the removal of this absurd requirement for CS majors. To start off, the EE16B course is widely known to be very poorly organized and taught, and a majority of the course content have absolutely no relevancy for most CS majors. Students from every single semester have complained endlessly about how much valuable time they wasted from their lives learning materials they won‚Äôt ever use again in their careers, as well as the detrimental effects it has had on their mental and physical health. Seriously, it is quite outrageous that a requirement like this still exists in our department. In addition, EE16B is apparently a well-funded class that takes away a large amount of resources and budget from the department, causing many of the upper division CS courses to be stripped of funding and seats. This means that not everyone can successfully enroll into the upper division courses that they wanted to take, and those who do enroll into these courses won‚Äôt receive nearly as much resources as they need. Many of the courses they used to offer in the past are gone because of this, and the most important courses (CS170, CS189, CS186, CS162, CS161) are becoming increasingly difficult to enroll into due to reduced seats. More recently, there has also been issues surrounding the restricted enrollment for CS70 as part of the department‚Äôs solution to cut costs. This is simply ridiculous, and the root of all these problems is funding, so why can‚Äôt we just remove the pointless EE16B requirement to free up much needed funding? Despite taking away an enormous amount of funding from the department, the EE16B course itself still struggles to expand its seats to accommodate for all students who need this requirement to graduate, which is quite a joke. Every semester, the department warns students to enroll into EE16B as early as they can since there won‚Äôt be any guarantees that juniors and seniors would be able to make it into the class. There have been instances every year where  2nd semester CS seniors cannot enroll into EE16B, and thus have trouble graduating on time, jeopardizing the full-time job offers that they have already accepted. If enrollment is still such a huge problem for EE16B, then why can‚Äôt the department just remove this graduation requirement altogether for CS majors to free up seats and funding? They really are contradicting themselves whenever they mention that funding is an issue while still requiring everyone to take this useless course in order to graduate. This issue is even more bizarre when you realize that CS majors admitted to Cal before fall 2017 don‚Äôt even need to take EE16B in order to graduate. Instead, they have the option to take EE16A + Math 54 to fulfill the requirement, as opposed to EE16A/Math 54 + EE16B. This further reveals the lack of necessity to enforce EE16B as a graduation requirement for all CS majors. As a preliminary proposal to remove the EE16B requirement, we can have the following choices for CS majors: \- Take an upper division technical elective instead of EE16B \- Recall the option of taking EE16A + Math 54 to fulfill the requirement \- Take Math 110 instead of EE16B \- Literally any 4-unit course in the school instead of EE16B Of course, these options don‚Äôt have to be mutually exclusive, and they each offer much more value to CS majors while saving valuable time in comparison to the EE16B requirement. Feel free to add any ideas to the above as well. Please sign the petition here [https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley](https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley). If the department doesn‚Äôt respond effectively to our petition, we will be hosting organized protests on campus to ensure that our voices are heard. Whatever it takes, let‚Äôs remove the EE16B requirement.
473	2	Apply to PhD.  I am admitted to the MEng program in Berkeley and some other MS programs, but there is part of me that still want to pursue a phd degree after. I wonder would the master degree put me on disadvantage during application. Since MEng is a not a thesis program, would it be better to choose a thesis based MS program?If choose the MEng program and start doing research with Professor, would it be the same?

56	2	Advice about financial aid for OOS?  Hi! This is my very first Reddit post so I'm really sorry if I'm doing something wrong. I was accepted to Berkeley recently, but I have no financial aid (which I'm pretty sure is normal for OOS). If I contact the financial aid office, is there any hope of cutting that down? And down by quite a lot of money? Like, uh, half? My family is middle class but on the lower side. I was just wondering anyone has had success with a similar experience. Berkeley is the only school I've ever toured and I can't let it go just yet. Thank you! Edit: Please let me know if this isn't the place to ask... idk where/whom to contact so I'm just grabbing at straws.
384	1	waitlisted at UCLA  Please give me encouraging stories of being waitlisted at UCLA but accepted to UCB. I never completely wanted to go to LA because i didn‚Äôt think my stats were strong enough but now i‚Äôm even more terrified. UCB is my DREAM school, i went to the campus my freshman year and senior year and i absolutely love it more and more each time. my heart dropped when i got requests for LORs and my essays were based more towards Cal. may the bear bring me luck for Thursday! rawr! üêª EDIT: I GOT IN!!! GO BEARS!!! Thank you for everyone who responded! I‚Äôm glad to say that it is possible. :)
183	2	Co2026 Decision Help  if anyone can read my comment for a minute or two that‚Äôd be great üòÇ I got accepted into Berkeley as a regents scholar, and finances have been a priority for me so that definitely boosts Berkeley to the top of my choices. However, UCLA has always been right there too, and tbh I think it was my dream school as a kid and I just couldn‚Äôt imagine turning it down (also got in there).They‚Äôve only offered me half tuition so far but I may be receiving a Boys and girls club scholarship worth up to 100k. Just as much, though, I could never imagine turning down Berkeley üòÇ If I can pay for both, which is better for a political science major and future law school student? I‚Äôm naturally introverted but extroverted when u get to know me, I am really trying to increase my persona and get some good networking, I‚Äôm trying to advocate for changes, and I want to be involved in intramurals and weightlifting. I just want to be as happy as possible, but I am an extremely hard worker and have been known for putting in hours upon hours of work outside of school and not hanging out that much üòÇ (also, I‚Äôm not stupid, if I don‚Äôt get as good of an offer from la, then I‚Äôm going Berkeley)

871	2	Control Theory/Robotics research over the summer?   I am currently taking EE C128 and want to apply what I'm learning in that class to something. After this semester I will have taken EE120, EE123, EECS 126, EECS149, EECS 151 (fpga lab), CS162, CS170, and have a lot of systems/embedded software and full-stack/app development experience.  I was wondering what some good labs to inquire about summer research would be. Ideally I'd like to join a lab that intersects control theory with some other fields (like AI/ML, optimization/probability, or signal processing) but my main priority is to work in a lab where I can apply and learn more about controls. If anything comes to mind lmk!
200	2	Acceptance Package/Letters for International Students?  I was very fortunate enough to have been accepted to Berkeley a few days ago which was an amazing surprise following the mountain of waitlists and rejections from all the other UCs + being international. I looked through some past threads but didn‚Äôt get an answer so I‚Äôm making a post: does berkeley send acceptance pamphlet package things to international students? If so, does anyone know around how long it takes for them to arrive? Thank you:)

795	2	I hate coding  Taking math 124 as my first exposure to coding, and I absolutely abhor it. I dread even beginning the HW. Somehow everyone in the class averages a 95% on HW and like a B+ on exams/quizzes, so this is going to tank my GPA. My will and desire to study for the class are fast dwindling, as I'm struggling to get a C even while putting a ton of effort, and it's rubbing off on all of my other courses.  Do you all enjoy coding, or are you doing it because it's the best career choice from a financial perspective?
453	2	Does performance in 61A correlate to how well of a software engineer you will be?  Because if so maybe software engineering is not for me. If the day to day activities of a software engineer are anywhere near as difficult as CS 61A, both exams and projects then I'm fucked lol
231	1	is there a place to get a little bit of a white paint on campus?  Quick random question, but does anyone know if there's a place where I can borrow a bit of a white paint on campus, like from the art department? I was originally looking to buy some paint myself, but I can't seem to find it locally and I just need a really tiny bit of it (the paint on the edge of my desk came off and it looks rather ugly, so I think a bit of paint might make it better).
616	2	Going fully online next year doable for CS?  I've been thinking about my options for next year since next year is my last year here and due to some personal circumstances as well as how bad the housing market is here, I was wondering if it would be possible for me to go fully online next year as a CS major and just fly for exam days especially since most CS courses are webcasted. I don't mind losing discussion credits or attendance points and don't really care about the social aspect or the "college experience" of being in person since I want to just get my degree and start making a living.
53	2	International Studies Breadths  What are some of your favorite international studies breadths? I'm hoping to enroll in a class with relatively little reading, but its not a requirement. I don't really care if the class is hard or the curve is bad as long as the course is interesting.

Im a very sociable person, and was wondering how are the vibes in the house. Since this is an academic focused house and right around the corner of the cs building, how diverse would you say the residents are in regards to majors. Also, my biggest concern. How would you rate and describe the cleanliness of the shared spaces and bathrooms. Any insight would be great to hear! Thanks

I'm an intended MCB major looking to get a minor (maybe double major) in data science or compsci, but I barely have any coding experience. I'm learning how to program with R right now but I was wondering how everyone else here got into coding. What resources did you all utilize? I'd prefer something free and could prepare me for coding courses at Berkeley. Also, how do I know if I can take some of the major requirements for data science/compsci at community college? Ik there was a website to check, but I forgot the name.

Ofc I took hella AP‚Äôs and kept my grades at A‚Äôs, but school has never been my focus, I like doing a lot of different things. Should I still pull up?

362	2	Should I transfer out (CS)?  Just knew about what's happening with cs70... apparently I can't declare cs anymore because I didn't indicate it in my application, which feels awful since if I knew that I would've indicated cs or gone to a different school. Furthermore, I can't even take the useful cs upper divs as a ds major because without cs70 I can't take cs170 and 162. Also, seeing how so many students are gonna do ds instead of cs because of this policy, ds is probably gonna be more impacted as well. This makes me really scared about my future..... My question is: if I really want to be a SWE after graduation (and no plans of grad school), should I transfer to a state school to study cs at this point?

I'm asking because I'm not certain if I would like to attend the summer program, if accepted.
289	3	My thoughts on theme housing program WISE (Womxn in STEAM Empowerment)  Hi, I'm a freshman this year living at Stern Hall in a theme housing program, WISE (Womxn in STEAM Empowerment). I found virtually no information on WISE last year when I was deciding whether or not to apply, so I'm going to share my experience with it so far. Sorry in advance, this is going to be really long and comprehensive. I will try my best to keep my emotions out of this and break it into chunks with descriptive headers. Hopefully this information will be interesting and/or helpful! *TL;DR - WISE is not at all what it is advertised as. Instead of teaching us how to succeed as women in STEAM fields, we have been taught how to be "woke," and there have been none of the fancy events that were promised. WISE has been canceled for Spring 2022 because too many of us complained.* **What is WISE?** WISE is described by [its official website](https://reslife.berkeley.edu/academics/theme-programs/empowering-womxn-in-steam/) as so: >Empowering Womxn in STEAM Theme Program (WISE), is focused on exploring the intersections of gender with Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics.   >   >The WISE Theme Program began in 1999 as an affinity space for 42 first-year female-identified students. The goal is for residents to explore their interest in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) fields, and intersections of social identity in their profession. Through weekly seminar discussions and intentional programming, WISE provides a critical community where residents learn about the gender gap, power, and privilege in the STEAM fields and advancements in current research.  They also advertise the following required events: * Fall and spring WISE Theme Program retreats * WISE programs, hosted by the Theme Program Assistant * Faculty dinner * Faculty and Industry Roundtables * Community Mixer * WISE Conference * Cal Day * End of the Year Celebration >Events include a wide variety of leadership and community-building activities, such as dinners with faculty, study groups, on-site tutoring, mentoring, and field trips. **Why did I apply?** My roommate and I applied to housing together, and we decided to apply to WISE as well, as we are both STEM majors. The events sounded incredibly promising, and the small community was appealing. I saw this as a great way to make friends, start focusing on career development, and figure out exactly what I want to do with my major in the STEM field. The website, my only resource on the program at the time, promised workshops, speakers, academic support, and field trips. The theme of this program resonated very strongly with me as a female CS major, as all of my high school CS experiences were uncomfortably male-dominated. I have strong interests in workplace success for women in male-dominated STEM fields and also in the importance of diversity in the workplace. I was looking forward to learning about and discussing the difficulties of being a woman in the STEM field. Additionally, the theme program requires that participants live in Stern Hall, which is located at the Foothill complex and is the only all-female student dormitory. All I knew about Stern was that it was all-female, and the building looked really pretty in the pictures I'd seen. I liked the idea that you would live near the other students in WISE. It seemed like a fun way to have people with your major around you and make friends. **Fall Semester: Broken Promises </3** Okay, to say that the WISE program was disappointing is an understatement. Going back to read all of WISE's promises has actually been shocking‚Äîthe website displays an egregious misrepresentation of what I experienced.  ***Fall Retreat*** The program started off on a disappointing note that, as I now can see, set the tone for the rest of the semester. WISE featured a mandatory 2-hour seminar every Monday evening that I will refer to as WISE seminar. The program is supposed to organize a retreat at the beginning of each semester. The fall retreat's time and date was communicated to us 2 days before it was scheduled to happen, and it seemed to be a 3-hour event at Stern/Foothill. Shortly after, it was postponed to the time of our first WISE seminar. I'm not sure what a retreat is supposed to look like, but our retreat entailed sitting in an assembly room with cold pizza and 2 hours of awkward icebreakers. We also wrote letters to our future selves and made some posters in small groups. Since the seminar is from 6-8 PM every Monday, we asked whether we would be provided dinner each week. The program coordinator and instructors said that we would get dinner sometimes, but not every week. SPOILER: we did not ever get dinner again after this first meeting. ***What We Actually Learned*** It would become clear that WISE was not at all what I expected. I expected to learn specifically about the challenges of being a woman in STEM. Instead, the seminars focused on learning about intersectionality and how social identities (gender, sexual orientation, economic status, citizenship/immigration status, age, race, ethnicity, disability, etc.) all contribute to discrimination, lack of opportunity, and oppression. I understand these topics are extremely important, but this was not what any of us signed up for, and the way that we learned about these topics became questionable. Each week, WISE seminar felt more and more like a waste of time. There was a very detailed syllabus, and we would receive homework assignments and weekly readings to do. Each week, we would learn about some topic almost completely unrelated to the topic of being a woman in STEAM. We would focus on discrimination against different subgroups of identities, such as economic status, race, sexual orientation.  ***Discriminating to learn how to... not discriminate?*** Throughout the semester, we learned about the intersectionality of identities and how some identities are privileged while others are discriminated against. One teaching activity that the WISE instructors particularly liked to do was having us separate into groups in different corners of the room based on how we identify. Once, we were told to separate into low-income, low middle-income, high middle-income, and high-income groups. We were also grouped by race in a Zoom call once. I understood these exercises to allow us to talk about discrimination, common problems, and misconceptions about our identity groups and share with the rest of these class. But it could be, and was, rather uncomfortable for many of us, especially to openly disclose your economic status to a class of around 40 people.  It's a really strange approach to talk about, for example, how white people are the oppressors, while POC are the oppressed. Then following that, have us all separate into racial groups. It seemed inappropriate, and the WISE instructors did not reconsider this approach even when students voiced their discomfort in front of the entire class later in the semester. ***Fall Final Project*** I don't know why, but I was expecting the final project to be something related to being a woman in STEAM. Instead, it was a group presentation project in which each group had to come up with a minute-by-minute instruction plan to teach the rest of the class about a certain identity (economic status, gender, race/ethnicity, etc). This project was the turning point for me to start to realize how much time I was wasting on WISE. **Miscellaneous Takeaways/Experiences at Wise!** *I'll be adding to this as any new WISE memories leak through the hefty mental block my brain has placed on all things WISE* * NONE of the events that were promised EVER happened. No faculty dinners, workshops, roundtables, mixers, or anything. Just WISE seminar every Monday. * I‚Äôm not sure if this will be true for future program participants, but we did get to live in the nicer/newer wing of Stern Hall. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a game of chance if you want to live in Stern but not have to live in the older, crustier rooms. * WISE was a 1-unit, pass/no-pass (P/NP) course, but the instructors kept talking about it like our GPA mattered for this class. I don‚Äôt know if they ever figured out that it was P/NP. * I am personally not white, but with the way that the instructors spoke about ‚Äúwhite people,‚Äù I would have felt very uncomfortable if I were. *  Almost none of the content was focused on STEAM. One of the only STEAM-related things I remember was learning, through a hands-on disability-simulating seminar, that people with dyslexia have a much harder time reading large, complex words in scientific literature.    **Redeeming Qualities** Even though this post sounds overwhelmingly negative, I do have a lot of respect for the program coordinators/instructors. COVID hit everyone really hard, and I believe that everyone tried their best on WISE. Here are some nice things that happened: * I stopped doing my work after I realized that WISE was a huge waste of time. But I still passed <3 * I did end up making some friends. A lot of us were able to bond and relate over the frustrations of WISE. The students in the program generally are really thoughtful and interesting! * Since a lot of WISE students complained, there will be no more P/NP WISE seminar this semester! They say that they‚Äôll organize optional events, and there has been a resume workshop so far. * Even though the topics covered were not what I signed up for, they are still incredibly important to talk about. There was a lot of fresh and thoughtful conversation from my peers, and I learned a lot. **Closing Thoughts** This post is heavily biased because I came into this program with personalized expectations and did not appreciate that this was not what I signed up for. I do feel the need to emphasize again that the program has been NOTHING like it was described on the official website. Feel free to ask me any questions about my experience. I don‚Äôt know how WISE will be in future years, but good luck if you do apply!

I know about some pathways like FPF, but I don't know if something like FPF is only applicable for like students planning to major at the college of letters and science, or if I can indicate FPF in my optional essay even though I've applied to the college of engineering. Any advice/info at all (even wider advice about how to make my optional essay stand out) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

154	2	UC Berkeley Bioengineering VS UC Davis Biomedical Engineering  A couple weeks ago, I was admitted to UC Davis for their biomedical engineering program. I was set on going there having been waitlisted from my other UC‚Äôs. However, day before yesterday, I was admitted to UC Berkeley for their bioengineering program. I am currently conflicted of where I should go.  UC Berkeley‚Äôs bioengineering program is extremely good, having close connections with UCSF. Berkeley‚Äôs overall prestige is also something to note. Berkeley basically has world renowned programs in every single department and Berkeley alumni are all extremely successful. However, I have heard that Berkeley‚Äôs student life is very cutthroat and competitive (heard that grade deflation is rampant), students are unhappy there, and the surrounding area is unsafe. Of course, these are things that I‚Äôve heard, so please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. UC Davis‚Äô biomedical program is obviously still quite good and I‚Äôve heard that it is not as competitive as Berkeley. I‚Äôve heard that it is easier to get involved in research at Davis compared to Berkeley and easier to achieve a higher GPA. I have heard that the student life is much more peaceful and overall, it‚Äôs a more well rounded college experience. I have also heard that the surrounding area at Davis is significantly more safe. However, I know that Davis does not carry the same reputation and name that Berkeley does. People often complain that Davis is in the middle of nowhere with not much campus life. I feel conflicted as to which one to choose. I feel like both are amazing options and it seems to me the question comes down to whether I prioritize academic reputation/prestige over student life or vice versa.  If you guys could give me some insight into what it‚Äôs like at Berkeley, that would be wonderful. Also, I acknowledge that I could be wrong with my assumptions regarding Berkeley, so please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks!

726	1	Opting out of donation phone calls and mail?  Apologies if this is a common question, but I couldn't find an answer when searching. Maybe I'm spitting into the wind, but I don't want to receive any more mail or phone calls from Berkeley trying to get me to donate. I came for a PhD program and dropped out. I am so sick and tired of getting these, and they bring up a lot of shame, and I literally want Berkeley to just forget my mailing address and phone number. Is there ANY WAY to opt out?

446	4	Feeling discouraged/stressed/depressed, etc. for March 24th  Disclaimer: This is a somewhat long read, look at the TLDR on the bottom if you don‚Äôt want to read it all. But, yes, I know everyone has gone through these same feelings, and yes, I know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling these feelings. No, I‚Äôm not asking for sympathy or any special treatment; only advice, but that‚Äôs it. The reason I‚Äôm writing this is for myself really, to write out and express my feelings instead of bottling them up. To somehow pose a manifestation maybe. Well here it goes. So basically, I was accepted to Berkeley in March of 2020 (yes, that long ago), but due to personal reasons (my family losing their house, my dad having a serious stroke, I had to stay back to help support them financially and emotionally, trickle that in with COVID and my own mental health issues, I was going through a lot), so I had withdrawn for that semester to continue in the spring. Or so I thought. In the spring, I was told I could apply for readmission, so I did. And waited all summer, just to find out in late August of 2021 that my admission was cancelled in August of 2020. So due to miscommunication and misunderstanding (on my part mainly), I fumbled my admission and I had wasted two years of my academic life. (You can see through my post history that this seriously has been a really tough situation for me.) I went ahead and reapplied in December because my mind had been fixated on Berkeley since I was accepted back in March of 2020, and there was no changing it. I had also applied to other UC schools, but that was it. I didn‚Äôt apply to any Maryland schools, where I‚Äôm originally from (a seriously foolish decision on my part). And then I waited for decisions. Flash forward to this past Friday where UC Irvine, San Diego, and Los Angeles decisions were released. And let‚Äôs just say the start of the discouragement kicked in. Waitlisted at Irvine and not accepted at the other two. Which seriously scares me in terms of Berkeley and makes me second guess myself and my achievements. I‚Äôm nervous that they looked at my senior year grades (2019-20) for the reason they didn‚Äôt accept me, which were awful, I‚Äôll admit. Though, they were no case of senioritis, I was going through a lot (again), and I explained that thoroughly in my application. But, I guess that explanation wasn‚Äôt enough. I guess my freshman, sophomore, and junior year grades, extracurriculars, essays, AP scores, recommendations, and accomplishments during my 2-year gap weren‚Äôt enough. And to me, I think I‚Äôve done a LOT in my life to overshadow that one bad year in my life, which really were just a bad 5 months (January-May 2020). I feel like there‚Äôs a lot in my application to make me stand out, but I‚Äôm just super nervous they‚Äôre going to hold my senior year grades against me. I‚Äôm even more scared if I don‚Äôt get in because then I just wasted another academic year. And I know not getting into Berkeley is not the end of the world, but it really puts a dent on everything for me.  I was told to have faith that if they accepted me once, they‚Äôll accept me again, and I want to hold true to that. The only thing that would‚Äôve changed since I was first admitted is my poor second semester senior year grades (which I throughly explained) and my 2 year gap (in which I tutored 2 students for over a year, college mentored a student for over a year, became an organizer for an AOC program and co-designed an Earth Day event that AOC attended, and co-designed a Summer Program, got a job at Starbucks, and more; all the while taking care of my family). I mean to me, that‚Äôs A LOT for a gap year during a pandemic with my ongoing family issues. I don‚Äôt know what other colleges expect out of me, to find a cure for cancer? To go viral on TikTok? I wish I could go back and not have all my personal issues I did my senior year. I wish I had teachers and administration who cared about my personal issues and would let me make up my assignments then. Oh, I wish I could change all of that, so they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a slacker or an unproductive student. But alas, I can‚Äôt. All I can do is try to make up for it, in which I believe I have. I hope my persistence these past two years in attending Berkeley attests to my admission chances and doesn‚Äôt deteriorate it. Maybe those other UC schools know I‚Äôm getting into Berkeley, so they denied me üò≠. I‚Äôm trying my best to remain hopeful, though I‚Äôm losing hope by the day. I‚Äôve tried my best to channel my emotions into other formats; albeit, this post, songwriting, hanging with friends and family, etc. But I feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of breaking, and I don‚Äôt want that. Plus, Berkeley has to cut student admissions by 2,629 students?! I could easily be one of those 2,629, which is all the more reason for me to stress, sigh. So this is the part where I ask for any and all advice. I‚Äôm aware no one can change my admission decisions, and that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking for. But what‚Äôs the best way for me to alleviate this stress/discouragement? If I have my mind set on California for this upcoming fall, is there still anything I can do about that? Anything helps really. My DMs are also open for advice/suggestions. I truly thank you for reading this, even if you skimmed. It‚Äôs a lot, I know, but it feels good to write it out. And I also hope it doesn‚Äôt come across as if I‚Äôm ‚Äúbragging‚Äù about my accomplishments during my gap year, that wasn‚Äôt the point of that section. It was my way of validating myself and giving myself hope that maybe Berkeley will overlook my senior year grades due to those achievements. That was the goal of the inclusion of that. Anyways, I hope and pray that I get accepted to Berkeley this Thursday, and at the very least waitlisted. A flat out rejection will absolutely crush me. Unfortunately, I‚Äôll have no time to be sad because I have to tutor and work that day, yay me! üòÉüò≠ But, thank you again, truly. Maybe one day, we can be friends and have lunch at Eureka! üò≠üò≠üò≠ TLDR: I was accepted at Berkeley in March 2020, went through a long process for a year and a half with Berkeley, just to find out I screwed up my admission. Reapplied to Berkeley and 3 other UCs in December 2021. Was waitlisted at 1, denied at the other 2. I‚Äôm nervous they didn‚Äôt accept me due to my senior year grades (which were poor due to personal issues, which were explained in the application), and I‚Äôm scared Berkeley will do the same despite the rest of my resounding application that includes some pretty unique gap year accomplishments. I ask for any advice in dealing with this stress and discouragement I feel as I know that no one in here can change the outcome of my admission decision. (Read everything for a more clearer picture.)

What type of things did you put into perspective? I know age isn‚Äôt an important factor, but I graduate at 22 if that helps. I‚Äôm not looking for an answer to my decision, just opinions of people who‚Äôve been in my position.

678	2	Does the Data Science minor matter?  I'm a sophomore taking 5 classes rn, one of them being CS 88 (similar to 61A) which I'm planning to use for the data science minor. Combined with clubs, internship recruiting, and other commitments, I'm not sure whether I should p/np the class or drop it then retake it. Taking it for a letter grade is out of the picture as I've already missed a lot of lecture self checks (like vitamins in other classes) and am way behind in terms of the concepts compared to the rest of my peers (I can barely do simple problems on my own). The reason I am even taking this class is for the data science minor which I assumed was helpful as I see a lot of people doing it, but then I found out the minor isn't even mentioned on the degree, only the transcript. Will the data science minor even help at all for career paths such as investment banking and consulting? Would y'all recommend I do the minor by dropping cs 88 and retaking it or just p/nping so I can get the knowledge without it affecting my GPA? I'm also going to have to use a late drop if I end up dropping it so please take that into consideration. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

568	2	Is there any pros to having a really high GPA in CS if you're not doing Grad School?  As much as I like to tell myself that I just need to graduate with a decent GPA, I often find myself putting in extra work for a higher grade even if I feel stressed out or don't need a higher grade and whenever I slack off a bit on things in order to relax, I feel the need to go on a huge grind even if I'm still on top of where I need to be. It's not like I'm even interested in doing grad school and just want to go straight to industry.

244	2	Heard CS Department is Considering To Remove EECS 16B Requirement  Heard from multiple friends, who apparently chatted with the CS committee members, that they have been considering removing EECS 16B as a requirement altogether. Perhaps to redirect funding and help with the CS ban crisis right now? Is this true? Can anyone confirm if a decision has been made already?    Apparently since all students try to avoid it like the plague it has caused massive enrollment issues, and some faculty are starting to agree since the ratings are super low and most students never use the content again in their lives. Is this true as well?
135	2	Switching from MEng to CS or EECS?  HI. Just another stupid question from an incoming baby bear! So i just got into the college of engineering at Berkeley, but recently i was more into sort of the meta verse industry and really contemplating to switch my major from engineering to cs, which is in the college of letters and science. Is that possible as soon as i get into campus? Or does it require a lot more process than that.
590	4	Stay Safe Out There  This happened to me yesterday but this might have been the same person as [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tfmjyx/i_think_some_guy_tried_to_steal_my_watch/) At about 4:30 yesterday I was taking the bus home when someone sat a little too close to me. I tried shifting around to avoid touching him but there wasn't room and he started talking to me. I thought it was just small talk and didn't pay much attention. He put his hand on top of mine; I felt uncomfortable but I didn't want to be rude since it might have been normal for his culture. He first asked me if I liked middle easterns then asked where I'm from. He then talked about how he lived in Berkeley for 24 years and has a house in the middle east and one in Berkeley. He then went on about how great he was at massages. I was quite uncomfortable but I was near my stop and was ready to get off. When I got off, he followed me. When we got off he kept trying to talk to me and the bus driver honked at him since he had a bike in the front. I tried to get away from him but I was at a crosswalk waiting for the signal. While waiting, he asked if I wanted a massage and I said no. I quickly crossed but again he followed and again I was waiting for the crosswalk signal. He then asked how big my penis was and I tried ignoring him. Once the signal turned green I was really uncomfortable and was walking away as fast as I could. He asked me a couple times if I wanted to go somewhere with him. I kept saying no then he said he would give me $200 if I showed him my penis. I kept saying no until he finally stopped following me. I'm grateful that nothing terrible happened to me and I hope I can be more assertive in the future. I should have told him to fuck off a lot sooner.

368	3	I strongly support cs department's prioritize EECS and CS-intended in cs70 enrollment. It is the only thing the department could do.  Change CS admission to UW/UIUC style -> Never gonna be approved by L&S Ask for more funding -> Ignored. Charge additional fee for cs majors -> Students will resist FIERCELY (I will too. I don't want to pay more tuition because of the cheaters) Now the department finally found a way! Give us more money or we can't teach more students. What will L&S do? Nothing. They can't do anything. Will the students protest? Maybe. But you should know that there are quite a lot of EECS or L&S CS or L&S CS-intended people who approve this decision by the department. It's not like everyone is against the idea. Quite a lot of people like me strongly support the department's decision.  You will say I am selfish and yes I am hella selfish. But so do you. You're asking for grandfathering bullsh\*t cause you are selfish. You make up all kinds of reasons like you didn't know when you are applying blahblahblah while this issue of overcrowding has been around for at least 5 years now. You should know that by gaming the system, by applying to "easy" majors only to declare cs, you took your chances. And you lost. You lost the bet. Suck it up. Now you are begging for grandfathering cause you want to be the last one who gamed the system. No, it will not work that way. Berkeley should teach cheaters like you a lesson. A lesson that gaming the system could be a very risky bet. You say L&S is all about discovering your true interest. If you really believe so, you would not be asking for gradnfathering or changing CS admission to UW style but you will be asking for more funding to the department. Let's be honest here. You won't care as long as you are the last one who could cheat. Sorry the world does not work that way. Finally, justice has been served. At least I transferred as L&S CS, got in with 5\~6% acceptance rate. Hope you learned a valuable lesson here.

927	3	LOST MY 16B CAR PLS HELP  So this is gonna sound really dumb but I left our 16B car in a room and it doesn't have our names on it lol. Like every other 16B car, it's a 3-wheeled wired mess with a breadboard and a couple motors, but as a distinguishing feature it has some whiteish zip ties on the back to hold the motor wires down. It was in a mid-sized Amazon box along with the kit and was last seen Monday in Cory 367. If you have seen it please pm or comment, I'll love you forever! <3 If you haven‚Äôt seen it pls share this with your ee/cs friends so two fellow bears don‚Äôt have to rebuild their cursed 16b car :(

50	2	Berkeley L&S vs. CMU SCS  Likely to have a gov-sponsored full-ride at either school, so cost isn't a factor. Neither is weather, I've experienced both climates and don't really have a preference. I'm mostly worried about CMU's stress culture - I don't want a boring undergrad experience. On the other hand, CS at L&S seems pretty bad with getting the required classes. I've heard horror stories about people going into 5/6th years just because they couldn't get the classes they need.

How likely would it be for me to get caught ?? Also, what's the longest I can live there according to their rules?
815	2	Business  I want to strengthen the business-side of my resume for my Haas application but am not entirely sure if there is something I can do aside from internships, consulting clubs, etc. unlike for CS you can do a personal project (I mean I guess you can start a business but that seems way more tough than a project lol) Any suggestions?
784	2	How to Research  I recently got an offer at one of the labs in BAIR under a PhD student.

Also, is it weird if I ask for access to the Way West building as a study space, or some other reason?

184	2	Berkeley L&S vs. UCLA L&S + Regents for CS-intended  These are the top two schools I've been admitted to at the moment. **Berkeley:** |Pros:|Cons:| |:-|:-| |Could double major in CS + Physics/Stats/Applied Math (interested in semiconductors and ML)|Didn't select CS on freshman application, uncertain about ability to declare| |If I am able to declare, I'm confident in my CS/quantitative and performing-at-the-top abilities|Not sure how B.A. in CS would be viewed by employers compared to B.S.| |Stronger name brand on the East Coast|Don't have priority enrollment/Regents, and with the current situation in L&S CS, I feel like it's going to be extremely hard to get the classes I want\*| |Probably better for people with a lot of ambition|Bad for my interpersonal development and soft skills (lots of non-Haas/athletes go in socially awkward and come out that way, think EECS students not taking showers)| |Like the trees/nature-y vibes of the campus|Dangerous and run-down surrounding areas| |Very big name brand in tech, essentially the only school comparable to Stanford/MIT|From what I've observed (have been to Berkeley's campus \~30 times in the past), a lot of the people look dead on the inside and isolate themselves from others| |Very familiar with the school because I was admitted under February early notification (top 8% of entering class) and have been researching it for the last 1.5 months|Too many people from my HS go to Berkeley, and hyper-competitive environment would feel like an extension of HS| |Good extracurricular opportunities|Ranked lower than UCLA on USNWR and ranking might keep decreasing if student satisfaction goes down/Berkeley unsuccessfully tries to game the rankings like it did in 2019| |Honestly a pretty big fan of NorCal weather|| ‚Äã **UCLA:** |Pros:|Cons:| |:-|:-| |Assuming I get Regents (currently have invitation which top \~1.5% of entering class gets), I get priority enrollment|Slightly weaker name brand on East Coast relative to Michigan/Virginia (Berkeley probably wouldn't have this problem right now, but in a few years, it might be different)\*\*| |Better for my interpersonal development, nicer people from what I've heard|One tier below Berkeley/Stanford/MIT/CMU in tech, but I'm not sure this would make a substantial difference (Berkeley's SV ties are not Stanford's)| |Better quality of life (surrounding areas and beautiful campus) and food (saw a post on here where a student got norovirus before his midterms)|Would have to transfer to CoE to do CS (3.5 bar is slightly higher than Berkeley L&S's 3.3 bar, but given how I've performed in HS I don't think this will be a problem)| |Still interested in the L&S Ling + CS major (especially for NLP research), which could be viewed as "interesting" for employers as long as I have the necessary CS skills and am able to justify the "linguistics" part (from what I've read on r/cscareerquestions)|Once again, not sure how Ling + CS B.A. would be viewed compared to CS B.S. | |CS isn't impacted like it is at Berkeley, also potentially better for grad school/master's because although there is grade deflation, it isn't nearly as bad as Berkeley's (now, if I was doing MCB or something, I wouldn't choose either school)|Can't double major if I transfer to CoE CS| |Never been to UCLA's campus, would be a refreshing change from NorCal|Weather a little too hot...? But UCLA is close to the ocean so I think there's a nice breeze there| |Ranked higher on USNWR and ranking seems to be going up because it's the quintessential one-size-fits-all school (basically the most desirable school in CA other than Stanford), may affect how Gen. Z perceives the difference in the schools|| |Overall peer quality seems better (nearly everyone who got into UCLA from my HS also got into Berkeley, but not the other way around)|| \*An alum I talked to said that while she was at Berkeley, she would go up to professors with flowers and chocolate and beg them to let her into the classes she wanted \*\*I'm planning to stay on the West Coast anyways (hopefully to work in Seattle), and Stanford/Berkeley/UCLA/Caltech are viewed as the best schools here (although it's good to keep my options open if I want to live on the East Coast)

478	2	I can't commit to Berkeley?  Hello! So I got accepted last year but then took a gap year. This year I was readmitted, and at first I still had a few tasks to do(including accepting my offer), but today, when i wanted to accept my offer, for some reason it's gone. (it also used to have a 'congrats' message from the vice chancellor of berkeley or smth like that On the top left corner, right above the COVID message). I'm not sure if that means they took back my decision or something... What can I do?  Thank you so much! https://preview.redd.it/pur63tkbpco81.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=f107c9dd1bcfa7e0d50da9d8418d7794585d5eeb

777	1	Happy National Sleep Awareness Week!  Sleeping soundly should come easy after a hard day at school. But, for many, nighttime slumber is disrupted by thoughts of a "to-do" list, worries about school workload, or interruptions from roommates, street noise, phone, etc. One-third of all American adults experience an occasional or persistent sleep disturbance known as insomnia. According to modest estimates, at least 20-30 million Americans suffer from insomnia. **To improve the quality of your sleep, try these slumber-friendly techniques:** * **Stick to a sleep schedule** \- Go to bed and wake up at the same time every night and day, including weekends. * **Wind down to sleep** \- Develop a relaxing, nightly wind-down routine such as reading, listening to music, light stretching, deep breathing, or taking a bath. * **Create a restful environment -** Create an environment conducive to sleep -- quiet, dark, comfortable. * **Separate work from bed** \- Do not use bedtime to do work. * **Include physical activity in your daily routine** \- Get regular exercise during the day. * **Avoid stimulants** \- Avoid caffeine or nicotine several hours before bedtime. * **Pay attention to what you eat and drink** \- Do not over- or under-eat before bedtime. * **Avoid alcohol-** Do not consume alcohol before bedtime (it can lead to disrupted sleep). * **Limit daytime naps -** Avoid naps unless you have no problem sleeping at night. * **Check your medication -** Ask your physician if any of your prescribed medication causes sleep disruption. * **Mindfulness -** Try relaxing each muscle from your toes to your head or think of a repetitive mental routine such as counting sheep! * **Remove the pressure -** If you cannot get to sleep, try doing something relaxing. If, after one to two weeks, you do not see improvement, consult your doctor. Your physician can explore physical or emotional causes and prescribe treatment accordingly to alleviate your sleeplessness.

I feel a little disappointed as Berkeley was my top choice and dream university.  I think that my application case is quite strong and having a Fulbright scholarship increased my chances of getting in but I got rejected straightforward without any feedback. I have already accepted it but do you know what could be the cause of rejecton? I have heard that Berkeley is more likely to accept international students but it did not work with me

633	2	Is there really no parking options for someone frequently in Berkeley who doesn‚Äôt live here?  My SO lives in SF and I live in Berkeley. I don‚Äôt have a car so they often have their car in Berkeley, maybe about half of the week. Most streets here either are limited certain hours of the day or require a residential parking permit. Is there really no way for them to park near my apartment without having to move the car twice a day or hope they don‚Äôt get a ticket?? It‚Äôs even more ridiculous because I live in Berkeley and should deserve a parking pass, but I can‚Äôt get one because I don‚Äôt have a car.

69	2	Help a newly admitted bear out!!  Hi. I was recently admitted to Berkeley for economics as an international and this is my first post on this sub. I really like Berkeley and California in general, yet I have some doubts based on what I heard about the UC system so far. My counselor and teachers told me that Berkeley may not be the best choice as it is very crowded and resources are limited, which is an important factor considering I would be paying the high international fee to attend. What do you guys think about it? Edit: For reference, I don‚Äôt care that much about professor availability, but I am interested in using the university resources to the fullest.

Do you have any recommendations for any new devices to buy that would be compatible for someone taking courses in L&S and hopefully Haas? I need something that will last me all four years (and if there are any student discounts pls lmk). At other colleges, I heard that it is preferred to use a Microsoft device because of Microsoft Office so I was wondering if there were any preferences within L&S and Haas. Also, some people on this subreddit have talked about preferring an iPad + Apple Pen instead of just a regular MacBook. Could anyone help me out on this?
660	2	Berkeley put everyone in flex dollar debt :/  Update: Looks like they fixed flex dollar balances! I still think it‚Äôs ridiculous we have to use flex dollars over spring break but it is what it is.  So on March 13th, students with a meal plan had their flex dollar balances reset back to the cap (ie, if your meal plan gave you $300 per semester, your balance was now $300 again). This was first noticed on the Berkeley subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tdrd3s/300_extra_flex_dollars/). Now, at first, I thought this might be assistance from the university for students, considering that (for reasons I still don't understand) we have to use flex dollars over spring break. But then I remembered that UC Berkeley would never do anything so generous, and sure enough, the flex dollars were [removed from accounts today](https://imgur.com/6VWCcIG). Now, obviously, if the university made a mistake, then I don't really care if they take their money back. Just chalk it up to someone pushing the wrong button, have a laugh, whatever. Here's the thing, though: if you spent *any* flex dollars between the adding and removal of these flex dollars, you are now in **flex dollar debt**. [Seriously, go check for yourself](https://imgur.com/ftppvcn). All in all, I think this is actually pretty funny, but it definitely needs to be fixed in the next few days. I think balances should just be rolled back to before the extra money was added (or just give us the bonus flex dollars back ü•∫).
666	2	Quantum Classes?  Hey fellow bears! I'm looking for advice on what course to take if I want to learn quantum mechanics.  So far, it looks like physics 7C and physics 137A are my choices, but I was wondering if there is a course in the chem department that covers quantum as well? Would chem 130B be my best bet? I can't seem to find anything about the course online, but the instructors in 130 seemed to allude to quantum being covered in B.  I've taken physics 7A and 7B and (like I said) chem 130. Does anyone know if I need to take 7C/5C before 137A or can I just jump right in? I have a background in linear algebra and differential eqs, but haven't taken the actual courses since high school. Would I be totally screwed in 137A? I'm thinking of taking it this summer.  I'm also not a chem or physics major, so apologies if these are obvious answers for you all lol. Thanks!!! Edit: why is this getting downvoted :(

The fam wants him to commute from home so that he can save some money on housing and so that he can enjoy home-cooked food every day. They also want him to be at home so that he stays in close contact with them and doesn't slip in school (opposite of what's happened to me lol). My bro doesn't rlly care either way; he's totally out of it now with senioritis and is just playing Elden Ring all day long. I'm mentioning that last bit in part so that you guys don't go all "your brother should be asking this question" lol. Gotta let the dude catch a break for once. So, I thought that I would ask on the Cal subreddit since you folks would probably know best. For context, we live in San Ramon, CA. Also, my little bro has his driving license. Depending on the conclusion, the parents could be down to get him a second-hand/used car. He would also be fine going on public transportation (BART, etc.). **What do you guys think about commuting to Cal from the San Ramon area?** Thanks in advance!

209	2	Help: Admissions Question  So, I got admitted to Berkeley yesterday, and I'm super excited to commit. However, I am a little concerned about how strict the conditions of admissions are. In the first semester of senior year, I earned a 3.1 (UW)/3.7 (W) GPA and received Cs in two courses (AP Statistics and AP Gov.). These are above the conditions of admissions, yes, but they show a decline from my previous academic record. For context, throughout sophomore and junior year, I only earned 2 Bs in AP World, and the rest were As. I have some extenuating circumstances to explain these grades if needed, although they are not particularly immense. Should I be worried about being rescinded, or am I being dramatic, considering I met the conditions of admissions? Should I contact my admissions officer about this decline? Please let me know and try not to be too brutal about this dilemma; I'm already a little anxious lol.

307	1	Solution to the CS crisis  you guys are looking at this crisis and being like üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± just force the uni to fund the eecs department more üò±üò±üò±üò± stop giving athletics so much üò±üò±üò¥üò¥ but i have the best idea.  simply make graduated eecs & cs majors sign a binding agreement forcing them to donate to cal's eecs/cs department. that way the department receives independent funding from the $150k+ per year SWE salaries of thousands of cal cs grads ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è so graduating more cs majors means more money! ü§ìüí≠üí° can't pay your post-grad CS tuition because you're going for your masters/PhD instead of working? making poverty wages?(<$100k/yr)  TOO BAD!! being poor in the bay area is a crime and you will pay for your transgressions.
454	2	Do professors reply to cold emails?  I am currently an undergrad for cs and want to pursue my own research and need a professor who can be a senior author for me.     Do you think it will work if I email a lot of professors in the area with my topic, resume, and papers that I have published previously?  or will they not even read it?     What my friends have suggested is that, since I am joining a lab next semester, I should get really close with the ph.d and the professor that I am working with and bring it up after when the project is done.    What do you suggest?

108	2	UC Berkeley (L&S CS) vs. UCSD (CS Direct Admit + Regents Scholar)   Hello guys! So in the next month, I am going to have to decide whether to go to UC Berkeley or UC San Diego as a CS major. I am weighing the options and would love some of your input. **UC Berkeley:** ***Pros:*** * **Location** (Located near the heart of Silicon Valley) * **Cost** (27k in aid, will cost around 7-9k to attend per year) (Can pay out of pocket from job) * **Prestige and Brand** (Top public school for Comp Sci) * I also know some people who go there, so it will be easier to transition **Cons:** * \***Biggest Con\*** I will not get direct admission into the CS major, but will have to declare after attaining a 3.3 GPA in 3 lower div courses. **(Admitted as Intended CS) (There are numerous problems with the department that are well-known in the interwebs)** * **Location** \- Has a very high cost of living and is not the safest area * I also am **not** a huge fan of the high-stress culture that Berkeley has * **Housing -** It is doggone difficult to find housing in Berkeley, and it is expensive ‚Äã **UC San Diego:** **Pros:** * **Direct Admission into CS major** (Don't have to worry about CS declaration) * **Cost** (Regents Scholarship covered tuition, housing, and food - will only need around 2-3k to cover other expenses per year) * \*\*Regents Scholarship Benefits (\*\*Priority Enrollment, Access to Research During First Year, *4-Year Guaranteed Housing*) * **Prestige** (Although not cream of the crop like Berkeley, it is still one of the top CS schools in the country) **Cons:** * **Social life -** The school is notorious for not having a vibrant campus community, and students there have some misgivings about the university  * **Does not have as much of a brand name outside of California as Berkeley**

321	3	English transfer applicant looking for some insight  Hi, I'm currently at a CCC awaiting an admission decision and have been stressing heavily. I was wondering if anyone here could share some insight on their application process or history prior to getting into Berkeley. I ended up with a 3.57 after having dealt with some pretty severe mental health struggles early in my college career. I dropped in and out a few times about 6 years ago with 3 B‚Äôs and 2 C‚Äôs and a semester of W‚Äôs that I have since gotten Academic Renewal for. I sought help and returned to school in fall of 2020 and have maintained a 3.93 ever since with 12 A‚Äôs and 1 B. I am involved in community service, I write for my school's newsletter, and work a part time job. I fear that my mistakes in the past may end up hurting my chances of getting in. I feel like I wrote really good essays and explained my situation well, but I tend to be rather pessimistic about getting in to such a good school. Has anyone else had a similar story or any insight into a situation like this? Edit: Clarified grades.

43	2	Question - Advice for College Options(Update)    Hello Everyone, I hope you are doing well! I think I posted this question on this discussion before, but I want to receive people‚Äôs thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. So currently as a high school senior, I have narrowed my choices down to UC Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington‚Äôs CS program as a Direct Admit (my in-state school). Previously, everyone advised me to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents and Chancellor‚Äôs Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead.  I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? Overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make YOU choose one over the other? I am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!

359	2	Attention to Issue For Transfer Students  If you're a transfer student at UCB, I wanna bring to your attention an issue that I encountered so that you're aware, and so that you could check if you have that issue and know how to address it. I completed my IGETC before transferring, and as a result, I should NOT be required to complete the seven breadth requirements at UCB. However, when I checked my Academic Progress Report on CalCentral (under My Acedemics>Degree Requirements-near the bottom of the page>"View your degree requirements and progress" link), I saw that it indicated that I still need to complete a bunch of seven breadth requirements such as Foreign language and social sciences. I contacted my major advisor and an L&S advisor. They told me that there seems to be a mistake and that the way to fix this is to open a case with CalCentral. I did that, and a week later I got an email saying that they " apologize for the oversight." and that my IGETC certificate has been added to my record. This made me wonder how often this happens, and how many transfer students are not aware that there is something wrong and go on completing courses that they DO NOT need to complete. That's why I decided to make this post because I wouldn't want this to happen to other students. To open a case you go to the CalCentral support page [https://studentcentral.berkeley.edu/services-areas-support/](https://studentcentral.berkeley.edu/services-areas-support/) and at the bottom of the page click the Open Case button. Under Selected Area, there's nothing relevant to the IGETC issue, so I chose "Other", then I simply wrote that I have completed my IGETC at my community college before transferring but it is not being reflected on my Academic Progress Report on CalCentral. This might be a system glitch, so it might be very common, so I urge you to check your Academic Progress Report and if you're unsure if it's reflecting your IGETC or not, meet with an advisor (in person or online). I hope this helps. Good luck!

I got something like a 2100 on SAT which is like 31 on ACT (previously) which translates to about 1300 SAT and something in the ACT. Does it have to be a lot higher than this? I don't know what else I should need, probably some outside class activities, but that's what I have. Did you guys get a lot higher, and if so what did it look like? (your resumes)

159	2	Question about Intro CS Classes  I just got accepted into CS under L&S and am really excited! I'm just worried about the minimum 3.3 GPA requirement. I was wondering if all the prereqs (61A, 61B and 70) were graded on a bell curve or if the curves are predetermined. I'm worried about the competition among the rest of my class who are probably way more qualified than me. Would it be difficult to reach the 3.3 GPA considering I am only in Calc AB (I heard 70 is notoriously difficult)? I've heard conflicting reports on whether the professors were sympathetic of the GPA requirement and was wondering if I would have to be above average in my classes to major in CS. Sorry for the rambling I'm just a bit stressed right now and any help would be great. Thanks in advance! :)

643	2	Grader forgot to take off late marks   Hello. I submitted an assignment a few days late. According to the syllabus a certain percent is deducted each day. I noticed that no late marks were removed so I‚Äôm guessing the grader forgot to take them off. For the other assignments (yes I submitted them late as well ) the late marks were deducted. I did make a post about this a while back that I noticed 1 day wasn‚Äôt deducted for an assignment. Basically everyone advised to just leave it. This also happened for the next one, I think because there is a 1 day discrepancy between the grading platform and syllabus, so I guessed the graders are just going off the submission platform but I‚Äôm not sure which is right. Anyways, i noticed for this assignment that my mark was good but it‚Äôs because late marks weren‚Äôt taken off. I did request an extension for the current assignment in this class, although I‚Äôm still going to be late ü•≤ I didn‚Äôt request an extension for the assignment I am referring to. I‚Äôm thinking of just contacting the course admin to let them know, just wanted to get some other perspectives on this. Thank you.

334	3	Meeting people/social life at berkeley  This is pretty much just a vent.  I‚Äôm currently a senior at Berkeley studying architecture. Majoring in architecture is nice because of the tight knit community, but it also kinda has a downside. Because all of my classes are only at wurster and I see the same 50-100 people everyday that are in my class, it makes it difficult to branch out and meet jew people. I‚Äôm part of an athletic club on campus, but not many people are part of it (5-10 people). So while it‚Äôs nice to hang out with them, like architecture, it‚Äôs so few people (and the same ones everyday) that I feel like I‚Äôm not branching out.  I am honestly really happy/content with my ‚Äúcircle.‚Äù I am really, really close to my housemates, I have other acquaintance friends, and I‚Äôm never necessarily lonely (which I‚Äôm grateful about). But I feel like I‚Äôm not taking advantage of being at such a big campus with the opportunity to meet lots of people. I think a lot of this worry/stress was brought on by the fact that my boyfriend of 3ish years and I broke up recently. That happening made me think about how I feel like I was just so content/settled with my routine before that I didn‚Äôt force myself to branch out.  With that said, I was wondering if anyone has advice on where to meet people (not just romantically, just in general?) on campus? I honestly don‚Äôt know. I feel like clubs are such a commitment and I have class with the same people in my major and would like to meet people from other departments I saw a few other people on this sub post about themselves, so I‚Äôll do the same and if anyone is interested in hanging out I‚Äôm down to meet new people!  - I like to run, hike, and bike. If anyone wants to run together I‚Äôd be down! My pace is around 8 minutes on average  - I enjoy reading and talking about psychology  - indie music (can talk about different songs forever. I always like comparing and showing fellow indie lovers music I like and vise versa) - I like art and design  - cooking   - walking around pretty neighborhoods in Berkeley  - plants? Idk if this is an interest, more like I just have a lot  - making videos  - himym and Gilmore girls lol

I was invited to apply for the SEED scholarship since I got in for Civil Engineering and I was looking at the requirements for the scholarship when I read this as one of the requirements: "Average scores of 4 or better on all AP STEM exams taken" I have a 4 average on the four AP tests I have taken so far and I am taking two more AP tests at the end of the my senior year (AP Physics 1 and AP Calculus AB), but I received a 3 on the only STEM AP Test I have taken thus far (AP Statistics). I was wondering if I could receive any advice. Keep in mind I met the other four requirements they had listed, this is the only one I didn't.  Here is the link to the page on how to apply and the requirements if it helps: [https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/applying](https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/applying)

727	3	On Mental Health  Does anyone else feel like the conversations around mental health here are completely performative?  Of course everyone would say that they'd support someone who's suffering from issues, but when it really comes down to it, it really only means "I'll support people who are feeling a bit sad/stressed out, maybe only short-term depression".  Anyone with anything more severe than sadness because of a failed midterm is seen as a lost cause and the people willing to help are suddenly gone.  At most, they'll tell you to call the suicide prevention hotline (total meme) or see a therapist, both the bare minimum, least helpful suggestions.  What are your thoughts?

I've heard that the EECS department is apparently attempting to restrict a course that does not allow people who didn't declare CS L&S on their application to major in Comp Sci. As someone who got admitted to cal (dream school) today for Cog Sci, but had a change in plans and wants to do Computer Science, do I have a chance of ever being able to major in the area that interests me? I am new to this whole EECS dept. news thing so idk if its official yet, but I'm wondering if its still gonna be a possibility to declare CS, if not, do I have any options other than going to a different school event tho Cal has been my dream?

Just saw People Park and I swear, there were like 5 tents during the two years of Covid and now we have like 30+ tents that's insane. Where do all these people come from and where were they during lockdown? My top 3 hypothesis: 1. Homeless in Berkeley is an occupation that depends on the student population, just like any restaurants in Asian Ghetto. 2. Berkeley students be living in one of those 30+ tents. God, I swear there were less tents during this winter break alone. 3. Talk of a subsidy from the University last year attracted more people to People's Park hoping for a ride on the new 2M homeless subsidy from UC Berkeley.

270	3	This is why we need to restrict cs70 enrollment.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/to44qk/if\_i\_was\_admitted\_into\_ls\_and\_applied\_as\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/to44qk/if_i_was_admitted_into_ls_and_applied_as_a/) I bet at least two thirds of the "discoverers" are actually "cheaters". It's about time department do something about this. Since L&S declaration policy is virtually impossible to change, cs department should do what it should do. Unlike previous proposals, cs70 enrollment restriction will be enforced because it doesn't require approval from L&S. Since L&S won't do a thing, it'd be a waste of time for the department to waste another year waiting for the response from L&S about the admission policy Plus it doesn't solve the funding crisis right away. To solve the funding crisis, cs70 enrollment restriction should be enforced right NOW. Department won't have to worry about lawsuit since the door is still officially open to every L&S majors and more students will be admitted if there is an adequate funding. These kinds of lawsuits take a long time to win and I'd be really surprised if the department or the university lose. Forget about admission policy change. We are facing a serious overcrowding issue right now and L&S won't lift a finger. I am pretty certain they will decline the admission policy change proposal again.

945	2	Living On Off-Campus Housing Seems Impossible  Been researching to live off-campus apartments for a bit and learned that most places require applicants to pass background check, have a decent credit score and adequate proof of income.  So, for students who: * do not have co-signer/guarantor (parents, friends, etc) * do not have income 2 to 3 times monthly rent (of course, we are only students at this point in life) * do not have much money to show in bank account * plan to pay the rent largely using financial aid  it seems almost impossible to rent an apartment around Berkeley-Oakland-Richmond-East Bay area, right? For folks who lives off-campus (and not in BSC co-op) and are in the situation above, how do your landlords accept you?

141	4	I need a BREAK  I'm a second-semester junior transfer here, and it's been... a really shitty year for me. Stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t1iujy/got_attacked_on_bart/) and [then this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tbupl1/it_finally_happenedthe_stress_of_berkeley_sent_me/) has happened, along with a robbery back in Sept/October, a sexual assault in November (both on fucking Grinnell Path - really, just walk any other way at night), and a really trash situation with my peers and a GSI that's effectively pushing me out of my dept. I had to go back to the hospital again this week for more fun, stress-related shit, and it hit me that like,  this actually isn't normal. Dying for a degree isn't normal. Requiring substances every day just to function and numb the trauma isn't normal or sustainable. So, scholarship on the line or not, I think I really need to GTFO after this semester - at least for a while. I could dip and go to a different UC like UCR or Davis this Fall, or perhaps I could withdraw and apply for readmission to Berkeley later. I am having a really hard time determining what'll be best for me because I'll jeopardize my scholarships if I leave. I just know I'm not okay, and the hustle-till-you-die mentality isn't something I *actually* want to exemplify. I want to actually be alive when I get my degree. Is there anyone I can talk to about any of this? Any way I can take that break and not risk my scholarships? üò´ There is an appointment set and on the books with Path to Care, and I'm working on getting another appt with the Student Advocate Office to help me find additional resources.

793	2	On campus apartment or off campus?  Hey everyone! I know this has been asked before in previous years but I would love to get some new insight.   Does anybody have any suggestions as to whether an on-campus apartment or off-campus housing is better?  I‚Äôve heard from a lot of people that off-campus is the way to go, but just wondering why, as well as the major pros and cons to both.  I‚Äôm pretty new to hunting for housing, so any advice would be greatly appreciated! For context: I recently got an offer for a unit 2 apartment (I‚Äôm guessing Wada) for 14K.  I do like Unit 2‚Äôs proximity to campus, amongst other things, but im also worried it might be harder to meet other sophomores compared to off campus.    If I don‚Äôt get an offer the following year I‚Äôll also have to move out and house hunt then, which might be harder if I don‚Äôt know as many people in my building.  For off-campus, most of the options available now are a bit farther from campus than I would like, but they probably are a little cheaper (though it would probably come out to be pretty close to 14K since it would be around 1-1.2K for a 12-month lease).

I'm quite new to Intellij Idea but strictly followed the instruction of the course when installing the intellij idea. So I'm sure all the essential steps were completed in the installation. Here I've got no idea what 'build and run' section means in this 'edit configuration' window, neither I could understand, or possibly set the proper options in 3 columns shown and marked in Chart1 and Chart2.  Also, I printscreened my settings for this '[HelloNumbers.java](https://HelloNumbers.java)' work in Chart3 so to make sure all the steps were set correctly. ‚Äã Question: How should I set the options right underneath the title of 'Build and run' so to get the right outcome of the codes? For the possible solution, I've already tried to leave them all at original  status, 'module not specified' and 'HelloNumbers', but the outcome of running codes is reported error message as 'some particular files are missing'. The other possible solution I chosen 'openJDK' options in the first column left underneath the title of 'Build and run', but had no idea what to choose in the column next to it. There are too many choices and seems none related to this HelloNumbers file. In addition, right under the two horizontal columns, there is a long one shown in Chart2. I guess it might require a proper setting too, but have no idea what to choose from the list of options. ‚Äã So could anyone help me with itÔºü feeling so frustrated at such a beginning step of learning codes...... ‚Äã ‚Äã https://preview.redd.it/h6922vczqgn81.jpg?width=1845&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01c7adead8cd3449ed3b6f3da4a29271cd412039 ‚Äã https://preview.redd.it/8carpjgnvgn81.jpg?width=1843&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c35b6e9b8034c3149ca0f3c593737c455146b9f ‚Äã https://preview.redd.it/3nc4voo5xgn81.jpg?width=1843&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=654bc9d0820b6c9d45fd875b94d72c912c285daf

I'm a p quiet person, who is rarely at home, if there are other occupants in the apartment.  Additionally, if anybody else at Cal has been in a similar circumstance and has any advise for locating nontraditional housing, please let a girl know!! Pm me about anything. Thank you! :D

I'm currently living on campus (but there's like a month left in the school year) and I'm not on any aid so I'm assuming that there would be little impact on either of these things. could someone tell me what exactly would happen if I drop to part time and, if the outcome would be THAT bad, is there any way to  supplement this?

I have been debating for quite some time on using our late drops this sem to drop some of my courses. I know that typically a regular late drop leaves a W on your transcript, but does anyone know if the same applies to a DSP signed late drop? Like is there any indication on our transcript that classes were dropped due to extenuating circumstances or do we just get a W like everyone else?
464	2	What classes did you guys take with cs 70?  I want to be able to take a class that doesn't take too much time and on the easier end. I was planning to do data 8 (i have cs61a/b experience), cs 70 and looking for another class.
344	2	Declaring math to circumvent cs70 enrollment issue is not a good idea unless you're serious about math  Upper div math classes are completely different (and much harder)from lower div math classes. Unless you're serious about math, just declare data science. I am pretty certain the CS department won't be able to stop using math 55 in lieu of cs70 for various reasons but still it is not a loophole or a backdoor. More like a trap. If you still wanna do math to do CS, go look at baby rudin book. Unless you're super comfortable with those kinds of books, don't do math just for CS. You've been warned

(11-12months, I am from Europe and moving to Berkley for Fulbright in August)  I got a Fulbright scholarship for a project at the Innovative genomics institute so I will spent about 11-12 months in Berkley . I found out that it is possible to rent an airbnb long term and many owners there are fine with having me for the whole 11-12 month period. I found decent 1br appartments for 2000-2600$ a month in South Berkley or El cerrito. I need a parking place so center of Berkley is im afraid not an option. Do you think it is a good idea to just go for it? I am quite afraid that I wont get an appartment the usual way as I wont be there for a whole year and also I am now in Europe and cannot go for viewings.  Also, my monthly budget is 4000$ for everything. Is it possible to live decently with 1400-2000$ a month after paying rent?  Thank you so much!

Some middle eastern man came up to me and asked me when the bus was coming, so I pulled up the app to let him know. When I told him, he shook my hand and thanked me, then continued to hold and rub my hand with his hands as he asked me personal questions like where I was from and how long I‚Äôve lived in America. While he was talking, he slipped his hand up my sleeve and rubbed my wrist, presumably to feel for a watch. Luckily, I wear my watch on my left hand, so he didn‚Äôt feel anything. As soon as the bus arrived, he let go of me and scowled and motioned for me to get on the bus. He didn‚Äôt even get on. Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid, but this guy gave me the creeps either way for how long he was there rubbing my hand. If a man with gaps in his bottom teeth asks you when the bus is coming, just tell him you‚Äôre not sure. TL;DR: Some guy came and asked me when the bus was coming, then kept rubbing my hand and wrist when he shook my hand and thanked me.

400	3	Plea to EECS/L&S CS-Intended  I understand that many of you have detailed plans for the future ‚Äî ones that may require taking certain classes in advance to free up space for later, or perhaps open up opportunities for research or so forth. Despite this, I hope to make a selfish but humble request (directed to any EECS majors or those who applied to Berkeley as L&S CS-intended): please drop CS70 Summer if you can. As many of you are aware, the CS department is planning to restrict enrollment into 70 for any non-EECS/originally CS-intended students, a backdoor effort to reduce the size of the CS major and relieve the funding crisis of the department. However, as a result, hundreds of students (many of whom discovered a passion for CS through Berkeley, and finally obtained resources to pursue it) like myself LOSE the chance to even prove themselves and have a shot at the major. I understand my request may sound frustrating; but please know, if I had another choice, I would take it. And while I‚Äôm being stripped of that choice, many of you still have it. So if it won‚Äôt drastically shift your life plans (as this policy change is affecting mine and many others), please do consider my humble plea. (Also please no hate, Ik its not my place to ask this, I‚Äôm just really stressed out, so just ignore this if you must)

10	4	I‚Äôve taken a medical leave of absence due to mental health issues  Long story short, I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I could disappear and not be noticed for at least several months. I‚Äôve posted in this subreddit before, talking about how I‚Äôm extremely isolated and have not a single friend or even acquaintances, and I‚Äôm estranged from my family. I could not handle the loneliness and my depression has led me to the ER for suicidal ideation, where I stayed in a psychiatric unit for a week and was discharged on the premise that I would be moving on to another residential treatment facility.  In early March, while trying to catch up with classes, I went to main stacks but felt so much shame and embarrassment for my situation and I just fucking cried and went back to my apartment. I probably deserve this suffering since I‚Äôve hurt people in the past and I haven‚Äôt changed at all.  UC Berkeley is literally the only thing giving me any kind of place in the world, but I can‚Äôt handle it. I‚Äôve dug myself too deep into a hole, and no person would really want to be around someone in as deep as I am, and I feel too ashamed and and struggle with trust too much to reach out to anyone. I can‚Äôt utter a word without clearly being an extreme mess and scaring people away. I‚Äôm stuck. In addition to this my depression is taking away my capacity to even hold a basic conversation and the very thing that I was accepted into UC Berkeley to do: to THINK and LEARN. I am so stupid right now it‚Äôs ridiculous.  Having withdrawn has also made things worse in some ways, since I have very little drive to occupy myself with something, when before I was very occupied with classes, and it‚Äôs making me sink into my depression even more. Additionally, I can barely fend for myself and I‚Äôm being tossed around by this residential facility. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be admitted or if I‚Äôll even be able to afford it, and I am scared because I can see myself getting worse than I was when I went to the ER. I‚Äôm just waiting for a response from them even though I‚Äôve contacted them many times. I can‚Äôt help but acknowledge that everything that is going wrong is really my fault and I‚Äôve just been making things a lot worse for myself as time goes by.  Another issue withdrawal has brought is being displaced for the summer, since I‚Äôm dependent on financial aid for housing. In addition to intensive therapy (20 hours/week) I have to find a job and a place to live.  I write this not to ask for someone to talk to but to just maybe show other students that the student body isn‚Äôt as intimidating as one might think. And maybe to see if anyone can help with the summer job/housing part. I also write this to vent, and honestly probably also for attention, though I don‚Äôt feel bad for reaching so low. I do feel slightly less stressed after writing this. The world isn‚Äôt as romantic as our dreams were when we first stepped foot on this campus, but for some reason that feels like a good thing.

597	2	I totally missed the FAFSA deadline, what do I do?  I was sure it was due in June (Federal deadline) but the state deadline is March 1. I didn‚Äôt get a single email from the financial aid office about FAFSA? What can I do? I have EFC 0 and receive Cal Grant, but can I still get Federal grants? Edit: I actually submitted it late last year right after it opened so im all set for 2022-2023 üòé. Keeping thread open for people who did miss the deadline‚Ä¶
963	1	Midterm Times  Why the actual hell are professors allowed to make their midterms at completely different times than their classes?? The class is 4-6 MW and the midterms are both 6-8 T.

617	3	Take a COVID Test Before You Leave for Spring Break!  If you are planning on traveling for spring break (March 21 - 25, 2022), we strongly recommend the following:  1. If you plan to travel, take a [COVID-19 PCR test](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing) to make sure you are not at risk of spreading the virus to anyone you visit. **We recommend taking the test 3-5 days before your day of departure and awaiting a negative test result before you travel.** Make an appointment ahead of time via eTang. 2. Please note that if you need testing documentation for your travel plans, the UHS testing site cannot guarantee turnaround times for test results, so you may need to seek a rapid PCR test at a community site. As a reminder, anyone who tests at UHS can get a lab results report that can be used for travel directly from your eTang portal (under Lab Results, click View Report). 3. **Three days after you return to campus**, we strongly recommend you get a UHS COVID-19 PCR test on campus. You can make an appointment ahead of time via eTang. 4. Rapid antigen tests can also be helpful when traveling, with [caveats](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/pcr-vs-rapid-antigen-test). If you choose to take rapid tests, we still recommend you schedule your UHS PCR test. Rapid antigen tests can be purchased at the UHS pharmacy for $7. Rapid antigen tests are now eligible for reimbursement through health insurance (including[ SHIP Insurance](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/news/ship-insurance-now-covers-home-covid-testing-kits)).  5. **Students living in campus housing should check their bmail for more specific instructions**.   For those traveling, you should also check the current COVID-19 situation at your destination, both [domestically](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html) and [internationally](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html). Make sure you understand and follow all state, tribal, local, and territorial travel restrictions, including face-covering requirements, proof of vaccination, testing, or any quarantine requirements. Also, mass transit, like airlines, still requires face coverings while traveling. And as always if you are sick, stay home and do not travel. Please stay safe, healthy, and have fun!

118	2	FPF program  I got waitlisted for admission this year and saw that sometimes they offer admission off the waitlist by offering a spot in the FPF program. i was wondering if anyone who did that felt like they missed out on the cal experience or if it was harder to make friends and stuff like that? overall is it worth it?
165	2	Transferring to UPenn Wharton or UCB Haas  Hi r/berkeley I'm currently a 19 y/o freshman at a California community college with a 4.0 GPA and extensive honors coursework. I am very interested in transferring to Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania or Haas at UCB due to their credibility as a high-ranked business programs and networking opportunities. As a freshman, Wharton's admission requirements require more immediate attention than those of UC Berkeley's. I have completed all of the Wharton's course requirements this semester, including Econ 1 & 2 and Calc 1. The UPenn admissions website states as a requirement; >"If you‚Äôre interested in the Wharton School, you must apply to transfer¬†after your first-year¬†to enter for your sophomore year. There are no¬†spaces available for entering juniors. **Please note that credit equivalency will be determined after you are admitted**." Nevertheless, I was unable to meet the March 15 application deadline for Fall 2022 partly due to a family emergency, as well as my own intention to strengthen my academic/extracurricular profile prior to applying. Is there any way that I can maintain my freshman standing and apply in the upcoming Fall 2023 cycle by taking a gap year to focus on extracurriculars, or completing non-transferrable courses at my community college for sophomore year? If there are no remaining possibilities to apply to Wharton as an undergrad, should I focus on transferring to Haas at UC Berkeley (which prefers community college students) and then potentially attending Wharton as an MBA student? Are MBA students at a disadvantage for networking/other opportunities? Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

245	2	Advantages of Data Science Major  I saw many posts stressing over the EECS department funding crisis, and despite a viable route, many people seem to be on the fence to declare data science instead, so I wanna lighten up the mood a bit and genuinely share my experience as a data science major student and how I went from on the fence too to really appreciate it. I think the biggest point is that data science has domain emphasis. while you can argue that computer science can be interdisciplinary too, data science actually have domain emphasis as their major requirements. Every field needs data and if you have a field ur particularly interested in, but still want a computer science/data science education, data science is the way to go! For someone like me who really wanted to be an artist but my parents are strongly against it, when I saw they have a domain emphasis of data art and humanities, I know data science is a middle ground I can escape to safely.  What‚Äôs more, i received a lot of help from the data science department as a DSP student. I honestly feel like data science program is just more inclusive and a lot more chill. And Data science department has more funding (no pun intended), they have discovery research program where I was matched with a program and opened the door for my research at URAP too, and guess what, my URAP subject is art lol üòÇ and bc of my data science background, I feel useful even in a non-STEM environment. Ofc I could be wrong, feel free to point that out too, also feel free to add more points.  Also, have a good spring break and hope y‚Äôall have good grades in the upcoming midterms haha.

I am interested in ux/ui design or pm and was interested in double majoring in both of those majors. Are there any classes that are useful for that career path that I should take in cog sci? Recommend classes that also satisfy requirements for both majors as well. How is the cog sci major?
