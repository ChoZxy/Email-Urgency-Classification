802	0	I’ve since heard that a strong reaction to the first dose is common in people who have had Covid before, which I am 99% sure I have, whereas those who haven’t had it before have it worse with their second dose. So hopefully we’ll have an easier time with the second dose!
793	0	I have pain on my hips too and it more when I move around that I feel everything. I can't walk for long too . Yeah I can't  afford not to work either stay persistent there has to be answers  im sorry your going  through this.  I'm sure there's so many people out there going through this Nightmare.
859	-2	You’re definitively right. You should stay home so you don’t infect people. Mask up. Get the jab that doesn’t protect you from covid. You have choices. Use them. It’s still a democracy last time I checked.
612	0	You’re 4 welcome ;)
47	-1	You got an experimental vaccine 💉 good luck 👍🏼
883	0	Yes. Stiff neck, neck pain, ear and throat pain started almost 24 days after 1st jab
284	0	That's weird.   Is Canada doing the everyone gets just one shot for now plan?
469	0	How are you feeling now? Any improvement? So scary to get it so long after.
977	0	How are you feeling now? Hopefully back to normal!
660	0	I just got my first dose 2days ago, and didn’t feel the flu like symptoms till mid next day. Body chills, soreness, low grade fever, tiredness. Blah!! Hate feeling sick. I wasn’t expecting to feel this in the first shot, def not looking forward to my 2nd. :/
578	0	And?  Did you have any side effects?
303	0	Day 11 now and Still rough! The fatigue is kicking my arse. Keep feeling like the aching has eased off and then I'll do something as simple as do a load of washing or go to the shop at the end of my road and bam wiped out >.<  Appetite seems to slowly be coming back at least!  I've been sleeping so much it's crazy. Hope you're feeling alright if you've been suffering!
828	0	The vacc centre I went to said it was not a problem, just to drink in moderation, as always!
274	0	EAU is authorized not FDA approval for safety or efficacy. It’s not the same
84	0	What will it take to move Pfizer, should I short it like the big guys?
580	0	Same here! 31YO healthy female
230	0	I got my vaccine yesterday it was Pfizer. My arm is sore. I got the chills last night but feel good right now. Feel like going to Buffalo Wild Wings and partying.
805	0	My husband got his first Pfizer shot, his arm was sore for 24 hours, then completely fine. 18 days later his arm suddenly became extremely sore, and has continued to be sore for 3 days so far.  There's no physical sign of a blood clot, skin isn't warm to the touch. He now feels run down and tired. I've heard of covid arm, but there's no rash, or swelling. I'm concerned... He doesn't want to go to the doctors for fear of catching covid from someone (our area is a hot spot right now).   Has anyone else experienced this?
585	0	18/F  I got it about a week ago (the first dose) i had a fever the day after , but only for a day. I regularly  run/ workout . So far I didin't have much energy to do these activities unfortunately. I hope I will be able o get back fully because so far even a light walk tires me out. Has anyone my aged experienced something similar?
714	0	is anybody aware that the mild aches, fatigue, sore throat are all because of Myocarditis?
740	0	I’m starting to think maybe I had covid but was asymptotic. Second shot is this coming Monday. I’ll be sure to update!
911	-1	Yes i have heard of some getting this. Do not get 2nd shot, trust your body
118	-2	Why take something that is not fda approved for safety or efficacy?!?!!
350	-1	I have mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Got first dose of Pfizer. I’m on day 3, and have had a similar experience to your first 3 days. I’m not nauseous today but dizzy and have random pains that appear throughout my body and then disappear. On day 1 I also developed a rash on my neck and had a tingly left arm (the one that didn’t get the shot). I’m going to my cardiologist on Thursday and I can update this post if they find anything.  I agree the lack of information is sincerely frustrating. I’d like to know if it’s safe for me to get a second shot give the above, but can’t find any information except for the common symptoms which I don’t have.
719	0	I got my first dose 10 hours ago.  Within the first 10 minutes, my blood pressure shot up to 160/100, accompanied by a dull and pulsating headache graded 2/10, and rotatory dizziness. For the record, my normal BP range is from 90/60 to 110/70. But this normalized back to 110/70 within the first hour post-vaccination.   So far, my only observed side effects are soreness on the inoculated arm. Intermittent pruritus on my extremities may or may not be associated with the vaccine.  Context: Upper range of normal BMI 30/F with several known environmental, food, and medication allergies; bronchial asthma; and PCOS.
151	1	I got mine today about three and a half hours ago. On my drive home I started feeling really tired. As soon as I got home I took a nap and actually just woke up and decided to see if fatigue and exhaustion/nausea was a common symptom. Thanks for this thread for putting my mind at ease
390	2	Wow, not sure I'm glad I came to this sub.  I had my first shot yesterday, I really have had no side effects.  About 45 minutes after I did have that feeling like a headache was going to start but it went away as quick as it came on.  I had heard some people were complaining about headaches...  My arm isn't sore, nothing.  While I am not downplaying anyone's personal experiences remember people are more apt to post complaints than they will positive experiences - it's just human nature. Don't let others feedback give your brain an opportunity to play tricks on you. We are all subject to subliminal messaging - it's everywhere these days!  I'm hoping everyone's side effects go away quickly and remember they can't be worse than being on a respirator or worse, 6 feet under.  Be glass is half full, not empty.  Positivity helps. Remember there are people in other countries that don't even have the opportunity to get vaccinated yet.  My stress levels have declined considerably and I'm looking forward to the 2nd shot and being able to get out of solitary confinement!
75	0	I received my second shot yesterday. After the first dose, I felt a little light headed about an hour later. Followed by a headache for roughly 2 hours. I ate some food and napped for 30 min and felt fine. My arm was sore for about 1.5 days. It felt like someone punched me really hard. No bruising or swelling though.   The second shot has been hard. The first day, my arm was sore, but not that bad. Had the chills in the evening, but they went away. I slept okay. Today, I’ve felt feverish and my body has been achy all day. I’ve felt lethargic and exhausted. Even while resting, I can’t get comfortable.
417	0	How are you feeling now? Compared to before the vaccine?
41	0	Soreness was gone by Friday. I got a tiny bit sleepy Friday afternoon and just a little bit of an upset stomach but nothing major at all. I’m scheduled to get the second dose Friday the 26th in the morning. I was able to make a Friday appt for the second shot because my primary physician warned me that most likely I’ll have some side effects from the second one. If that happens I’ll have the weekend to rest. Will report back after I get the second one.
725	0	Yes had the same for like 3 days. It was a medicated metallic sensation like it came from a lab...
685	0	Wife hospitalized with afib after second dose. Any one else experience this?
801	-1	Have you heard the term "floxed"? I stumbled upon it whilst deep in the rabbit hole searching for my diagnosis. It's about certain drugs that have "crippling" long term effects, and I know they are 2 totally different pharmaceuticals, but it feels like if one of these,(antibiotics),could cause such chaos in the system, why couldn't the (vaccine) one we know so little about?
594	0	How are all of you doing now? u/Santa987 u/PirateKIng u/Hangrycouchpotato u/Yuzhrrri  I had mine about 15 minutes ago and my heartbeat doesn't feel as strong as normal, more faint... my salivary glands are also a lot less active than normal (my mouth feels waaay drier than normal) but I'm still considering the second one nonetheless
669	0	Update
501	0	Kids are annoying
619	0	Immediately after 1st dose I was fine and kind of high and without apetite, my arm hurted for a day and a half. It was four days ago, today my throat is sore, I have nausea, chills, slight fever, no apetite, brain fog and I feel exhausted.
657	0	I got the Pfizer jab on the Monday 17th May and after 5mins had a headache and sinus pain. That evening my arm started to hurt and by the next day was quite sore and I also had a red circle and slight lump. It's now Friday 21st and my arm is nearly back to normal and the red circle is faded and almost completely gone. I still have sinus pain and slight head ache.
299	0	How are you doing? Are you feeling better?
766	0	Got mine 2 days ago and yesterday I had whole body muscle issues like they were tired out easily.  Today I've had diarrhea which I'm trying to find out if anyone else has?? And I feel abit crap.  My arm still has a swollen red lump on it but it barely hurts anymore and I can lift my arm up straight again whereas 24hrs after having the jab I couldn't.
349	-1	That's all frightening, I hope you're alright.  I had my first dose today and asked the nurse if it's alright to work out.  She said yes, it's recommended.  I noticed while I was on the elliptical my heart rate was 166.  It's usually 139.  I slowed down and then cut my work out short.  I feel ok now except for a headache and ears ringing.  I'm not 100% down with introducing mRNA, t-cell protein, lipids etc etc into my body.  It was my resolution to dueling fears.  Covid-19 vs Phizer vaccine.  I hope I made the right choice, it's something I can't undo.  I wish you the best!
347	0	Interesting and good questions.  I never got tested (because tests weren't available) but I do think I might have had covid early last year.  I tried to give blood before my 1st shot to check for antibodies but they weren't doing it anymore so I guess I'll never know for sure.  I am hoping I will feel better as many long haulers are describing after I get over my second shot. I've basically been in solitary confinement for a year out of fear of getting infected because I have a few co-morbidities. I haven't even been to the doc over a year.  My HMO got fined several times by the state for not complying to covid protocols so it was the last place I was going. I've made an apt for 2 weeks after my next shot for a checkup.
377	0	Thank you.
779	0	You should be totally fine. Just don’t miss that appointment! If possible, you may want to let them know that they can call you any time after the 3 week mark if they have extra doses on any given day and need to use them up so they don’t go to waste. My son was due for his 2nd on a Thursday afternoon but I got a call from the pharmacy Wednesday evening right before closing and they asked if we could come immediately to use an extra dose that would otherwise expire because someone missed their appt that day.
741	1	No it wasn't. There were no temperature changes and I said flu-like, which implied joint pains etc, sorry if that was not clear enough. And how can it be rhinitis if nose not runny?  Anyway, it got better slowly and now is gone. Definitely the vaccination. Still grateful I got it.
810	0	A month after dose 2, I'm still dizzy. It has come and gone, but really hasn't gone and this straight up sucks. I wish I woods have just had the one dose, but many purple say they've been suffering even after one post.   It's manageable but not really. Dizziness and brain fog mixed with the Anxiety it causes, it's hard to do anything.   This sucks man.
923	0	So good to hear. I am having my second dose on Friday and I am nervous for any side effects!
275	0	No, you need to read the history. Thalidomide was not approved in the US, and the FDA avoided thousands of malformations.  From Wikipedia:  "The official in charge of the FDA review, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time."  Kelsey is held up inside the FDA as a saint.  There are portraits of her.
960	0	Got my first jab, besides a sore arm like most have, 2 days after my vaccin I got a swollen lymph node on the side I got vaccinated and it's still there nnow 7 days later.
899	0	I don't get why they don't aspirate!? They should, and I don't need to be qualified to say this. I want to he 100% sure no vein is being hit, big or small.  But they refuse to do this (aspirate) without any reason (its protocol doesn't count as a reason)
171	1	I’m sure a lot less than .1% of our population has died from the vaccine tho
174	0	That’s interesting. I didn’t have any issues after the first dose, but will see what happens after my second dose on Wednesday.
137	1	My first dose hit me harder than expected. Mind you, I'm 54 and have lung disease. I received it on Friday evening (Thank you UTSW!). Woke up Saturday morning with chills. This progressed into a little shortness of breath. My oxygen sats were in the high 80's to low 90's. I was honestly a little concerned. Pretty much slept all day Saturday and most of Sunday. Monday I was a little fatigued and had a foggy brain. By Tuesday I was right as rain! I see this as a positive response to the vaccine by my body. I'm a little apprehensive about the second dose but not overly concerned.
87	0	All of this is incorrect and this person does not know what they are talking about. Speak to Your doctor if you have concerns about the vaccine. Ignore individual who claims to be an expert because they searched some debunked Facebook posts
42	0	Let us know what they say! I had the same and they couldn’t find anything wrong.
67	0	Good!
241	0	Dizziness is still there but not as bad.
546	0	Same!
969	0	We don't have the information to know whether they recovered at home because basic testing wasn't available until about a year ago. There was also  lack of testing in general until about 9 months ago.   I personally as a 33 year old experienced flu like symptoms. I wouldn't have gone near my older parents or outside. Imagine just deciding it's fine cos you think you have it and killing people. Walk past old lady x 'POW', walk past MS person y 'ZAP',  hug extremely asthmatic  friend z 'WHACK!''.   All dead cos I didn't want to consider the global pandemic worth pandering to. My feeling on not being careful and seeing my parents is that if I wasn't then I effectively had a little gun for those outside my own health and age range  and went 'dead" 'dead'  'dead'  Not cos they did a bad thing but because I was so precious I put them.at risk
548	0	Maybe her grandma died, not because of the vaccine, but because she was just old 🤷‍♀️you can’t just make assumptions like that
784	0	Hey, did your breathing improve? I'm 9 days out from my first shot and have been suffering from shortness of breath for 8 of those days. Did you get the second dose?
561	0	I am feeling much better. You?
987	0	I find it funny you never address any of my points but obviously...  Sweetie let me explain, the global economy was impacted. Prior to that the previous president refused to acknowledge  that there was an issue until forced to do so. Lots of People have died, mainly those who were old or in places where these things were assumed to be dirty slum based.  Except  people outside of the dirty slums also died. A lot of them.   I never advocated the wtf amefican system of healthcare, that shit is fucked.  But you guys are 'merica right. So you can't pay less in taxes to ensure everyone gets healthcare. Sweetie, read my posts properly. You're very sweet.
99	0	36 Male here just got my shot this afternoon so far I feel fine no symptoms or soreness yet . But thought I’d share since a lot of posts are about symptoms and thought I’d balance out first few hours reactions.
971	0	I went to the ER too with the palpitations after my 2nd dose! Also had waves of numbness/pins and needles. It was so scary and anxiety inducing but all tests came back clear except for low potassium. Slowly feeling better now 2 weeks later, I believe my potent immune system made the side effects more severe. I think I was able to tell the difference between the side effect palpitations and my anxiety palpitations (30/F/active/healthy/general anxiety but not diagnosed). Hope you're feeling better!
219	0	Got my first dose at 26 weeks pregnant and second dose today at 29 weeks.   First dose I just had a sore arm (lasted less than 24 hours), mild headache that night and was a little more tired.    I had the second dose about 7 hours ago. So far my arm is sore, I’m definitely fatigued, and I’m starting to feel a little weak/achy. Nothing major. No fever so far either. My munchkin is kicking away still as well.
440	0	27M healthy. Got my first dose on Sunday 4pm. Didn’t hurt felt fine, went on a bike ride when I got home. 10pm getting ready for bed came down with an aggressive stuffy nose, went through a good amount of tissues. Passed out, woke up at 6am lifeless, head pounding and strong fatigue. Had to take the day off work due to to fact that I couldn’t think straight and had a fever of 102 and chill. Fever lasted about 8 hours and getting out of bed was a chore. It was a tough day, unlike anything ive ever experienced  Next day I felt 65%, enough to get out of bed and work but was still getting chills and fever.   Day 3 85%. Mild headaches throughout the day but had enough sitting around and walked and played 9 holes of golf. Played amazing.. maybe it’s the shot.   Day 4 - woke up with a headache still feeling a little fatigue and now have a mild dry cough. Mind is racing. Do I have Covid?  Anyone experience anything similar? Should I get tested or is this just my body fighting back?   Ts & Ps
348	-1	are u still going to skip your second dose? also might sound stupid. but do you know what happens if you skip the second dose? i got my first dose of pfizer 2 days ago but honestly been regretting it and wanting to skip the second. i have no side effects besides shoulder soreness and headache. but reading so many things has gotten me worried
139	0	Excuse me, last I checked this Reddit was about taking the Pfizer vaccine. You seem to be caught up on profit margins and lawsuits. If you want to rant about the uninsured or big tobacco or the opioid crisis, why not find a Reddit page for that, I am sure there are plenty on here. My posts are about observations of this vaccine not the aforementioned topics you are discussing. Here is a question to you: Have you taken the vaccine yet, why or why not?
577	0	I experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea as well but on my second dose. Also brain fog, and extreme tiredness. I do not believe I ever got Covid so maybe that’s why? Hope you’re feeling better!
336	0	Hi.  I assume that was your first dose? I'm curious as to know how did go on your second dose?
941	0	I received my second vaccine last Saturday ( the 26th). I have had extreme nausea, exhaustion and mild headache for 5 days. It's so discouraging to feel this way. I thought it would last two days, tops.
161	0	Then don't get it...
749	0	Hey! How are you feeling now?
289	0	But fr I'm all good now
412	0	How are you feeling now? I am in a similar position. Did it get better?
627	0	I'm planning to get my first dose tomorrow. Hope it doesn't react too bad since I already get tired very easily and I have past history of occasional mild bronchitis.
334	0	You may have inflammation in your ears due to the vaccine. I would try reducing inflammation naturally, if that doesn't help see a doctor about getting meds for inflammation. I get that when my allergies kick up (inflammation). I take Claritin and after a couple days it goes away.
891	0	Please try magnesium, b and d vitamin and ginko biloba supplements. Also real mineral water. Those things, especially the last teo were lifesavers for me
909	-1	I (F31) got my first vaccine on June 1. That night I had chills and really bad anxiety that prevented me to fall asleep. Then it was just arm soreness for 2 days. I received my second shot on July 13 (this Tuesday). I experienced strange pressure in my head and again, anxiety that kept me up until 2am. Next day, my arm was sore but I felt great. Thursday I woke up at 4am with vertigo. It was so intense I thought I was gonna throw up or faint. I was covered in sweat...it got a little better but I still have vertigo and it's Friday now. Whenever I lay down or lower or turn my head the world starts spinning around me. I've never experienced anything like it. Anyone else had a similar experience?  EDIT: Just to update - vertigo stopped on Tuesday so exactly a week after getting the shot. I had these strange pressure or pain in my chest every now and then for next couple of days but could be also connected to my bad posture. Today is July 29 and I'm feeling great but if there's a third shot, I don't think I'm gonna get it. Take care you guys!
824	0	This makes me wonder about the AC separation I have in my left shoulder. I probably should have it checked again. I'm very ignorant about injuries, and continuing to work physically, and play with my kids like I'm 20, although I'm almost 41. Thank you for sharing this.
926	1	Just to note, many people are having their symptoms dismissed as stress and anxiety. This certainly induces anxiety, for sure. But people know their bodies so if somebody says it was the vaccine, it's because they know.   Apparently this is similar to long haul but brought on by the vaccine, which apparently is not as bad as being brought on by the virus, but sucks nonetheless.
979	0	They asked me a few questions but that's about it. I will do though. They said when I was there to make sure I mention it next time & they'll put me in one of the privacy rooms out the way with a bed.
682	0	I was reading your past comments, and see that you still have headaches. I'm on day 10 post 2nd moderna vaccine, and I'm getting daily headaches as well. They seem to start later in the day, and set on bad by evening. Before this vaccine, I hardly ever got headaches. They start near my neck shoulder, and radiant to the right side of my head. Kinda scared since u seem to have gotten the shots 3 months ago.
107	-1	I got my first dose on Feb 3rd , and right after I didn't feel right, I got dizzy and just felt weird. It only got worse after that, that night I had hot flashes that lasted a couple days along with severe insomnia, which I'm still suffering from right now, after a few days with no sleep I started having hallucinations and by the 4th night my body just was too tired that I passed out but had horrendous super vivid nightmares, this cycle has been repeating itself till this day, then early last week I started feeling just unwell like something was seriously wrong with me, that feeling hasn't gone away yet but it's lessened the past day or so... Also last week I got the worst migraine of my life, it lasted two whole days, with NOTHING being able to quell it, idk if this was bc of the vaccine, I usually get 4 or 5 migraines a year and two Tylenol always takes it away quickly so idk, what do you guys think?... also I got nauseous the day after the vaccine but not too bad but that got worse, it wasn't until the 7th or 8th that my nausea started affecting my diet, on the 10th I got so nauseous I couldn't stomach anything at all, I had to force feed myself but with just a little bit a food, my stomach therefore, I assume, started hurting a lot... Since then (AND I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS/IS EXPERIENCING THIS) my nausea comes and goes every day, for hours I'll be so sick but then I'll feel fine for a few hours and then it comes back full force. My symptoms really didn't start until several days after my first dose and just got progressively worse. I honestly thought I had or might have something serious going on, I just haven't heard of anyone having so many bad reactions to it for so long. Has/is anyone felt similar? If so it would really help ease my mind if you lmk so I know I'm not just stuck in bed bc of the vaccine or if I really need to go to the ER. If this is normal there's no way I can handle the second dose, no way in hell.
505	-1	I received the Pfizer first dose on Wednesday May 12. I had an immediately strong immune response and was very dizzy and tired. By Thursday evening my hands started to go numb and that soon spread to my forearms, legs, face and head.  I was hospitalized with various tests performed but the doctor can’t find any other reason except “must be side effects”  I’ve been home for 2 days and the symptoms have been steadily improving each day.   Needless to say I have some real hesitation about getting a second dose. Especially if no one can tell me what is going on.
199	0	Got first dose yesterday afternoon in Massachusetts.    Felt fine after shot but 3-4 hours later my arm started to feel sore. As the night progressed it got more sore, my arm felt "dead" in which could not lift it higher than a keyboard sitting position. I also felt more and more exhausted as the soreness increased.   Sleeping was hard because it was too uncomfortable to sleep on either side. Woke up this morning still sore, but I can feel it getting better as I go through my morning.   A little nauseated this morning, but it's not uncommon for me to have morning nausea so I doubt it's directly related.
967	0	That makes sense! I am a bit worried now too, to take the second shot. I’m scared that after the second one it might be even worse. My grandma fainted after her second shot, so I should not be surprised at my immune reaction
978	0	Is anyone experiencing muscle twitching and tingling around the body?
588	0	Any update? Im getting my vaccine today
832	0	I’m a 36yo female, very active, overall healthy  I had covid in December- horrible headache and couldn’t get out of bed for a week but no hospitalization. I sucked wind during the next month working out- endurance was shot, but was back to normal after 6 weeks.  I just got my second dose of Pfizer (2 weeks late…but better late than never is what I read…)  After my first dose in June, I didn’t have any side effects except slight soreness in my arm.  However, after receiving the second dose at approx 1pm, I now feel fatigued and a bit dizzy at 3pm TBH this whole thread freaked me out a bit with everyone’s side effects, hopefully mine will be mild. I’m so sorry for those of you who have been dealing with weeks of fatigue, aches and nausea!  I’m interested to know how many of you with prolonged side effects have ever had covid.
102	0	I did notice the fatigue the most at the gym because I am going on a very regular base. I did experience headaches and here and there dizziness as well, today is day 10 and I feel better, yet tired...unsure whether more tired than usual or just tired in general...
356	0	2nd shot on Monday.  Felt fine Monday, but Tuesday developed a slight headache.  Some light dizziness and fatigue.  Went to bed early and felt 💯in the morning 👍
206	1	1. Why would families in Norway sue if vaccines are FDA approved? They are in Norway.  2. Why would you sue anybody for adverse side effects or allergic reactions?  I am allergic to the sun.  Am I suppose to sue somebody for my allergies?  3.  Why do you care if people choose to vaccinate or not?  It doesn't effect you in any way if a person chooses to receive a vaccine.
388	0	First dose 3/15 at 3:00-  nothing but sore shoulder at injection site    Second dose 4/5 at 3:00- nothing but sore shoulder at injection site as of 24 hours since second dose was given. Will update with any changes. Haven’t counted my chickens yet
704	0	I got the second shot in April and other than some soreness where I got the shot, I was fine.  Until today.  Today, I woke up after taking a brief nap with a headache, aches and chills like you can’t imagine. My temperature, at the moment, is 97.5 and I just popped two ibuprofen. I have a COVID-19 test scheduled for tomorrow and I’ll let you know what the results.   BTW: I tested positive for Covid (minor aches, headaches) in Jan, three months before I got the first shot.
522	0	I was feeling lasting fatigue and it's almost time for my 2nd shot, so thank you for coming back and updating, it's encouraging!
638	0	Hey, just wondering if your symptoms went away? I have dizziness, migraines, and feeling off balance.
176	1	My husband (33/m) and I (30/f) received our first dose yesterday and we both experienced sore arms and he’s had no other side effects. I’ve experienced some dizziness and some anxiety, but that’s not unusual. Most of the elders in my family have received one or both doses with no major issues.
472	0	I tasted a strong metal taste for about three minutes immediately after my first dose of Pfizer was given to me. I’m wondering if this will happen when I get my second dose next week. It really scared me at the time, because it was such an odd taste and sudden.
827	0	I just got my second dose and I feel no symptoms..not even a sore arm … I’m worried she didn’t  inject me w the vaccine
223	0	Ok
605	0	I'm a 29 year old male, when I got my first shot on the 15th May it took a couple of hours for the symptoms to kick in, I had body aches all over, headaches, chest pain and nausea, after a couple of days they disappeared.  I have no clue if this is related but fast forward 2 weeks, I've been getting constant headaches/migraines even to the point of me hallucinating, again, I have no idea if it's related but I can't think of anything else, even as of today, I'm having those effects.
39	0	Just got the shot today - just a sore arm and slight fatigue (barely noticeable). Otherwise nothing significant.
833	0	Not that I'm closed to that idea, but I highly doubt it. It's simply too different.  Ivermectin has seemed to help me thus far. I'm on my 5th dose. The brain fog is still there a bit but the diziness and generally sick feeling has subsided substantially. Almost completely really.   Hoping I'll keep getting better! I believe supplements (c,zinc,glutathione, quercetin, d3 and fish oil) have helped as well
9	-2	Watch Pfizer censor your post...   And mine !!!
134	0	Update Day 4: feeling normal. Nothing I would say particularly feels bad or like a side effect. Still not out of the woods yet so I’ll update when I remember. Hope everyone is feeling ok.
259	0	So was Astra Zeneca btw ...  good luck
579	0	I had my vaccine 5 days ago and today I felt an extreem head/nexk pain and I vomited. i Am not sure if it is a side effect or not at this moment ...
935	0	I have experienced occasional right ear pain since my first shot on 6th July. It is very mild, and hearing was not involved, but I'm getting a bit worried. Anyone else?
163	0	PREmedicating with pain/fever reducers can be an issue (studies have been done and shown this in children). But taking NSAIDs AFTER a vaccine is fine.
770	0	Has anyone experienced shortness of breath , difficulty breathing after the first shot ? One week after the first shot I have been having major difficulty breathing and as if the air will not come in completely , as if lungs feel tight.
318	0	Please post updates if you can
79	0	I have a slight sore throat too.
834	0	Not yet, been told it could take a few months to clear. It's improving but very, very slowly.
314	-1	Omg!  Is anyone on these pro-vaccine sites educated?!!
49	0	It’s been flat for a long time while other vaccine makers stocks are going thru the roof. A new facility is helping them produce in France after their vaccine didn’t get approved. Biden ordered 200 million more and they will be delivered 2 months early. Their bottle hold 6 doses while everyone else’s hold only 5 per vial. I’m holding for now because I can’t figure out with all the good news regarding this company why has the stock gone down? Doesn’t make sense. 2/2 will be a day to remember if you own this stock good or bad
218	1	Yeah, sore arm is very common. I was super tired too. That’s good that you didn’t take anything. I am happy you had a good weekend. Yeah not telling them is a good thing. On a positive note 5 of my family members got their second dose of Pfizer and it’s been over 24 hours and none of them have had any negative symptoms. Only 2 of them were tired and that was it. I am glad to help, my round 2 is April  6th!
129	0	I'm on 72 hours and at this point in time the first day after my vaccine I got knocked on my ass with feeling foggy tired and a slight headache but that's due to caffeine withdrawals cuz of not drinking caffeine. Then 48 hours I was very out of it where my brain response time to actions that work were very minimum. Today was just a good day until about an hour ago I started feeling foggy again.
306	0	Got it today in the afternoon first dose. The only thing I barely notice is some slight soreness on the left arm spot where I got my shot.
61	0	Thanks for the reply. I hope not to see anymore side effects. The talk is that the second shot is the real kicker.
921	0	Me like a good basic math killing
647	1	Call me crazy but have terrible allergies.. it feels like they improved after the vaccination.
846	0	Anyone getting shakes? It feels like I can't hold my hand steady anymore after receiving the first dose (June 10th) and it feels like I have early onset Parkinson's (29/M)
329	0	Got my 1st shot Tuesday 2/23 and didn’t start feeling symptoms until 24 hours later. Exhaustion, headache, achy all over. Went away in the evening then came back 48 hours later. Its been on and off aches/exhaustion. Today is day 5 and I still have a headache behind my eyes that won’t seem to go away. That’s the biggest thing that’s bothering me is this never ending headache behind my eyes.   Anyone else have a lasting headache from this?? I just want to be able to move my eyes around without pain lol
590	0	In my country, 28 days.
692	0	Hey there, just wanted to share my experience, and i will try to keep it up to date. I got my first shot 4 days ago, and immediately after the injection i felt some throat pain, headache and a feeling of general tiredness. Never had any alergic reaction to any medicine, but soon after the first shot my heart rate increased to 90-95 bpm, so they kept me under observation for 2 hours, then i went back home. For the next three days i juat had some headache and pain on the injected arm, but nothing more. Today when i was at work i had a panic attack (never had one in my life, maybe just two years ago for some digestive problems but was not that bad). I suddenly coultn't feel my legs, and the general feeling was like i could pass out at any time. I had increased pressure, tachicardia and some convulsions on my left leg, could not control that. I went to emergency hospital where i am right now, and at the moment i feel like super healthy, just a bit of a headache and sometimes a feeling of something bad inside. I am waiting for some analysis then i wish i can go home soon. Did anyone experience this kind of symptoms? Thanks
405	1	I got my first dose 3/16. Nothing but a sore arm. Fast forward to April 1...I’ve got slight sore throat, headache and fatigue. No fever. Got a Covid test yesterday 4/2.. got results today (4/3) negative. Am thinking that since the body can take almost two+ weeks to build an immune response to the vaccine, this was my body reacting to that response?
963	0	It’s wild - some people have crazy strong immune systems I guess! I definitely feel better now and only had a sore arm and fatigue for a few days after the second shot! It was like night and day. I have a feeling it tanks your electrolytes. I started drinking coconut water and eating tons of potassium rich food after the first shot and I seemed to have faired way better. My cycle is still messed up but other than that I’m totally back to normal now. I waited 5 weeks between shots and did just fine!
665	0	He has that too. A feeling of ear fullness. It’s been a month. He had an mri, went to an ent, went on meds.  Nothing is making it better
537	0	It’s like a have appendicitis again except it’s in the middle of my stomach instead of on my lower left abdomen
229	0	🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
462	0	https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2BL2UW  Looks like it’s 80 for both.
529	0	Hey how are you feeling now, did the dizzy symptoms from the vaccine go away? & how
712	0	Thanks for asking. He has been diagnosed with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)and is now on Ivabradine. Not good unfortunately.
646	0	No, not at all. However, cycles can be affected by anything ranging from stress to nutrition, so it’s hard to tell.
226	0	First 5 days no symptoms, and then boom. The headache and feeling shaking internally inside of my head when I lie down.  Now day 7, headache is a bit better, but still there. Shaking is still there. I already tested negative. I hope this stop soon. None of the OTC stuff works!
558	0	Was very sick for a month yes a month! After the second shot, actually was in emergency room two hours after the second shot! Took high dose steroids for a week before I started feeling better. Was sick 17 days that subsided on its own after the first. It’s been a rough 7 weeks!!
831	1	I'm completely fine! I was more tired than usual for a few days after my second shot, but no other issues. I have not been infected yet. Overal it has been a positive experience.
695	0	Yeah, I'm over 3 days with a nose like an open tap, non-stop sneezing and sinus pressure.  It feels like a bad a bad bout of manflu.
519	0	Hope you keep us all updated! Good luck, glad things are turning out ok
722	0	I got the vaccine 6 days ago and I have been getting acne on my forehead - not typical whiteheads but just bumps. Could that be a sign of an allergic reaction?
972	0	Just got my 1st dose today about 2.5hrs ago I feel fine so far suppose to exercise later with family and I’m making sure I stay hydrated. Hopefully the next two days and 2nd dose is a breeze I keep y’all updated.
165	1	> “The vaccine”? There are several vaccines and yes there are deaths linked to the Pfizer vaccine.  Yes, there are multiple vaccines, I just didn't realize I needed to actually specify to you which vaccine when posting in /r/PfizerVaccine.  But sorry, I'll take the word of the CDC who I quoted above over some rando on the internet whose response is "yes there are" without and documentation.
737	1	You’re not alone, I’m feeling the same. Though, today gave me a fair boost of confidence. Hope everything goes well for you.
37	1	It takes about 10 days to develop immunity so these are common symptoms of an immune response. They certainly should go away tho so eat well and take vitamins and stay hydrated.
150	1	Had my second shot 10 days ago, can still feel my body adjusting, light head, flush, headache a couple times, but overall not bad and feel grateful
407	1	Good luck, although I’m sure you’ll be fine! Thanks for the update, I hope the second one is better for you. I’ll definitely keep you updated.
19	0	Hi, I just had my vaccine today and I am starting to feel chest pains and shortness of breath. I really think it’s another side effect, I don’t usually have chest pains.
231	1	I get my first shot of Pfizer tomorrow. Not gonna lie, kind of excited. 💉😀
22	0	How are you feeling today?
443	1	We won't know the long-term effects for a while, I'm sure. But the few studies that are ongoing (of the original clinical trial groups) seem promising as of this moment. Most doctors would rather you get it than not.
621	1	I figured I'd give my experience since only people who have had bad side effects are bothering to post. I only had arm soreness for the first shot and nothing else.   For my second shot, I had arm soreness, but not as bad as the first. However, I had the chills and a light fever 12-13 hours after receiving the vaccine. It passed the very next morning. I was still tired throughout the day, and was only completely fine the next day.
985	1	I got my first shot Friday (7/9/21) and feel fine today, Monday (7/12/21). My leg has been a bit sore and the injection site is still a little sore, but overall I don’t have any sickness symptoms.   The leg soreness has been a bit of a concern because of the clotting side effect that some people have, just hope it’s not that. But it didn’t seem like Pfizer had that issue on a large scale like J&J and Astrozeneca.
523	0	so if you haven't have any side effects to the first... the second does is worse?
748	0	First one was soreness, then that aches feeling you get at the onset of a cold, along with the ache you get when the weather changes. Lasted about 36 hours. Shot 2 gave me a sore arm, headache, and 3 days of feeling like a drugged up horse at the vet
260	0	got my second shot on Tuesday noon. Had a fever from Tue night till Wednesday night. Since then, a mild headache that persists until now (Fri afternoon).
112	2	I trust the scientists and science behind vaccines that have been saving lives for decades. So yes I’m trying to provide some comfort to those who are experiencing post vaccine anxiety— because the vaccine is safe and I guarantee a decent chunk of the reported side effects of heart rate increases are largely due to anxiety. Is the vaccine totally perfect? No, but we don’t really have the time to create the perfect vaccine with zero side effects or risks. These vaccines will save more lives than it will take. So at this point it’s in our country’s best interest to get the current vaccines out. I agree with everything you said, but I don’t think the government is always out to get us...
265	0	Thank you :)
193	0	I just got mine last Tuesday. It’s now Sunday and I am really tired and still have a lot of brain fog for some reason. Hoping it will go away soon.
432	0	Same! I’m super nervous and reading through this thread to prepare myself. Really hoping I’ll be one of the lucky ones with little to no side effects. How are you feeling after your second dose?
352	0	Anyone having a pain in the injection site after a month of 2nd dose ? Having this pain for a few days already... all shots went almost without side effects but this is weird
396	0	Did ur post get censored?
320	0	My dad got a bit of vertigo after his second one.
25	1	Did you go to your doctor? If not, you seem to be describing unusually severe symptoms (whether from the vaccine or something else) and I think it would be right about time to consult a physician.  I had tiredness, poor sleep, mild nausea, mild fever and mild headache up to 7 days after the first vaccine but that’s it. And my body is EXTREMELY reactive in general (including history of 3 anaphylactic shocks). You should see what’s up and double check if it’s vaccine side effects or something else or a combo of both.
117	0	I had bad fatigue and brain fog after my first dose too. Almost threw up at work and had bad diarrhea as well.
486	0	> Pedialyte   Thats a great suggestion.  Being hydrated and with the right electrolytes sounds like a great way to go in.  I bought some for my covid emergency stash (in case I got it) so I'll be sure to drink it before my second shot.   Your family must love having their own personal EMT!  thank you for all you do, and thank you for posting this.
509	0	This is reassuring. I’m glad it didn’t last so long for you as it has for others. I’m really hoping that’ll be my case too. I even experienced a little cough an hour ago but it’s subsided. Also - do you know if it’s true that if you don’t react to the first vaccine, when you take the second it’ll be harder on your body? And vice versa? I read that on here somewhere but I’m not sure if it’s valid
330	0	Got 1st shot was tired but I attributed that to the 12 mile run the night to morning before (finished at 1 am) my road mileage hasn’t suffered after that at all
892	0	I just got my second dose a week ago and I’ve had a horrible burning sensation in my chest (like heart burn). Has anyone else had this? Anti acids don’t seem to be very effective right now and I’ve always been fine with a single Tums in the past.
466	1	just got my second shot today! i’m glad you’re feeling better. In the end, glad you got the Pfizer!
302	0	I think it was like Saturday midday (got it on Wednesday) that I felt completely better. I definitely felt worse the day after I got it. I got my second dose today... 🤞and already let my main supervisor know I could be sick tomorrow
920	0	Two weeks ago I got my first vaccine. After a couple of hours my arm got sore, I think they call it the typical COVID arm ;) After the first couple of days it got better and better until after 4/5 days it was completely gone and I was happy because it wasn’t that bad. But last Sunday I woke up with the same muscle pain and as off today (6th day now) I still have it and even worse. I don’t notice that it’s getting better with the days like the first time.. how can it be gone and then come back? Are there more people with the same experience or has an explanation? I only read online that COVID arm can last up to 5 days…
664	0	I still have tinnitus after 4 weeks. Sucks especially at night.
280	0	You don’t sue for a vaccine injury anyway. You file with the national vaccine injury compensation program for ANY vaccine injury.
673	0	Many on Twitter. Report it to vaers!
862	1	Hey, I was in the same boat a bit worse though. A fit, male, got the shot a week ago. I felt fine right after the first shot, then the next 4 days were very close to the worse days I had in the past 2 years. I had very mad headaches, muscle pains (not aches), and my skin near my spine and neck was sensitive. I have my energy back to like 70% And have been slow back to the gym. my neck is okay now but Im generally worried to take the second shot. Thanks for your post im glad im not the only one who feels this way. The worst part is friends who have had the actual virus had an easier time then I did with the first shot. Dont let my experience scare other people, talk to #your doctor and see what's best for you.
950	0	Have any other females experienced loss of a period and breasts being ridiculously tender/getting larger? And before anyone asks I've taken pregnancy tests, and I'm not pregnant 😅
800	0	Have you had your 2nd dose? I am SO worried  that the 2nd dose will be even worse. Thanks for sharing 🙂
164	0	2/2 has past 🤔 hasnt 🚀... any clues to why & when should we see it 🚀
172	0	Oh boy! I’m on day 7 and I’m going through it too. My main symptoms have been bad dizzy spells and exhaustion. I’m so glad I work from home because otherwise... I don’t know how I’d be able to commute (I have 1 hr commute to and back from work). I’m exhausted all the time and feel winded... these dizzy spells have been freaking me out and they don’t seem to go away!  I spoke with my doctors and they just tell me to take Tylenol if I’m in pain and get as much rest. But honestly, I’m sleeping so much and yet... I feel like I haven’t slept at all. I hope we all get better soon.
72	-2	EAU means EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION. It’s not approved by the FDA for safety or efficacy. You are volunteering to take a drug made by the pharmaceutical companies that have zero liability if you have any adverse side effects or allergic reactions. You can’t sue ANYONE!!! I find it stupefying that you TRUST the pharmaceutical companies. They have no liability if you go into anaphylactic shock or get Bell’s palsy from the vaccine. All your medical bills are yours to deal with but hey, good luck.
298	0	They used to be but now they are more like a pressure/dull ache.
851	2	Thanks, that makes sense. I'm happy to say that the strong palpitations are easing up and I'm just going to keep resting and pushing fluids today. Despite all this I'm so glad I got the vaccine.
190	0	Feeling body aches and very tired, curious about others’ experiences. When will I feel normal again? Any advice???
640	-1	69 YO male, got second dose on March 29 in Murietta, CA. Got the expected soreness and 101 degree fever / vomiting a few days out, then better or so I thought. The fever came back, approximately weekly, for six weeks, though weaker each time. More ominously my bio markers worsened. As I am monitoring health closely due to prostate cancer.  My kidneys went from healthy to stage 3 failure (eGFR from 90 to 35). Blood pressure increase by 20 mm of HG. CRP from 1.5 to 2.8. I was having a measurable inflammation event, kidney failure, and hypertension in addition to the recurring fever. My sedimentation rate of 33 indicates a blood clotting risk.  Not fun, since my PSA (prostate cancer risk) doubled in two months where it had been taking 12, probably as a result of the inflammation attack. The vaccination is not worth it.
113	0	How’s it going
847	0	Mine was high for 3 weeks. It went over 130 when doing something small. My husband had tach for 1.5 weeks. I also had tach over 150 beats per minute twice with high blood pressure and needed beta blockers, went to ER and my family doc did a 24 holter. I will not be having the 2nd shot for now. But my husband will, since he didnt have it so bad
256	0	I got my first shot yesterday, 3/9. I felt fine for a few hours after, then suddenly I felt completed exhausted and had to go lay down. I continued to feel tired after I woke up from my nap and I also had brain fog. Today I am still feeling lethargic, but not as bad as yesterday. Arm is pretty sore, though.
288	0	Three hours into my first shot. Only a small amount of pain in arm so far. I feel fine otherwise. I was quite nervous and had some anxiety right after injection but felt better in about 20 min. That’s not unusual for me and my history with anxiety. I will let you know how it progresses.
774	0	Hi, how are you feeling now, I got my 2nd vaccine 18 days ago And I still have clogged ears, tightness in troat, extremely exhausted and weak, brain fog at times and kind of dizzy, tingling all over my body, weird bowel movement. Went to E R everything normal.
773	0	Hey guys, I have the opportunity to go to a walk-in COVID vaccination today near where I live . I am 49 and have so far not taken any invitations to book. I am on hrt, have reactive lymph glands. I am so anxious to get vaccinated but know that I should, according to the details sent there are both Pfizer and AZ available today…. Is Pfizer the better me to have ie less side effects? The clinic starts for n 4.5 hours ! UPDATE: Had my Pfizer first jab that day which is a week today ….after the 15 min wait I had slight discomfort in arm and could feel that a headache could be coming also felt cold. The arm discomfort went quickly headache never really got going but did have to put my central heating on for the next couple of days. The only side effect I really noticed was a very low mood and feeling agitated 2 days after and that lasted for only 2 days, feel absolutely fine now. I have read that the 2nd jab of Pfizer is when you feel more side effects so I am back to feeling anxious for that, over here in the uk they want an 8 - 12 week gap in between first and second even though Pfizer say 3 weeks.
15	-1	I had the Moderna vaccine #2 8 days ago and have been having a racing heart beat, little chest discomfort, sweaty palms/soles that continues to come in waves. Is she still experiencing it, or did it go away? Went to the ER. They couldn’t really say but feel it may be related to the vaccine. Sent me to a cardiologist. Wearing a heart monitor now. I definitely feel this is vaccine related because of the acute onset. Hoping it resolves soon.
464	0	Nope. Still have headaches every day but they aren’t as bad.
18	0	Im doing good
86	0	Had my first does this morning. I started feeling soreness in my neck on the side that  got my shot after. It felt like I had been sitting on the computer too long. About 2 hours later I felt exhausted-it’s been about 7 hours and I’ve been dozing off all day. I have a little sore throat and my injection site is sore. No fever- it feels like my body is fighting off a cold or flu- not quite sick- but I don’t feel like doing much either.
73	-2	All that and guess what, you can still get covid?  That’s not a cure. It’s not even FDA APPROVED. You volunteered to inject yourself with a drug that has not been approved for safety or efficacy. Good luck to you.
690	0	Hey anyone here experience joint muscle or bone pain weeks after vaccine its been two months and I still feel pain. When I press on my fingers my bone hurts also by toes hurt.i didn't take the second shot.
