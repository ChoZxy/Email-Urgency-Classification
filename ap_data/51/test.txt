565	-2	Does anybody know how long these side effects are going to last ? Idk why none of this is on the information sheet that was handed to me prior to the first dose I would have never took this shot if this was the case! Idk what‚Äôs going on the uncertainty is eating me alive!
94	0	How are you doing? Just got my second one a few minutes ago!! I‚Äôll update how I‚Äôm feeling later
186	1	I got my first shot Mar 8 (it‚Äôs the 14th today).  Sore at the spot of the shot, but really no other side effects. My friend who is in way better shape than me felt similar. We felt even BETTER than we normally did! Both in our late 30s.  I‚Äôll try to remember to update after the 2nd shot.  I did have a 3 min panic attack while sitting in the waiting room for 15 min after the shot. That was the worse part!  Also if you‚Äôre just browsing through Reddit and looking for vaccine experiences from people, understand that these types of posts are probably heavily skewed towards people with negative experiences. More than likely, it doesn‚Äôt even cross someone‚Äôs mind to post updates when they had zero to little reactions to the vaccine. Just throwing that out there bc reading this thread made me super nervous getting my shot!  My friend in her early 40s, in shape,  not obese, had a full day of fever and body weakness after the 2nd moderna shot. But she said it only lasted like a day. But her fever did get to 101, which freaked her out.  **2ND SHOT UPDATE (3/30):** I got my 2nd shot yesterday. I have slight soreness on the spot on my shoulder where I got the shot. And I feel muscle soreness and maybe a tiny sluggish today. Other than that, feel so happy that I got my shot! I have 3 other friends that got vaxxed at the same place (Pfizer shot) yesterday, and they all feel fine today :D  **3/31** \- feelin normal
599	-1	I've been getting pins and needles throughout the day since first dose. It started about 4 days after. All over, not all at once but it moves around. Sometimes fingertips both hands, toes and arches of both feet. Sometimes in legs and arms but not as much as in my feet and hands. I'm day 21 and hesitant about second shot.  I also got a weird reddish purple bump on my right quad, it's since mostly gone but I can still see it a bit. I've been getting a bump on my arm that comes and goes for like 3 days. Sometimes it's completely gone and sometimes it's big and itchy.   Not sure.
564	-1	Who told you that?  My son has had covid 3 times. He‚Äôs a US Marine. Not one marine has died of covid. He said it was no different than the flu. If you are obese or have an unhealthy lifestyle, maybe the risks of experimental vaccines are worth it to you. Over 96% of people who get covid, recover at home.
182	0	Same experience here. Going on day 6 and can‚Äôt get out of bed
651	0	How are you now?
236	0	With dizziness yes but not the headaches. Going to try these new meds and hope for the best!
29	0	Chill I was kidding.
615	0	Completed my second dose last week basically had no side effects other than shot spot sore for a day.   Thusfar my first dose was worse. Arm was sore for 4-5 days after the first dose and i was tired and achy for a day but it wasn't that bad.
470	0	Are you back to 100% yet?
340	0	Go away
628	0	Nothing. A lot of countries are giving second doses a lot later. Here in the UK we‚Äôre giving them 11/12 weeks after the first dose.
806	0	I had my 2nd dose on Thursday, it's Tuesday today... Thursday and Friday were fine, I was 100% okay. But Saturday started with diarrhea which lasted on and off till today (i hope it's over) and which is weird - i cannot stand the smell and taste of coffee. I just can't. The same with Coke. I just read an article that some people have metalic taste in their mouth after that - maybe it's somehow connected? I even did pregnancy test today, but it's negative. It's so weird.
639	-1	I got the Pfizer vaccine today and instant reaction. Like numbness and tingling in the face and arms. The doctor on site monitored me for a hour and told me if it gets worse to go to emergency. It's been 4 hours and my lips and face are still numb. Apparently this is a common side effect. I was told this was the safest vaccine for women. I don't think I'd recommend this one üòí
554	0	I have the same symptoms, has your stuff improved at all?
552	0	She thinks the inflammatory response from the vaccine caused the pain in my neck to worsen. Just a hypothesis she has right now. My recent blood tests have shown high platelets and low iron and vitamin D also.
2	1	It‚Äôs about 50-55% percent on the first shot, then goes up to 95% after the second  Edit: not sure what days these efficiencies kick in after the shot is had, this also does not account for the new strains we are starting to see but they are happy that it is still effective against the new strains
355	0	21F. I got my vaccine at approximately 9:30am yesterday. It is currently 7:30am the next day and I feel so terrible it‚Äôs brought me to tears. At around 3pm-5pm the day of injection I got very tired, that could‚Äôve been unrelated. Then around 10pm I started feeling pain all over my body. It is hard to describe but it‚Äôs like an aching/needle pain in every single place in my body, and it is really bad along my back and neck and legs. I believe I have a fever but cannot find a thermometer. I was not able to sleep at all last night. I was turning around in bed constantly trying to find comfort, but with no success. My arm where the shot was given has the expected tenderness and pain but nothing compared to how the rest of my body feels. Now I just broke down in tears because of how much my body hurts. I‚Äôm at college and just want to be at home with my mom. I am so miserable. Edited to add: with the first dose I only had very bad arm pain at the site of injection and no other symptoms.
897	1	Canada is recommending minimum 8 weeks between doses, based on studies from the UK that indicate a stronger immune response when doses are spaced out.
366	0	Maybe you can avoid the surgery? Is it vital? Many things can be healed without it. I wish you the best!
497	0	How did it end up going?
424	0	That makes sense now. I used ginger in my curry recipe last night and thought my tongue was on fire even though I used the same amount of ginger when I cooked the same curry before! I was apologizing my room mates for cooking deadly spicy curry but they were like ‚ÄúNot sure what you are taking about! it‚Äôs really good!‚Äù. This is 3 days after my 2nd shot.
517	0	I had my second shot on 4/25 , 10 hours later fever started went up to 102F. Have been taking ibuprofen but nurse said use acetaminophen that broke the fever, chills followed after that. Had low grade fever next morning. Fatigue, joint pain lasted over a week even though in low intensity.  I‚Äôm still having few of them 2 weeks later, visited my GP for something else today and they said there seem to be a group of people for whom those side effects can last up to a month!
857	2	I (25F) had my first dose on 18 of June. After 4 hours I started to have a skin burn but without any other symptoms. It was not that bad and it was coming and going. After 6 days it was totally gone. My mother also had the same reaction after both doses. I went to a doctor for allergies and they gave me antihistamines. Other than that, for 2 days after the vaccine I was a bit tired but nothing so bad and my left arm hurt because that's where I got the vaccine.   Second dose was on Friday, July 9th. Again pain in the arm. But because I am still on antihistamine nothing else. Not even being tired. It's been more that 50 hours and I am totally fine. I will continue to take the allergy medication for a week.   Besides the small but annoying allergic reaction, I am totally happy that it's done. Hope nothing else happens.  Stay safe all!  Edit: it's been more than a month and I had zero side effects after my second dose! My advice: get tested to see if you are allergic to the vaccine, otherwise go get it.
568	0	Got my second Pfizer shot yesterday afternoon - been over 24 hours and I‚Äôve had zero issues. Slight soreness in the arm where the needle was injected, otherwise I feel completely fine. Only thing I did was take it easy and drink lots of water.
584	0	*I felt weak for about a week and a half post my first shot. I normally train jiu jitsu so it was definitely bad for me, but I wouldn't have noticed anything if I didn't do strenuous exercise like bjj. Supposed to get my second dose today so fingers crossed it's not bad!*
374	0	Ugh.
493	0	46f diabetic ; 2nd dose 4/6  Today I feel tingly in my left elbow and left hand (shot was on left arm), tingly face , my ears are plugged up and ringing off and on, chills on my head, feel feverish and clammy face, some brain fog.  I was able to go grocery shopping this morning just fine. I have energy but my legs feel heavy.
58	0	I had my second dose on Monday.. So far all I've had is some fatigue and a really sore shoulder. 48 hours after the first vaccine I had exhaustion, headache and nausea. Will be interesting to see if it kicks in later today.
437	0	update
211	0	I got my first shot yesterday, (3/24) and am only 2 days in.   Immediately after the shot my arm started feeling heavy, like a bag of sand. And there was tenderness. As soon as I got home I was super fatigued and slept for 4 hours. But I still felt fatigued.  6-8 hours later my arm actually started aching near the injection site and it hurt to move it above my head. Plus it made me nervous so I‚Äôll mention it but the muscle which received the injection was twitching on and off for like 2 hours. I didn‚Äôt get a headache.  It‚Äôs the second day for me now and I just woke up, still fatigued. But the lights are a little too bright for my taste. I‚Äôm a bit sensitive to it right now. Arm still aches but no headache. Just a very light sore throat coming on (I think).
575	0	I received shot number 2 last Thursday and only felt mild leg aches the next day. But 6 days later I felt like I got hit by a flu bomb. I‚Äôm still dealing with it as it‚Äôs working it‚Äôs way out of me but I‚Äôve been down for the count the last 2 days. I *think it‚Äôs from the shot. It doesn‚Äôt feel or sound like covid and I went to urgent care and they said the same thing (they didnt test me and I was going to yesterday but decided to sleep all day instead) Weird!
797	0	I think the second was different than the first. I didn't really have any symptoms other than major fatigue for 2-3 days. It hit me about an hour after I got my second dose, and I basically slept through the weekend.   My arm was probably sore for two days after the first and second doses. But I don't recall having a sore throat or a headache like I did for the first.
532	2	I'm so sorry you're suffering as well.  üò™  While we both feel like hell, at least we're vaxxed & that's a GREAT thing!  Thinking of you & sending you all the vibes for a quick recovery!  You're 100% right...we've got this!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
133	0	I wonder how much of that is true for me. I think the placebo effect is causing me anxiety which is causing me to have high BP and causing headaches.
829	-1	I‚Äôm sorry to hear . Yea I‚Äôve delayed the second because the first almost killed me . No joke
525	0	Its normal to feel throat pain when swallow or jaw stiffnes on one side 1 week after the vaccine? Mi girfliend develop that symptoms i have like flu symptom know for 2 days. We have the first dosis 10 days ago  Sorry if is hard to read im from south america i realy dont speak english too much
759	0	Two weeks from my first vaccination, the symptoms started on the 9th until today (14th day). Headache the first days (9,10,11), sweating, tiredness.  Day 14 I'm dizzy
803	0	Hi all, after my first jab I was very sleepy and I thought that was it but as I read all your experiences it made me realize I had it all. I experienced a lot of fatigue, anything physical would make me cringe and I'm usually very active person. Now I'm 24h post second one and I feel about the same. I didn't experience any fever just light headache but what bothers me the most is my arm... Boy that hurts
393	0	I had the exact same experience after my first dose. I felt totally wiped out for about 3 days and had a nasty bout of vertigo on day 2.   I just had my 2nd dose on Monday and it was a breeze. Only side effects were increased appetite and a small amount of brain fog. Hope your 2nd dose goes just as well!
6	0	Some people have only had mild effects (or even none) so it‚Äôs hard to say for sure what you may experience. Of the people I know personally who have had a stronger reaction like I did, it was only for one day. I started feeling the chills and aches approx 10ish hours  after the vaccine and then immediately slept all night before my full day of feeling bad. I would say definitely REST, regardless of how you are feeling, as much as possible for the next 24-48 hours so your body can do what it needs to do. Don‚Äôt stay up late, don‚Äôt eat junk, keep hydrated, and just rest/sleep any time you don‚Äôt have to be at work. I hope you are one of the lucky ones who doesn‚Äôt have it too bad. Also, some people have been worried about taking pain relievers for their symptoms for fear of it causing the vaccine to not work as well. But it is ok to take a little something if you feel really awful AFTER a vaccine. So don‚Äôt hesitate if you do feel bad.
747	0	I had my first dose and after 7 days my lymph nodes from the neck swole too but just a little bit, it feels like you when you didn‚Äôt sleep well and have neck pain, i get my second dose tomorrow
624	0	25 F I got my second shot yesterday morning.  First shot:  Sore arm started a couple of hours after. I was very fatigued and my body temp dropped late at night. I bundled up and rested a lot. Woke up feeling great and had no other symptoms.  Second shot:   It's almost been 24 hours, but I'm much sicker this time. It started out the same where I got a sore arm a couple of hours later. I slowly started feeling worse. More than just body fatigue. It felt like the flu but a little worse. I tried to rest, but I couldn't sleep. Laid in bed in pain for hours until I finally got the energy to get some medicine and cried my body hurt so much. It hurt absolutely everywhere. My back, butt, feet, head, everywhere. I was running a fever this time, so I took some ibuprofen and only got two hours of sleep. I'm feeling a little better right now. Body is still a bit sore and my arm is sore if I move it too quickly, but it's not as intense. Still have a low grade fever despite taking more medicine.
855	0	I had nausea
676	0	Yup.  My best guess is that it was inflammation around the lungs since your body is mimicking how it would react to the actual virus.  same reason why your arm feels like it was hit by a softball - the muscles and tissue swell up.   About a month later and I‚Äôm still alive so I guess it‚Äôs not a big deal.
276	2	No no no no no. Take a deep breath. So for the Pfizer vaccine there were over 43,000 people in the trials. A total of 6 people died over the course of several months during the trials. None of which had anything to do with the vaccine itself. 4 of them didn‚Äôt even receive the vaccine, they got the saline placebo. Of the 2 that were part of the trial and received the vaccine, one died of a heart attack over 2 months after getting the 2nd dose. And the other, who died 3 days after the first dose I believe, had (can‚Äôt remember the exact name of the condition) something that is essentially hardening of the arteries, like plaque buildup and such which happens over a long period of time usually from bad diet, smoking, genetics etc. All 6 were just in a very very large trial group and death for one reason or another just happens when you are considering such a large cross section of people of varying ages and health history. Please try not to stress about it. Do something nice for yourself to take your mind off of it. And when you do get your second vaccine, keep in mind that if you do experience any side effects (mostly feeling like you‚Äôve got the dang flu for 24 hours in most cases) have been fairly common. Just get rest and let your body do what it‚Äôs supposed to do and take comfort in knowing you‚Äôve done your part to help stop this awful virus AND protect yourself and your loved ones. (((HUGS))) You‚Äôre going to be ok.
938	0	I got my second dose 3 weeks after my comment and had zero side effects. To this day I feel totally fine
362	-1	I got my first shot on almost almost 48 hours ago. Six hours after I got my shot I started getting a very mild sore throat. This mild sore throat is still with me almost 2 days later, plus I feel very tired.  I'm very anxious and nervous about getting my 2nd shot now. Even though the side effects I have are very mild and could be unrelated to the shot, it still makes me nervous that something isn't working correctly.  Does anyone else feel this way or has anyone decided to just opt out of their 2nd shot?
592	2	So... I just had my second dose on Sunday at 5pm. I was already quite fatigued from finals and family time but around midnight I began to feel like I had the ‚Äúbody flu‚Äù- aches and general joint discomfort. Slept for roughly 12 hours which was honestly nice and way over due for the semester.  Monday I had an elevated temp (usually 97.8) at 99.6 F. Aside from feeling the fever and aches I woke up Tuesday as if nothing had happened.  I can‚Äôt 100% claim my tiredness is post vax effects because my period starts this week and I also take other medications that can influence my fatigue levels dependent on my hormones.  Arm pain with first dose was actually way more uncomfortable than the second. I didn‚Äôt feel the first injection when it happened, but the second one felt like a nerve got hit... like a light shock, but not unbearable.  I am physically very sensitive and feel unwell easily but the vaccine was ALOT easier than I initially anticipated. All in all I‚Äôm grateful I was able to get the vaccine and Pfizer has a good track record (medically speaking) stay hydrated and plan to get the second one with a day or two off work.   Stay safe everyone!
353	0	A little over 2 weeks. Just in time for my 2nd shot which was ironically less of an issue than the 1st one.
527	0	I had that with my 1st dose. I got in the shower and stood in the hot water.  Probably not the best thing to do with fever,  but it helped with the shivering.
415	1	Zinc lozenges are good, hydrate and stay positive! You‚Äôve got this! I had a strong reaction to first and so far good on the second! :)
238	0	Good to hear! Just got my first today
893	0	o m g im so relieved to see that other ppl had sore throats too.. not listed side effect, didnt find anything online but i have one too, i got my 1st shot tuesday and it started very light on thursday and today (saturday) it was really uncomfortable..  i was worried to the point that i took a covid test, even tho i tested negative wednesday and friday.. and i was negative today too.. so im linking it to the vaccine..
553	0	Had my first Pfizer shot 3 weeks ago. Was fine the first day except my period started, very early and unexpectedly, about 5 hours after the shot. Day two I felt like I was in a car accident and had whiplash from my shoulder to the heel of my foot but only on one side. Day 3 I had a sore arm and some body stiffness and thought I was on the mend. Day 4 I woke up with a crushing pain around my ribs, like I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath but not. Took my blood pressure and O2 Sat and they were fine so I took some Tylenol and went to sleep. Day 5 my lymph nodes in my neck and armpits were swollen and the skin over them was sore to the touch (still is sometimes). Day 6 the headaches started. Called my doc on day 7 and she refused to see me and told me to go to the ER because I had left sided (shot side) shoulder and back pain. Sat there for 8 hours and had an EKG, heart ultrasound, 2 rounds of blood tests and an X-ray checking for blood clots and heart attack. Came back clean but with very low potassium. Was told it‚Äôs probably shot side effects, my immune response was probably crazy and that they should subside. I‚Äôve had constant headaches, random dizzy spells, cold hands and feet like something is wrong with my circulation, profound fatigue all day long and terrible left side shoulder blade pain that gets worse with movement. The newest thing that started happening about 5 days ago is that my arms feel heavy. Like I have been lifting super heavy weights everyday except I never recover. It‚Äôs so tight and I can‚Äôt figure out why. I am scheduled to get shot 2 tomorrow but I don‚Äôt think I can do it. Wtf is happening to me? Has anyone else had any similar issues? Do I risk it and get the second one in hopes that I ‚Äúreset‚Äù? Or do I wait until I feel better to get it?
205	-1	The CARES ACT run by the CDC demanded that they oversee coding deaths. This is something physicians usually do. If you die, your physician fills out the reason for for death. Suddenly, the CDC intervened in March 2020 and demanded that ANY death from ANY cause be coded as covid-19 even it is from something else such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, heart disease or even getting killed in a car accident IF covid is even present in the hospital!!! I recently met an ICU nurse who works in a hospital in Los Angeles. She said over 95% of the people dying of covid are already sick or dying of something else. You stay home if you‚Äôre afraid, wear a mask üò∑ and live in fear. I don‚Äôt care. The CDC states on their own website most people recover from covid at home. If you are obese or smoke or have type 2 diabetes, you‚Äôre at risk. Get an experimental vaccine üíâ . Good luck
790	-1	fucking crazy people in power.
13	0	I was told not to take ibuprofen (Advil) but Acetaminophen (Tylenol) was ok if I needed it. I was mortified because I‚Äôd taken Advil for my menstrual cycle 8 hours before the first shot.   I was fortunate to not have any symptoms other than soreness at injection site with both shots. I‚Äôm 8 days out from the second dose (2/19).
233	-1	I had my first dose of Pfizer today. I can‚Äôt get myself to calm down. I am so worried about those rare fatal side effects ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
515	0	I had terrible heart burn yesterday too. Thought I was having a heart attack for a second there.
173	0	Just got my second dose this afternoon about 4 hours ago. Should I take anything preemptively to stave off bad symptoms? I‚Äôm getting a bit scared hearing all this and I have two kids to care for and no fall back tomorrow :( so far I feel fine. No soreness, tiny headache only. With the first shot I only had mild arm soreness and nothing else. 35yo female.
175	0	24 hours later after first shot and I‚Äôm SO tired. Tried working out this morning and 30 minutes in I had to throw in the towel. Sore arm, extremely tired, and feel like I might need to throw up.
663	0	you responded so fast! Since we are both here, what's your favorite color
404	0	I‚Äôm having low back spasms.
593	0	Mine was directly around the injection site and swollen. I don't remember it being hot
608	0	I feel great now, my symptoms lasted about 4 - 5 days with each dose. I took Tylenol. I will note this: I had a regular doctor‚Äôs appt last week and my b12 was extremely low. I know it probably has nothing to do with vaccine but I have never had that issue and wondered if anyone else had after vaccination?
630	0	Well i after my first shot day my arm hurt a little for a day.  I got my second shot almost 1 hour ago so i cant tell you anything about it of worth.
869	0	Yes, 2 weeks after my 2nd Pfizer jab I developed a mild pins and needles/tingly feeling under my left heel and can feel it when I walk. Also had a lot of side effects during the first week including paresthesia, pins and needles, faintness and numbness mostly passing through the arms and face when I lie down. Slowly feeling better lately. Been nourishing my nerves with lion's mane, magnesium and proper nutrient intake. (30F, healthy)
721	1	I have and second dose wasn‚Äôt bad at all.  I have a few family members who had Moderna and they were very sick.  Myself and everyone I know who has taken Pfizer felt almost nothing on the second dose.
316	0	I woke up today having slept a full night and feeling completely normal, even went to play tennis this morning. Glad the bad part is over. Thanks
45	0	As in 12% efficiency? Or 12 weeks apart for shots?  My next one was meant to be April but it‚Äôs been brought forward to March 10th for some reason
481	0	Thanks! It‚Äôs just PT but I‚Äôll see if it helps!
31	1	Hey there!  I have talked to a friend who is a registered nurse here (Kelowna, BC, Canada), who also received the vaccine. He however received it two weeks prior me so I asked about his experiences. He told me that he felt like I did, general fatigued and exhausted as well as little energy at the gym for about 8 to 10 days after the vaccine. He stated that it is common for some to have these symptoms for a little while after, however he told me that if you have ANY respiratory issues at all to contact your doctor about it. I so far only felt tired and low energized and here and there dizzy, but today is day 10 post vaccine and I do feel alot better, I will keep you updated, thank you for sharing your experience! :)
751	0	2 weeks üò≠ I had no symptoms from my first shot but the second made me sick for a few days. I‚Äôm over that now but this brain fog feeling is driving me nuts it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not really here or something
502	0	Did you guys felt any burning in the arm and needles/numbness after 2 or 3 day from the vaccine ? Thanks
380	0	I‚Äôm a little more than 24 hours out and just have waves of fatigue here and there and a significantly sore arm. The side effects haven‚Äôt been terrible by any means so far. Three friends, all in their 40s, got the second pfizer recently and had pretty much the same experience.
906	0	Currently riding out the waves of my second shot side affects. Both times have knocked me about.   1st shot - I had mild muscle aches, and a 10 day late period.   2nd shot- 3 hours afterwards I felt fatigued and had an hour's nap (which is very rare for me). Nothing else rest of day and night.  Woke up this morning and felt dizzy and my arm was  very very sore to the point I couldn't lay on that side or lift my arm without pain. 23 hours post jab I started feeling really tired and achy. By midday (so exactly 24 hours after the shot) I was almost in tears, muscles and joints were aching so badly it felt like I had been through the most strenuous workout of my life. Body was freezing cold, I wrapped up under 3 blankets and then spent 6 hours alternating between awake and asleep, but very groggy and with a severe brain fog the whole time.  Now I'm regulating my body temperature fine but I have an awful headache and have developed a bit of a sore throat and a stuffy nose. Still feel groggy and useless.
861	0	Yes! First shot I felt nothing but experienced it intensely the first few days after the 2nd shot. Numbness/tingling/faintness/palpitations that came and went in waves especially when lying down. 2 weeks later I'm gradually feeling better but now I seem to have a mild pins and needles spot under my left heel. I'm hoping this is temporary. My immune system is also jacked (30F, healthy) so the amount of side effects make sense. Replenishing my nerves with magnesium supplement, lion's mane and optimal nutrition. Hoping you're feeling better.
534	2	Seconding this. With so few people dying after the vaccine it is attributed to chance. It was a coincidence that they died then. Otherwise more people would have. And they would have pulled the vaccine off the market. You‚Äôre good!
168	0	Got my dose 1 yesterday and had a mild headache last night.  Worked out today and it went normally.  Hoping to continue this trend with dose two but I‚Äôm sure it will be worse
798	-1	I had the second Pfizer shot about a month ago. I have separated my shoulders several times throughout my lifetime and was just starting to have a bit of arthritis pain in both, occasionally. A couple of days after the shot, I started having terrible pain in both shoulders which didn't subside.  I couldn't even lift my arms to take my shirt without being in pain. Trying to sleep was impossible. My primary care doc said to wait 20 days out from the shot and she'd then prescribe an oral steroid (prednisone) and an anti inflammatory. That combo worked after a couple days, but the pain came back just as strong about a week after my last dose of prednisone. Next up were cortisone injections directly into the joints...worked after a couple days and then the pain was back to full intensity about 10 days later. I'm going to see a pain specialist next to see if medical marijuana might help. This "free" life saving vaccine is running up quite a bill - even with health insurance.  The cost of medical marijuana isn't covered at all by health insurance.  WTF
111	0	Hey there!  Honestly my progress of the vaccine sounds very similar to what you are experiencing. Today is my Day 10 after and overall I feel a little better and my workout was very energized and good today. However, I did experience sleeping troubles as well. I did have a really long day yesterday, 14 hours of work and was quiet exhausted and slept quiet good until 90mins before my alarm, so I am unsure whether I needed just really exhaust myself to sleep well or if it is the vaccine causing the body to be exhausted due to working in our system! Thanks for sharing your experience! :)
521	0	first dose: slight arm pain at injection site otherwise no symptoms whatsoever.  second dose: received about 30 hours a go. woke up feeling awful. headache and body aches everywhere. chills.  no fever though. hope it only lasts a day or two..
680	0	I‚Äôm ok now, much much better, this was difficult from day 8 to 15 after the vaccine
450	0	Got my second shot at 10:30 this morning- waiting to get hit by the vaccine bus this evening.  So far just a very sore arm and a bit of fatigue. Thanks for sharing your experiences, everyone! Knowing what to expect took the edge of my anxiety.  Update: Felt fine until about 13 hours post vaccine. Currently under a pile of blankets with severe muscle aches, chills, headache, and a low grade fever. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it, the aches have me on the verge of tears. Took Tylenol and hoping that l can get some sleep. I do have a very reactive immune system. My partner also got his second dose and he is fine apart from a very sore arm. I‚Äôll update in the morning!  Day 2 Update: fever finally broke at 4am. Felt bad all day but thankfully fever and chills are gone. Headache, brain fog, and muscle soreness. I have a very reactive immune system in general, so I‚Äôm not all that surprised, but my symptoms were more severe than I expected! It‚Äôs 8pm now and I‚Äôm exhausted and achey. Thinking I‚Äôll start to feel better tomorrow. *8:30pm: Well fuck me, Fever is back.
89	0	Has it calmed down completely?
384	0	How are you doing now?
756	0	A bit of a sore arm for a few days as well as a bit of lethargy. No fever, headache, etc. I feel I should also mention that I have had covid back in February, people claim that it makes a difference with how the vaccines affect you
691	0	I was fine after my first dose but the second dose made me really sick. For 2.5 days I was in so much pain from all my muscles and joints. I had a fever and a terrible headache and weird dreams. Now it‚Äôs Thursday (I got it Sunday) and I‚Äôm having the weirdest feeling in my head like I‚Äôm in a bubble or not really awake or something. I saw something online about ‚Äúvax fog‚Äù and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what this is. If anyone else had it lmk how long it lasted cause it‚Äôs honestly making me feel really weird
795	0	Same thing happened with both doses!   I had to take Claritin to stop the flow from the nose.
720	0	Keep us updated. Hoping for the best!
562	0	I have something similar, pain at the back of a neck.. I have it since the 7th day after the first vaccine. Maybe its something with a lymph nodes. How are u feeling now? any better?
376	-1	23M and had my first shot yesterday afternoon. Since 10am today I‚Äôve had a moderate headache, chills and sweats, and 101.7F fever (normal is 97F for me so this is a high grade fever for me).  With my antibodies now I‚Äôm not even sure I should get the second dose later this month. I feel miserable.  My symptoms are about the same as when I had covid in early February, I wonder if having antibodies worsens my side effects?
178	0	Ive been pretty good in the three days after getting it.  I‚Äôve been sort of tired but hard to tell if that was from a long work week or what.  Felt a little crappy yesterday on day two in the evening.  No fever, headache went away after the first night. I worked out yesterday and today and workouts went well.  HR all within normal range for me.  Arm was mildly sore after first day but not nearly as bad as other people I know.  Think I was fortunate.
681	0	It‚Äôs refreshing to hear a more positive outcome. Hope it stays that way!
425	0	I‚Äôm two weeks post the first vaccine. I had significant arm/injection site pain for ~5 days. It felt like a bag of bricks and I couldn‚Äôt move my arm or exercise. Although I started working out on day 5, it still hurt pretty bad but I think moving it may have helped it. I was also very fatigued all week. Second shot coming next weekend.
414	0	Me too. Are you feeling better now?
817	0	Tomorrow I‚Äôll get mine, I‚Äôm only afraid of the super-mega-rare anaphylaxis allergic reaction that kills me in 10 minutes, how many times did this happen?
762	0	Same here, from day 8 to day 15 I feel horrible. Now im ok
249	0	I had my first dose on Friday, March 19th. I did not experience any side effects, not even a sore arm. I thought I was in the clear.   On Friday, March 26th, a full week after the first dose, I suddenly developed chills and significant body aches. I checked and my fever was 100.7. It went up to 102.0 at its highest and I couldn't sleep because of the body aches. Acetaminophen helped more than ibuprofen, but neither helped a lot that first night.   Saturday, my fever ranged from 99.7 to 100.7 and the body aches decreased. Sunday, the aches went away and 99.7 was my highest temperature. Sunday night and so far today, no fever and no aches.   It lasted 48 hours, with Friday being the worst. I was worried at first because I hadn't heard of anyone experiencing a reaction a full week later, but I can't think of another reason for what happened.
492	0	Has anyone else had a resurgence of arm pain around day 9/10? My arm has started to hurt again after it went away 2 days after my initial injection. The reason I think it's vaccine-related is that the pain is radiating from the injection site and goes down to my finger like it did originally.  Edit: This is after my first dose.
36	2	What does shutting down the economy and locking people in their homes have to do with this conversation?    You implied repeatedly that the vaccine is unsafe and is killing people.  I pointed to the CDC data which says there have been no deaths linked to the vaccine.  Your comment is nothing but a red herring.
874	-2	There is no science to this. Recently I just felt everything was done based on convenience and politics
604	0	First dose: 9:30am. Sore arm started at about 2pm as well as a wave of fatigue. I pretty much just chilled in bed the rest of the day and then went to bed early. Woke up the next day and my arm was extremely sore-could barely move it. Ice and weed helped with that and by mid day i barely noticed it. Also developed a weird looking rash that looked like scratch marks on my arm and I felt hungover the whole day. All symptoms went away by the next day.   Will update tomorrow after I get the second vaccine.
403	0	First dose I had no side effects. Second dose knocked me down like dominoes. Aches everywhere and fever and dizziness
518	1	Got second does about 48 hrs ago. No side effects for the first 24. Had a quick run of the chills last night but passed TF out at 6:30pm. Woke up at 8:30am still feeling tired and achey. And my armpit on the injection side is swole up and sore. I just passed out for another 3 hours but feeling like I‚Äôm on the mend. Small price to pay.
867	0	1st dose: felt genuinely exhausted after about 13 2 hours and this continued until about 36 hours. No other symptoms.   2nd dose: felt quite tired after about 12 hours, slight temperature. After about 24 hours I still felt very tired and slept all day.   After about 30 hours I noticed a loss of taste and smell which is not one of the reported side effects.
512	0	Same here I got the shot Wednesday and here I am Saturday laying on the sofa with spontaneous fevers.
904	-1	ME TOO. I just had my 2nd dose this morning, and my resting heart rate (sitting down, not moving) is much higher than it normally is. My watch usually says my avg heart rate is in the 50s. After today's final vaccine dose, it's in the 70s.... Definitely not normal.  Google says there's a rare heart inflammation (called myocarditis and pericarditis or something) from the Pfizer vaccine. Do you plan on seeing your PCP??  I'm worried... I hope this isn't permanent heart damage.
602	0	Significantly better.  Still feel a little off, but probably 85-90% better than earlier in the week.  Cheers to surviving!
291	0	Yeah but I got a flyer that said the government will pay for any medical expenses if I do end up with a reaction so oh well.
311	0	Update Day 11: Feeling good still no side effects and no fatigue.
195	0	Let's just wait 5 years for full data.  Meanwhile, millions of people will die of the Pandemic and our economy will collapse.
687	0	I'm so sorry you're going through this! Wishing you a full recovery soon üôè
850	0	I feel exactly the same.. my symptoms began about two weeks ago and I got the shot on June 10.
520	0	YES! I FELT LIKE THIS AFTER Shot2!! I got my #2ladt Friday and still feel like crud today. Granted not as bad, but I ve been nauseated off and on since 5 pm on Friday. Cramps‚úî tired‚úîracing snd low heart mild rate‚úîrunny nose‚úîmild vertigo ‚úîcranky and feel like I'm in a fog; can't fully focus ‚úî lethargic and low energy ‚úîheadache‚úî feel like shit ‚úî Note: shot #1 and #2 have had similar effects on me with similar intensity. Ugh. Icky ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pfizer / 46 Female; in good health & no prior illness.
953	0	Another experience here with delayed symptoms this time from jab 2:   My partner got the second Pfizer shot on July 10th and his symptoms only started on the 19th. He has been floored since then with fever up to 39.8 C, chills, body aches and insomnia. ‚Ä¶. Two covid tests one antigen and one PCR (as we were convinced it was covid) both came back negative. ‚Ä¶ he still feels rough. Hoping he will get better soon and be able to get back to work too. ‚Ä¶
513	0	I had the same issue. As soon as the injection happened I got the weird metallic taste and smell that lasted like 3 days. Didn‚Äôt get it on my second one though. My second one I didn‚Äôt get side effects really at all unlike my first where I thought I was gonna die
729	0	Same problem. Following
970	0	I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. I‚Äôm getting my second one today, 7 weeks after the first one (had my reasons - I got sick, and once I recovered from that, I started a new job so I couldn‚Äôt afford to take time off while in the training period of my role). Anyway you don‚Äôt have to restart the process if you ‚Äúmiss the mark.‚Äù They just don‚Äôt have enough data yet for anything outside of the window they provided. I highly doubt waiting a week or two after the 6 weeks is an issue, otherwise they would have turned me away. Best of luck!
918	0	‚Ä¢26F - active lifestyle + healthy diet - no known health issues, but heart problems run in my family   ‚Ä¢Diagnosed and medicated for anxiety (as needed) and ADHD (daily)  ‚Ä¢1st shot received June 24th, 2nd scheduled for July 23rd - will update again after then.   My experience:  I canceled my first appointment due to anxiety. I was initially supposed to receive Moderna, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt as an allergy of mine puts me at higher risk of side effects - from Moderna, specifically. Weird.   No healthcare practitioner or nurse told me this despite the fact I informed them of my allergy - I only learnt it through the general literature provided while waiting in line for Pfizer. Also weird!   After getting my dose, I felt fine aside from two minutes of a hotflash. I left the clinic, ran a few errands without issue (aside from an gradually increasing soreness in my arm) and got home just in time to be hit with a wave of fatigue.   My Internet was being installed, and I nearly fell asleep while the techs were around (lol) - they left, and I immediately went to bed, sleeping for nearly 12 hours straight. This is kind of a big deal as I normally take sleeping pills - I did not need them this day as staying awake was more of a struggle than falling asleep.   The next day I woke up with a supremely sore arm and foggy brain. Went about my day as planned, and ended up getting in my very first car accident (woo!) - no serious harm was done to either of us or our cars, luckily.   The fogginess and intermittent disassociation continued for over a week, but my arm began to improve on the 3rd day. I was back in the gym within 72 hours.   On the 4th day, I began to feel extremely faint on top of the disassociation and perceived heart palpitations. I say ‚Äúperceived‚Äù due to my anxiety disorder (the brain is a very powerful thing) and the fact that I noticed them post workout, after taking preworkout and my ADHD medication - double stimulants.   In a panic, I took myself to the ER, sat through blood work, an EKG, etc. and was told by the doctor that he wished his vitals were as good as mine (lol I guess) then sent on my way.   My period was a few days late, but that could be entirely unrelated. As mentioned, I‚Äôll update after my second dose‚Ä¶ or if I have anything else worth sharing.   TLDR: experienced fogginess, intermittent disassociation, perceived heart palpitations, and sore arm.   Had blood work and an EKG ran on the 4th day and was considered perfectly healthy.
341	0	Anyone experience tooth pain/sensitivity to cold and hot?
761	0	It‚Äôs been 7 hours since I got Pfizer first dose and I am feeling tired like hell with a little soreness on my arm.
124	0	I wanted to share my experience so far. I got my shot on 2/5.  Felt fine afterwards but day 2 my legs and feet started to get a tingly/pins and needles feeling and it‚Äôs been like that ever since (today is 2/11). I‚Äôm getting weird ticks and twitch‚Äôs in my legs too. I do CrossFit and I havent been unable to go back. I get so tired during the day after doing something simple like walk my dogs.  My feet have been really cold too.   This sucks.
304	0	I don‚Äôt care if you get the vaccine. Good luck üëçüèº
881	0	had no side effects except for arm pain (lasted about three days) and a tiny 20-minute headache after the first shot.  had second dose about 12 hours ago, at the moment I have a bit sharper arm pain, serious fatigue (took a 3-hour "nap" during the day). no fever yet, but body temperature is about 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than usual, but not over the fever threshold. keeping my fingers crossed for a peaceful night
742	0	1 month and about a week from my second dose, and I'm noticing my arm is still sore at the injection site? I was in the shower yesterday and turned slightly so the water was hitting right on the area where I got the vaccine, and I felt a dull pain. I pressed around my arm with my fingers and the pain is there right at where I remember the injection site was. Has this happened to anyone else? I didn't notice it until yesterday, and feel relatively fine otherwise.
645	0	Shot 1: no side effects other than slight soreness at injection site   Shot 2: no side effects other than slight soreness at injection site   I felt faint and sweaty after both shots because that‚Äôs just how I role, haha. But overall the worst part by far was my nerves and anxiety.
191	0	I have a history of chronic severe depression and anxiety. I received my second dose Saturday around 18:30. Sunday afternoon I experienced depression, apathy and suicidal idealation. I attempted research to see if it was vaccine related but didn't  have much luck. Has anyone else had this type of experience and if so how long did it last?
103	0	Thanks for the update.

858	-1	OK... having known (previously) multiple people who died of it and some that died but not of covid during the pandemic. One has to wonder why Bill Gates would be pushing killing off the populations across the world in a way that led to governments going into shut down. Mate, I'd be more worried about Steve Jobs.  That dude has been about style over substance for a long time.
427	0	M/47 Got my second dose of pfizer about 10 hours ago. I just feel some on and off fatigue at this point.
962	1	I'm almost exactly the same as you. Relatively fit and healthy gym goer from the UK, just a couple of years younger. I'm on day 23 and still have dizziness and breathlessness.   For what it's worth, I went to my GP last week and he told me it was a chronic inflammation as a result of the vaccine and that it could take up to 2 months to clear. He also recommended I ask for another vaccine for my 2nd jab (got Pfizer for my first dose).  I'd double check with your doctor that there isn't any underlying issues to be safe, otherwise it's a case of waiting it out. It's incredibly frustrating and debilitating, and my mental health is taking a bit of a battering, but there's not a lot I can do.
297	0	I agree the pharmaceutical companies are laughing all the way to the bank. üòÅüòÅ  Hope you invested early.  Some guy posted another Instagram guy‚Äôs story that the shot left metal in his arm. Pure Russian propaganda.
471	0	Thank you! I was hearing that if you had a reaction to the first dose you probably won't have one for the second dose, now I see that's not true. Ugh, I'm really not looking forward to #2 because #1 wiped me out pretty good.
991	0	How did it go for you?
225	0	Just got my first dose an hour ago at drive-through vaccination site at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, TX. Feeling a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù: slightly dizzy, lack of concentration, hand of injection arm felt tight and tingly. Otherwise just relaxing
694	0	Hi, I am  a little better, unfortunately not over. I‚Äôm experiencing exhaustion and weakness, especially the left side of my body. My ears are acting up, sharp pain nerve behinds the ear when I touch it. Muscle spasms of my throat and legs. My blood results so far after seen my primary doctor: low thyroid (tsh - high - hypothyroidism) I had a physical on January and everything was normal. She run autoimmune labs, and muscle damage and inflammation (everything normal). I am 100% it‚Äôs the vaccine but my doctor said she could not affirm or denied that it is the cause of my symptoms. Hope it is over soon.
237	1	Had my second dose 20 days ago only 3 weeks after my first dose.Side effects much worse than after the first dose.Currently experiancing following effects (fortunately not all at the same time !)  Nausea - dizzyness - heartbeat racing - tired - pains in bones (especially the ribs) - feeling sick -low blood sugar - short sharp headaches - temperature swings - lack of concentration - brain fog and different thoughts milling around in my brain.  I have said to myself that i will get through this and stay positive . Hope that this will help people to know if they have high side effects or low as this is the only Forum that i could find on the subject.
354	0	I mean If you wanna play Russian roulette be my guest
239	0	Are you feeling better or is the dizziness still present?
567	0	Twice I tried to post a question on this community, but it didn't work, so I'll just leave this here. After the 2nd shot, about 30-36 hours in, I developed a baseball sized spot on my arm about an inch below the injection site. It was hot to touch, slightly swollen, painful and tender, and red like a sunburn. After some research, it sounds like "covid arm", and through my conversation with my doctor's office over the phone, that's what they think as well. It continued to get worse until about 50 hours after the 2nd shot and has since been steadily getting better. Apparently "covid arm" isn't super common, but my understanding is it's essentially harmless and is just a reaction to the mounting response for your immune system and will resolve on its own in a few days.   My experience is a bit of an outlier, since it seems like most incidents of "covid arm" occur after the first shot and delayed (like 8 days later according the to few sources I found online) and lasts for a few days. Mine was less than 2 days after the second shot, and seems to already be resolving. Other than this, I've had basically no side effects to either shot (no headaches, nausea, fatigue, etc.).   I wanted to leave this info somewhere in case someone else has similar symptoms. I tend to worry easily, so it would have helped me a lot to have seen a post like this or to have been able to post my question and get responses. It would have helped to know there were documented similar cases that weren't the click-bait horror stories of clots (the symptoms of which WebMD also describes as warm, swollen, change in color, and painful üôÑ). 4am web searches are absolutely terrifying, so maybe this will help someone else not immediately rush to the fear of doom and gloom.
992	0	Yes something similar. No nightmares but yeah...
449	0	You ended your post so ominously. I hope you're feeling better!
996	0	I've heard it's the other way around. If you already have antibodies, the first dose may have more pronounced symptoms.
228	0	I‚Äôm about 6 days past my second dose.   1st dose‚Äîa breeze! Just pain in the arm.   2nd dose‚ÄîWoke up with slight chills and body aches after receiving it the night before. As the day went on it got progressively worse. From about 11-630 I had really bad chills and body aches. It honestly felt like I had been in a car accident! It was very uncomfortable!! But as random as it came on, it also went away randomly! Around 630 I started feeling better. I slept about 9 hours that night and woke up the next day feeling fine!   When I woke up I had barely any pain where I received the shot but I did have pain in my armpit for about 2 days! I checked and it said some people get pain there due to their lymph nodes!  That‚Äôs about it! I‚Äôm feeling fine now!!
541	0	First shot Saturday, sore arm started that evening and all day Sunday. Monday totally fine. Tuesday ( today) feel some chills and borderline elevated temp, not quite fever.  Bit of a sore throat maybe lurking. Otherwise fine.

703	0	Had my 1st dose Thursday, fatigued all weekend with migraine starting on Sunday. I get migraines frequently but I could tell this was vaccine induced. Felt better today, Monday when I woke up, however by 1pm my migraine came back with a vengeance. It‚Äôs almost 3:30pm & I‚Äôve had loose stools, nausea, vomiting & my temp is creeping up. Right now it‚Äôs around 99 which is a mild fever for me.
391	2	Alright, so after reading through the horrific accounts of peoples experiences on this sub, I was hesitant to go get my vaccine yesterday. But I followed through with it, even despite all the scary anti-vaxx news sites and vids my mom has be sending from all the quackademics.  Was a little nervous waiting in line, but the process was very easy. The shot itself doesn't hurt at all. Tried to keep my arm as relaxed as possible during administration of the vaccine. I didn't feel dizzy afterwards, if anything it was just a little high from an adrenaline rush. Chugged a bottle of water and felt totally fine. Earlier in the day I had eaten some fruit and snacks, as well as took some electrolyte supplements.   Fast forward day 2 and there is still no symptoms other than a slightly sore arm which I am trying to keep moving and active.   Will update after my 2nd shot and let you all know how I feel.  I think this is a great opportunity to help combat the pandemic. Yesterday on the radio I heard 7 Million people wont get the vaccine because they don't know it's FREE! The other half of people voluntarily not taking the vaccine happen to be republicans. Hahah what a world
903	0	Hi- how are you doing now? üò≠ !
10	-1	Thanks for the reply. You are probably correct in the fact of waiting for this vaccine for another year; however, I had my reasons above but also many reservations too. The issue of privacy during the process of getting this shot was maybe more of an observation, then the ‚Äúlack there of‚Äù and wanted to inform others like myself that have never been apart of something like this.
555	0	I felt the same way for a bit too. Currently trying to cut any red meats off my diet hoping it will help my body get back to normal. I‚Äôve only had 1 dose of Pfizer though.
666	0	I'm a 22 year-old male with no underlying health issues. Got my first jab on 15th of June and will get the second dose on the 13th of July. Fortunately, I didn't encounter any severe side effects. I only got mild fever, headache, and pain at the injection site. The whole thing lasted for about 36 hours. Just like other people, I do feel anxious for my second dose as well, hoping for the best though.
27	1	Hi I'm from uk and had mine on 28th jan to,i was so tired for a couple of days after any idea how much immunity we have with one shot?
23	0	It‚Äôs now been 14+ hours since I got my first shot and I‚Äôm good. Arm is a bit sore but that‚Äôs it.
32	0	Can you give me a link to an article saying this plz?
326	0	Ello chums, got my first Pfizer vaccine 7 days ago and here is my experience so far:  Slight soreness in arm as expected, nothing crazy.  Day 2: had a sudden flash of fatigue, I was at work and felt stupid, could barely answer customer questions. Had my gf drive me home cus I didn‚Äôt feel safe to drive a car. Got home, watched a movie and 4 hours after the onset it cleared up it was really strange.  Day 3: no symptoms  Day 4: right at the end of the night felt ‚Äúnot good‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it was, drank a bunch of water and switched to a relaxing activity and that seemed to clear it up  Day 5: Woke up fine, I noticed my appetite was a bit suppressed and wasn‚Äôt able to eat much. Later in the night developed headache/chills/ and felt like the discomfort of a fever but not actually running hot. The night was rough, took many hot showers and sat in front of my mini heater most the time to satisfy the chills. Finally fell asleep and slept through till about 7am next day.  Day 6: Woke up a little more nauseated than the day before so had myself some alka seltzer (felt like a hang over) and immediately went back to bed cus of fatigue. Woke up around 11:00 am and though I was feeling better which was nice cus I was running behind on schoolwork so I was able to focus and get some of it done. Still had no appetite, could only intake liquids like water/smoothie/ and for some reason a banana was accepted by my body. Thought everything was groovy except around 6pm got hit with another wave of fatigue/headache/chills which sucked. Took an ibuprofen 200mg but stomach got upset because I haven‚Äôt been eating so no dice.Went back to the hot showers and heating fan and eventually fell asleep but felt very hot all night.  Day 7(today): Woke up feeling pretty normal, again got a banana down and a smoothie, tried some toast but no dice. Was able to get some more school work done but then again around 6pm hit by a wave of this fatigue/headache/nausea but definitely not as bad as the previous nights. Still haven‚Äôt been able to eat much which is also contributing to my headache and fatigue but drinking lots of water and also pedialyte seemed to help. This time took a ibuprofen 200mg again but tried to fill my stomach as much with water to avoid nausea and it seems to have helped, I‚Äôve kind of snapped out of my ‚Äúchills‚Äù state.   I am 25 M, and don‚Äôt use any drugs or drink alcohol, I also don‚Äôt take any daily medications accept Claritin. I tried to provide as much details as possible to give those considering getting the vaccine an idea of my experience.  Helpful Notes: If you‚Äôre gunna take hot showers, make sure to drink LOTS of water so you don‚Äôt get dehydrated .  Drink plenty of water.  If your appetite is messed up like mine try to eat liquid foods that have calories so your body has something to work with (applesauce/smoothie) or whatever your body agrees with. Any amount of nutrients gives your body what it needs to fight off the invader (vaccine).  Try small doses of Ibuprofen if you can.  Hope this helps!
924	0	Thanks for your reply, I may move my 2nd shot to an actual doctors office just to be extra safe.
105	1	A quick update! On Sunday (4 days after my first vaccine) my symptoms (fatigue) alleviated. Feeling good now!! Looking forward to my next vaccine, but aware the symptoms might be uncomfortable. So thankful for this vaccine!

997	0	(34F) Its been about a week since my second dose.. other than fatigue I didn't really feel anything until now. Last couple of days I've been having weird pains in my inner thigh and arms like clotting. My chest did feel a bit heavy during the week and I have woken up a in the middle of the night due to a tightness. Not sure if anyone has felt the same. Just praying for the best and trying to keep it moving üôè already had covid twice..hoping I can survive the shot and make it past the 3 week aftermark.
739	0	1st dose: My heart would suddenly race. Almost like mini anxiety attacks.   I got my 2nd dose Tuesday (it‚Äôs now Thursday) and on that evening I felt foggy and nauseous. Went to bed early and woke up in the morning with a terrible headache, nausea and felt feverish. Slept all day Wednesday and still had some nausea. Thursday: suddenly getting a sore throat, a cough and sniffles.
273	-2	We have lost .1% of the population in the USA to Covid-19 in over a year. The CARES ACT requires anyone that dies of anything else but covid is present, even it isn‚Äôt covid that killed them, must be coded as death by covid. This was SUDDENLY enacted in March of 2020 by the CDC whose major funding comes from Bill Gates. Suddenly, physicians are being told by the CDC how to code deaths. A death from a heart attack can be listed as covid if covid is even present in the hospital.  This allows the hospital to get 20% more in reimbursements from Medicaid. If they even eyeball a ventilator, add $39,000 to the reimbursement. More people die from cigarettes and tobacco products than covid but hey, the tobacco lobby has the government in their back pockets. The government could make cigarettes illegal but they make too much money off tobacco.  Don‚Äôt think for a minute that the government or pharmaceutical companies care about how you die. They just want to make money off it. Terrified people are making a lot of companies billions of dollars off fear. Good luck üëçüèº
457	0	Hi again friend! It's funny we had this conversation last night because my heart rate is super high todayü•≤ I'm curious can you check your blood pressure?
713	1	THANK YOU- I am scared about getting the second dose because I have a phobia that gives me panick attacks when I am nautious or throw up (me or others) so since I know of a few people who were really sick to their stomach after the second dose, I feel like I am causing myself to feel sick while I normally avoid anything that can put me in that situation so this is really torture for me. I know getting covid is worse than puking but not when you have an irrational, deep fear. I feel a lot better after reading about your experience and your family's.

786	0	Received first dose June 13th 4:45pm, had a sore left arm immediately after. By 9pm the left part of my body didn‚Äôt feel the same as my right side. By 9:30 my chest(left side) was tight. Continued over night when my body is in certain positions while sleeping. Woke up better but the chest muscle tightness has resumed again. Anyone with this same thing experience?
781	0	Hello, I‚Äôm just wondering how your are feeling now. I got my 2nd vaccine 18 days ago And I still have clogged ears, tightness in troat, extremely exhausted and weak, brain fog at times and kind of dizzy, hear rate of 143, and weird bowel movement. Does anyone feel the same? Went to E R everything normal.
623	0	Sounds like urticaria. Are you more itchy after a shower?
444	0	How are you determining at this point what is pseudoscience vs real? When you have qualified ppl screaming about the dangers of these vaccines it seems like a good idea to listen to what they are saying and then compare to both anecdotical as well as scientific learnings.
400	0	1st vaccine- arm pain, and fatigue, early and heavy menstrual cycle.   2nd vaccine (26 hours ago)- arm pain at 3 hours in. Chills and body aches at 13 hours. Low fever at 16 hours. Fever goes up to 101.9 with random sharp pains in limbs and head at 18 hours. Fever persisted for 8 hours. Woke up with a head ache. Its been 26 hours and i feel fine with a bit of a headache still.  Edit: having some nerve pain in the back of my head and also my heart rate is through the roof anytime i stand. -40 hours post second dose.
856	0	My experience as a generally healthy person with rock solid immunity, 30 F, with no prominent pre-existing conditions, and never caught Covid:  First dose of Pfizer was effortless with only fatigue and arm soreness, though period has been more painful than my usual naturally painless cycles.   Got my 2nd Pfizer on the morning of July 12. Fatigue during the day and nausea (up to 150 bpm) in the evening. Went to the ER at 2am due to crazy palpitations and numbness waves/paresthesia in face, upper body and arms (mostly arms). Major anxiety brought on by it, and a few twinges of heart pain. I know this was all side effects as I've never had a panic attack. Multiple test results came back clear but was given a potassium supplement which helped.  The waves of numbness/tingling/palps come and go along with confusion, anxiety, lightheadedness, brain fog, usually occurring at night. On July 13, I couldn't sleep all night due to the numbness waves, but palps were less intense. Limbs twitched a bit while trying to fall asleep, started lucid dreaming and heard a few split seconds' worth of "voices". I know this is not normal for me. Felt better during the day with about 5 seconds of a mild burning sensation on thigh.  July 14 was less severe with redness near injection area, fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath and mild palpitations on and off, starting in the evening (seems pretty common). I try to get some safe sunlight exposure during the day in hopes of regulating my nervous system/circadian rhythm.  July 15 was much better, with only a bit of fatigue, mild nausea during the day, and mild palps and barely noticeable numbness waves in the evening.   July 16/17 - mild heart pains, fatigue and palps on and off in the late afternoon, and especially when lying down to sleep. Seems to slowly be fading.  July 18 - Some fatigue and palps during the day. The heart pains and intermittent numb waves seem to mostly happen when I lie down and try to sleep, though also shortly during the evening.  Planning to ride it out for the next few weeks, then get checked out if necessary.  One interesting thing to note is that my small patch of eczema has mostly neutralized in just 2-3 days, after 2 years. Period is regular for the most part, but has been way more painful after the 1st and 2nd jabs after a year of naturally painless cramps.  I know in my heart that it'll fade eventually.
915	0	First dose went smoothly, the second dose is what gave me the diarreah and throwing up. I did not fill out any type of health form beforehand for the second shot.
30	0	Just got first injection of Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Other than soreness in my arm around the injection site nothing else to report.
500	0	How was your 2nd shot?
97	0	Got my first dose yesterday. Within thirty minutes I had an elevated heart rate and BP, nausea and sweats. Stayed at clinic until everything went down. Within six hours had body aches and a headache. Now about one day after I have a tight throat and ache, body aches, chills and a low grade fever
215	0	1st jab - sore arm started a few hours after. This discomfort lasted a few days  2nd jab - sore arm first day only . Night of jab I had chills and struggled to sleep. Day after I felt tired/lethargic and slept most of the day. Fine after that though
808	0	Thanks for answering how long have you felt pain on your toes? Hope it goes away for you soon!
389	0	Wow you sound like me after my J&J vaccine.  I thought my head was going to explode too, it was soo bad.  Hang in there!
668	0	Thank you, it is a difficult decision, I‚Äôm 36 y/o and always taking my health seriously, eating lots of greens and all that, and this happened. My best wishes to you and hope you get No side effects if you decide to take it.
484	1	I had 2 or 3 drinks the night before.. no side effects 1 day post shot besides some pain near where I was jabbed.   Just don‚Äôt drink too much since it can interfere with antibody formation
461	0	Thank you for the update!! My SO is your age and super active like you so it was great to see how this affected you as were both a bit nervous about getting ours this Sunday. Thank you again!
780	0	I had my first jab on the 11th of June. I had a dead arm for three days afterwards but other than no symptoms. Five days afterwards I started to feel exhausted, I exercise 3-4 times a week normally but the last time I did exercise was 2 weeks ago and I haven't felt like I've had the energy to do anything since then. I have a healthy diet, I'm not overweight, (6ft 2, 89kg, 17.5% body fat).
508	0	2nd shot:  got it around 3:45pm, woke up next day arm slightly hurt but not enough to complain. felt super tired and out of it though. as the day progressed more tired, ended up taking a 3 hour nap. couldn't fall asleep until midnight, figured because of the nap. day 2 after vaccine woke up and started to work. i was extremely slow at work and couldn't focus felt dizzy. stayed hydrated both days (more than usual). headache came mid afternoon of day 2 sat in the shower, more Tylenol... now my head hurt feels heavy and i have experienced dizziness, and chills randomly but they don't last long. no fever but lights hurt my eyes. probably gonna call it an early night and pray i feel 100% tomorrow when i wake up
121	0	You may be fine... I had a rough go, but the worst of it was the first 24 hours or so. I‚Äôve also spoken with folks who felt fine and had no issues at all. I hope you remain in the second camp.
262	0	You are so lucky that you can work from home! When I tried to go back to work just the stretch movement to use the mouse and keyboard had me aching so bad I was shaking.  Oh I feel your pain! When the dizzy spells strike just get on the floor or bed and concentrate on breathing until it passes. Yeah my doctor said similar, just been given a sick note for another week and have to ring up mid week to arrange blood tests.  Keep your fluids up and just rest is all we can do by the sounds of it. With you on the sleep, I've never had so much sleep yet felt so tired!  Me too!

783	0	That‚Äôs my current experience (started on the 3rd day after the 2nd shot) - I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not alone.
822	0	She thinks something about the inflammatory response can reignite old injuries but it‚Äôs just a hypothesis.
868	2	Hey bud,   I understand your reluctance, but now that I am 70 days post shot #2 I am glad I got it. I have zero COVID anxiety when I am out in public, and while the side effects were not fun they only lasted a day or 2 and didn‚Äôt take me out so I would encourage you to go ahead and finish the regiment. Covid sucks, way worse than the vaccine so anything you can do to protect yourself is worth doing. Even my skeptical friends/coworkers are starting to come around on it, I think the anti vaxx movement is just a trend that will die out as time passes. Be well!
583	0	Same headache in day 7,8,9 Day 10,11 less headache but feel bad hot rush sweating and fatigue. No fever
138	0	Ohhhhhhh, I did not know you were being so specific, I thought you initially said, ‚ÄúNO VACCINE IS FDA APPROVED!!!‚Äù Yet the first link I posted shows that there are 80+ approved vaccines. Wow I did not know tetanus and smallpox and polio were not approved. Are you saying the FDA is also lying about the approval of the Ebola Vaccine in this article: https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-ebola-virus-disease-marking-critical-milestone-public-health
