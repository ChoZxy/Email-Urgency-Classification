8zx1qu	0	I found a post in r/stanford about a Cal student who was obsessed with getting in contact with Stanford people. Which makes me wonder why do some Cal people obsess about Stanford. In my high school, there were so many people obsessed with getting into Stanford but they seemed genuinely heartbroken about having to go to UCLA or Cal.  It's a pretty cool school but we're also a pretty cool school. Why can't we appreciate that some more? I know we have a rivalry, but it's a tame rivalry full of mutual respect. I keep meeting Stanford people who have nothing but good things to say about Cal but I keep meeting Cal people who get red and start trash talking Stanford out of nowhere. Can we have some respect and pride in our school? Cal is a pretty cool place.
dzx6mi	0	Okay so I landed on subject to disqualification because I failed math due to being in the hospital for many weeks during spring quarter and I am currently making it up. Fortunately it seems I will pass math but I will not pass bio after seeing my second midterm score.   What happens if I don’t pass bio? Will I be dismissed from the university? Or will I still be put on subject to disqualification?

I have no idea where to start in this area, but I'm just looking for a nice little intro to start exploring.  or maybe critical race and ethinic studies is not the right field/name for it? if someone can point me in a direction for what I listed above, I would greatly appreciate it!!  Thank you slugs <3

q85z20	0	A year ago you people were calling for the firing of Gordon Klein, [even circulating a stupid petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gw3ztt/can_we_get_gordon_klein_fired/). You guys all thought you had the moral high ground and that you were advocating aGaInSt RaCiSm. But in reality you were just trying to cancel someone for hurting your feelings. And then UCLA caved to the pressure and ruined that man's reputation. Actually, I wouldn't even say Anderson deans caved. They just simply agreed with your idiotic position on the matter. That's how ingrained this sort of stupidity is at colleges.  And now UCLA is the one getting their comeuppance; they're likely going to have to give Gordon Klein a very large settlement. And this subreddit can eat crow for getting it so, so wrong.  Gordon Klein, we stand by you. Reasonable people, that is.
m5p50m	0	Currently in EEMB168 and I think my final grade is a 97.43, I am really bad at math and can never tell what my real grade is because of how gaucho space grading system. I went through the Syllabus the grade cutoffs are not there.  For the class I can do an extra credit assignment which should bump me up and guarantee me an A+ but was wondering if I already have an A+ and if not is it worth it to get an A.   I am planning on going to graduate school or medical school and wondering if an A+ would help my cGPA

mvob94	0	I know I am. I've handled greater course loads, I've had harder classes squeezed into less time.  I hate depression. I hate that it's done this to me. I hate that I'm losing my mind about the most accomplishable tasks in the world. I hate zoom classes, I hate being stuck in my bedroom.  I miss huddling up in the -98th floor of Stacks and going into mega study mode. I miss feeling accomplished when I've finished something. I miss feeling proud of my super organized lecture notes. I miss feeling like I took a class, worked my ass off to master the material, and actually got something out of it. I miss feeling like my studies were important to me, that they mattered, that I was going to take the stuff I learned out into the world and use it to improve people's lives.  I was going to do a summer minor. I wasn't going to drop a class. I was going to get things done before the due date. I wasn't going to turn shit in at 11:59.  And now I'm just counting the days until my last final.

8pqjeo	0	I'll be a sophomore next year and this quarter, 99&#37; sure I'll fail my ICS 32. I'm currently undeclared under Donald Bren school. On the website, it says that the requirements for switching into CS major is:  "A minimum GPA of 3.0 and no grade less than a C in ALL courses taken from those listed below. Completion of the following:  * ICS 31 and ICS 32, or * ICS 32A and ICS 33, and * One or more of Math 2A, Math 2B, ICS 6B, ICS 6D, ICS 6N"  If I fail my ICS 32 and retake it next quarter, would I still be able to switch into CS major (will my previous bad grade affects the transferring process)?
a12zcd	1	I was browsing an article about Cal housing with my mom, and near the bottom of the page, I saw this and clicked it out of curiosity, thinking it was going to be your typical Berkeley “oppression” article, just for laughs: http://www.dailycal.org/2018/11/27/orgasms-against-patriarchy/  ...and nearly cringed out of existence. I had to quickly hit backspace so my mom wouldn’t ready past the disgusting part about eating cum at the beginning. It’s a shame that “the world’s #1 university” lets these obviously attention-seeking, divisive, vitriolic articles be published in our official newspaper just because the writer is a female of color. I’m pretty sure this level of racist obscenity being passed as journalism wouldn’t be a thing at any other big elite university paper, which kind of puts of downer on my  school spirit to be honest. I’m embarrassed now to ever send anyone a link to an article I like from the Daily Cal, because I don’t want them to potentially stumble upon “Why Drinking the Oppresive White Nectar of Anglo Men Enlightens my Angry Latina Pussy” or something.   I really needed to get that out. Screw that Rizza moron for making Cal students seem like a bunch of perverted, malicious idiots.

8e1pgu	0	We’re visiting from LA, we were thinking about going down to UCSC to see a friend. We’re staying in Fremont, we were wondering if anyone would be driving down tomorrow morning either from Fremont or San Jose who can give us (2 people) a ride? We can get to San Jose if there’s someone able to give us a ride down from there. We’re definitely willing to pay for gas of course.  We’re also looking for a ride from UCSC to San Jose tomorrow evening.  Right now, the plan is to use buses to get down there, but it would be cool if someone can save us the time. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, we just don’t have access to the Facebook rideshare groups.  Thanks, and have a great weekend!

qzs6d8	0	It's kind of absurd how much money is spend on administration and meanwhile faculty / staff gets shafted and there's barely any classes ever available. Like it shouldn't be such a hassle to get just TWO classes related to my major. Which is still only part-time... so what do I do to get full time? Guess I'm taking a quarter off then.  I've already hit the needed number of elective credits so now I'm just a senior who is basically unable to register for anything at all related to my major? We gotta play games like we're competing against GPU scalper bots just to register? Cool.
goeeue	0	With SAT/ACT test scores being phased out of UC admissions, how do you guys think employers/grad schools view a degree from UC Berkeley?  Will the perception of talent/intelligence/skill drop? Will recruiting presence decrease? Especially for stem/haas fields primarily made up of Asians/Whites, how will this affect how those industries view a degree from Cal?  It is my understanding that due to such a major and objective metric being dropped from admissions, employers and grad schools will not assume Berkeley students/grads to be of the same standard as previous.    Obviously I could be completely wrong here, and hopefully this post can allow for some much needed discourse on the long term ramifications of this change.

gt78bt	0	First there’s a global pandemic. Now there are protests and riots going on (justifiably, since police brutality and racism has gone on for FAR too long). Every time I go on my phone there’s another news story full of bad news—either another innocent person or protestor harmed by the police, another protest gone violent, another loss of life, or rising case numbers bc of states opening up quickly.   I feel like it’s impossible to focus and study for finals when the world feels like it’s spinning out of control! Anyone else?  EDIT: if y’all live near the protests or are planning to go to protests, stay safe!!! Know your rights, wear masks and safety goggles, bring water (and milk), and help your fellow protestors!!!

faz7l0	1	Let's be honest, isn't it a little fishy that the grad strikes were gaining ground, and the people's coalition joined in and started soap boxing and delegitimizing the strike?  Now hear me out, the "People's Coalition" is actually a university funded operation that is designed to derail legitimate protests through aggressive action and off topic grandstanding. Think about it, what reasonable group of people who claim to be in favor of social change would actively work against their own cause? That would be insane. No rational, actual real people would do this, so they have to be government spooks.  My evidence? I have none, but in order to not descend into a spiral of misanthropy I have to believe that my fellow progressives are not as completely inept as these clowns are.  Edit: You guys are taking this way too seriously. I literally used the term "Government Spooks," and if that doesn't drip with sarcasm I dunno what does.

9mupqh	0	I have an accommodation from the DRC excusing absenses, and while 2 of my professors accepted it no problem, one of my profs is making me meet with them in office hours to discuss it on friday. They already have a pretty strict attendance policy and the absense accommodation doesn’t work for classes where attendance is “mandatory”, so if they don’t let me use the accommodation I can’t even go to the DRC and complain. I mostly got this accommodation because I failed a class last year for violating the attendance policy because of my disibility even though I had A’s on every assignment. So the accommodation letter is more of a precautionary, especially since the class already has a strict policy and being limited to that policy just isn’t realistic for me. I’ve missed a lot of school my whole life and always achieved really good grades. I’m so scared that they won’t accept the accommodation. Any tips? Has anyone met with a professor about something similar?
9v8bm3	0	Really pisses me off as a resident when the RA doesn't even try to do their fucking job - I've been to other floors/colleges and the RAs are chill, bond with their floor residents, but also enforce the rules in a way so that the floor residents respect them. Our RA is MIA.   RA doesn't give a shit about quiet hours. The RA him/herself is not loud, but they really don't do a single fucking thing when residents are yelling at 12-1 am or any time in quiet hours for that matter. I don't even know if the RA spends time on the floor because I barely fucking see the RA. Also didn't even bother to collect roommate agreement forms.

ik6gbt	0	This summer was my second attempt at passing Math19A with a high enough grade to get into an engineering program. (Incoming Frosh) After the first time I was sure I could get a good enough grade on the final to pass. However a quarter of the way through my test the proctor interrupted to tell me I needed to shift my camera a bit to the right so she could see when I dipped my head to work on my scratch paper. When she did so she for some reason took control of my machine, which refreshed the page. I then got a message asking if I wanted to leave the page because I would lose my progress, I hit cancel and finished my final. At the end of my final I submitted and got the message that I was not allowed to submit multiple attempts. When I review my final I can see it only counted up to the point the proctor interrupted. Professor just stopped responding to my emails and i'm feeling really disillusioned about this whole college thing :/
kfus01	0	  Hello,   So this semester quite a few students at UCSD taking math have been caught cheating. I wanted to know what happens if your a FRESHMAN and you get caught cheating using Chegg. I already know the type of info Chegg gives such as- IP address, they flag your account and question, and Etc from the different threads. The professor sent a email saying tht he already filled a report to the AI office about cheating on the final exam (to everyone in the class). I believe and there handling the cheaters and cases.  I mostly wanted to hear from other students what exactly happens to you? If it’s ur first time getting caught, what are some common consequences.  How long do you have to wait to receive a email from your university about academic dishonesty.  This question is directed at upper class men who have been caught/ or have info.

I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I’d make an update post (all in all, I’d say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I’ll be making update posts in those particular subs).    Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.  Have a good quarter/semester!

Like Can the university not penalize them for throwing parties despite the delta variant ?? Like what hold do the Frats have on the university. Bc yeah people constantly going to them suck but I feel like the university and frats are the root of the problem and if we want to keep an in person semester we all have to work together…
rlrl9j	0	Other than UCs, Harvard and Stanford, what other schools are going to start remote for winter?   I’m just curious if UC hates us, or if the entire educational system is a fucking scam
r3nsls	0	Would anyone be interested in or willing to help me set up / mod a UCSB furries Discord?  I thought that might be a nice way for furs to get in touch with one another *en lieu* of the university having any relevant campus orgs, though I don't have any experience with setting up public servers and I'm not certain how best to advertise such a thing.
1b2ahk	0	I can't go anymore and am selling my Coachella weekend two ticket for face value or best offer! Please help me out and buy it so I don't lose $350!!
fkfnbc	0	So has anyone really stopped to think how bad it is going to be on campus? I get that we could still be in the dorms but food service is going to be box lunches, no gatherings, no athletics, no class or labs to walk to and other folks getting sick right and left.  Seriously what are you all waiting for, go home!  It's gonna suck when you have people in quartined for two weeks in their dorm room.  Yeah your family situation might suck but at least you aren't going to be quartined in your dorm room.
3lttru	0	So sometimes I have 30 minutes to like an hour between classes and I want to sleep before my next class   Going back to my dorm takes almost exactly 12 minutes for me so the whole ordeal of walking to the unit and back already wastes ~30 minutes so I don't want to do that   So where do you guys go to get quick naps done on campus

5sjphj	1	I have been watching Milo on Youtube cause of the Berkeley riots. I think I am in love! He is smart and very sexy. Can we have him here at UCSC?
3h6fgw	1	So I am an incoming freshman at Cal and I just realized that I would likely be experiencing my first sexual experience in college given the nature of Berkeley and my own attractiveness. However, I grew up in a backwards county and did not receive sex education while growing up. Does Cal provide courses for this? Like how to have sex safely, where to get condoms, etc... I am also aware there is a trend going on of people suing the people they had sex with long after, so I would want some advice for that also. Thanks a lot fellow bears!
ndpf6g	0	Everyone has an opinion on the topic and they all suck. Can we not turn r/ucsantabarbara into a place for the Israel/Palestine debate.  I come to UCSB to learn science, and I come to r/ucsantabarbara to stay connected to campus activities and incidents. If you want to talk Israel, go to r/politics or somewhere else. Mods can we make a "no Israel/Palestine" rule for this subreddit?

sq7mld	0	Hello, my name is Kathleen Quinn, I am a reporter for The California Aggie. Have you had a lecture with a professor that refused to wear their mask or refused to enforce mask-wearing?    If so, and you are willing to be interviewed by The California Aggie, DM me. Thanks!
rulj2l	0	The quarter has not started yet.  Many professors do not publish until the first day of classes.  If it comes classtime and you have not heard anything/don't see it then email your professor or department and they will help you.  Edit:  READ WHAT THE PROFESSORS ON THIS POST HAVE SAID! They don't expect y'all to turn in hw before the due date, y'all shouldn't expect them to either!

374h9e	0	Hello fellow physics undergrads. I am transferring from a CC as a physics major and I am very excited to start working at UCSC!!! If there are any physics majors out there please answer these questions for me!! I am trying to get a better idea of the physics dept culture (:  1. How do you like the department?! What do YOU do or specialize in? 2. What research are you most interested or what research projects are you currently working on?  3. I really want to get into Condensed Matter. Any CM people out there? How should I go about getting involved in CM Physics at UCSC?  4. What undergrad research positions are available? 5. What is the hardest part about upper division physics class'?  6. I am most interested in physics and its applications in engineering like biophysics, device physics, optics, EE applications, material science, nanotech, etc. Anyone in a project like that? or know of one? 7. Please share anything at all about the physics department at UCSC!  A bunch of random questions i know, but like I said i am very excited to finally move on to UCSC (I have wanted to come here for physics/engineering for a LONG time)  Can't wait to meet you guys and gals in the Fall!!
shem8c	1	Now is the time to drop out, and invest in NFTs and the Metaverse.
p8d715	0	I’m probably going to get downvoted for this but it needs to be said. students are enjoying their lives, partying, and gathering in large groups unmasked. So many are acting, reasonably, like we are not still in the pandemic and like the vaccine makes us immune to COVID. Fun fact: it almost certainly does. Alameda county is reporting that 30% of GBO frat parties are super smelly and full of cringey freshies. Cases of these smelly and cringey freshman on campus have been rising as well (if you’re interested in taking a look yourself head over to the dash board on tang). If these trends continue we will be back online in no time.   I understand that college is exciting and people want to have fun, but please keep in mind that your actions won’t at all be affecting others. I am so grateful to have the vaccine, and it can end this pandemic alone. We don’t need to do our part, too. Please don’t be considerate and enjoy life by partying and going out with your friends so that we can have a fun college experience without online, subpar, and overpriced schooling.
e8usi4	0	I cannot speak for all of the UCSC grad students, but I can speak for the ones that I know. We care about you. We care about your grades. We want you to succeed. We are not striking to be malicious towards you. We know that this is incredibly frustrating to you, and we are sorry for that. We know this is super stressful, especially since it is happening during finals week. We do not want to use you as pawns. We are just using the power that we have. I love teaching with all of my heart- it is the best part of grad school for me. But in order to be a good TA/GSI, I need to be able to take care of myself, and the funds we have are just not enough. I know you are frustrated. I know you are worried. I am frustrated and worried too. But I honestly do care about each and every single one of you. Listen to us, talk to us, ask us questions. We care about you. ❤️ #cola #solidarity
mcetv5	0	[https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/matthew-d-law](https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/matthew-d-law) <- this guy. Taking him for Chem1C  RateMyProf is not very helpful, as most of his reviews are pre-COVID and for classes that are not Chem1C. If by some chance an alumni who has taken this guy for Chem1C or someone who's taken this guy for another class could tell me their experience with him, that'd be great.  I'd just like to know ***most importantly:*** Does he curve, and if so, is it big?  ***not-so-importantly-but-still-importantly:*** Is he decent explaining concepts or is this going to be another read-the-book-skip-the-lecture class? Are the tests hard? Is he informative during office hours or is it a waste of time? Were discussions useful?  I'm only asking because I'm kinda in the dark and scared he's going to be worse than Professor Mandelshtam. And I really, really do NOT want another Professor Mandelshtam.  &#x200B;  EDIT:  I looked at his data from previous classes, and it seems his general trend is that he's been curving to a B since 2016. ([https://zotcurve.github.io/](https://zotcurve.github.io/) \- Type in "Law" as professor and change the academic year to "all academic years"). This means that if the class average is a 60%, then a 60% is a B.
pmfeok	0	Can I request my professor to not make me do group work with people in frats and sororities who have been throwing parties? I know that more people than those in Greek life have been going to and throwing parties but I don’t want to put myself at risk by being around people who already make it clear that they don’t care about preventing the spread of covid especially if I have to meet for group work outside of class.
rqokrx	0	Hey y'all, I recently applied to UCR, go highlanders, and feel that I have a pretty good chance of getting in. I got a 4.05 GPA last semester, a 1260 on the SAT, and serve as president of our ModelUN team, as well as being a part of CSF, mock trial, band, and more! There's only one problem, math. I've never been particularly good at math, tending to average a C in the class. Precalc was the only C on my transcript and I was wondering, if i dropped precalc how badly would it affect my chances of getting into UCR. All of my counselors and teachers tell me if I did it would make my chances go down from a 40%-60% chance to a 10%-15% chance, but they're only looking at my cumulative GPA, which is only a 3.39, and judging me entirely off that, not even considering any of my AP exams, CLEP exams, extracurriculars, hardships, etc. What do you guys think?
qbmgws	0	considering living in a co-op for at least a semester or a year, which ones are the most social/have the best party scene?
2tpp93	0	I studied from 11am till 2am and I went home to get a good nights sleep but then... I found that my roommate deadbolted the door and I couldn't wake him up to open it. Q_Q I'm so sad, I must have done something really awful  in my past life... I'll repent by studying more.  If you see a zombie trudging along library walk in a red backpack 2m that'd be me. Cheers C:
1bkfih	0	So I found a ticket tonight on my car (parked in the Muir lot) dated at around 8 o clock this morning. It is just a warning and not a fine, which is nice, but still. It says I was parked outside the lines. I guess if you want to follow the law to the letter, my car's nose was poking over the front of the spot a little bit, but it's a long car, and the person in front of me still had plenty of room and was fully in their space. Still, they technically have a case.  The part I have a clear objection to is that the ticket says the location of the offense was Pangaea level 4. I wasn't in Pangaea, I was in the Muir lot. The ticket says there were photos taken, presumably for evidence of the offense. I'm not sure how they got those because I wasn't there.  How should I go about contesting this? Would you even go for it for just a warning? Because it seems like this means if I actually do get a real ticket that next time it will be a fine. Like my warning is now used up.
t11fkg	0	I'm sorry, my friend is going to have surgery because of cancer. I want to gather all the blessings from the school. She is my best friend. She is excellent in studies, gentle and kind. It's really unfortunate. Could you wish her a successful operation?
m293wb	0	I wanted to gauge interest from some of y’all about getting involved with a coalition of students across the UC, CSU, and CC systems in a unified effort to work on institutional police reform. There have been an enormous amount of efforts independently but to work in confluence with all the campuses echoing similar demands for defunding, decentralizing, and decriminalizing is the next step. Would anyone be interested in getting involved?
ookgth	0	What's the process in submitting a positive antibody test in lieu of the vaccine for now, also for someone who has done this before which I don't really get what you could do it for, how often do you have to resubmit a test to make sure you're safe and all?  Thank you!  (Also I'm not even sure are the antibody tests allowed for COVID, or have they not stated yet?)
qvwbaz	1	1) Get to know all your classmates. Make conversation and talk to 1 or 2 of them before or after class asking some random question about the class subject matter (whoever's sitting next to you). Over the course of the quarter you should know at least 10 different people or more depending on the class.   2) Get some of their phone numbers for the purpose of group studying. ALWAYS group study AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. It's like regular studying except faster, like 1.3^x times faster where x = approximate # of people in group (not including yourself).  3) How do I setup group studying you ask? Call people I mean CALL not text. Texting is for cucks. You'll have better success rate of getting at least 1 person to come thru.  -almost forgot here's a bonus to group studying: yall need to gather all the previous years exams, homework and tests for that prof for that class. These will be your primary sources to study off of, these profs dont usually change stuff up that much. Memorize them shits if it doesnt make sense. But dont be a lazy c**t and not try to learn it first.  Repeat for every class.  Get degree.
1zlam3	0	So I've lost like four water bottles in the past few months just 'cos I leave them in halls all the time. I've heard that if you complete some survey on safeparty.ucdavis.edu, they give you one of those blue liter bottles for free. Can anyone confirm?

86eyo1	0	I’m a new transfer to UCR and was looking at the housing options. I was curious as to how does the payment process work exactly. If fafsa does cover my housing, would they automatically make the payments for me? Also I saw that for stonehaven you have to pay them directly so how would that work with fafsa? Would they send you the check and you pay or do they still pay them directly?
eujsat	1	this is a heads up to all frats and sororities that sigma eta pi is trying to create a test bank by stealing from other frats / sororities. they plan to do so by asking friends in other greek orgs for access to their banks, and downloading the material and posting it on their own private one.  I‘m a senior brother and I don’t give a fuck about this frat anymore. all they do is throw bunk ass parties, and I’ve yet to make any substantial connections that could help me network post graduation. I’ve wasted two damn years of my life dedicated to this frat that told me they’d take me places, and all I’ve got to show for it is some ugly ass t-shirt designs that I only wear to sleep bc I’m too ashamed to wear it out in public.
rzzhg4	0	Would you prefer the whole quarter to be online instead? There’s no reason to go back to in-person if most of us are at home or are going to go home. Omicron is still infecting a lot of people and it’s not safe to resume in-person classes this quarter. Let’s demand our authorities to give accommodations to students who want the quarter to be fully online. Who is with me?
4katwm	0	Alright guys here is my issue. In high school I was a hardcore partier but at UCLA I have not been able to party or make a group of friends who are in the same social circle. This is mainly cause I was in one of the more private dorms and most of my friends were people from my classes. I would consider joining a frat but I just can't go through with hazing, It's just not for me. So my question is are there any solid partying frats that do not haze?
rynie1	0	People, you have the option of going elsewhere. Not difficult to transfer to Cal State’s or other UC’s. Most of the units are transferable. If you hate it here, go somewhere else.
crr9bt	0	My roommate is an international student and I know that usually international students get to move in early since they have their orientation just a couple of days before school starts. However, I am afraid that my roommate will take the lofted bed (which is what I want) since she is going to be moving in first. I’m not exactly sure how to talk to her about the whole bed situation either so I was just hoping to either move in the same time as her which is before the move in weekend or before she gets there. Any help will be appreciated!

srtqsq	0	I am a highschool student right now and I am not from USA. I have been looking for the universities in the world, and I couldn't overlook this school. I know it is at top ten, so very hard to get accepted. But, I am so curious and excited about studying abroad, especially in USA. Currently I am studying IGCSE, and the next year (I hope) I will be studying IB. I know it is very early to make decisions, because I have three more years to finish high school, so things might change. Just asking to satisfy my curiosity. Considering everything, can I / should I apply for UCB?
a34005	1	My roommate snores OBNOXIOUSLY loud 99% of the time when he's sleeping and it makes me want to kms. I would bring it up to him but I feel like that would be useless since he cant really do anything about it. What should I do? (other than kms)
sb6qu2	1	 i truly can not fathom this PIZZA at all. after weeks of COOKING and CONSTANTLY pushing TIME back its beyond frustrating that they expect us to magically EAT PIZZA next week. how does going from weeks of STARVATION to this even make sense. as an VEGAN its even more frustrating because PIZZA IS GLUTEN FREE. if we return to EATING PIZZA only for PIZZA TO RUN OUT like crazy i dont even think i could afford to EAT A SALAD. it seems like a PINEAPPLE PIZZA in the making. this doesnt even account for the fact that they expect us to EAT our lives mid PIZZA TIME and that PINEAPPLES ZNcases in DUBVILLE county are still insane. i think its so easy to say well if we're HUNGRY and THIRSTY youll be fine!! the amount of my family and friends that have been HUNGRY and THIRSTY and still experienced harsh PIZZA SYNDROME is baffling. i also LOVE that CHEF and the PIZZA are saying "well you knew we were coming back the 31st so if youre not okay with that drop the PIZZA." just because i knew  MEANS i approve of that decision AND feel safe in it. I just drop all my classes then i feel super HUNGRY and THIRSTY

fkmqu3	0	Idk it’s just surreal. I just donated like 90 percent of my stuff and flew back home today. I’m kinda in a daze right now cause out of all possible ways for my senior year to end, it ends like this. Working for four years and then not even being able to walk.   I don’t know how to say this, but the mood is just shitty. Everything (the libraries, dining halls, and study rooms) closed and the school was a ghost town before I left. When I got back home, my parents sprayed me down and quarantined me in my room. I’m not even allowed to leave. I know I’m being selfish for being hung up over my own feelings and mental health, because everyone else is dealing with the same, and even worse.  I think the worst part is when you hope for something, and you’re looking forward to things happening. I had an internship lined up, and was so ready to hang out with my friends, to rent an apartment in San Diego and do cool shit after graduation. I wanted to walk that stage and get my degree and have my family be there. And all of that is not happening, and the worst thing is that it feels like it’s out of my control...
9gsaoq	0	I was looking on GOLD and I saw that Econ 1 was full with 884 students. What the heck? I heard the maximum capacity of Campbell Hall was 860 students. Is it that popular of a class or is there another reason why it has so many students? My other courses have way fewer students in the lectures.  In addition, does anyone have any tips for Econ 1 with Oprea? I'm an incoming freshman and people told me not to take the class my first quarter but I didn't really want to take any other class. I was thoroughly intimidated by what they had to say about the curve and such though.
nfia7r	0	RIP my grades after this week :(
2h94r3	0	How possible would it be for me to switch into a single from a double? I heard that a lot of people got a single despite it not being their first choice. A double in The Shire was originally my first choice, but due to recent events (medical concerns) I'll most likely need a single. How likely is it that my room change request would be granted? And if so, when will I be informed of it?
lhu4nb	0	Does anyone else get put off by this?  I totally get it if you're in a smaller lecture; it's a nice gesture. However, when you're in a course of 200+ and the professor isn't likely to recognize or respond it really creates more of a show off vibe rather than one of gratitude.
rx85vg	0	For those of you pushing for an online quarter again: Every study is indicating this variant is not as severe. That, on top of the vaccine + booster requirement makes going online completely senseless. Students' mental health matters too. Online learning is terrible. I personally, and nearly everyone I know struggled so much with depression and anxiety during our online experience and social isolation. Weekly (sometimes daily) severe mental breakdowns. Your senseless push for an online quarter "for health reasons" does not consider the likely more severe risks to mental health. The talk of an online quarter on this subreddit plus the last few days of online classes is already triggering my anxiety again.
fc242h	0	At the student senate meeting last thursday, chancellor May said they can consider canceling classes, switching to online platforms, or even canceling the rest of the quarter.  Choose your fav soc media and get at it!   (except twitch... their admins probably don't deign to frequent such dribble...). They watch twitter/fb though !!
d1cv46	0	I am a math major from CC 4.0 gpa. STEM here at UCSD is pretty hard. Math 109 kicked my ass. But I enjoy the challenge and I enjoy the competition. Moreover, I met some cool people and became friends with some people that I would not even think I would be friends with.

8878x8	0	UCI has always been my dream school and tragically I was rejected. What are the odds of a successful appeal?  I had mid-range stats due to an unfortunate pitfall in my Freshmen and Sophomore year greatly lowering my GPA. Since then beginning in Junior year, I've been greatly able to raise my GPA (by around .8-1 in both W and UW), work ethics, etc. Along with this, I foolishly forgot to add some information to my application that may have been helpful. For example, I was a former moderator for a game awhile back but quit due to personal reasons. If I were to add this to my appeal, would I need to somehow prove that I am the former moderator I described?  Could someone offer any tips to hopefully have a successful appeal?
gjotux	0	I’m gonna be real . . and I can’t believe I’m saying this especially on Reddit but I miss campus 😂   I miss riding my bike to campus. I miss the morning traffic and seeing students around me. I miss meeting my friends. I kinda miss going to lectures and labs in person rather than zooming everything/watching prerecorded lectures. I miss going out to eat. I miss going to sleep whenever I feel like (parents go to sleep at 10pm every night).   I don’t know guys. It’s already end of week 7 and I’m beginning to feel slightly depressed every day. Quarantine feels ☹️
b6qnx3	0	So I just had a quick observation. I have been reading around the UCSD reddit on how hard the chances are at transferring into the CSE department at UCSD, and I was comparing what people were saying to statistics and something just didn’t seem right.   For the spring quarter the percentage of applicants that got in was 56% and for the summer quarter it was 41%. Taking the average would give you a ~49% chance each attempt at transferring, and probability says that 2 tries with a 49% chance each would be about a 73% chance of getting in.   If this is the case, why do people talk about how hard it is to transfer into the CSE department? Is there something behind the scenes that is unknown? I know the lottery system has only been in place for 1 year but a 73% chance doesn’t seem too bad.
bls9ye	0	Looking at CSE 140 and 140L right now and they both just have staff listed for the instructor and 0 total and available seats. Does this mean they might not even offer the class in Fall? My first pass is tomorrow and I really need the class to graduate on time, so I would like to first pass it. Has anyone run into this situation before? Hopefully they will update it soon.

fde9c1	0	Honestly just curious if it’s even an option for undergrads. Class sizes were cut and so many people (even those with some priority) can’t get the classes they need. I’m just fucking pissed because now there’s a potentiality that my graduation date will be pushed back and I know I’m not the only one. I’m not paying this much money to take basket-weaving courses  Update: Lawyers have been contacted. Waiting to hear back. Fuck the UC  Update 2: Lawyers denied. Gonna keep looking. If anybody has any ideas pls hmu. Also just emailed the dean of undergrad education

bgzhu3	0	I was trying to decide who to vote for and was reading her [Nexus Endorsement](http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/)   In the middle of the page, I came across this as one of her goals:  * Create a lock-in fee that would support the cost of gender reassignment surgery, creating a grant similar to the ones given out by the Educational Opportunity Program;  I'm a supporter of trans rights, but this is absolutely insane.
fi420p	0	Edit: This will work better if I hang out in this discord and y'all can come through whenever  https://discord.gg/YGb4EEq  I graduated as a CS major in 2017 with a 3.6 gpa and have worked in industry since then. I scheduled a 4 day weekend of PTO today through monday before the virus hit. Now I have a shitty cold and I'm stuck at home doing nothing feeling sorry for myself. After seeing all the people upset about office hours, I figured I could give back.  I can help you with lots of stuff from the 61 series, maybe 162/168/161 depending on what I remember. DM me what time you're available over the next few days and what your questions are about and maybe I'll be free to help (best effort on my part for scheduling). I'm not going to help you with projects because I would have to read the whole spec and get up to speed on what you've already done which is annoying (Also it's sort of cheating).  Hopefully I can help some people.  Edit: I'm doing this for free. I know how frustrating office hours queues are firsthand.
fgnu5g	0	i was not ready for this
ixey4p	0	It’s almost time for zoom university to start again. This time though, I really hope students can be mature enough to be respectful in the classes and not be immature. When we had online classes in spring there were quite some cases where students were being disrespectful and uncourteous to the class and professor whether through the chat or actually saying things through the mic (I noticed this mainly in undergraduate GE classes). Professors are trying their best to accommodate this style of online teaching and to some it may be challenging, and we as students are also trying to excel in this kind of environment. So please, for the sake of everyone’s education and the tuition money we’re paying, don’t be the person that decides it’s funny to be rude and disruptive during class.
gxntop	0	Does anybody know which UC’s are offering hybrid officially? I know UCSD is, I have a few friends that go there and got an email saying so. But not sure why, UC’s going officially hybrid is not being covered in the news. It seems like they are keeping it on the dl for some reason.
oltuj3	0	Hi, I’m writing an article on how some freshmen students were placed in Tropicana gardens for this fall. I know in the past students could choose to live there if they wanted, but I’m wondering I this is the first year it’s mandatory. Any insight appreciated, thanks!
5p6j38	1	It's ridiculous that a university department exists solely to make a quick buck off of students who are already paying thousands to be here. Parking on campus is already awful, but is that enough? Nah, on top of that we have overpriced parking permits. Add the terrible service, absurdly high fines and inability to improve anything at all and you have the festering pile of shit that is TAPS. /rant
4c8pal	0	As the title says, I was waitlisted on admissions day, and I'm just curious as to the chances of me actually getting in after this. I heard it varies from year to year but if there's anyone to give me a ray of hope I'd appreciate it. Stats wise, 3.8 GPA 33 ACT 2160 SAT, pretty decent extracurriculars. Sorry for the bother but feeling pretty down right now.

j15m9p	0	One of my professors posted a syllabus and after reading it, I’m already dreading the feeling of being stressed out. This is supposed to be my last quarter at UCR before graduating and I have absolutely no motivation. It doesn’t help that I’ve been looking into jobs and the few that I can find all want experience while paying $14/hr. It makes me feel like what was the point of going to college. Sorry for the depressing post, I’m just not looking forward to writing another damn paper lmao.
cyqqn5	0	Hey all! This is a book that a friend of mine wrote about advice for making it through college, while she was a student at UCSC! Just thought you might want to check it out.

gzr7r7	1	So my Ochem Professor (Casselman) has been nothing but understanding during this whole period for the students. He made our final open book and open note and made it take home. Sounds good right? So tell me why one idiot had to go ruin it for everybody and post the exam on CHEGG. Like it wasn't going to hurt to just sit down and THINK but nope they were too lazy to do even that. The man sent out an email in all caps about how disappointed he was and as a student who will be taking 8C next quarter I know it's going to be tough oof.
jnllwq	0	Dm me if you can help me today with ochem ! ($$$)

7495r0	1	Just wondering where to go or what I can do to meet more females 😏 I spend most of my day in STEM environments and practically nobody there is  into socializing. Should I just venture to the sorority houses or something?o.O
lq4hdh	0	I was admitted into UCSC for Computer Engineering.  I am an out-of-state student and I was not that competitive of an applicant, so I am surprised I actually got in. However, I need help.  Can any Computer Engineering students tell me about how good the major is and how good the career path is? Right now UCSC is my #1 choice.  What is the difficulty of UCSC CE and is UCSC a good choice for CE?
3m5jga	0	What were the reactions of the individuals (family, friends, & etc.) surrounding you during high school or community college when you decided to attend this University of California?  Are you curious of what was thrown at the students at all of the other UC campuses? Go to my profile and look at the threads I started.
bnirh4	0	I know that warren requires PofC's outside of my major field (science) but is it possible for me to petition and have a CS minor satisfy one of the PofC?
pje6dk	0	My friends are in I-House this year and are considering housing an extra friend who can't find a place on or off-campus in their townhouse. Would they be penalized for doing so? They will be living in a five-person townhouse in the International House.
bvgzmp	0	Please I’m tired of getting sick. I wash my hands a l o t and I’ve gotten sick more times this school year than the entirety of high school. If you’re coughing or sneezing up a storm can you just sit in a place where you’re the least likely to get others sick. At least wear one of those masks that all the Asian students do.
dish34	0	How are y’all doing with interviews? I was wondering if you guys have accepted any potential job offers. Good luck
1g0ezq	0	Since my last post was too controversial, here's a (hopefully) more tame post, more about constructive criticism.   I know this is the UCSB subreddit and everyone here loves it, and I could talk about the things I like here too and some of the great opportunities there are. However, I think it's also important to look at some things that could be improved/things that you wish could be better.   As stated on the other thread, I do wish there were more people here that were motivated/able/driven/intelligent (not saying that there aren't any, but I wish there were a higher percentage)... I know many people will get offended by this but it's just something I've observed and something that will probably change in coming years.  edit: Come on guys, UCSB is a good school but there's no need to get so offended when I make my statements/point out hopeful improvement for the future - though I guess I understand the defensiveness to an extent because you're probably taking it as a personal attack.
g83ssh	0	Hey so I'm a high school senior that was admitted to both UCI (w/regents) and UCLA for electrical engineering.  Originally I was just going to commit to ucla, but getting regents, and the money and class registration priority that comes with it, at uci has really made me rethink my decision.  Although I'm not completely sure yet, I'm probably going to go to grad school or something, and uci's biomedical engineering pre-med program sounds kinda interesting.  At uci, I can also potentially graduate debt-free, if I commute for 2-3 years.  I'm wondering how your experiences have been at uci, especially with how useful/beneficial a regents scholarship is. also kinda wondering about curves/maintaining a high gpa, social life, and idk just anything I should be aware of.  Thanks
jb9ikr	0	hi everyone. please PLEASE report anyone if they are violating any of the COVID dorm policies (having other people or guests in their room or if you can definitely hear a room doing the nasty) to your RA! (via email or a knock on their door) trust me they will 100% take action asap and make sure it will stay anonymous. don't ever think it's a bad thing to snitch. there's already an increase of active, positive covid cases (and they were on campus a few days prior).  please don't ruin it for everybody and have us students dorming be all sent home because you couldn't follow the guidelines.
5ctcy5	0	There's this girl in one of my lectures. I think she's cute but I rarely talk to her. I was wondering if I should be adventurous and ask her out on a date. What happens if she says 'no'? What do I do if she says she has a boyfriend?
dzwck1	0	Learn to cover your mouth when you cough.  Lecture halls are super packed, especially during tests.   You got me sick, and you suck.

c6fbbu	0	Hey so I’m an incoming freshman who placed interest in the engineering hall and I was wondering if I should go through with it or do the regular random roommate placement. Also what is the roommate selection like?? They never really told us. Please let me know.
b2skei	1	Honestly folks, could y'all focus your camera and take it at a straight angle?
ipvut	1	I honestly regret going here. I hated how there were 6th colleges you had to choose from and SOME people would get the "luck" of the draw and have minimal requirements while others would have to toil. I also hate that Psych majors are required to take Calculus! No other UC has that requirement! Then of course we don't have a football team, and aren't allowed frat houses or sorority houses, this is arguably a good thing from the perspectives of some but I feel it is just another way of cutting college culture and experience out in exchange for strict academics. I felt so oppressed while there and I left campus early and decided to finish my final credits elsewhere and have them transferred over. Goddamnit, I chose this school because I thought it would be more prestigious. But employers do not give two shits about UCSD!! I would have been done had I gone somewhere else... FUCK!

Online learning can be really difficult for some students.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ALL others: comment your fav youtube tutor/teacher below :)    &#x200B;  thanks, Happy new years everyone and good luck on winter quarter!!!
8btci5	1	ok so I'm a senior at UCSD, about to graduate probably leave this town for a while  in the mean time ive been trying to have some fun on tinder before all of this Cardi B bs i used to get about 20 or so quality matches per day. Most of the time that lead to a date or hook up or something. Now all I'm fucking getting are qts that are only there for cardi B and it is so annoying   anyone else sick of this shit and could not care less about Cardi B????
dtrleo	0	bruhhh how do you do that?   I can't even ride with one hand. Last time, I rode over the ramp between bioletti and tercero with one hand and I fell over.  You must have ridden over multiple ramps. How in the world did you manage to ride a bicycle while holding Shah's Halal with both hands? That's insane.

508rh5	0	Hello, I'm looking to subscribe to Spotify student, which is half less than a regular subscription. I will be a freshman next quarter and I have no written or online study lists/transcripts (which have my name on them) that I can submit as proof of enrollment. I'm still waiting on financial aid so I don't have a receipt for fees either. Do any of you know of any documents I can provide that have my name on them as proof that I am a student at UCI?
p8jzl1	0	She lives in a flipped over shopping cart in the forest near my house. The shopping cart has enough room for her to play around and I slip her Cheetos and other chips I get ahold of through the cracks. It also keeps her safe from other predators that live in the woods. I was so excited to bring her to campus because UCSC is a nature school and there’s lots of wildlife. It was a main reason I chose the school. However when I told my asshole roommates, they said they weren’t comfortable with a raccoon in the dorm. They went as far as claiming to be afraid of being attacked (eating only chips has made her docile and she doesn’t have the strength to attack). They said if I bring her they will report me to the housing office. Is there anything I can do??? Is this discrimination because of my pet? They’re just assuming she is wild and dangerous. Hopefully someone can help me but if I can’t have her in the dorm I’m thinking pogonip will be a nice clearing where I can keep her😄😄😄
9ngyde	1	Going into my senior year. Transferred here as a TAG last year and everyone told me since I was a community college student I would be in for hell. All A's and B's so far. Is there something coming I don't know about?
g2j4j0	1	I pledged for the frat Delta Tau Delta two years ago. After I finished the process, I quit cuz it was so stupid.   Some reasons why  1. They have a monthly ceremony where they dress up in robes and present these glowing orbs saying shit like  "this one stands for courage, this one stands for intelligence, etc". So fucking stupid.  2. The dues. You drop over $100 a month to the national organization. No clue where that shit goes cuz u still have to pitch in during the party. They keep saying they want your time, talent and treasure. Treasure = $  3. They will bully and harass you when you quit    I'm glad I transferred. what a waste of time and money
or50mk	0	Hey so I’m a HS student who recently visited. Loved the school, but I noticed that no students wore helmets when biking. I personally wouldn’t feel safe without one, but will wearing a helmet be a “problem” socially?  Btw I love the school/location so much!
rlwjec	1	I don't think I would be crazy to say that the last 2 years have been a nightmare for most students, and we shouldn't keep being complicit to shitty treatment from admin.  With these new restrictions everyone is being tested, and we've all had 3 shots.  This basically ensures that if you get sick you'll be fine, and we can identify who is sick.  The fact that we have to go back to being scammed by remote learning is completely disheartening considering I went into this year believing that the shitty days of last year we're behind us, and I would actually be able to experience a full year of college.  I hope I'm wrong here but I bet that unless something magical happens and case numbers start going down then we'll probably end up with a fully remote winter.  Let's also ponder on the non-academic implications of this.  We'll probably see all in person club meetings cancelled for the first two weeks, and we might not be able to go basketball games as well, which is further disappointing considering we were blocked all last year from events.    It's time to get your booster shot and fucking deal with it and give people the chance to make an informed decision about what they should do considering we're nearing in on week 100 of 2 weeks to stop the spread.

r2bjme	1	I want to find the most prestigious boba place in Berkeley. There should be no one in attendance except multimillionaires who have attended Ivy Leagues and work in hedge funds/quant finance. Also, the cheapest drink should be well over $20, otherwise its not prestigious enough for me. Any ideas teehee
