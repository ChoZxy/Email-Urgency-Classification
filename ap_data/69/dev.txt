jchtci	0	I know there's been a lot of arguments on here against 16 recently, but I believe that prop 16 is not nearly as harmful as many are painting it out to be.  Federal law will still confine race in admissions and hiring to being just one factor (out of many) for the compelling reason of fostering diversity.   It's important that UCLA's student body match the demographics of California and that students of color are given opportunities and not penalized for for being of low socioeconomic status. Right now UCLA is underrepresented when it comes to latinx, black and native americans. We need to do better and prop 16 is the way to do it. UCLA will finally be able to accurately claim it is diverse with 16 in place, which will repeal prop 209 and delete harmful language from the California constitution.  16 will create opportunities for everyone. Thank you.

ol29j6	0	In the last year and a half, it seems like the shirts and sweatshirts at the bookstore have had pretty lackluster designs. Why can't they just have a simple UC Davis seal design, like every other university has? Or a t-shirt with a pocket and Gunrock is sticking his head out of it.

imsueu	0	Before you guys crucify me for this-  I don't go in any public places anymore, and in my mind going to a public place where a bunch of potentially sick people are also going seems super dangerous to me. This would be the first time since march I would be in a public place with other people, and I am not willing to take the risk of getting coronavirus now just to fulfill some requirement.   That being said- I know there are opt outs for employees, but what about students?  Thanks!

fleyd1	0	It's pretty clear that no one gives a shit about COLA anymore, since there are no in-person classes either way. I can't help but feel that there's a hidden meaning behind this, that the unstoppable forces of nature make the unified voices of the masses a mere hiccup. I mean, think about the strike on Sproul. The GSIs must've felt like they made their voices heard, that they made a difference -- but now, they're just worried that they didn't contract the virus from some sociology student participant.  It's really hard to talk about political or economic change when our main threat is not other human apparatuses, but an act of nature.

piwg7p	0	Hello everyone,  I  am currently in Soc Sci 3A with Professor Morgan for sumner session 2 and we are going down into our final paper this week. I am sort of unsure if I am formatting it right and was wondering if anyone who had him in the past could show me what their paper looked like so I know if I am in right path?  If you can, I would really appreciate it!   Edit: Clearly some of you misunderstood this post. What I meant by formatting I meant like just having an intro and hypotheses in APA format but having a bibilio in MLA and it made me wonder if I was following the basic structure. Btw, we each have a different topic we chose in a past assignment so I wouldn‚Äôt do that but it‚Äôs good to know that some of you here in this sub Reddit wouldn‚Äôt help a single fly or ask more questions.

1d3cq8	0	So i just got out of my first econ 41 midterm today, I feel that I totally failed the class. I had half finished answers as far as the eye can see. It was terrible. I'm probably gonna end up retaking the class with my Columbian TA in the summer. My professor Rojas' got some mixed reviews. From what i can tell, don't use the book cause its horrible, but his lectures and practice midterms don't help at all. Anyone got any tips? advises?
qrw59d	1	Though I went to a different school (Go Ags!), my child is a Cal student.  When I see someone in Cal regalia, can I tell them "Go Bears" or have I not earned this privilege?  If I can, does this power go away when my student graduates?    I think I should be able to, since I'm proud of my student (plus I send them fat checks). On the other hand, I'm one of those loud people.  Go Bears!
22jx7l	0	I can understand when attendance is mandatory or there's clickers... But what's the point when that isn't the case? I just saw a student sitting in front of the class completely KO'd with his head on the desk. Honestly what's the point if you're not going to learn anything.   EDIT: people seem to think that I'm trying to change them, I don't really care. I'm just curious on the thought process of those students since my immediate response to falling asleep is to leave.

Though I couldn't see your smile through the mask, it would have warmed me with the strength of a gently used microwave.

Your voice tinkled with the sound of a thousand wind chimes, annoying everybody within earshot.  Call me.

rxx3t4	0	Does anyone else agree that UCLA should just announce the same extension of remote learning to go back in person on the 31st like the other UCs (UCD,UCSC,UCSD,UCI) instead of making us wait and guess until next week. I mean, if all the other schools are all doing the same, why wouldn‚Äôt UCLA, located in the most severe county with cases not follow suit. I hope they just announce it already to 1. let people know what‚Äôs really going on, 2. Let oos and international students plan their travel accommodations, and 3. Let this surge pass so we can just finish the year in person. Thanks for reading my mini rant.

rzkf5o	0	Yang is a hack, but people are overreacting. It‚Äôs a tough situation, and this at least gives us a chance to have some in person. If a prof really wants to do in person, they can.

Not a perfect decision, it does put responsibility on profs, but students will just deal with their profs decisions and that‚Äôs that.   What do you think?

bwj57m	0	A well-connected facutly member informed me of the school board's plan to hide professors names from students for courses during registration on GOLD. Some of the faculty dislikes that students can utilize resources such as rate my professor when picking classes, which make some professors more attractive than others. The policy is not set in stone yet but they are discussing it, and it is a very real possibility. This could go into effect as soon as next school year. I don't know about you, but I don't like the sound of that. I don't know how, but we have to find a way to stop this from happening.

f22jh7	0	If UCSC cannot or will not provide you with the support you need to finish your programs, why do you continue to support the school financially? I view both housing and education as being priced at what the market will bear. Yes, there are still people willing to drop $1m+ for a bungalow in town, and obviously plenty of grad students willing to go into extreme debt and endure housing and food insecurity for the piece of paper that says UC on it. Why is it worth it to you? I understand that you want the reality to be different than what it is, but in my experience, the best way to encourage change is to withhold your money. Imagine if grads transferred en masse from UCSC, such that staffing for teaching and research were jeopardized or threatened. The university administrators would be forced to rethink their business model. Unionized labor and labor strikes are not enough to dismantle or rebuild the educational industrial complex. You would need to damage the university‚Äôs reputation and discourage new grad students from enrolling, otherwise it will be just like the housing situation where investors and folks looking for vacation homes will continue to drive up the prices. It‚Äôs only when a critical mass stops buying into such systems will change happen.
iecog8	1	I'm sorry but I'm at my apartment and I can't believe how for the last 3 days, I have witnessed parties everyday from houses just outside my window!! Aint even the frats!! Who knows what else is happening in greek life and the rest of Southside, downtown, etc. It is clear that these students just do not care at all. I really hope this is only going to go on for the few next days until the semester begins, otherwise there is going to be serious outbreaks. Also, just generally being obnoxiously loud at late times is incredibly frustrating - I get it, its the week before the semester, but it is actually ridiculous how loud and incosiderate these people are EVERYDAY since they moved. I feel most sorry for the non-college residents who have to deal with this crap.

qu18mn	0	Hey all, I'm a mechanical engineering transfer and I am hoping to stay in northern california for school. Davis has been my dream school for a while, but since my gpa is quite high I thought I would shoot my shot at Cal. I am a bit worried that berkeley will be significantly harder than community college (or davis for that matter) and I've heard the engineering program is incredibly cutthroat. As far an environment, I prefer the bay area and campus compared to davis. Berkeley of course has the prestige, although davis is fairly prestigious as well. However, I've heard that prestige doesn't necessarily matter when getting your engineering degree. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with both schools or if anyone has transferred from a community college and had a harder time at Cal/found the rumors to be true. Thanks!

I know this school likes working toilets and stuff, but not everyone was raised like that. I for one am getting home from RED LOBSTER and I'm not very used to seeing all this casual nonchalant talk about how much mold and vomit you get to experience through Premier Student Housing. Even though I'm majoring in Science, I still don't appreciate people talking about certain topics. It's inappropriate and could lead to your PARENTS being called. You wouldn't want me to call your PARENTS would you?  Just please keep in mind that not everyone wants to see that. Maybe r/ucla wasn't the place for me lmao.

We can meet at Cafe 3 or Croads and have pizza and brisk tea, a nice little meal for the two of us.  I am quite knowledgeable in the sciences (EECS major) and I am an avid music listener (i listen to neutral milk hotel, piper at the gates of dawn is also one of my favorites).  In other words, I have many admirable qualities.  I just need a chance to feel the gaping void a little less this week.

qs937j	0	Hi all. Im currently taking physics 5A with professor dhar and i just gotta say he is in no way as bad as people made him out to be. Before entering the class i was so scared by all the Reddit posts and rate my professor reviews but having almost made it through the quarter i can definitely attest to the fact that he‚Äôs actually a good professor. Like on this past midterm every single problem covered content that he explicitly went over in class. All you had to do was take notes and follow along with the examples he gave and you would‚Äôve been able to pass easily. Keep in mind I‚Äôm pretty shit at physics lol but still managed to do good on it.   Overall i just hope this helps anyone who was planning on taking physics next quarter; don‚Äôt believe all the bad stuff online bc in reality if you put in the bare minimum effort you‚Äôll do well in the class.   Alsooo if ur questioning my legitimacy i know i just made this account but i really am just a student lol, but im feeling all empathetic and shit so I thought I‚Äôd stick up for Dhar since he gets such a bad rep for no reason.

ait0f5	0	Doctor Klefstad's behavior was really uncalled for. There was no reason for Doctor Klefstad to shout at her. She literally apologized for having allergies and he just straight humiliated her, what the fuck? I feel so shitty for her and hope she's okay. Obviously he could have dealt with the situation more delicately and be more sensitive. Today I saw a side of him that I didn't know existed  Edit: for those who don't know what happened-  A girl from the class after 142A walked in a minute before class ended so he asked her if she was in the class. she said no and asked her to get out but it seemed like he was joking (at least to me). She said that she was really sorry and that she had allergies which is why she couldn't hang out outside. He shouted at her loudly to get out before changing his mind and telling her to stay so he could get her information and report her because she was being disruptive. Everyone else was free to go. He was completely fine for the whole class but he snapped and blew up on her in literally the final 2 minutes

Omicron is still raging and we refuse to believe that adding a zoom camera to a classroom is to difficult for one of the most technologically advanced regions in the world. This matters due to long covid, due to some disabled being susceptible to covid, and to those afflicted by implicit covid effects.

We're doing something of a soft opening right now, the official websites and social media links and meetings are yet to come, and we officially open 1 week before the first day of the 2016-2017 academic year.  If you have any questions, or would like to get involved, feel free to ask here!

2c4qtm	0	I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this.   I'm an incoming freshman, but I haven't really met any people from school yet. But whenever I read this subreddit, everyone seems like they hate UCSD (only talking about the bad things about the school, such as how it takes your money, is no fun, or is making you take a class etc).   I guess what I'm asking is not whether or not UCSD is "socially dead", but if students actually hate administration as much as this reddit page leads to believe?

They look fairly high tech.  I'm not worried about RA's/CSO's, I'll take a writeup worst case, but I don't want to set off the alarms and have everyone evacuate + my room flooded.
2u6fpe	0	Apparently it is 100 MC which seems like a ridiculous amount for an one hour and fifteen minute class.   I have been just memorizing the slides, but I'm worried because her lecture style is awful and I have felt absolutely no benefit in going to class at 8 am (which is why I've missed about half of them).   Any study tips? I've been using custom online flashcards to memorize the lecture slides, and by doing this I've become pretty comfortable with most major concepts and could apply them if I needed to. I'm just scared because we have to know SO much information that it's kinda unfair... This class is only 3 units too...Dafuq   Any tips? Techniques?

gssnme	0	Hey everyone, this past month I built the website¬†[RateMyDorm.com](https://ratemydorm.com/)¬†\- think RateMyProfessors but for dorms. You can read reviews from other students and filter through dorms based on rating, amenities, or class year.  When I was a freshmen, I wondered why there was no resource to read dorm reviews. Thanks to quarantine, I finally got around developing it and I'm hoping this can grow to a platform that will be helpful to all UCR students. If you can help contribute, please check out the site and rate a dorm you've lived in! Thanks

I searched the name of a few lost id cards and their names are legit the first result like you can just dm them and stop exposing people for the swag. JK do wut u want, gotta get swag in the bag right? But for those of you who dont know just search them up before making a post. I applaud those who have been doing that its pretty obvious but swag is in high demand (shout out KCFUNG) .Everyone should know if they lose their id they gonna get exposed for the swag.

I wouldn't even mind switching to the other side if there were a clear consensus, but it seems more like a random mix of right-side and left-side pedestrians. Any insight on this?

skqjoi	0	I've been seeing this a lot "we're all healthy and young". I feel like you guys don't understand how many people around you might be disabled, and it makes you guys' perspective on the pandemic incredibly selfish.   You don't know if somebody near you has a co-morbidity, that's not something you can always figure out by looking at the person. Just because somebody "looks" healthy doesn't always mean they are. You should be more considerate, you don't know if you're putting someone else's life at risk.

hcqols	0	Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.  Please do not refer to Berkeley as "UCB." This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.  As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that "UCB" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.  While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name "UCB" to refer our school. Thank you.  TL:DR  Don't say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.
fsizwo	0	Please remember that even though they're over video, the teachers are really trying their best with these lectures. In one lecture I just saw like 10 people sharing porn/gore over video, people spamming chat, and other things that are disrupting lecture. It isn't funny, nobody is laughing. The teacher ended lecture early because of this stuff. Online classes are hard enough to adapt to, and people are already making it 10 times harder to watch with stuff like this going on.    Has anyone else had a similar experience so far?

Congrats!‚Äù among other signs with a load of text that I didn‚Äôt read. Is the school seriously so into ‚ÄúGotta hear both sides‚Äù -ism that they‚Äôre gonna allow this? I know it‚Äôs public property but this pushes the boundary of the rules, right?

fgt3f1	0	It's gotten to the point where nobody can talk about anything else. A lot of things are changing and it's all for a virus with a low death rate in those under 70 that most of us will come into contact with outside of school anyway (most of us won't stay locked in a room alone living on canned food for the next several months). It's ridiculous what this virus is doing to us.
saq4mj	1	Ucla petition is almost reaching 4k for online courses. It's so funny yet so disrespectful when UCLA literally posts their petition for online courses and they get upvotes from y'all but on the other hand, when some of us mention online classes for UCSD all we get is hate lol...
9nem2k	0	Let's talk about it... why? I mean, Panda Express is not healthy, is not tasty, so why do so many of you end up eating there? Is it especially cheap? Very large serving? I just don't get why one goes through such a ridiculous line to eat something which is barely edible.
20rnp9	0	My major has some classes focused in the middle east, which understandably attract a large amount of middle eastern students.  The things I've noticed in these classes  1. The material is far easier  2. Students talk over professors and TAs constantly. Like multiple times a week they will have to stop and ask them to stop talking loudly during lecture  3. Rampant cheating even though the classes are the easiest I've taken Like dozens of people getting caught using cell phones on midterms and getting let off with warnings.  I'm not saying this is all middle eastern students, cuz i have talked to some who are just as disgusted as i am with what's goingon.  But it's really blowing my mind how prevalent this is.
oqeo9u	0	I see a lot people posting that ghosting is a terrible thing to do...  I don‚Äôt really get it tbh. There was this person that I liked. She ghosted me. I‚Äôm mad that things ended between us, but honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel any better if she just broke up with me in person.   ‚ÄúHey I met someone else.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt feel a spark between us.‚Äù How would I respond to that?   Either way the person that I like is leaving. I‚Äôm still probably going to cry regardless.   Can‚Äôt really understand why people would rather have it happen in real life.

muhglt	0	We've been actively avoiding renting from anywhere affiliated with Everest and Raj Properties. For newer renters out there, Raj is a convicted human trafficker who trafficked young children and women. He made several subsidiary companies (like Everest, soon to be a new name) that continuously changes its name to avoid detection by weary students who don't want to support a scumbag. After finding Square One and not seeing anything related to Raj or Everest, we thought we were good to go. We even asked Square One asking if they were related to Everest, and they said no.   After spreading the good news that we finally found a great apartment, and our monthly rent wouldn't help a trafficker, one of my friends found something. Square One is owned by Anchor Valley Partners, an investment group that's owned by Raj's nephew. There's no escape... finding housing is extremely hard, and we were so happy to find a good place that wasn't affiliated with Raj Properties but ultimately signed the lease and discovered the bad news. Just leaving this post to help future tenants who are thinking about renting in the future. It sucks that we have to choose between supporting them, or paying an obscene amount of rent.

aijway	0	Hey Anteaters! I'm a high school senior looking into transferring from a community college to a UC (preferably UCI) mostly for the sake of saving up on money and mentally getting my shit together before going off into the labyrinth.   Another choice that I'm considering is UCLA but it's not apart of TAG and I'm personally more drawn into the overall vicinity and background of Irvine itself.   Care to share with me the rundown of how the entire process is executed so I know how to prepare myself?
n2vd78	0	We know that vaccines are highly effective, and UCSD will mandate all students to get vaccinated, why would we still need to wear masks sitting through classes for 4+ hours everyday? Anyone has any scientific studies that answer this?
ae1x5m	1	I spent the last six years in community college fantasizing about when I'll make it to real college and get some validation that I am actually worth something. I spent the first couple of years goofing off, going no where, but eventually, got my act together, buckled down, and worked hard to get done with community college while working full-time, and rebuilding my GPA. Now here I am, and I am just as unhappy as I have ever been. I moved away from my home and my friends to come to a school that I have grown to hate, chasing something I thought was a promise of success, but I now see is a clever marketing scheme to get me to dump $35,000 a year here. Now, I can't register for classes because they're all full, and I can't get financial aid until I register, meanwhile I keep racking up late fees. Yes, It's my fault I got into this mess in the first place, but now this school is making it impossible to get out of it. I just want my life back, and my time back, and my money back. I like to think I'd be happier somewhere else but I'm sure I would hate myself just as much anywhere I went, I deserve to since it's my fault.

ov7dz	0	Hi everyone! I'm Amir Khazaieli, the president of the Anacapa Residential Hall. Since I'm in the loop, you can ask me almost anything about UCSB, Reshalls, or other (like where to get the best weed). I am also a safe sex peer advisor, so I can give you great sex advice. And I know where all the best parties are on DP, so ask me anything!

Without a doubt, I worked my butt off doing hours of practice problems, reading and note-taking for this one, but it was worth it.   My advice for anyone who's in the spot I was in, prioritize! I can't stress how much it helped me focus on what's actually important, and sure, it might cost you some enjoyment in the short term to cut some fun things out of your life. But I promise it'll be worth it to finally achieve what you've been trying to do, whatever that may be.   Good luck fellow Tritons!!! There's only a couple weeks left until we can all go back home and relax, so I'd urge you to just push for every moment we have left till the end. WE GOT THIS!
pn1p3a	0	Fellow Anteaters, I have good news to report regarding vaccination status.  Nearly 90% of students and over 90% of faculty/staff have been vaccinated.  This is excellent news for all.  Ref:  [https://uci.edu/coronavirus/updates/210910-update.php](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/updates/210910-update.php)  "**More than 90% of employees and nearly 90% of students are  vaccinated against COVID-19, which will help with health and safety as  we approach an in-person fall quarter."**  Peter

I've been to parking.ucsd.edu but when I reach the area to purchase a permit, the quarterly parking permit option is not available to me. I can only see options to purchase the 'M' spot, 'S'-annual spot, NWA, and holiday shuttle seats.

rzmhhg	0	Normally I just lurk. But I can't stand this anymore.   Hello everyone, I'm sick and tired of everyone wanting to  go back in person, it's so selfish! We are in the middle of a surge. I thought since being admitted here, you guys would be more rational than my Midwestern, anti vaxxer, backwater that I  came from.  I was excited for a change of view on COVID. I guessed wrong.  My best friend had overcome so much, she was born deaf, and disabled. She got COVID and now she has neurological damage, and can't taste or touch. She also has intense migraines. It break my heart to see her in such a state. She was so brilliant and now she's depressed since she can't stand up out of a wheelchair.   But I guess since she was "immunocompromised" no one cares about her.  She's just another statistic to everyone. She was even vaxxed.   Honestly, you guys need to learn empathy for others. They aren't just another statistic. They're people with lives.   End of rant.
ntjymk	0	Hello, I like many highschool students am looking to spend my summer doing some kind of summer program and I was hoping to do one at UCLA. I looked at their summer sessions website and there seems to be 2 main options: summer courses or summer institutes. What is the difference betwee them? Which one would be more beneficial. For context I am looking to participate in programs about filmmaking etc. Your input is appreciated.

g7l2an	0	Hello everyone.  I had just recently been accepted to transfer at UC Davis for Political Science, along with UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara. I also got into UCSC but thats out of the picture.  I was wondering if out of the three, I should go to Davis. I am hoping for a good pre-law program that will help me get into a good law school out of state, while also having the best education overall. I will be asking this at the other subreddits for the other two colleges since I understand people in here will probably be a bit biased towards Davis. It is the closest one from home, and my Dad really does insist I go, despite going to Santa Barbara.  Also, with corona going around, would it be possible to take a break from college until we can go back? I did just got accepted and I am transferring from another college. I am unsure if administration would allow this.
lntd78	0	I live in Riverside away from family and with roommates but things have just been a bit rough. A lot of my roommates have just moved out of our house to go with family and I have to stick around because of work. To make things worse, my girlfriend and I recently split up and it‚Äôs hard to stay motivated or focused. All I do is work and school and I find no fulfillment in my life right now. I just needed to vent to see if anyone else feels this way and maybe someone else reading this can know they‚Äôre not alone. I miss all of you guys, I miss being around other driven people. Hopefully next year (my last) will be better, but until then we just gotta hang in there. Thanks :)
