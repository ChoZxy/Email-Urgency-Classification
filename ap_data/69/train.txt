nc1fge	0	Just finished my last final of my freshman year! It‚Äôs been hella rough these past few months with covid going on and everything. I practically had to work full time for my dad‚Äôs local business without any real direct pay, worked full time classes, had to help my younger sibling with their online school, and managed most of the housework while my parents went to work, all while somehow maintaining straight As. Did I have to miss out on clubs or school events? Yeah sure. I‚Äôm so goddamn proud of myself for even surviving this year though that I don‚Äôt even care! Congrats to me!  Can‚Äôt wait to finally be on campus next fall! Go Bears! üêª
dlcry3	0	People started to become uncomfortable with the radians looking like the Imperial Japan flag and I severely apologize for it. Didn't realize until the last minute.   Working on a better one and a much simpler one now.
o5t9ra	1	the most annoying thing i have experienced in classes is grade comparison. enough with the bragging. good for u that you got an A, 50 other people did as well and u don‚Äôt understand what that person is going through. legit saw a girl brag about an A to another girl who lost her grandmother and couldn‚Äôt take the final and ended up with an incomplete. for the braggers in the forum, get a life.
10z2pc	0	(For all you freshers, UCLA has a system of steam tunnels underneath its campus.)  If you're keen PM me.  Bring a flashlight and a marker if you want. Neither are necessary but they're nice to have. Don't wear anything super nice. It gets pretty hot in the tunnels, but where we're going, at least, there won't be military crawling or anything.

sn9nkg	0	Assumptions: In person exams, everyone gets close to 100 on non-test related assignments, and all the B+/A- students are extremely competitive for their grades, don't have to work, etc.  If a class has 15 percent A's, you'd want consistently to be in the top 5-12%. Anyone in the 12-15% group is cutting it too close and leaving their grades to chance.  I'm not trying to be snobby or anything, just want some perspective. I've already picked up a A- last quarter in Pstat 120a, and I'm at risk of picking up another one this quarter unless the professor curves.
rpwzcw	1	I was more than 6 feet away from you. I have a big nose so the mask just naturally sides down. I didn‚Äôt fix it because I was in the middle of a set and my glasses were fogging up. Your chances of getting COVID probably increased by 0.000001% during those few seconds. You did not have to be so rude about it. Please see a therapist immediately.
kdqxfw	0	For context I am a freshman who decided to stay home during the fall. I‚Äôm in the college of chem and only took 3 classes. Chem 4a, Math 53, Anthro 3AC. I persevered so hard this semester and tried the best I could. When it comes to the help I received there was none. Professors don‚Äôt seem to care about this pandemic and sign a ridiculous amount of work. At first my exams were fair but my final for yesterday in chem 4a was horrendous. The guy really assigned 46 questions majority being FRQ and not taking into account technical issues and such. For anthro 3AC I am around an A A- and it seems with the last assignment we did I will probably drop to a B+. (Edit Not complaining about this). I‚Äôm done with berkeley and can‚Äôt wait for this semester to end. This university doesn‚Äôt seem to care and it‚Äôs me competing with my peers who are already smart to receive a good grade.   I should have went to UCSD. It was closer to home and less toxic. Fuck the prestige
1zhigk	0	Basically I bought tickets to go with a friend, now they can't go, so I can't go.  It's at the Observatory this Sunday, the 9th.  I'll sell each for an even $20.  Thanks a ton, and enjoy the show for me!
qqkfeq	0	So, recently I have developed an obsession with this school.  This is partly due to where it is situated, I mean what‚Äôs there not to love about LA? But, the main reason I‚Äôve fallen so deeply in love with UCLA is because of how good their Media and Entertainment Law L.L. M. course looks.   As a UK resident, I don‚Äôt really like the options presented to me here after I eventually get my law degree.   I know that the UK government does not fund any postgraduate courses in or outside of the country, so naturally I looked into scholarships - but the programs seem to be targeted towards groups who otherwise might not have the opportunity to attend UCLA (i.e. women in STEM, POC, etc). But also, neither me nor my family have the funds to pay for it.  While I am certainly aware of my privilege as a white man, having the knowledge that my ideal course at my ideal university is potentially locked behind a paywall worries me. Sure, there are media law courses for postgrads in the UK, but UCLA‚Äôs one honestly looks unmatched.   I‚Äôm not really sure what my purpose of writing this is. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is in a similar position, or if anyone can provide any guidance to students in this unique position? Thanks for listening to my vent anyway I guess.
f703ui	0	Today from 1:00-3:00p Pacific, several graduate students and one of our undergraduate allies will be hosting an AMA to answer questions about the ongoing teaching strike currently taking place.   Our strike has been growing, and solidarity movements have popped up at several other UC campuses, as well as a number of campuses nationwide. We were even endorsed last night by Senator Bernie Sanders.  You can find out more about the strike at [https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/), and of course, please join us below and ask us anything!

aqpff6	1	Please forgive me.  At work, I put several bags into the recycling bins. When I returned a minute later, I noticed a yellow creature nestled near the lid of the bin.  "A banana slug!" I exclaimed as this was my second banana slug spotting. Something wasn't right. I then noticed that its entire body was not visible.   "Oh no oh no oh no," I muttered as my biggest fear came to life. I opened the lid to reveal the other half of its body. I gently scooped it up and noticed no movement. I put it on a nearby rock, stood in front of it and saluted. My tears were washed away from the morning's rain.  I feel awful. I'm currently listening to Marvins Room on the brink of tears. Police sirens blare in the distance; I'm waiting to be turned in.  Will I be expelled? I didn't mean to :((   Please forgive me.  I'm sorry Sammy. I'm sorry friends. I'm sorry Blumie.

lzouei	0	This is so discouraging, every time I ask them a question they be like ‚Äúu shlda known this already‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take this course if u dont know this‚Äù. Bro I am here to learn. And I‚Äôm exactly taking the courses for my major requirement by order. Why can‚Äôt they be more mindful? If I knew everything already, why am I going to college? We pay for school, and they should respect us like students just like we respect them. I know that there are many profs who are not like that, but those who have that mindset makes me wanna drop out of school.  Edit: Im talking about new materials that are covered in a class for the first time. I did finish prerequisite classes with As... and I also google the questions before I ask profs. it just I wish they used a different wording instead of criticizing us.
q49clm	1	I love how I was put in hotel housing and can‚Äôt cook anything. I love how the water reeks of sulfur and how I have to shower in it/how I‚Äôm expected to drink it. I love how I was denied a parking permit, so I have to stay on campus all day everyday to be able to eat the crappy meal plan or waste over an hour on the bus going back and forth. I love how they haven‚Äôt disbursed my leftover funds. I love how I‚Äôm sick so there‚Äôs no way for me to eat without ordering takeout that I can‚Äôt pay for. I love how academic advisors tossed me around for a week when I was looking for 4 units (told me I could cross campus enroll or withdraw, but I finally had a meeting with one who literally just added me to a course). And most of all I love how useless and unresponsive student services are when I actually need help. Guess I‚Äôll just live off water and protein powder till I feel better... lovely experience so far.  I hope other transfers are having a better time than me.
lddw87	1	Recently someone posted an informational about an upcoming protest or something and sent it to all graduate students. Since then I've received on the order of 100 reply alls creating a massive email chain. A mixed of stupid people asking to be unsubscribed from a DEPARTMENT MAILING LIST and people fighting with each other. Are you actually kidding me...   Another side note, how much do people make. I'm very comfortable here with my salary, and I don't see the need for constant harassment of OTHER GRADUATE STUDENTS about your wage. So please, tell me why you can't afford to live here. BUT DO IT HERE, not in a freaking email chain with every single graduate student on it.

dvvnyh	0	Throwaway account because i don‚Äôt want the person who told me to get in trouble.   Ucsc is planning on closing the Rachel Carson dining hall from winter 2020-fall 2022.

jb62vq	0	I know it's only Week 2, but I honestly have no motivation left, and I can't open my Canvas page without crying. I'm so tired. I know that we're expected to have adjusted to online classes by now, but I'm struggling more during this quarter than I did during the last Spring quarter. At least in March, there were recent memories of regular interactions and the hope that things would go back to normal. But now, I can't even remember the last time I've seen someone besides my family, and my circumstances are still the same as March if not worse. I feel so bad for letting my professors down and for being a bad student, but I don't know how to tell them that most of my energy is spent trying to keep myself alive. Like, I don't even know anymore. There's just so much work already, and I feel so overwhelmed, and I don't know how I'm going to get through this quarter. Sorry, I just needed to rant.
ftbu73	0	For me is seems even more exhausting than in person classes and a few of my classes seem to have increased their workload. Anyone else feel the same way? Any advice on keeping energy high!?
fc3lzc	0	So I'm currently a second year Cogs major specialized in design and interaction and I am trying to add a minor so that I will have enough units to graduate. My top choices were CSE, Data Science, and Design, but I ruled out Data b/c I didn't take math 20, and Design is really close to my major anyways. I really want to minor in CSE, but I know how impacted the classes are and I don't know if I will actually be able to get my classes in time to graduate. Can anyone give me some advice on what to do? Will I be able to take on a CSE minor. No advisors from the COGS or CSE departments have been able to help me, and I just need some outside opinions.

e0s4x6	0	I tried to make an appointment with a psychiatrist last week after attempting to kill myself a few days before (didn't work obviously). The quickest appointment they could give me was mid to late January.  Not even just about me, I really think it's scary how long you might have to wait to get a sit down appointment to talk to someone. I absolutely don't blame the workers, it's likely a combo of understaffment and general mental health problems of a such a large school, but I don't know, when they told me that I could come in then the first thought I had was "I probably won't be alive by then."

lunbxo	0	So i‚Äôm driving home to visit my grandma and I made a wrong exit (thanks apple maps) and ended in one of the not so great parts of California. The people here are pretty poor tbh. I have a 10 K car and it was the nicest at the gas station. Someone even asked me about my car because they were so impressed...  Now I feel like I‚Äôm spoiled/ rich as fuck because I grew up in Irvine where I had a shit ton of opportunities. I doubt the people here had anything more than minimum wage jobs available to them.   The reason why this is mind blowing to me is that Irvine is a rich city. Half of my friends growing up lived in million dollar houses. I always felt like that one poor kid. Now I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôve been given an amazing life with many opportunities. I even attend a university that is considered a ‚ÄúPublic Ivy.‚Äù Lol Irvine poor is actually pretty nice to be honest. Now i‚Äôm going to buy my single mother some flowers because now I truly understand how great of a mother she was and how hard she worked in life (she‚Äôs still annoying tho).  TLDR; Life is all about perspective... Be grateful to be here!
rxyts7	0	I'm a 3rd year. By the end of spring I'll only have spent a total of 4 quarters taking in person classes, participating in labs, getting hands on experience, etc. As an engineering major it's incredibly frustrating that I've had almost no access to the machine shop as a student.   The gym has been closed for about half my tenure as a student. Student teams have been barred from operating in person for about as long.   As a research university, the classes are the least appealing thing about attending Davis, seeing as there are almost no professors hired on for the sole purpose of teaching. However, the classes are the only service that is consistently being offered.   I'm not getting a fair return on my tuition. If I knew how long this was going to last I would've deferred after freshman year and gone to a cc while working to save money. The university owes us compensation for the value we've lost, and knowing they'll probably never consider making us whole is upsetting.

Plus in case I got hungry I could steal a little bit of the food as snack on the way, something so small they wouldn‚Äôt even notice. Like maybe a french fry or something.

rlqvda	1	We all know how this is probably going to go. 2 weeks turns into a quarter, that turns into an academic year. Then the university waits until we all have omicron boosters. Then next year the Pi variant happens and the entire thing repeats.  Meanwhile, UCSD charges the same price for gym memberships that are closed, libraries you cannot access, office hours you cannot attend, experiences, an education you are robbed of.  We all did what we were supposed to do for 2 fucking years and they continue to pointlessly disrupt our education, and steal from us with no punishment. There is no government order to shut down the school. They are simply doing it.   I‚Äôm not a lawyer of any kind, but this has to be illegal. Is anyone here a law student? Can we do some kind of class action thing? They should not be able to charge the same amount as a genuine education.   For those of you who insist we continue to do everything they say ; what does it take? Really?

bakqr8	0	Hi all! I am seeking your opinion on which school I should attend: UCSD or UCSB (both schools cost approx the same so finances aren't an issue). I am currently in environmental science but I am planning on switching to econ w a minor in business at UCSD and at UCSB economics! I would ideally like to land a job during senior year w/ a starting salary in the high 50s-60s and tbh I am rly not sure if I would like accounting but I would have to test it out!!  Factors I'm Considering:  1. Ease of getting a job/internship. How do the recruitment/networkings compare? 2. Education quality; professors, classes, etc. I heard you might need 5 years to graduate with an impacted major because of limited class spots? 3. General student body vibe: work ethic, socialness, racial diversity, open-mindedness level? I do know UCSB is characterized for their parties but you don't have to go; contrarily, UCSD is the opposite but you can find parties if you try. Are people cut-throat or willing to help each other? 4. Dorm Quality? (I'm in Marshall for SD and I'm not sure about SB)  Thank you for any help! (sorry long list of questions :/)
hdwgcj	1	Recently a meme was shared with the UCB subreddit outlining an allegedly "dismissive" and "disrespectful" act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.  Please refer to University of California, Berkeley as "UCB." This is **the** proper way to refer to the UC's original and flagship campus. While Cal, Berkeley, or UC Berkeley are other proper and acceptable ways to say it, it is preferred to be referred to as just "UCB."  As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, UCB students feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. They feel that "UCB" boldens their brand and emphasize the incredible prestige associated with UCB.  It is acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms, as well as UCB, the so-called "flagship and most well-known campus," and they therefore request that you start using the name "UCB" to refer their school. Thank you.  TL:DR  Please say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.

pyx2ao	1	WHY? Everywhere I look its just hot girl after hot girl after hot girl. In my classes: hot girls. In the library: hot girls. In the dining halls: hot girls. How can I focus among all these hot girls? They're everywhere except my dorm! I can't even leave my own dorm anymore without my eyes being berated by female beauty. How do you other male specimen out there function with all these hot girls running wild? I came to UCSD because everyone told me the girls here were ugly and I could finally focus on my studies. Jokes on me I guess! The only thing I'm studying now is the perfect figure of the girl sitting across from me right now.

4ehg63	1	I heard about a programming event the other day, and it turns out it was only for Latino programmers. Then I heard about another one and it was only for Black writers. I just feel annoyed by this. You don't have to be a certain race to write or program, so why should it matter? Can you imagine the outrage if an event was held for white programmers only? And I'm not even white, I'm Asian.   I am just annoyed that people can get away with this sort of thing. It's sort of like, reverse racism.
fi2r5x	0	Hey all,  I'm so sorry if this has been asked a lot lately, but if I were to get 3 C's in AP Calc, AP Psych, and APES would UC Davis rescind me?  Im also out of state so would they be more lenient on me since they want my money?  thank u

djre3m	0	There was just a pretty bad accident on ring road just now. Biker hit a girl who was walking from the grass to the walking side of the road. It seemed like she wasn‚Äôt paying attention and the biker slammed into her. This was by Parkview Classroom (which is the most downhill portion of ring road, so the biker was going really fast).  The person walking literally flipped back and slammed her head. I heard her head smack the road through my earphones. She seemed unconscious for a few moments, but I f anyone has additional info on how she‚Äôs doing, post here!  Wishing the best recovery given how bad it seemed.  EDIT: Both are okay (thanks for clarifying, u/KevMard)

8ng03j	0	So I‚Äôm an incoming freshman majoring in NPB and I come from a very open minded place in SoCal. I started smoking weed for fun at first, but it became something that genuinely helps with my anxiety and depression (although the fun part is a bonus). It was something that I was planning on doing through college as well, but I don‚Äôt want to get a lot of shit for it. Can anyone tell me how stoners are perceived there? Also does anyone know any off campus places where I can smoke in peace?

rdp5g	0	To my delight, I have been accepted into UCLA along with the Regent Scholarship.  Both my parents and I do not have any expected contribution thanks to scholarship. Before the Fall quarter starts, how will I receive my financial aid? If I spend conservatively during the school year, will I have to return any leftover aids?   The current cost of attendance shown on my financial aid award is $32,781. Does anyone know how this is calculated?  And then there's housing. What kind of housing should I be aiming for? I'm a bit introverted. I prefer a quiet environment where I can study and have my own privacy, but I also want the option of being able to socialize. Is there any specific area in UCLA where people don't party a lot?  Last but not least, do most current Regent scholars join the Regent Society? What kind of activities do they do? I feel like if I join, I'll people singling out other potential new people I could meet in UCLA =x  thank you guys for taking your time to read this and helping me out

553oqw	1	There I was, relaxing at Hana Kitchen, watching some youtube videos on my phone while eating a delicious chicken bowl when I noticed somthing in the corner of my eye.  Dangling Lanyard, UCSB sweater, bright, stoned red eyes, no facial hair, slicked back hairdoo. It was a freshman. In his hand was a Orange Fanta‚Ñ¢. I've been reading about the horror stories and quickly closed the lid of my food and began walking away, but by then it was too late.  As I was walking away, he screamed "Nice cruiser faggot", and lassoed his lanyard around my neck. I fell down, my Hana Kitchen spilled all over the floor. He then opened his Fanta‚Ñ¢ and poured it all over the mess on the floor that was once my delicious dinner. He then smirked and threw the Fanta‚Ñ¢ bottle at my head and walked away.  I saw him walk outside, unlock the ulock that he only put on his front tire. And ride away in his $599 roadbike, lanyard dangling in the wind.   I hope you hit someone in a roundabout shitlord.

hdwf5d	1	Recently a meme was shared with the UCB subreddit outlining an allegedly "dismissive" and "disrespectful" act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.  Please refer to University of California, Berkeley as "UCB." This is **the** proper way to refer to the UC's original and flagship campus. While Cal, Berkeley, or UC Berkeley are other proper and acceptable ways to say it, it is preferred to be referred to as just "UCB."  As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, UCB students feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. They feel that "UCB" boldens their brand and emphasize the incredible prestige associated with UCB.  It is acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms, as well as UCB, the so-called "flagship and most well-known campus," and they therefore request that you start using the name "UCB" to refer their school. Thank you.  TL:DR  Please say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.

igkavn	0	My biggest tip:  DON‚ÄôT feel bad about using free time to rest. Online or not, Berkeley is challenging. Mental health is already threatened by the external circumstances, and I encourage you guys to take care as school starts.   Rest does not mean being unproductive. It means being proactive about your well-being, and putting your well-being in a good state will make your daily activities less strenuous.   Rest can look like: - reading an easy book for fun - spending an hour to follow a recipe or make a new dessert (I miss Berkeley Bowl so so much) - organizing online game nights/trivia with friends (team challenges are great for bonding) - reorganizing your room layout (unless you don‚Äôt find this restful haha) - hiking/walking around campus (when the air is healthy...the views at Berkeley/Tilden are unmatched in my opinion)  Remember, college is never just about the classes!

fay7st	0	I'm considering starting a petition to make it so that lectures will be recorded and posted online or livestreamed and archived, so that students worried about the outbreak can isolate themselves while still keeping up with their classes.  I know a lot of students are worried about graduating on time, which is why I think instead of shutting down classes next quarter, we should make accessing them from home an option. Not to mention, in the near future many students may end up in quarantine and it wouldn't be fair to them to miss out on class everyone else is able to attend.  What do you all think? Should I start a petition for that? Or is it a bad idea?

gsltfp	0	I had reached out to one of my professors two weeks ago asking for an extension on one of my essays solely because I have been feeling unmotivated and particularly lonely these days. She granted me the extension and didn‚Äôt give me a specific date to turn it in. I turned it in on Memorial Day, is using about a week extra to complete the essay.   Today, she emailed me with an email with ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù as the subject. She simply reached out to see how I was doing and gave me the opportunity to talk to her if I wanted to. She had said she was thinking about me and wanted to check in to see how I was doing since I had been feeling down and alone.   All professors should strive to be as great and compassionate as this professor. She made my entire day and made me feel like she truly cares about me. We have been emailing back and forth since. Not all professors are this caring, but they should be.
p67nv3	0	This is like giving your address to strangers. You are putting this info out there for anyone to see, and this is especially bad if you have PII on your profile. We know you want help with what your room assignment means, but putting the number out there for everyone to see is not a smart idea.
e1zwno	0	Is it gonna happen today?
gvlzfp	0	In light of recent events, I could not give less of a fuck about skewing your grading scale or class average. Yes, some students (including myself!) would still like to take their finals to try and boost our grades BUT not everyone is in the right mental/physical space to do so.  Considering the fact that other professors have even decided to give all their students A‚Äôs for this quarter, this is quite literally the bare minimum you could do. We‚Äôre not even asking you to completely cancel your finals to get a free pass, just make it optional. Grades are a social construct. I promise you the fabric of time and space is not going to be ripped to shreds and the entire educational system will not collapse for having a little compassion for your students FOR ONE DAMN QUARTER.

I told her I'm a philosophy major, and she started laughing at me. I asked her why she was laughing and she went and got a coworker, who asked me what was going on. I was confused so I repeated myself, and he starts laughing too. Embarrassed, I quickly left the store and got in my car, before realizing I left my card inside. I tried to go back inside and they locked the door, pointing at me through the door and laughing. fuckk I'm so mad right now.

I will be majoring in Computer Engineering in both schools and I am having a hard time determining which school I think I should choose.   I am concerned that San Diego State doesn't have as good of a computer engineering class, so that makes me very hesitant. Also, I feel like SDSU won't give me as many job opportunities in comparison to Davis. That is really the only thing holding me back from choosing SDSU over Davis and I was looking for input on the matter. Otherwise, I would much rather be in San Diego.  If only there was a way to move UCD down to San Diego, smh my head.

If you believe in this issue sign, post, share, and send this petition!!!! We can do this!!   UCSB remains one of two UCs who have not changed their grading policies in light of the pandemic... To all students who feel like this quarter has been an uphill battle, this petition is for you. The UCSB community must address equity, diversity, and inclusion in remote education.   http://chng.it/xdH82VJPJP  If you support the statements,  please sign the petition and share the link with as many people as you can.

t2tw7h	0	Sunsets in Santa Barbara are magical.  We watch them from the beach, or from the cliffs above.  As it gets chilly, we slowly walk back to our homes.   Downtowns get busy with people chatting over dinner,   music coming from student homes livens up the streets of our little college town.  Sunsets over winter Kiev can too, be magical.  However, as the sun sets over Ukrainian cities today, sirens will go off and windows will go dark.  Their inhabitants will seek shelter anticipating yet another sleepless night of air raids.   In darkness - the absence of light.  I argue that:  We are all part of the same democratic world built on the premise of freedom.  Education is an inherent enemy of any totalitarian regime as dissent has repeatedly grown from academic communities.  It is our privilege to defend it.  Besides financial aid, there are limited options of how we can support the Ukrainian people in its struggle for freedom.  I propose:  For the people of Ukraine, and for all of humanity.  We demonstrate our support by taking a minute of silence while pointing a flashlight to the sky at sunset.

rhxa2d	0	was anyone else uncomfortable with the way ucr handled covid cases fall quarter? the email that was sent looked like a spam email and was often over a week sometime 10 days after the actual covid exposer. and there was no mandatory testing for people who had known exposure to a covid positive person. given the new variant is spreading quickly at other universities i really hope that ucr does a better job next quarter  edit: I'm not saying we should be back online and be isolated. I just wish that when covid cases happen the university would handle it better. If you have a known exposer you should be required to get tested before you return to classes. Anecdotally I have heard that many people aren't planning on getting the booster or are waiting. Bc there is no data on booster shots we don't know how protected we are with new variants. So maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for the university to have more mandatory testing to catch cases before we have an outbreak.

b8dxh6	0	So most likely I will be attending the family orientation in place of my mother because she works. Anyways, from what I understood my sister HAS to spend the night. I live like 25 mins away, is it optional for me to spend the night? I'd rather drive home for the night and go back the next day for day 2 of orientation.
byzstu	0	I am joining as a transfer student this Fall and I can‚Äôt help but remove myself from social situations. I delve into a kafkaesque metamorphosis to which I would be better suited locked away in oblivion. I‚Äôm seeking a change and I want to start life a new. I want to be able to go to the bar, be able to have fun. Most of all I have repressed romantic desires I wish could manifest to reality. I would watch college movies with my uncle every night before we went to sleep and I‚Äôd dream for an experience similar to the ones I‚Äôd see. But alas I‚Äôd be hit with reality, waking up in the very same bed we slept in. I wish to change this. Any type of recommendations are appreciated
akvav2	0	Any idea on how to prepare for quizzes other than lecture slides or are the quizzes on general concepts based off the slides?
agi99w	0	Last quarter I took: ICS 6B, ICS 32A, Writing 39C. I felt like my workload was extremely light and thought I could handle more, so I decided to enroll in 16 units for winter quarter.  Currently I‚Äôm taking: Pysch 7A (Hagedorn), ICS 6D (Gassko), Stats 67 (Armstrong), and ICS 33 (Pattis).   Since the quarter began, my workload has increased ten fold. The problem is, 80 percent of the time I‚Äôm doing hw is occupied by working on stuff for ICS 33 (which I need to take), so I don‚Äôt know if dropping 6D or 67 would make much a difference. Content-wise, both of these math classes are pretty okay so far, Im just afraid that if they spike in difficulty near midterm/finals week, it could hurt my GPA. I‚Äôm also afraid that if I drop one of these math classes (leaning towards 67), that I‚Äôll just be wasting more time/tuition by enrolling in 12 units like I did last quarter.  I know people warn against taking two math classes in one quarter, but I also have heard of people doing this before and still doing well. Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation that could give me some advice?
fhc8xj	0	Do you also think that the other UC Davis kitties (Coco and Compost) should get a new friend/companion kitty as well, so that they can feel less lonely and have someone to play with?
flvp1j	0	It just hit me today that this might be my last time on campus in a very long time - I will be moving out of California because of grad school around the time commencement is supposed to take place. To all you who still have time left, enjoy everything. Even the most mundane things are beautiful.   One time I was bored and walked around, I saw a dolphin. And I met many amazing people here. Ignore my ramblers and I hope you are all in great health.
sor3ws	0	I faceplanted while riding a Bird for the first time today behind two students and they were so nice to me. They helped me up and said it was okay and even told me to have a good day. It really made my day. And in general I feel like my classmates are all really nice and helpful, whether I forget to bring a pencil to class or miss class and need someone's notes. I feel like most students I meet are actually very kind, now that I think about it. Anyway I love y'all
78j25q	0	I would love to invite anyone to hangout with myself or me and my friends. I'm sure we can find something we have in common, even if it's just studying together sometimes. I've seen a few posts on here about being lonely and that's a huge bummer. I've seen it a lot on campus too.        Here are some things me and my friends do:      - Study together/get lunch/coffee etc on campus   - Game nights about once a month. Board games and Mario Kart mostly (people drink but nothing major)     - Watch sports (NFL and NBA mostly, some CFB)   - Smoking (by itself or with any of the above activities)   - Video games (CoD, Mario Kart, Smash Bros, etc)     - Gym (lifting mostly, but cardio sometimes lol)   - Explore the Bay (Point Reyes, Muir woods, etc)   - Sports (basketball, football)    - Bars and Gameday stuff (I actually watch the Cal games tho lol)   - Class work. Keep eachother focused     Please post in here or PM me if you'd like an invite to any of the above! This is an open invitation to any Bears.      Or, post in here with things you enjoy and maybe others could reply if you share hobbys/interests?

This survey consists of 13 questions and NO FLOORPLANS! We know that you are tired of looking at those. This survey is mostly about what kind of indoor and outdoor amenities interest you.  If you complete the survey and the prize entry form, then you will be included in a random drawing for one of three cash prizes of $100 each. Survey responses are anonymous and contact information concerning prizes is confidential.  To take the survey, click here:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3X37ZFN  The survey will close on June 28th, 2015  Thanks for sharing your opinions with us so that we can provide better housing!  Kirsten and team
tdh6a8	0	Seriously, for anyone waiting for admissions, stop asking us for percentages of you getting in. We're students in the midst of finals week.

f2cpqu	0	COLA is a bandaid. COLA is not going to improve the housing situation in Santa Cruz or Santa Cruz County. UCSC predicted this issue back in 2005 (see [link](https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/Final2005EIR/2005feir-VI-app_c-hsgimpact.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1HR-VX_P_vi6vKsszyqBaonIYS5MSBm5D2Qp-jGDDM7JdrP5WLUVBDcCw) ) UCSC wanted to build more housing on campus YEARS AGO but the city and county have exercised through any legal means necessary to block expansion (see [link](http://www.smartvoter.org/2006/11/07/ca/scz/meas/I/) ).   Per usual, this strike is entirely misguided, the UCSC Admin has had their hands tied regarding this issue for over a decade, with zero help from the City and County of Santa Cruz, the UC regents, and the state of CA.

fs6p6z	0	Hello y'all. I'm a student at a community college, and I applied for UCR as a transfer student. My GPA is pretty good (3.8), and I still have to finish 4 courses before transferring which should give me the opportunity to bump up my GPA even more. However, I still haven't heard anything from them, even though most of my friends got accepted. When I log in the portal, it still says that my application is still being considered for an admission decision, aka still pending. Should I be worried? It's almost the end of the month and I have a feeling I won't be accepted. :( Anything helps. Thanks!
hs2ff0	0	Do a the unit cap for switching majors apply if you are doing a double major? I am currently in ICS 31 and want to try add a computer science major but I think the Unit Cap is 90 units. My dilemma is that by the end of fall quarter I will have around 130units(around 90 if u don‚Äôt count the credits I got from APs). So my main concern is will I still be able to add the major if I don‚Äôt manage to get into ICS 32 in the fall?
h7f9bg	0	The more I learn about Berkeley, the happier I get about being accepted here.  Even the little things just make me love it.

gut156	0	(This is somewhat in response to the posts I've been seeing on this subreddit about the ongoing protests affecting students' ability to take spring finals.) In my opinion, I think it could be more effective to ask your professors for I (incomplete) grades than/additional to protesting for optional finals. I grades would allow you to complete the class final/project/whatever you decide with your professor up to a year after the end of this term (unless you are graduating, then different rules apply as per [this page](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/grades/incomplete) from the Registrar's site). It seems unlikely that the administration will cancel finals or raise everyone's grades, so this could be a good option if the professors are for it.

Lost my mental sanity sitting at home and going crazy. All for the greater good. I‚Äôm not going to get COVID now because my greedy and incompetent school is forcing us to go back. Most doctors I know still say Omircon is a big deal, and going back is a horrible idea. Idc what happens, all I know is that I‚Äôm not risking my health and risking long COVID to attend a few classes.

bk2cn2	0	Hi, I'm going to be attending UC Riverside next year for computer science and was wondering if it would be possible to graduate in two years. I have 16 AP courses which I believe can pass me out of some of the math courses, physics, and electives. Also, I will be taking summer courses this summer to finish off more classes. With all of this, is it possible to graduate in two years?  &#x200B;  Also, I was wondering if transferring to another UC is possible after attending UCR for one year. So essentially transferring out after one year.
fi4gxf	1	From Kohlsa's March 9th campus wide email:  *Cancellation or postponement of events or meetings that are expected to have more than 100 people.*   *Cancellation or postponement of non-essential visits to campus by groups of more than 15 people.*  Pick a section of Geisel during the evening, it's chock full of students well in excess of 15 or more and definitely within 6 feet of each other.  Don't get me started on 2nd floor East Wing... I don't understand how you can have these guidelines and not recognize/deal with the library.  For fuck's sake, the library is the icon of the campus, it's on every business card and letterhead I've ever encountered and there is no mention of it.  Also here is a rundown of what happened in the past before the expanse of online classes.   2003 wildfires = campus closed.  2007 wildfires = campus closed.  2019 invisible virus = campus open.  Please keep in mind - students need a place to study, but by the parameters set out by the big man, **THE** place to study should have been eliminated concurrently with in-person classes.

If everyone just tried to answer one question per class everything would be so much easier. Please guys help me out here.

7xv20k	0	I just want to rant for a sec and honestly just say a friendly "fuck you" to every meter maid, their families and their pets.   Had to park ASAP in revelle, for I needed  to pay my housing deposit in person and the HDH offices closed at 430, it was 425.  I tried to park at the 20min loading zones but they were full, so I just said fuck it, wrote a little plea letter along the lines of "please don't cite me, emergency parking" explainning my reasoning, the time I parked, and that I'd be back very shortly. I did what I had to do, barely making it in time, then came back to a fucking meter maid inspecting my car the second I got there, i tried to explain to him my situation, but it fell on depth ears. All I could do was stand there waiting for him to finish writing his ticket, when he gave it to me all I said was a nice friendly "thanks for keeping the parking lots safe you piece of shit minute maid" and we both went on our ways.   65$ isn't the end of the world. But the very fact that it was an emergency I tried to explain, had evidence to prove I wasn't lying, and the fact that it took more energy out of him to write me a citation than to say just shrug it off just kinda grinded my gears.
cqla9g	0	I'm looking to host a Yang rally (or some sort of political event) on campus in the fall! I spent the past two years just avoiding politics in general because it's just been incredibly depressing af, but since discovering Andrew Yang, I've found a real resurgence in my interest in politics and would really love to get back into political activism!  Where would I go about creating something like that? I did some googling, but had a hard time figuring out how to host events like this on campus (and whether or not the school would squelch something like this)

nk455k	0	As we continue to get vaccinated, and most likely the Pfizer will be federally approved (FDA) by October which will make it a lot easier to produce and process America while allowing business, government, and schools to enforce it. Why are still a minority of students wanting to stay lockdown, wear masks, stay distant, and never come back normal? Too many people need to come back to our normal life.
7zsihb	0	I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

It's boring replying to the same three poorly researched anti-strike arguments.   There's plenty of arguments for and against the strike, but hearing the same basic level shit reposted ad infinitum is mind-numbing. Take a second and please read some of the big threads already, I assure your questions and/or "unpopular" (read; unresearched) opinions have been dealt with already.    Sifting through these thoughtless takes will help us focus on the actually solid arguments for or against the strike.  Again, posting arguments against the strike is fine, encouraged even. Posting the same three is tiresome. We need a megathread.
t0kc9	0	I would like to file a complaint about Green Mondays, especially at Carrillo:  We are paying quite a lot for these meals, so obviously we expect a large selection of food at the highest possible level of convenience. The truth of the matter is that even though Green Mondays take place at one dining common, it is very inconvenient to go all the way across campus (maybe even in the heat of potentially missing a class) to find a dining common that fits my dietary needs. Not to mention, vegetarians are such a small subset of the population, that it seems rather unconventional to put their needs before those of rest of the population.  Yes, I agree that this is for the good of the environment, but it is not what we paid for. I am not asking to abolish Green Mondays, but it would be much more convenient for those in San Rafael and Manzanita if it was restricted to either Ortega or DLG.

rxso6p	0	Here‚Äôs my thoughts if I was Admin here is what I would do. UCI goes back in-person Week 3, but lecture notes and recorded lectures are available online to those students who don‚Äôt feel safe coming to school. It should be everyone‚Äôs option, with all quizzes and exams online also. Isn‚Äôt that a policy fair to everyone?
5kbxuy	0	I can imagine the overall difficulty and seriousness STEM courses in UCs like UCB and UCSD. However, is the competition any similar to the likes of the universities I just mentioned? Is the environment for engineering/science very studious? Well of course it is, but at the same level as a highly rigorous academic school? UCSB is above average I know that, but I just want to know what is the judgement type of how it "looks" there - well, you know what I mean.

cvsw80	0	Hey guys. So, I‚Äôm a third year and heavily considering rushing in fall. I never have because a lot of the top srats here have a bad reputation. But I decided I‚Äôm just gonna go for it. And alright, I know top houses haze. I‚Äôve heard stories from DG alum and ADPi girls about a lot of gross body shaming that goes on. I understand that‚Äôs just the way it is and have enough self confidence to not let that get to me. BUT, I am concerned about hazing involving alcohol bc ya girl has a low tolerance and hates being too drunk. I‚Äôm also tall, pretty, good gpa, so I‚Äôm most likely getting into a top house. I was wondering if any of u have info on srat hazing, bc im not tryna waste $75 to rush if I‚Äôm not gonna be down. ((Pls be anonymous so u don‚Äôt get in trouble lmao))  Also !! @ anyone in top houses,, do u think it‚Äôs worth the time and money?

n0sxdq	0	Hello! Are you a fourth year about to graduate? Are you sad and disappointed because you didn't make the friends you wanted to make in college? Do you want to make friends but worry it will look weird and desperate now?? Do you worry that you're a burden and would bother anyone you talk to? Do you think its too late to try to make friends now? Well you're wrong and look no further. Here I am, a 4th year bio major about to graduate who wants to get to know you and make friends.   My interests: procrastinating my last quarter though  cartoons/anime, drawing, walking around outside, scrolling on tik tok and Twitter   Idk what else to say but point being, if you want someone to talk to, I'm here  Edit: thank you to everyone who has responded.

hagna7	0	After the free parking on campus was eliminated I quickly found a location for free parking and have been keeping it quite because I didn't want it to get crowded. Now that I graduated I don't care anymore so here's the location.  Look up University Heights Middle School. It's located two blocks north of one of the Lots on campus. The school has the street infront of it completely empty because teachers use the provided parking lot. There's room for like 20+ cars on this street. The only downside is that two days throughout the week sweepers come so there are signs saying you can't park during those times.  Anyways I parked there the entire last quarter and it was fine minus going back there like at 9pm because the two blocks from the parking lot to the school aren't lit up. That being said the streets were usually empty.   Anyways good luck.

rb9qrf	1	WHY? Every time I shift my eyes even slightly away from whatever I'm working on I just see hot guy after hot guy after hot guy. In my writing class discussions: hot guys. In my lectures: hot guys. In my lab classes: hot guys. In the library: hot guys. In price center: hot guys. How could I ever focus on studies when I'm surrounded by such gorgeous and and handsome folks?? These guys are really everywhere except in my arms! I can't even step outside the door of my apartment without my eyes being blinded by such attractiveness of guys around me. I really came to UC Socially Dead because everyone told me that the guys here were ugly and I could finally focus on my studies and work without worrying about partying or catching feelings. Look where that has gotten me! The only work I've done is plan out my entire future with the hot guy sitting three tables over from me at price center with Panda Express Orange Chicken and a Lychee Calpico. If you were the guy in price center today with the light pink hoodie and green flannel over it, black cargo pants and red sketchers, (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
gm5744	0	Yeah. I had to present a scene (directing major) and they wanted to see our ability to stage people in relation to other people. So i spent several hours yesterday recording voice actors... and planning where my dolls would stand on my table. I ran out of dolls for characters, so one of them was a honey bear bottle. Today I presented that for 15% of my grade. My professor liked it.  Coronavirus has made my degree feel so much more worthless than it already did.
n08524	0	Tomorrow is Denim Day, it‚Äôs basically a day that encourages people to wear jeans to raise awareness of rape and sexual assault. Some background, in the 1990‚Äôs an Italian court overturned a ruling on a case that it was not sexual assault due to the victim wearing tight jeans. Implying that the victim had to have taken the jeans off herself; making it consensual. AS WE ALL KNOW, this is bullshit.   Especially on a college campus we know that sexual assault happens a lot unfortunately. There could be people around you: friends, family members, or coworkers that never have spoken out about it because of fear. Therefore, tomorrow if you can or care to wear jeans on Denim Day to show solidarity and support to victims of sexual assault. You can spread awareness as well on social media to show your support. Unfortunately, it is an issue that is sometimes undermined and all victims should be able to feel strong enough to come forward and tell THEIR stories, if they wish to.

I know I made the best choice for me but I wonder how the academics of the two schools compare since I graduated with high honors from high school and feel Berkeley may have offered me a better education. Anyone else make a difficult college decision between UCSD and somewhere else? Are you happy with your choice and feel UCSD offers you the ability to succeed after college and in med school or other challenging majors?? I appreciate everyone‚Äôs constant support and making me feel welcomed at UCSD already. :)

rxsaea	0	You all should have received a recent announcement about remote instructions being extended until 28th of this month ([https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/chancellor-mays-video-message-extending-remote-instruction](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/chancellor-mays-video-message-extending-remote-instruction)).  **If you were packing your stuff or got excited to go back home, please think again and DON'T.**  The main reason why remote instructions have been extended was to contain the covid situation as much as possible for the next three weeks and give enough time for those tested positive to quarantine.  **Going back home for the next three weeks not only poses a risk of spreading the virus and risking your own family and friends in hometown but also catching it in your hometown and returning to Davis with it. If this happens, the number of positive cases will keep going up, and we might have to close the entire school again (remember 2020?).**  Of course, if you are currently outside of Davis and tested positive, you should follow school and CDC guidelines and isolate/quarantine instead of returning to Davis.  So please, stay in Davis. Let's all work together as Aggies and hope we can go back to in-person learning as fast as we can.
hgpo0b	1	Please stop asking students to talk you into UCSB. You got rejected from UCB or UCLA and now you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôre in the same situation as a large portion of the current students. Don‚Äôt come in here complaining to current UCSB students saying their school isn‚Äôt good enough. There are ways to ask about campus life without sounding arrogant. Don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre better than the other students. If you don‚Äôt want to go here go to a CC, then transfer to your dream school that didn‚Äôt want you.
f9o6om	1	I was talking to a classmate outside today, and a bird was walking near us. I told him to be careful because they're programmed to strike if you get too close, and he looked at me with a confused expression. "Programmed?" he asked me. I said, "of course," every person with half a brain knows that birds aren't real, and they're really just spy drones created by the government. He said "you must be joking" and I then quickly ended the conversation because I couldn't believe someone could be that ignorant, especially here at Cal. How could anyone actually believe birds are real with the overwhelming evidence that the last birds were genocided 20 years ago and are now all robotic replacements!? How can such a person even function in the real world if they can't open their eyes to reality?

sntui7	0	Had two girls approach me about some "bible study" and "fun activities like volleyball." I was just trying to chill in the park and one approached me asking my name and about myself but never even told me their own name. I told her I'm not interested in whatever she's saying and she went away after a few mins but when I looked behind me, she was looking at me and it felt uncomfortable. I stayed for five more minutes and she was still there üíÄüíÄ so then I got paranoid and left. Later on I got approached again by a different girl saying the same thing. When I looked around, the girl from earlier was talking to another girl. One had curly hair, black mask, jeans, and a Coach hand bag on her shoulder. The other one was wearing jeans, a tshirt that said "DON'T QUIT" with "DO IT" bolded, and a backpack. Both of them seemed off in the way they were speaking....culty vibez

Cops were able to catch one suspect driving the car, but the other two drove off separately still being searched by cops at the moment. His car was TOTALED from the car chase. UVT‚Äôs security is fucking ridiculous and completely absent. One of the office workers seemed unfazed when my roommate told them about the incident.

a5q7er	1	I'm so tired of these people. You think you have it so hard because you sit around playing with numbers all day. North campus majors are out here writing and designing works of pure art that will last for generations, while you guys complain about having to be tested on stuff a kid could do.   Math majors? I mastered my times tables in the fifth grade.   Computer science majors? I spend all day on the internet, and that's just for FUN. I can't imagine actually trying to get a degree out of this kind of thing. What losers.  Physics majors? Just math for people who need to look at pictures too.  Chem majors? Chem is the kind of thing drug dealers do, and they don't even need a degree for it.   If your major is just working with numbers all day, you're only going to end up graduating and finding out some kid in Asia can already do that way better than you. Unhireable.   To all the south campus majors complaining about finals: just SHUT IT. You wouldn't last a day in a major that actually forces you to think critically and google things. You're all frauds who don't know how to read/write, so for the love of god stop complaining about your easy classes coding fortnite dances or whatever the hell you do.

I‚Äôm not saying that UCSC is perfect by any means but it seems like its positive aspects are never acknowledged. UCSC is a great school. It gives a ton of financial aid and it‚Äôs ranked #2 in the country for social mobility. As someone who comes from a lower income family, I feel lucky to be here. If you hate UCSC so much, find another university that you won‚Äôt complain about all the time.

This is highly unusual since UC riverside is clearly listed as a school set to receive my FAFSA disbursement in my student aid report. Can anyone please help me???

rw0r56	0	Over the course of the school year, we‚Äôve recorded 441 positive cases (at the time I wrote this post), and 112 cases were recorded in a single day, yesterday. We‚Äôve started this week with an 11% positivity rate. For reference, in the entirety of the Fall quarter, I‚Äôm pretty sure the positivity rate only reached 1% at the end of the quarter when Omicron began spreading. Right now we only have a fraction of the student population that‚Äôs returned but it‚Äôs a wildfire already. At this point catching COVID feels almost inevitable.

Also complain in person to someone sitting behind those clinicals (not to a server or cook-that won't help)  As someone who isn't able to move back home and must remain on campus and continue to pay outrages prices for meal plans, this is a huge problem.

lqw024	0	I feel like the university isn't giving us enough tangible information to make us comfortable with "more in-person fall instruction and operations." I understand that everything is up in the air right now, but I wish they'd just release some sort of indication as to what their housing, vaccine distribution, and instruction plans will be. It honestly feels like they're just trying to get as many incoming freshman to SIR as possible.

sbgnnv	0	I'm a 4th year student and I honestly think the UCSC student population has a real substance abuse problem. I remember coming to college sure that I wouldn't touch drugs, then in freshman year I noticed nearly everyone I knew was using and that sobriety was not the norm. It feels almost inescapable in most social gatherings here. There's also the risk factors of intense stress and easy access...  Edit: I would define substance abuse as "excessive use of a drug without medical justification." I would include binge-drinking, binge-smoking, daily/weekly drug use, overindulgence and dependency, etc. You don't have to be an addict to abuse drugs and alcohol.

n21q9h	0	I was walking my dog near campus and a man in his car made a comment about my dog while we crossed the street. After that I walked to the beach and this same man was there. He came up from behind me and told me he was the guy from the car. He started up a conversation with me and said he was a PhD student. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and I told him no, he then told me he was doing research on relationships and asked if he could ask me some questions. The questions felt very off. He asked me if I‚Äôd ever date an older person (I‚Äôm an undergraduate) and asked me about specific f*tishes. I was very uncomfortable and just kept saying no to everything. He asked me if I only kiss during ***, and then asked if I‚Äôd want to kiss him. He finally said that I have a nice day and walked in the other direction.   He was a white man who was probably 28-30, I was very uncomfortable so I don‚Äôt remember very much about his appearance.    Has anything similar happen to anyone else on campus or Iv?
c1tq92	0	Legit this has been affecting me like you have no idea. The conversation just goes south whenever (even at interviews) someone asks me about my university.

I am pretty neutral when it comes to political affiliation and I encourage people to voice their opinions but extremists are really annoying to me. Any thoughts?
gy75he	0	The campus Bookstore exists to make profit for the institution, NOT to serve the students. In their own words, they are "no longer in the business of selling books," but rather of renting electronic textbook access to students. They see textbook publishers as their customers and students as a captive market.  If you think Inclusive Access and Equitable Access were/are bad deals for you as a student, you have only the Bookstore to blame. Us faculty did NOT have any say in this. They did get some input from a few students--but nothing compared to what they got from textbook publishers.  What's the solution?  You, the students, should own and run the Bookstore. This is how it works at some other UC campuses, and it's even how it worked at UC Davis long ago.  Administration won't let go of this cash cow without a fight.  Bring the fight to them.  If you're upset about the Bookstore's predatory tactics, contact your ASUCD representatives. Ask them to demand that the University sell the Bookstore back to ASUCD. When the University refuses to sell, go to the media.  Change is possible, but only if you fight for it!

p88cbe	0	I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted for this but it needs to be said. students are being reckless, partying, and gathering in large groups unmasked. So many are acting like we are not still in a pandemic and like the vaccine makes us immune to COVID. Fun fact: it doesn‚Äôt. LA county is reporting that 30% of its cases are breakthrough cases in vaccinated people. Cases on campus have been rising as well (if you‚Äôre interested in taking a look yourself head over to the dash board on tang). If these trends continue we will be back online in no time.   I understand that college is exciting and people want to have fun, but please keep in mind that your actions will definitely be affecting others. I am so grateful to have the vaccine, but it cant end this pandemic alone. We need to do our part, too. Please be considerate and try to play your part so that we can continue in person classes and don‚Äôt have to go back online.

This is the reason why people here dislike the homeless.

dw12xt	1	I saw the protest outside the chancellors office today, and when they stormed inside I struck up a convo with one of the union workers outside. She said the chancellor was cutting their benefits and pensions while simultaneously outsourcing their labor to companies that don‚Äôt follow California‚Äôs labor laws. I said that‚Äôs really shitty and told her good luck! I think this is a great form of protesting.   Later I heard complaints that the union was intentionally blocking bike paths and making as much noise around the library as possible (during midterm season). I think this is a shitty way to protest.   I never understand this idea of blanket inconvenience as a form of protesting? Some people are with you, some people are against you, and some people are neutral. The idea of a protest is (in my opinion) to inform people of an issue, gain support from new people, and to prevent the people against you from ignoring you. Obviously a protest doesn‚Äôt go without inconveniencing ANYONE, but going out of your way to piss off bystanders doesn‚Äôt make sense to me?
m9cpbf	0	My heart has been hurting deeply for all the pain and hate inflicted on the Asian community. Two of the most important women (my fake adoptive Moms) in my life that helped raise me, were of Vietnamese and Korean decent.

They have since passed, and I think of someone trying to hurt them or their/our family and it just breaks me. I just want you to know, I see you, I love you, and I have your back. That‚Äôs all.

rjmj6x	0	Just a random thought but think about it:  1) Everyone comes in at the same time (the beginning of freshman year) because we want to make money for a better future  2) We have RAs telling us the rules (circle masks) TAs teaching discussion sections (triangle masks) and professors in charge of our grades (square masks)  3) We have meals given out at the dining halls (steak at BPlate)  4) We have a rivalry with USC - comparative to that of Gi-Hun and Deok-Su or Sang-Woo  5) Our classes are like the games, where we have to follow the rules (academic honor code) and are judged on our performance. Some people have harder classes than others (like the dalgona candy shapes)  6) Following from the last point, during our classes (the games), we have some really industrious students who are (a little too) competitive (ie Deok-Su) and we have some slackers. Typically, those who survive are those who worked hard but sometimes, being too competitive makes you worse off (Mi-Nyeo pushing Deok-Su)  Anyways, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen.  Byeee

jmhzmq	0	As more time in quarantine goes by, I think many, including the school, are raising expectations for how well everyone should adapt to online learning. Slowly and subtlely chipped away are days of Covid accommodations, and there are little efforts in trying to understand what fundamentally determines a successful online learner from a miserable online student: home life.  Even just living in a spacious house with a yard, as opposed to an apartment, can make a huge difference: actual, readily accessible outdoor space with a yard vs. tight indoor confinement. Or, a supportive family that you get along with vs. living with people you can hardly tolerate. The point is, it's not so much the tedious zoom sessions or the reduced engagement, but *the* *quality of home life in quarantine* that predominately determines your online school experience, which makes online learning *always* wildly inconsistent from one student to another, because home environments will not change much no matter how long this goes.   Sadly, this level of fundamental inconsistency is hardly addressed, and thus hardly taken into consideration and accommodated for.

What is up with the biology-heavy course material? What is up with  the overly technical, nit-picky Midterm? How is any of this sociology at all?  Also, is anyone else super uncomfortable with the fact that the  people grading our exams are undergraduates who may or may not be  younger/less advanced students than us?  P.S. anyone else find the Baldwins horribly out-of-touch and painful to listen to?
1s4ipw	0	I am in the high school graduating class of 2017 and I desperately want to get into UCLA for my undergraduate education.   So far, the semester is coming to an end, and I will probably get 2 B's in honor classes out of seven classes total. This semester I really didn't know what I was expecting and high school really hit me hard.   I recognized that my grades were falling way too late, and they will reflect in my first semester report card. Putting that aside, do you guys have any tips for me and the next four years of high school?   Also, will the 2 B's have a big impact when they're considering accepting me? I feel like I'm overthinking, but there is nothing more than I want but to get into UCLA. If you have any advice or anything that could help me, please tell me.   Thank you so much and go Bruins! I hope to attend your college in four years. :)

919dcq	0	Hi guys I'm not an UCR student but I'm looking to buy real estate about below $250k around the UCR area. Ideally minimum 2 bedroom 1.25+ bath. I want to live in one room and rent out the other.  My ideal goal is to rent to professors or staff instead of students. NOTHING against the students of course. It's just that students come and go and my margin is so thin I can't afford turnover so often. I want long term tenants (so I guess grad students are good too).  Can you give any advice on where to buy? For example:  * What neighborhoods do staff live in? * What are the major public transportation routes I should look at (to buy houses/apts around those routes)? * Are staff guaranteed parking or are they fighting for parking like students? * Is there currently a housing shortage for staff, like there is for students? * What is the likelihood that UCR will build new housing for staff soon? Parking?  Finally, do you think UCR is a growing university and good place to invest in real estate?   * Pro: Your campus is beautiful, new, and aggressively recruiting students and upgrading faculty. * Con: I'm worried with so much open space around UCR, people can easily build new condos and drive down value of old condo I buy.  Any tips will be greatly appreciated!

maze3c	0	Yo. WTF was Komor's final. It brought down my grade from 94 to 85. THAT'S 9%. It's insane how I really put in the work throughout the entire quarter, just to have my final grade go from an A to now a B+. INSANE. When I saw my grade I was really disappointed in myself because I expect more from myself. But, looking at all the other chem group chats I'm in + my suite mates, it's so clear that it wasn't just me who was so massively messed up by that final. So many other people's grades went down by 6, 7, 8, and even 10%. TEN FUCKING PERCENT. And these are all people that I know really studied their assess off for this final. I really am just so tired and I really wish there was something more I could do to save my grade after this :/

Instead of educating others, ya‚Äôll seem to assert an elitist position over those who might not be as well versed in a subject as you are. Disclaimer  I am not saying all of ya‚Äôll are like this, just a large majority. I do see a lot of STEM related posts on here so maybe it has to do with that?
skrfel	1	Ya I‚Äôm talking to you EECS/CS boys and girls. Some of you guys smell absolutely foul. And I know you have time to shower bc I‚Äôm also CS and I shower regularly. If you smell like shit in class I better not see you watching anime on your laptop. I better see you paying close attention or grinding HW. And then after class I better see you sprinting to your next class or to the library to keep working. Preferably while simultaneously working in your project. Id consider myself to be an average to slightly above average CS student. But I‚Äôm taking 3 UDs which I know is somewhat on the tougher end of class schedules. And MFers I still shower every day. No one is impressed by the fact that you smell like literal dogshit. Please for the love of all you hold dear, clean yourself you animals.
y0mq3	0	Hey all, my bike was stolen from FSH stoke 1 last night, took the whole frame/rear set, left the front wheel.  Here are the details:  * Aluminum Visp 58cm frame/fork (painted tan, it is a little scraped up) * Velocity 700C Deep V WOODGRAIN rims (very distinct), white spokes, gold nipples, and white origin 8 sealed hub. These were probably the only things actually worth something on the bike, and they left the locked up one behind. * Flip flop white hub in the rear, freewheel included. The bike if kept together will have 2 different wheels or new wheels altogether. * White Session Brand 700C tires * Pace 3pc cranks (black) w/ metal and leather black pedal/straps/traps * Forte (black) neck with Carbon spacers * Black shortened bars (not super short) with locking grips. * Cork wrap MASI grips are on there right now. (again, very distinct)  Thanks for keeping an eye out, I have about 50 RSS feeds being monitored for Craigslist and eBay right now for bay area and LA areas (including SB). This thing won't hit the internet without me knowing. Now I just need local eyes!
mj2rfx	1	Like they are on a UCI subreddit, we have only gone to UCI, how are we supposed to judge another university we have never attended?? Almost all of these posts are from users who came from A2C which is literally a toxic subreddit full of prepubescent kids that stat check each other more than an rpg game. If UCSD's subreddit doesn't allow these posts we shouldn't either tbh. (I want to clarify that I am fine with posts that just ask about how a program is at UCI, but comparing universities is cringe.)

1qy2r1	0	Hello everyone, I'm a prospective community college transfer student. I have UCI on my tentative list of transfer universities. Turns out UCI has a department of Information and Computer Sciences. There are two minors that may be apropos to my background: Information and Computer Sciences; and Digital Information Systems. These are taught out of the School of Business.  Anyone here in the School of Business? What has been your experience like?

cg9ify	0	In a conversation I had with a friend of mine we were talking about the number of international students in U.S schools. He made a hook on that subject and told me his father works in the Justice dept. screening many of them, apparently the government's greatest concern lies in students coming from China (!!!)  He told me many are a huge risk of industrial/research espionage as they are briefed by their government on their way out and when they come back. He told me many of whom are asked to conduct espionage or are hired as spies.  That's just crazy! That never really crossed my mind while I was here.

However, I have a friend who goes to UCSD but her admissions office told her that she won‚Äôt receive credit.  She came to me asking if I could help her argue against the office‚Äôs decision to not her give credit.  What should I do?  (And yes, we are both in the same program doing the same work)

fv5koj	0	Today I did absolutely nothing productive or constructive, and my head hurts. I feel like I totally crashed and burned after this week. It makes no sense. I‚Äôm just at home; I don‚Äôt have to go anywhere for class and there are no events happening for me to make it to. I should have more steam, not less. I didn‚Äôt even have this type of problem in Fall Quarter when everything was new to me, and this is week *one*. What am I going to look like next month? Currently staring at the corner of my desk contemplating banging my head on it. Ready for a slew of comments on how I‚Äôm just being a baby and should get over it to come in.
8598le	1	Hello,  I'm sorry that you have to spend almost 20 hours a week grading our work since you do deserve to spend that time focusing on your work instead. Coincidently, that's the same amount of time that I spend on the labs and for studying for the midterm.  I'm sorry that I was not one of those 3 students who attend lab as I am currently aiding my brother as he is facing depression. I knew from the start that I was one of those kids that didn't have interest in the class because I spend 20+ hours working on each lab assignment and work on the hw. We're sorry that you had to go through a harder version of this class halfway around the world, you must've had a hard time as well. But hey, none of us are as motivated as you are in helping the ICS 51 students succeed, right? I mean, you took the time to write a response for someone who was trying to criticize the class while you should have been helping countless people who ask questions regarding how to do certain things such as how to use subregisters and knowing how to implement a loop. But hey, we all get it that we are not as smart as you are seeing that you taught ICS 51 for 3 years and also survived that hard course. We understand.  Thank you for all of your help.

rm3hnu	0	He is currently on the board of directors for a company called Leidos, which provides technologies that helps ICE monitor the US-Mexico border to prevent undocumented immigrants from coming in. Essentialy, Gary May profits off of ICE's malpractices at the southwestern border. Leidos also deals weapons like unmanned drones to the US military which has major implications in the Middle East.   May makes large amounts of money from some of the least moral industries in the country while also soaking up University funds to essentially do nothing. I do not like him one bit to say the least
lgol56	0	I never met him, but hearing that someone from the community died is so painful. He was nearing the end of Zoom University, soon to come back to campus to experience life as a Triton (I don‚Äôt think he was a senior). Now, he won‚Äôt have that opportunity.  He will again never see any of his friends or have the opportunity to make new ones. He will never again get to watch a soccer game, go to a party, play any drinking games, have a crush on someone, or go on a beach date. I feel a lot of sadness knowing all this.  If one of my friends had died, I would cry for days, about all the great times we‚Äôve had together and cannot have anymore. The great thing is that I‚Äôm alive. My friends are alive. You are alive. And your friends are alive. Make as many memories as you can, because you never know when you‚Äôll reach your last days. Life is too short to put the great things on hold. If something is on your bucket list, get on it.

q2axh	0	My current roommates have gone off the deep end this year, so we're parting ways after spring quarter. I will still be living in UCLA's housing, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be living in the school-owned apartments, or in the dorms. Either way, I have to do that whole room selection thing, so I'm not looking for someone to sign a lease with me or anything.  I figured I'd try to find a roommate here, because I at least know that people on here have (some) interests similar to mine.  Some stuff about me: I'm female, so I need the roommate(s) to be female as well  I'm a bit on the messy/disorganized side, but I do make it a point to clean up all my stuff once a week or so.  I have a boyfriend who comes over somewhat frequently, but he's out of the room by 11-11:30 on school nights.  I'm kind of a geek, and am prone to participate in geeky things.  I'm pretty easygoing about people borrowing my stuff depending on what it is, and how frequently someone wants to use it.  If you're interested, please let me know soon; my room sign-up date is on March 6th.

4gwyp1	0	I grew up thinking UCLA was a school for scientists and academics, but after getting accepted and joining the facebook page, I was completely turned off.   Everyone talks in ebonics and hoodspeak (even asians and white people). Honestly as an African American from the east coast, this is insulting.  People have ridiculous political views calling each other racist over nothing. Any real race-related questions about UCLA's socio climate never get answered. All the current UCLA students are going around trying to "sell" the kids to attend the school instead of letting them make their own decision.  Every 2 hours theres a new post talking shit about Berkeley or USC or Vanderbilt - and I'm in those other admit pages and they never reference UCLA at all. Kids are literally linking Buzzfeed articles to convince other kids to choose UCLA over another school.   I thought college would be a much more intellectual place, but I don't think I'd fit in here. They honestly seem a lot dumber than I expected, and I'm not getting the same feel I am from the campus visits and facebook discussions I've seen from other schools, even Berkeley and USC which are also in California.   Why is UCLA like this?
garypc	0	I was wondering if you (current student or alum) had the chance to go back in time to when you decided which college to attend, would you pick UCI again? Why or why not?  *also I will be a psychology major if anyone has specific comments about that
sw42bo	0	It seems Berkeley will have to enroll 300 fewer nonresidents every year starting from the next cycle. Berkeley typically admits 2000 nonresident freshman and transfer students every year. The thing I am curious is, how bad will this be for international student from California community college applying to Berkeley as an applied math major? Btw transfer acceptance rate for applied math major is around 35%

e04rct	0	The Cowell dining hall was randomly closed this morning around 9-9:30. I saw people eating inside so I snuck in anyways but the sliding door to the hot food area was closed and all the staff were in small groups talking with their supervisors. I asked one of them what was going on and one of them said a medical emergency had happened but I wonder if something different happened and the staff are trying to cover it up. Like what if there was a serious food safety concern and the ‚Äòmedical emergency‚Äô was a false excuse to hide the truth. Not that I don‚Äôt trust the staff or anything but hypothetically speaking the managers could have told all the employees not to say anything about what really happened. Yeah this is kind of a conspiracy theory I know... but I get curious when the dining hall is closed on a weekday morning during peak breakfast hours.

n4emqk	0	So I spoke to drone guy, and tried to kindly explain that if something you're doing is pissing off 99% of people around you, you shouldn't do it.  I tried to kind of nicely explain that to him, and that there is tons of open space to fly a drone in Santa Barbara, but it just isn't appropriate here. He dug his heels in and his girlfriend got all bitchy at me.  As a licensed pilot I also know that he is prohibited from flying above people, or other peoples property, anything beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), he has to notify SB airport before every flight because he's within 5 miles, and also anything creating a nuisance (thats not an FAA rule but a city rule).  Anyways I just called 911 and I'll let them deal with it. He chose to act like a dick so he gets treated like one.

gk8cm2	1	Today when I was doing my daily walk I saw groups everywhere, not to mention the 30+ people that were having a part in the backyard of a house.  And don‚Äôt tell me they all live there, it‚Äôs a tiny house, and they were all drunk and crowded next to each other. 30+ people ffs.  I‚Äôve seen snap and insta stories of groups at the beach and out in the mountains.  Stories from people that I know for a fact live in single gender housing yet are obviously intermingling with others.  Like are we supposed to all just accept that if we live near UCSB we are most likely to be infected? And then just pray it doesn‚Äôt do any lasting damage to our bodies?  Every day the streets get more crowded, social distancing breaks down more and more.  What will it take?  Someone dying in IV?  Though honestly it feels that these children wouldn‚Äôt even care, if they were even sober enough to understand. Smh. *Rant Over*

nryjjm	1	Unless you've been living under a rock lately, the UC has been struck with revamped controversy over limited spots for California applicants across the undergraduate campuses (with the exception being Merced, perhaps). Because of this, people have been suggesting turning a CSU into a UC campus (which apparently isn't allowed anymore because that's how UCSB became a thing). So why not just turn the UCR-Palm Desert extension into a new UC? That's how UCR, UCD, UCLA, and UCSD all became UC schools; they originally were just graduate or research extensions of UCB.  I'm thinking that they could call the campus University of California, Palm Springs. I know this is probably a pipe dream if we're talking about the near future, but it's not impossible either considering the history of UC that I aforementioned.  Thoughts?
ip3pmo	0	I know and saw the reddit post with all of the information regarding the last 300 students to receive financial aid and I myself am one of them. Its still just so scary to think about sometimes that I am 1 week away from the fees being due and while it says that my application is complete and that theyll have my aid award shortly and they said if they dont have it to me by then they wont drop me out of my classes  but I cant help but think what if something goes wrong and im dropped out of all of my classes because of this. Its really rough to think about.

8d1qif	0	There was a news link called 'A Case for the NewCen: It Is Time for Change'. I read it as It is Time for Charge. When I read it, I was like 'Oh, this must be disagreement with the UCen plan.', but when it's actually the opposite. The guy who actually wrote is already graduated, and said HE would like to have SOMETHING to say after HIS graduation. I only felt ripped off when they are going to charge me extra money for renovation, since why would I need to pay extra for public access service, isn't this already paid with tuitions and fees and tax money? BTW, the UC, this PUBLIC university's yearly tuition is somehow higher than some of the PRIVATE universities. Does anyone have any ideas related to UCen renovation?
gjrjzn	0	**Which college has a better business program? help me decide please I will be starting my undergrad studies and I don't know which to attend. UCR is close to home (20 mins away) and I would be a commuter student. I'm getting full tuition covered by financial aid as a commuter student. UCSD is further like 1 hour and 40 minutes away, I would probably be in debt because of dorming. I like UCSD but I've never been far away from home, but I know that it has better rankings overall. I don't know which would be best for me. I will be majoring in pre-business at ucr and international business at ucsd.**

If you're a new student you're probably familiar with the awesome Choose to Reuse Camel-Bak bottles that we included in every dorm. We'll also be giving these out at various events and booths on campus.

hdwj1l	1	Recently a meme was shared with the UCB subreddit outlining an allegedly "dismissive" and "disrespectful" act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.  Please refer to University of California, Berkeley as "UCB." This is **the** proper way to refer to the UC's original and flagship campus. While Cal, Berkeley, or UC Berkeley are other proper and acceptable ways to say it, it is preferred to be referred to as just "UCB."  As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, UCB students feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. They feel that "UCB" boldens their brand and emphasize the incredible prestige associated with UCB.  It is acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms, as well as UCB, the so-called "flagship and most well-known campus," and they therefore request that you start using the name "UCB" to refer their school. Thank you.  TL:DR  Please say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.

bz5oee	0	Hi this is my first post and I made a separate account to ask this question.  Has anyone had any experience switching into the mathematics department even though it's capped? I have a 3.42 GPA in my screening course, but I'm still nervous. I'm a continuing student, I've already spoken with the adviser and they said I shouldn't worry. I just want to know if anyone else has experience switching in please.  Thank you very much.  GL on your finals :)

cilxbu	0	 No I‚Äôm not the most social. Yes I have issues in my personal life that makes being happy a kind of muscle that I have to constantly exercise.   But honestly being here in this beautiful city and school makes it all worthwhile.   I see so much negativity in here, and though it‚Äôs just a fraction of UCSD, the vibe we implement on here spreads into reality too.   Let‚Äôs practice mindfulness, watching what and how we think, and how we treat ourselves. Practice attracting good things through good thoughts. Friends? No problem. Good grades? No problem. Love? It‚Äôs around the corner.   I have faith in y‚Äôall. Have a beautiful rest of the summer.
k0ejxa	0	Im taking physics 3A rn and my class is using the respondus lockdown browser. I really dont like using it and it makes me feel really uncomfortable when taking my exams. Are people that are an in 3B and 3C also using respondus or is it just my class? I just hope that my future physics classes dont force me to keep using it cause the entire physics department says so.

ldu580	0	I am a second-year pre-business student who is about to apply to SOBA. I was wondering for upper division finance students: do you only need 18 upper division classes to graduate? So you only need to take 3 classes per quarter for 6 quarters?  I already have a lot of units from college classes/AP tests, so I can only afford to take 3 classes per quarter in order to stay under 216 total units.  Also, is there a penalty for only taking 12 units per quarter? I have taken at least 15 units per quarter so far so I don't really know.
9xns07	0	I don't know what to say; I fucked up hard. I have an essay due for HUM 3 today and I've done nothing yet. It's not been for lack of trying, I've set aside 4 days for it barely going to class. But everytime I try to write I get so anxious and a little depressed about it I just watch YouTube so I don't have to think about it anymore. I know I'm just fucking making excuses and if I had the same motivation I had last year I could finish in the next 2 days and take the 10% penalty, but I don't know if I'll be able to. Is there a way to drop with a W at this point or is there some way I can appeal to my TA/Lyon to figure something out. It was the same thing with my last essay. I think it's some kind of mental health thing because I've never had this bad of a procrastination reaction before; it's to the point it feels more like avoidance. I've told myself I'd contact CAPS this quarter, but it's too late to get any help from that. If it helps with appealing I didn't have this problem last year and have As with HUM, so it's just something I'm struggling with now.

moln01	0	Hi guys,  I am so stressed about everything right now. I feel like life isn't going the way I expected it to go. I recently lost my cousin and my grandma, which took a huge toll on my mental health. My dog also has a mass growing in his ears and I'm scared that I won't be able to afford for surgery. I brought him to my apartment in riverside to take care of him. We left him at the apartment for an hour to run some errands and he bit the trim of the door. I honestly feel like I am at an all time low right now. Also, my 2/4 of my professors doesn't teach. It's not a big deal, but I literally do not understand physics. I don't know how group work and turning in a bunch of note cards will help me learn anything. Why can't some professors do their jobs and teach instead of going over useless definitions in a class that requires calculations?  Hahahaha sorry, this is more of a life rant.

74388a	0	So I ordered some stuff on Amazon on Saturday, and it happened to be that they arrived on Sunday afternoon.  Since the housing office doesn't process mail during Sundays, I was expecting to get them by Monday. But I didn't.   At least I was expecting to receive them today but I guess I am not. I am just hoping they didn't keep them somewhere behind the room and forgot to process them at all. I will probably wait for a few more days and just hope they didn't forget about it.  Tl:dr Make sure your packages never arrive on Sundays. Rather let them arrive on Mondays so that they can start processing right away!

kpurtn	0	 NEWS!  As of the winter quarter, the Freshman Collective is growing and adding transfer students to our family! If you transferred into UCR in 2020, now is the time to sign up and get yourself a mentor!  UCR's Campus Collective is an exciting new mentoring program for students who are entering college as a freshman.  Students are matched with mentors who are there to offer guidance as students acclimate to life in college.  Mentors will assist mentees in navigating the many adjustments that students often face when attending college for the first time. Mentoring pairs connect by text, phone, email, or virtual meeting platform.   https://ue.ucr.edu/mentoring

hcshht	0	Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.  Please do not refer to Berkeley as "UCB." This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.  As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that "UCB" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.  While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name "UCB" to refer our school. Thank you.  TL:DR  Don't say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.

kcq6hz	0	Hello everyone! I wish you all the best of luck on your impending finals! If you've already taken them, I hope your results turn out the way you want them to! These are very rough and stressful times but imagine the liberation you would feel after finishing a whole semester online :) You guys are going to go down in history for doing that unlike any other alumni... You've made it so far! I really wish that I will one day be able to take finals and complain about them on this reddit thread next year lol >< You guys are so inspirational and amazing for continuing to put in effort and hard work in college when the world is in chaos right now. I really look up to you guys.  I hope things work out for the best for you all. Go Bruins!  Edit: Thank you so much for all of the kind messages! This just reaffirmed why UCLA is my top choice :) The community is amazing.... You guys are the best!
fmii0n	0	Some background to my career aspirations include being a pre-med student majoring in biomedical engineering. For anyone who has insight in that major how is it like (that can be your major or you know someone majoring in biomed e.)? Also for anyone who is a pre-med student how has your experience been (extra appreciation for those who are bioengineering premed students). How are professors like for the basic required classes for any premed student (bio, chem, calculus, etccc...)? Important academic information to consider is I will be an IB diploma holding student and am learning calculus and physics already.   For those of you who may say how horrible it is to be a premed student or if I am sure about it, the answer is yes. My mind is quite made up on pursuing medical school and I in fact already have in mind in doing an ophthalmology residency.

The holidays are not a happy time to feel like shit, especially around family and old friends.
pxka3b	0	I am here on a scholarship but I feel like it just a huge waste of time and money.  1. No parking - There is no where to park and we have to fight over what little parking spots there is. 2. No food - All of the dining halls have hour longs waits and some don‚Äôt even have food we can order. Also, the food that we do receive looks and taste so bad. 3. No internet - seriously, at a time and age like this and you can‚Äôt figure how to get internet faster than dial up. Sometimes when I walk into class I spend a majority of time fighting to get wifi. This wifi has screwed with several interviews and online classes.  4. No Housing - dorms are shitty but like some people don‚Äôt even have somewhere to live. 5. No Laundry  - why is there only 4 washing machines for a whole apartment building. And now I have to worry about someone pissing into my laundry because I live in warren. 6. No visitor policy - we can‚Äôt have visitors in our dorm yet you stuff hundreds of people into classrooms where everyone sits shoulder to shoulder, and have events like meet the beach where thousands of people show up without mask.   And this list probably goes on and on. I‚Äôm sorry I just needed to vent.
rytbzz	0	As I understand, the SUA (student government) is pushing for a fully remote Winter quarter and sent the chancellor an email about this demand yesterday. I can't comprehend why this is desirable given the information we know now. Based on the trends we are seeing everywhere, Omicron will most likely peak in a week or two from now (probably during Week 3) and by the start of Week 5 we should be in good shape to begin in-person education, perhaps having a 1-week hybrid period with remote lectures and in-person sections to safely transition. Given this information regarding the peak as well as Omicron being significantly less dangerous than previous strains, why are we trying to have the entire quarter be remote?

juebpc	1	Before I sell my soul to the devil, how are the Econ classes at Davis?

This will be my last quarter of GE‚Äôs as well, so it makes sense to minor in something that‚Äôs marketable for better employment for the future.
fkygij	0	Turning off the lights, locking the door, and walking out of an office I likely won't see again for at least a couple of months was more emotionally difficult than I had expected.  I packed up a big markerboard and three boxes of textbooks, Lego, magnetic rods, electrical components, and other tools of the trade that will be useful for teaching online for a while. Filled out the working-from-home form and turned that in. Tidied things up, unplugged everything, threw out some old stuff that I probably should've thrown out months or years ago. And as one final act of, I don't know, defiance I suppose, I wound the old wall clock, set the time, and put the pendulum in motion. It'll be ticktocking and chiming out the hours to an empty room for a few days at least. Felt right somehow.  Until next time, UC Davis. Stay safe out there.

kpgrfx	0	I signed up for Music 11B by Karlton Hester for Jazz or whatever because I wanted to fulfill a GE, and I guess I didn't search well enough for background info because I am only now just finding out about multiple, vehement warnings by past students via this subreddit and RMP to *not* take the class.  I'm not even that interested in Jazz, which I guess was something I should've thought of first, but I wanted to finish the CC GE this quarter and Music 81C wasn't available.  He has a 2.2/5 for 80 reviews on RMP, and although he seems established as a musician, I'm now wary about his course because of the descriptions of it being strenuous and disorganized.  I'm gonna have to rethink a lot because it was difficult to conjure up three classes that were available for me this quarter that suited the path I'm taking, and I'm probably gonna have to switch out of this one, of which I don't know the window of time to do so, and rethink my game plan.  Hopefully I'm overreacting, to be honest.  Remember to do your due diligence in background-checking your future classes.  If anyone has any advice about this or (very helpfully) about what class would be prime to switch with this, please let me know. Thank you.  TL;DR: "Ya like jazz?" Not currently :(

q8a9mf	0	Hi all. I graduated in 2014 with a BA in Global Studies and I just wanted to let you know I'm really happy I went to UCR. I use most of what I was taught every day. I don't work in international politics, but I do work in the government. The things I learned from my degree, like understanding why people are they are in the world, shows up every single day.   So, I just wanted to share that I'm one proud alum. Not every school has a diverse staff with a pretty awesome curriculum. When I went to grad school, I was disappointed how mainstream the curriculum was compared to UCR.   So, embrace some r'side. Embrace the uniqueness. Embrace such a hidden gem of a UC. You go to a great school :)  And really, once you're older, no one cares AS MUCH where you went to school. The federal government only cares that I got a 2.95 GPA or higher.   Enjoy your fall quarter!!! üíó

bf1ze8	0	Last week our beloved band director at UCR committed suicide after unfounded allegations of sexual misconduct were brought against him at his other school. The police investigated and found evidence of him being catfished by a minor, no criminal wrongdoing.  The department chair sent out an email to a few of the current band members (not all) and the music department faculty and absolutely nothing else has been said by the University. I went to the counseling center and they didn't know about what was going on. Some of my friends have missed classes due to grief but none of their faculty know that it's because one of their colleagues committed suicide. I had one person say that "they would have heard about that" in response to me saying that I couldn't make it to class and asking about notes.  I'm not a music Major, so none of my faculty are aware of what's going on and kind of brushed it off when I mentioned it was the band director.  Like the band director isn't one of the most important people in the life of every musician.  Rest in Peace, Dr. Sam R Andress. Whatever the flip the school is thinking, we miss you.

izwtjl	0	I was accused of using Chegg for a physics 40c final that I took in spring. The final was multiple choice and fully open notes, slides, ect. Just no outside internet resources. I checked my history for that night and confirmed that I never entered Chegg. I also have never paid for Chegg. However, I did look up some common equations and constants that were on the equation sheet to save time. The main accusation was for using Chegg, though.   Has anyone else gone through this process when they were innocent?  Update 1: I just had my SCAIP administrative meeting and it went well. It turns out that they're only investigating based on a list of Chegg accounts that accessed the questions and one of the account email addresses looked like it belonged to me. I do have a Chegg account but the coordinator confirmed that this account was not the one that is being investigated. The best part though is that this Chegg account accessed the questions on a day that I wasn't taking the final. There were 2 final dates and I guess the professor didn't bother to check that they lined up. Once the coordinator confirms that I took the final on a different day, I should be cleared. Thanks again everyone.

I returned to graduate at my original high school, and am hoping to transfer next year after my cc courses are all taken.  Will this possibly damage my chances in any way?

Everyone makes it sound like everyone gets shit faced every weekend and is buzzed every other day, but you guys, who actually attend, what's it really like? I know "any school can be a party school." If you don't want to party, how's the academic side, and if you want to party occasionally, what's it like? What's the campus environment and students like? Do you like UCSB or would you have rather gone somewhere else? How do you think it compares with CSU SD?

nqa1mu	0	Coachella is happening next year, but it's from April 15-17 and April 22-24. Neither of those dates are on a break, but does anyone know if either weekend is better? At least in regards to the UCSB calendar. On a side note, anyone going to Rolling Loud this year?
8drun9	0	My best friend will be graduating from UCR this spring on June 17th And I‚Äôm so excited for him! He has already used up all of his tickets for the commencement ceremony for his family, but unfortunately that means me and our other best friend can‚Äôt go. :(  So I‚Äôm wondering if anyone on here that is graduating has a couple of extra tickets we could have? It would mean the world to me and my friend.  Thank you again everyone!
855jv7	0	Graduating with a 3.6 gpa and I thought I‚Äôd contribute my knowledge back to the subreddit.  I‚Äôve been involved heavily in plenty of student orgs including a fraternity.   I‚Äôve had 3 internships, 1 at a startup and 2 at the company I am going to work at full-time after graduating.  Starting total comp is >$150k.  Ask me anything from CS to campus life.
sjnb6y	0	I‚Äôm not happy about getting rejected but I did learn a lot about how these clubs work. If I actually got in I still would have made an AMA post. If you wanna figure out how these club‚Äôs recruitment events really work just ask me your questions here and maybe I can help
dfnm8k	1	I thought this list would be useful, especially during midterm season. Here are my favorite places to cry on campus.   Outside of Soda (next to Cafe VA). Everyone usually minds their own business because they're busy doing work. Also, it's usually a little bit sunny which makes the situation better. If you're crying you might as well be in a nice environment with some plants around you.  Benches near strawberry creek. I've found that nobody is ever in the naturey part of campus, so it's really nice to just sit on the benches and look at the creek and trees and cry to yourself as much as you need, and nobody will bother you.   Single bathrooms in Dwinelle Hall. These are conveniently located right outside lecture halls just in case you need to excuse yourself for a good cry.   **Hot takes**:  During a midterm or exam. This is controversial, but nothing beats just silently letting tears run down your face during the exam where everyone else is focused on their own work. Bonus points if a TA makes eye contact with you while you cry.  Cory bathrooms. Listen...I know it's grimy. But nobody's ever in there because it smells awful, and you can't smell how bad it is if your nose is stuffy enough from crying.  Feel free to add your own recommendations!
336moh	0	Hi All,  I am currently on the Davis Waitlist for mechanical engineering. My other option is UCI. I just went to UCI and really liked the campus and engineering program, but I also like Davis. So I am conflicted on which school to go. Does anyone have any reasons for me to attend Davis or UCI?
qft6tk	0	Since the start of the quarter I‚Äôve been sporadically hearing the occasional cough here and there, but today it feels like there‚Äôs at least one person in my vicinity coughing their lungs out every time I sat down somewhere. There was this girl at geisel who had the most phlegm-filled cough, then when I escaped to PC there was this homeless man coughing uncontrollably for a straight 10 seconds with their mask under their chin. Not to mention there were multiple instances of coughing left and right as I made my way around campus today. Had to go home early today just to change my clothes and shower just to feel clean again..
j6ip5s	0	I used to meet up new people on campus, and now that's not an option, I am wondering how people are doing it. I also moved to my parents house far away, so I am having a hard time finding other UCLA peeps. Any tips and advice would be appreciated.

rx28w1	0	Idk between moving in on Jan 2nd and classes starting on Jan 3rd, Omicron/COVID, and just generally being mentally ill, I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I‚Äôve hardly made any effort to participate in any of my classes so far. I already feel so behind because I‚Äôve been too anxious to approach any of my classes. I‚Äôm not even taking boring or difficult classes either I‚Äôm just so tired all the time. I‚Äôm kinda just curious if anyone else feels this way, that might make me (and anyone else?) feel a little better about being so stressed out right now :/

m50gd0	1	Dear Professors on this sub,    I realize it must be very annoying to receive dozens of emails a day about individuals you don‚Äôt even know asking if they could get involved research. I understand that many of you do not have the time to sift through every email and even give a response back to every student. However, like many others, whenever this happens to me, I feel inadequate and worthless. Am I not even worth a simple ‚ÄúNo, sorry.‚Äùthat you just leave me waiting for a response until the ends of time, agonizing over whether I will ever hear back? However, I have a solution to this everlasting awkwardness and dread. Rather than me reaching out to you, I think it would be a better use of everyone‚Äôs time if you simply reach out to me.  If you are a professor who is conducting some form of biological or chemical research, please reach out to me with a CV, a letter of recommendation, and a description on what your lab does. If the work seems somewhat interesting, I will be sure to let you know that your lab is receiving strong consideration. If you do not receive a message back, it is because I am simply too busy.
l9s9dk	0	Throwaway for soon to be obvious reasons.  I'm a conservative who hasn't told anyone at Berkeley.    Are there any conservative/Republican/even-remotely-right-of-center bears out there?  Pretty much all of my friends back home are liberal, they just understand that I'm not a bad person and they don't really care that we disagree politically.  Maybe I'm not giving people here enough credit, but I fear they won't be so uncaring about my point of view.  I'm tired of living this way.  If you fit any of the above criteria and are also looking for a friend, please feel free to DM me.
3m5lyd	0	What were the reactions of the individuals (family, friends, & etc.) surrounding you during high school or community college when you decided to attend this University of California?  Are you curious of what was thrown at the students at all of the other UC campuses? Go to my profile and look at the threads I started.
gw41vn	0	Ever since the switch to online format of evaluations, I don't understand why they want these evaluations at the end of week 10. I can understand if they want ESCI evaluations done before you get your final grade. If they are fearful of people being petty and giving classes bad evaluations because they did poorly in the class, MAYBE. Even then, people's mindset about grading and the fairness of the class are developed already by the first large essay/exam, and the evaluations should include the fairness of the final exam, often worth 50% of the grade. Why does the admin want us to turn in the evals before Finals? Plus, I'm the kind of person who actually is motivated to write extra comments, but I don't have the time/energy for that while studying for the finals.  I'm just remembering how I got shafted a year ago when my professor gave us a final nothing like the level of the midterm or homeworks, and then felt even worse because I previously gave them a satisfactory evaluation because I didn't expect him to screw us over.

dptnv9	0	I didn't really fuck with the "consent is sexy" message of the protest. The terrible things that happened weren't done in lieu of knowing what consent is, they were a complete disreguard of consent. What the protest should have focused on is how the school can allow an organization like sig pi to exist when the frat obviously has such terrible members and governing body. I know that educating people on consent is always important, but i doubt those guys who commited those crimes were ignorant in understanding what consent is, they just didn't care

o27zjh	0	Hello, I am still waitlisted for computer science game design (alt major choice: computer engineering). UCSC has always been the top school that I want to go due the strong CS and game design program and since it is very close to my home.  Many of my interests align with game design as I made many games and have experience working with game designing software. I am also more than happy with pursuing computer engineering too. I am still desperately waiting for a response. Is it still worth to it to wait? When will I get a response? I haven't sent a LOCI when I got waitlisted. Should I send it now? Will CS classes fill up before I even get a response from wait-list? Will housing be filled up and force me into some random vacant spot?   Sorry if this type of post may be repetitive and if I have unnecessarily made this post. I just want to get a response to my questions. Thank you for your time and help.
mm9hmo	0	i‚Äôve had at least one of my TAs every quarter this year say that a student told them that.   which one of y‚Äôall is doing that.  what is wrong with you.   first of all that‚Äôs lowkey rude because they work hard to make these quizzes a good supplement to our learning while also regarding how hard it is to take these classes during COVID. secondly other students don‚Äôt work at the same pace as you and need these quizzes to boost their grade. if you want something to test your knowledge, find quizzes to take online. do the questions in your book.   there‚Äôs literally no benefit to making things harder for everyone else. be considerate of your TA and other students.

q785s	0	Hi r/ucsd! I'm looking for someone to rent the other bedroom in a 2BR/2BA apartment in UTC. It's a really nice place (new carpet, wood floor kitchen, granite countertops in kitchen/baths, stainless steel appliances) and rent is $930/mo, plus half of the utilities (usually ~$70). The room is 11'x12' with a walk-in closet, patio, and you get your own bathroom right next to it. The kitchen is fully stocked and the living room is fully furnished.  It's at La Jolla Village Drive and Lebon, giving easy access to 5, 805, and 52. There's a bus stop at the corner that goes right to UCSD, and it's about a 7min drive to Sorrento Valley. The complex has a great pool, hot tub, and grill. There's also a fitness center, and a club house that can be rented out.  It's available ASAP, and the lease goes to August. PM me if you're interested!
mjowdl	0	Occasionally I see people post snippets or screenshots of their lecture recordings on this sub or elsewhere.   You should stop, for 2 reasons:  1) It opens you up to not only a student conduct case but also potentially a legal copyright case. Your instructors are sharing their lectures only with the registered students in the course. They own the copyrights to their lectures, it is very likely illegal for you to publish these, and they would be in the right to pursue this case.  2) Just like you expect your professors to respect your privacy, you should respect theirs as well. If you have ever felt uncomfortable with the idea of, say, a recording of a proctored exam or Lockdown Browser, and if you'd feel uncomfortable with that recording of yourself being published online, remember your instructors are regular people too who probably have similar privacy concerns of their own.
gux0g1	0	Where do I find out about protests to join in on?

4lixyc	0	Some of my friends are in colleges where in between the last day of instruction and finals theres a week where you are supposed to "study". None of them study and thus get lower scores relative to their peers that do study than what they would have gotten (and thus fall behind the curve). I know for a fact that I would be one of those people who did not study. Heres my thanks to UCSD for not allowing my lazyness to get the better of me too much.
akwrfb	0	I asked a club and they told me that they would no longer read my stuff. I asked a female friend and she said the prose was good. Another said that my lexicon was good. Any guidance is appreciated.
fx58pf	0	Okay, so I have a strong belief that because I had an awful time during high school and of course in this room of mine, every single time I come back here I just don't get any motivation. I lay in this bed and don't feel any need to do anything, eat anything, or to talk to anyone. I step a foot in this room and it sucks the life out of me, its a simple spell but quite unbreakable until I make it back to campus. So once I found out I would be doing all of the Spring quarter here, I just about lost my mind. It's only the start of week 2 and I've already missed 3 zoom discussions/lectures because I either overslept or just was a potato and couldn't process anything let alone my academic obligations. On top of that, I don't even have a fucking desk to do any work and the kitchen table is just not an option so for some reason because of this I can't muster up the energy to take out my notebook and do notes or practice problems in bed, thus I haven't done any homework, or anything productive for that matter, in the past 3 weeks. If you have read this far then you probably noticed I'm not having a dandy ol' time in this quarantine as an introvert should. I feel like a potato. Fuck this quarantine.  Thanks for listening.

s9wi1b	0	I'm on the executive board for Associated Graduate Students (the graduate student government). We were NOT consulted about the decision to return to in-person instruction. The ASUCI executive board also was not consulted.  The University's statement that "The decision to proceed was based on broad consultation with the community, including ... student government leadership" is extremely misleading (verging on falsehood).  Just want y'all to know that although the University is trying to use student leaders to justify their decision, AGS and ASUCI were not consulted. AGS and ASUCI will be issuing a joint statement to call out the University's misleading statement and to raise some concerns we have with their decision.
p5t157	0	With an average of 12,177 new cases a day over the past week, and 31 deaths a day just in California alone, I don't think returning to campus is a smart idea simply so UCI can make money.   source: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/08/17/covid-cases-college-fall-semester-tuition/5591245002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/08/17/covid-cases-college-fall-semester-tuition/5591245002/)

rmmtan	0	Many UCLA students don‚Äôt have hundreds of dollars to spend on a new flight or hotel because the admin has decided at the last minute to not give us access to our dorms, which we‚Äôve already paid for.  If they were truly focused on stopping the spread of COVID, they would pay for these adjustments. Instead, many people will be staying with friends in their dorms, since that‚Äôs their only option - making the problem worse.  Not to mention that there were zero cases of covid transmission in a classroom last quarter (as UCLA so proudly told us last week), so to stop covid we‚Äôre moving classes online and forcing people to stay in the dorms - where masks aren‚Äôt required and most covid transmission happens. Everyone knows there will be tons of dorm parties these next two weeks.  Who came up with this plan?? The incompetence of these people is astounding.

n7d6la	0	 Hello everyone,  I recently got admitted into UCSB for pre-Economics, but I have a few concerns:  1- How math-heavy are econ classes in UCSB, I am VERY bad at math and the only thing I can do confidently is probably calc-1 level derivatives, and that probably as far as I can stretch. Idk how good I am in stats because I've never taken stats but yeah...  2- How rigorous would you say econ classes are in UCSB?  3- For current econ majors/ alum would you say you would have rather enrolled in another college? My current options are SDSU or UCSD (other than UCSB).  4- I am an international student so my estimated yearly cost is 60k for UCs and 45k for SDSU would you say it's worth paying this much for the econ program in UCSB or should I go for the cheaper option in SDSU?
hbojqg	0	This senseless crime is a devastating loss to his family and to the Cal community.  This was a heinous act of violence on an innocent person.   I didn't know Seth Smith but reading posts from those who knew him all shared the same sentiment  - he was a kind, brilliant, talented, funny, compassionate, accomplished, great guy.    I hope they find the person(s) involved with this crime.  His mother is determined to get answers for her son's murder and I hope she gets them soon.

The problem is that my coding experience is almost nonexistent, other than the five Khan Academy Javascript exercises that I did back in my senior year of high school. Not only that, but the class is a huge pain to get into by itself, and even if people do get in, I heard that it is PURE TORTURE, almost like a weeding class. What are my options? What do you guys recommend?

I‚Äôm very uncomfortable with the alcohol my roommates have in the apartment because of its behavioral consequences for them (and their guests, who are usually members of the opposite sex and trundle around the apartment at 1am). of course, a SF environment is no guarantee against this stuff, but ya.  does anyone have experience with switching rooms on this basis, and is it even possible to do this before the year is up? :) if so, I would love to hear what‚Äôs gone on with that.  thank you! :) :)  tl;dr - opted for SF-housing, didn‚Äôt receive it, life at the apartment is disruptive, and I‚Äôm wondering what can be done.
amy5gf	0	I just found out I am graduating early and have a lease on a room at campus entrance. I don't want to pay for 6 months of rent when I am not living there. Anyone interested in subleasing the room? I can make it to Science hill in 15 minutes by bus. I've attached the basic description I posted on other sites. Pm me if interested. Will be available on 3/26/19. I apologize if this breaks the subreddit's rules, nothing in the guidelines mentions this kind of thing.   Sublease that can be renewed for next year. Room for sublease has attached private bathroom complete with tub and shower. Room can house one or two people. Looking for clean, respectful, and courteous housemates for house with other UCSC students. Has downstairs common area and kitchen complete with modern appliances (including gas stove). Pets are allowed on a case by case basis but there is an additional $500 deposit. Located at base of UCSC campus next to multiple bus stops and park/dog park. Amenities include dishwasher, washer/dryer, central heat (downstairs), garage parking, and swimming pool access. Rent is $1837/month with a $475 deposit. Room does not come furnished.  &#x200B;  [https://imgur.com/a/i59Ew68](https://imgur.com/a/i59Ew68)
2hwjxq	0	Like the title says where can I find a place to play basketball at UCI, and where are the empty places, and the busy courts located at?  Thank you
s46emw	0	Ok. This situation is just jading. We are most likely going to end up online anyway, but there‚Äôs this uncertainty that keeps me from focusing on my classes and gives me a lot of anxiety. Does anyone else feel the same way? Can we just petition to stay online for the rest of the quarter and get it over with? Petition link: https://chng.it/qvHn85LkXR
ey0i5s	1	Ever since he smoked last year, all he does is consume marijuana. He has become a habitual user and I am worried for his sake and my own as well. He is up to one weed a day and there is no sign of him stopping. He is always eating pizza and I get jealous. What should I do?
hlfp8l	0	It would be nice not having to text my friends to come down and open the door for me when I'm visiting. And sometimes I just wanna study in a different lounge or check out the building.  Reslife why??? If a student was up to some sketchy shit they would be able to get inside ANYWAYS by standing there waiting 30 seconds for someone to open the door.
i7zkln	0	I just got an email about Aggie Orientation. It says ‚ÄúParticipation in Aggie Orientation is mandatory for all new students. The fee to participate is $350 for commuters and $480 for residential students (meals & housing included) which covers all three parts: Aggie 101, Aggie Advising and Aggie Orientation.‚Äù  Why am I required to pay this much money for a meeting on Zoom? My parents are currently struggling financially and I would rather not pay this amount of money. I‚Äôve asked people if orientation is important, and they said orientation is useful to learn how to use schedule builder, oasis, and my degree, but i already know how to use them. I have also spoken to an advisor so I don‚Äôt need that either.  What will happen if I choose not to register for orientation? Thanks.
mbz9di	0	ochem 8b grades just got posted and I ended the class with a C- which is passing. However I plan on applying to PA school and they require classes to be passed with a C. Is there anyway to retake the class? Maybe CC? Any info or help is appreciated lowkey stressing about grades/gpa this quarter was rough
fditon	0	Please join me in r/ucsccola to restart a constructive discourse and in r/uscsstac to vent our frustrations regarding the COLA movement.
7lee3d	0	basically what the title says ^^ all honest and truthful opinions please! im currently a junior in high school, and im thinking about majoring in biology or psychology... but im thinking of pursuing a career as a therapist. like psychotherapy, and possibly CBT. my gpa (as of now) is 4.2 and my highest SAT score is 1440. the most recent SAT i took (the November one) i flunked so bad... did soooo bad on math section. :/ SAT math is challenging for me in general... i would really like to know what a majority of UC schools look for in its applicants, except obviously the admissions process will differ by each school, and probably changes each year.
kctijr	0	I forgot what time it was until I heard a chorus of people suddenly scream "FUCK" from around my apartment complex. Somehow the reminder than I'm not alone in this miserable quarter is motivating me. Good luck on your finals everyone!
cz9rne	0	What company or crew do you use to clean your apartment? How was your experience?
rhiw53	0	Hi everyone, my grades were finally posted and I got a Y (I think Yes for pass) in one of my classes. But I didn‚Äôt request a pass or no pass in that class, I wanted a letter grade. Should I email him to give me a letter grade?
b2240d	0	Our team gets revenge by demolishing Cal State Fullerton 92-64. Team effort but Collin Welp and Max Hazzard dominated them!  This will be the second time in school history that we made the tournament. We made it in 2015 but lost by two points to the defending champions, Louisville, in the Round of 64. We were really close even with Louisville having two NBA players (Terry Rozier/Boston Celtics and Montrezl Harrell/LA Clippers).  Go Anteaters!!!
57pv6w	0	I was debating/discussing this with my roommate yesterday. Obviously Crown is Ravenclaw, and I also maintain that Stevenson is Slytherin and Cowell is Gryffindor, but I'm undecided about the others. Thoughts?
167epq	1	Having some trouble meeting new regular (daily/weekly) tokers (I know maybe 4) Or even anyone who smokes in general. Anyone want to hangout, we can chat a bit, I just realized I sound like a cop. I'm a male living on campus.   If there happens to be any others who favor herbs, and baking, let me know, and we can get together and talk about our common interests while doing legal things.
i7d6lh	0	Hi, I'm a newly admitted undergrad student to UCI for the fall quarter of 2020. I read about majority of fall quarter classes being online and I figured if the rest of the year are gonna be mostly online classes, I might as well just take them at a JC.  Now let's say I'm notified later on that the winter quarter will include more in-person classes. Could I transfer to UCI after the fall quarter at a JC?
qik0oh	1	To the biker I almost hit this morning in downtown Davis who glared at me. It's called a stop sign. You're supposed to stop. Especially when blowing through it puts you within 10 feet from the hood of a car making a left turn. Please don't give me the stink eye for your inattention to traffic signals.   Thank you.
en49mm	0	I am a girl and I transferred here last quarter. I met some people that seem nice but aren‚Äôt interested in going with me to a party. I usually spent most of my weekends last quarter working outside of Santa Barbara area or studying and I have never been to a frat party. I have been to plenty of parties before but always with a group of friends. I am also getting pretty tired of sitting in my room doing nothing and I know I am going to be too busy later on in the quarter to go. Literally the only thing I know about frat parties is from last quarter with all the sexual assault emails we got so I am a bit more hesitant to go.  Any words of wisdom, tips or tricks?
4yfgi5	0	Hey so I'm an incoming freshman and I'm debating whether or not to rush. I just wanna know the importance of going Greek to get into parties. (I'd probably only go out 1-2 nights a week.)  EDIT: And I'm a guy.
a7kskc	0	Are grades due December 19th at midnight, and if so, is this guaranteed that all class grades are gonna show up? I still have 3 classes whose grades have not been posted yet and just want to make sure they will show up... thanks guys!
