62	kept	They seem well made, but as you try to sharpen them, the lead breaks.  The first one I sharpened took me down to half the length to get it to not break, but only because I did not sharpen it to the tip.  I was using a hand-held sharpener, so maybe trying a different type will yield different results.
423	kept	Although this looks like the one i saw in Staples, it isn't.  I wanted one that doesn't have the spring.  My kids in class are tough on staplers.  They spring the springs by pulling them open.  This one is okay.  It will work.  It just isn't what i was hoping for.
146	kept	For a pencil sharpener, I would give it five stars as it sharpens about as well as any I've tried. However, I placed it on a wood table, and noticed yesterday there are black rings from the rubber feet which have stained the wood and would not come up no matter what I tried. I am very upset as this was nice wood. So if you buy it, place something under it before putting on a wood desk!!!
326	kept	I don't like the self-adhesive seal.  I much prefer the peel-and stick.  I found the self-sealing was awkward to use, and didn't always like completely flat.  Other than that, itOK but I would not buy it.
170	returned	These permanent markers are pretty bad! The colors don't match the caps! They are really thick, unlike Sharpies. If you need permanent markers, STICK WITH SHARPIE!!
389	kept	don't last ,expensive,but needed.will order again as needed as I have no choice if I want to use the printed
26	kept	This paper was not really of the high quality standards I have come to expect from Mead products in the past. While it is fine for it's intended purpose and useable I find the thickness of the paper to be extremely thin and the lines on the backside of some of the pages from this pack were so faded I had trouble seeing them.  Honestly, I expected better.
317	returned	This unit is not heavy duty enough, nor hot enough to seal any more than a page or two. Try to seal more, and you will get areas that do not seal the adhesive, resulting in white splotches on your finished project.
404	returned	This is my first disappointing experience with the Quartet brand. My combination board arrived with a large buckle in the magnetic whiteboard. I posted pictures on this product page. The glue separated. We tried to re-fit the white surface but couldn't smooth it out.The buckle wasn't just an aesthetic blemish. Quartet needs to adjust the amount or type of glue used on the magnetic whiteboard.I like the board's size (30" x 18") and the combination utility with the cork board surface. The aluminum frame came with two mounting options (clips and mounting pads) for cubicles or walls.Overall, the board is of less-than-average quality, especially weighing the $74.99 list price and $46.99 Amazon price. I can't recommend this board at either of those prices.I do recommendQuartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Markers, which I received at the same time as this board. I'm using the markers with a different dry erase board.Rating: Two stars
401	returned	This envelope is so stiff, that it is hard to access the folders.  You have to use both hands to keep it open so you can get inside.  It doesn't stand up on it's own, so you have to hold it while you try to hold the lid open to use it.  It is easier to pull the folders out, in order to work with them.  It isn't very practical to have to pull the folders out every time you want to access them.  It does fit well in backpacks, like it advertises but I don't think it is very easy access.If the above things bother you, I would suggest looking elsewhere for a better folder unit.
213	returned	I hate this printer with a fiery passion.  I fantasize about running it over with my car - that's how much of a hassle it has been.The Good (and the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1):1. Color copies are crisp and look good - especially with a higher quality paper.The Bad:1.  The scanner makes me insane.  It is so slow I could send my document more efficiently via pony express.  It also randomly doesn't work some days - particularly after scanning multi-page documents.2.  HP customer 'support' is so bad it's like a comedy routine about outsourced customer support.  If you need help, plan to devote a few hours on the phone to HP 'support', and plan to go through long checklists that are unrelated to your problem.  The last 2 times I called with a question their solution was to unplug the unit and leave it unplugged for a few days and try again.3.  The fax is slow and sometimes unreliable.4.  Like others, I was annoyed that I needed to buy my own USB cable - and the first one I bought didn't work with this printer (though it works with other things) - I had to get another.5.  The set-up.  I may not be a pro but I am hardly a tech novice - I have a home office and have used several different all-in-ones in the past.  This is the first time that installing a printer caused me so much trouble (including buying multiple USB cables and calling HP 'support' twice).Also, and I can't count this as a negative since it is stated, be aware that this unit does not copy wirelessly unless you have an Ethernet connection/card.Bottom line:  Hours upon hours of hassle and frustration make this unit not worth it at any price.
229	returned	I bought this product for my grandchildren, as they use a lot of pencils at home doing school work and their many arts and crafts projects. I was very disappointed by the performance of this sharpener. It did not work well at all out of the box. When it did run, it did not sharpen the pencils, it just ground them up, no matter what kind of pencil it was. After two days and wasting an entire package of 20 pencils, I ultimately sent it back. I then ordered a manual crank sharpener that suctions to the table and it works great. And it was far less expensive.
136	kept	The applicator works okay, but it's essentially the same as a CD Stomper applicator I already had. The only difference is that the new one has a couple of slots at the edges to accommodate a change in the labels. For some reason, the smaller cylinder in the middle of the applicator is smaller than the small holes in full print labels, so the side slots help with alignment - except that the extra wings on labels rip off if you aren't careful removing the label from the sheet. It seems like all of that could have been solved with better engineering.
405	kept	Large. Heavy. Good luck finding a space for it on your desk. I have it in a file cabinet and not using it.
450	returned	I am so relieved to read that other reviewers had the same reaction to this notebook that I did: the colors of the pages are gaudy. The second I opened this product, I knew I could not use it in a professional setting. The ruled area is &#34;ruled&#34; in a royal blue, the &#34;QuickNotes&#34; section is an alarming yellow, and there are pinkish-red lines in the notes section. As mentioned, it looks like a primer that one might use in high-school when taking a business course. Not to mention, on each page, the words &#34;QuickNotes&#34; appear at the top in a large, silly font.For me, this is unusable.
402	kept	i wanted to like this file folder. i use these types of folders a lot to sort school paperwork for my kids. i didn't like the shape or bulkiness of this one. it's oddly shaped from any other file folder i've used with the huge flap and the opening at the short side instead of the longer side. i may not use this as often because of this.
258	returned	I have been buying the combo ink 45/78 for years for my printer.  I thought I would order from amazon rather than Staples for the first time and boy am I sorry I did.  I received a loose unlabeled white cardboard with a color ink cartridge in it, I have not put it in my printer, I am hoping it even works, but I am doubtful.  I am thinking it could be really old - or something must be wrong because why would this seller send me 2 separate ink cartridges and one is not even in any packaging?  Not sure where these came from but I will not be ordering from this seller again.
94	kept	These are fine envelopes; but if you are buying them for the advertised security tint, they make poor security envelopes.  When I sealed my check in one, not only could I tell there was a check inside, I could read the check routing numbers by holding the envelope up to the light.  I had to add an extra sheet of folded white paper to hide my check.
223	returned	My boxes just came in, so I can't report on some of the issues experienced by others such as the sides coming unsnapped. But, seeing what I have seen, it seems entirely plausible. What I CAN say for certain is that the top is oversized, and there is nothing suspending the top above the file tabs. Crushed file tabs, guaranteed if you stack ANYTHING on top.This seems like a great concept, and with some tweaks, (and added expense), they would really be on to something.
134	kept	So, you get a piece of paper in the box with this thing.  It advertises Avery products, but it doesn't tell exactly the step-by-step process for using it.  I suppose it should be ovbvious, but I've never used a CD/DVD label applicator and it's not.  I think I've figured it out, but it would sure have been helpful just to have a HINT on the instructions as to how this gadget works.Oh..OK...the instructions are on the labels themselves!!  Now I feel better.
75	kept	I purchased my first Scotch tape dispenser in 1974 and it lasted for 37 years.  It was built like a rock- solid composition, almost as heavy as marble.This item cracked and started to spill out sand after it was bumped on the countertop. It is constructed of 2 pieces of lightweight plastic glued together with sand inside to weigh the dispenser down.I only paid 2.50 for the item, no big loss, but I would of preferred a more durable unit even if it costs more.
344	returned	I was not happy to learn that although there is plenty of toner left in my cartridge, it stopped printing in my important printing job because 'toner has reached the end of its useful life'.I won't be buying any more Brother products in the future.  This is just a cynical way to make more money.Brother's attitude:  'The customer?' 'Shaft the customer!'Apparently this cartridge loves the idea of doing the same thing to its customers as well.  I'm shopping elsewhere!
460	kept	Worked fine for the first 100 pages or so, and then the toner stopped sticking to the paper in some places.  Using Xerox copy/printer paper.  Will try cheaper paper.
216	returned	The cost for a pack of these pens seemed too good to be true. I had found that Uniball Signo had been the most reliable pen, right down to the last drop.BUT NOT THESE. Almost everyone skips. I'm ready to chuck the whole box.Not recommended!PS: label says red, but I got black pens which is what I ordered.
375	kept	I'm sorry to say the product did not work for me too long, from the start the foam was attracting debris like some sort of lint catcher in a dryer.  Even the bottom of the unit attracted debris, I started to wonder if what I actually needed was an Air Purifier.  It was as if this foam pad was an attractant to anything!!!  It did provide good wrist support, while I went without one it was a noticeable difference.  So, it would have been great if not for the foam aspect.
153	returned	This pencil is tiny which makes it not very comfortable to write with.  I ended up giving it to my son who likes the way it looks...but he also noted that it's small in his hand (he's a teenager, so his hands are adult-sized).  Maybe good for someone with small hands but not for us.-D
160	returned	I was excited to get these because I like bright colors, and because I keep a family whiteboard calendar that I like to color code (don't judge, I'm fussy).  Unfortunately, they are a disappointment on a number of levels.They SMUDGE:  The tips are not fine, and seem cheaply made, almost frayed.  I can't write cleanly or clearly with them.They SMEAR:  When you try to erase with the attached erasers, they smear.  You need a real white-board eraser, and sometimes you need white-board spritz cleaner too.  The attached erasers are useless.They are SHODDY:  The magnets are weak, which makes the markers slide off and/or get knocked off easily.  The erasers are not only useless, but they fall off after a few days use.  The whole kit is cheap, like something from the dollar store.  Or a cereal box.Bottom Line:  2 stars for bright colors and the fact that they are functioning markers.  They will not work for you if you do a lot of erasing, or need to write detailed notes with them, or use your white-board frequently.  Another reviewer wrote that they would work for a dorm room style, cheap memo board, and that's probably true- though you would trash the whole thing in a month when the marker residue could no longer be erased.
267	kept	One thing to love, the bright primary colors of yellow, red and blue of the folders.So many things to hate about these hanging folders!  Everything about these folders seems to be do it yourself.First of all, to make them square on the bottom you have to put this long strip of cardboard into the bottom of each folder which you also have to pull apart each piece of cardboard, which is hard enough in itself as far as getting the cardboard ends to stay in the bottom of each folder.  I used a little piece of tape to secure the cardboard on each end of the folder.The folder itself, it doesn't seem to be any thicker, maybe even thinner than Pendaflex file folders.Instead of the cardboard they included which isn't very thick, it would have made the bottom of the folders more rigid/durable, stand easier, if they had used some kind of durable plastic instead of cardboard, which would have made much more sense to make them more square on the bottom of each folder.Since most people don't put the same amounts of paper in each folder, it wasn't fun to get the folders to fit in correctly,to lay flat on the bottom of each folder in either my file box in my desk, or this big file box that I have in my bedroom.Then the white ends of each folder that makes them hang, it kept finding it's way into the sleeve of my blouse.Then they include this sheet of paper and plastic covers for you to put onto each folder so that it would show what is in each folder.  I didn't use these either. Iam not sure if the paper would even stay in the plastic covers.While I was doing all of this I decided to change out each manila folder to a new one.  To do two chores at once, so that I won't have to bother with any of this for a long time.I just don't see any added benefit to having this kind of hanging folder, or any improvement what so ever to having this kind of hanging folder!!I only used about half of the box of 25 folders that they included, before I decided to call it a day with these folders.If you want hanging folders, I would just use these hanging folders without the included cardboard for the bottom of each folder, which doesn't seem to have any added benefit.I would also forgo the paper/plastic part you are supposed to put onto the top of each  folder to show what is in each hanging folder.You can just use manila folders, or whatever kind of folders you like that have a place to write on the tab part, to show what is in each folder.I also used some label tape to show what is in each folder.For a company to make what should be such an easy thing to use, how did they end up deciding that doing it this way was a good way to do it?If you like feeling frustrated/aggravated, this might be the perfect product for you to use!
161	returned	I was pretty disappointed with these dry erase markers. First, when taking them out of the plastic bag they were housed in - I grabbed two by the eraser at the top and the erases came off! They weren't attached to the cap at all - simply placed inside the came, meaning the erasers will soon be lost.Secondly - the magnets didn't stick very well on some of the markers. Meaning - they wouldn't stay attached to my dry erase board.  So basically - the two best selling points of the markers didn't work well at all.The markers themselves worked well enough - they draw in a thin line which is great for us as my kids do a lot of school work on our dry erase board. The marker makes a line more similar to a pen you might use, so this would be great for a personal lap dry erase board or again - practicing school work on a dry erase board.The markers are small - probably 3/4 the length of the more common dry erase markers.But, the cheapness of the magnets and the erasers not being properly attached would keep me from purchasing or recommending these markers.
490	returned	Don't let the picture deceive you, the stapler looks all cute and a manageable size, but this thing is ridiculously massive. When I got it I was like, &#34;Whaaaaa?!?&#34; It's also really heavy....super big...and super heavy. This is *not* a product that you are going to want for your home office...this is definitely more like a corporate/business electric stapler. Beyond that, it's &#34;okay&#34; at doing what it's supposed to do, but I would never attempt to shove 45 sheets of paper into it; it jammed a could of times with 25 sheets. So if you're wanting to mostly staple really large documents look elsewhere, but really...again...the size for me was a total and complete turn off.
360	returned	Cuz when I got it there were more pieces rattling around inside than a movie theater size box of Razenettes !
154	kept	Pencil is nice heavy weight feel to it, the cap is a gorgeous color, however the back half of the pencil is a cheapo plastic that does not even come close to being the same color as the metal cap. They should have made it the same material. This is an expensive pencil and should be 100% made of metal not half plastic.
425	returned	I was really looking forward to getting this scanner since the paperwork pile I amass each month running my business seems to be growing exponentially. I've been using an Epson GT-S50 for scanning and, while it is wonderful for processing large amounts of paper, it does not offer a database to catalog the scans. Also, it can be fussy with regard to receipt-size paper (sometimes need to use a carrier sheet to hold the original). Both of those problems are issues the Neatdesk is supposed to address.Installation on a Win 7 (32 bit) machine proceeded slowly, but without any drama. The only concern I had was that at various times the install seems as if it had stalled. I just gave it time and it eventually sorted itself out.The first problem came up while trying to scan odd-sized receipts. The scanner jammed repeatedly, or pulled the paper askew, which ruined the scan. It is very fussy with regard to the condition of the original. Paper that would go through my Epson without a hitch caused the Neatdesk to choke. This is a serious drawback since receipts and invoices are rarely in pristine condition -- they get crumpled and folded. But, even with a perfect original, the feeder on the Neatdesk often malfunctioned. Major source of frustration.The second source of frustration was with the software. It's supposed to automatically know the difference between a receipt and a document, and automatically pull in key attributes from the receipt into its database. Works great in theory. In actual practice, not so much. Mis-reads are more common than good reads. You end up spending more time than if you just did things manually.The only plus is that it is more compact that other scanners, and looks nice.While the concept is good, the execution is poor. For this price I expected a lot more functionality. I'm sticking with my Epson, and can't recommend this unless you will be scanning originals in perfect condition and are willing to spend time cataloging items scanned.
480	kept	There what you have to have to print. The only problem is they are so small. They work well but they don't last very long.
348	kept	I wrote a very long review, which completely justified my two star review and included a technical description of the problem I discovered.  I decided not to post it.  Instead, I'll give you the highlights.I thought this was a great idea.  Little box the size of a cigarette lighter that would expose a telephone connection - or let you have access to the phone system from your laptop.  No premium phone calls allowed unless you prepay - so it is safe to put the phone where anyone can use it.I plugged it in - and it didn't work.  Called support, and they refused to believe that the problem could be at their end.  Their diagnosis would have had them believe that the problem was at my end - and it would have had me believe it was well - except that I know better, because I'm a retired IT tech and have diagnostic tools that most people do not have.  I ran packet traces and did other advanced diagnosis stuff, proved to anyone who was capable of understanding the technical issues (which a L2 disgnostic person should be capable of if they are providing fix-it support to people) that the problem was at their end and had to call in twice before I could find someone in their high level tech support who actually would believe that they had a problem and who would take a problem report.  The first guy acted like he really could not even understand what I was driving at, the second guy understood that I had eliminated all possibilities other than they were broken - and I was able to show him the data in the packet that had misled their application.The mistake they made is well known in the industry - you can find papers describing it and software packages that try and address it, which makes me think that the support software was written by some kids in a college class rather than by professionals - or they would have known the problem and not tried to short-cut it.They made other errors of the same sort:  Their outlook interface is one way (they don't add the outlook contacts to the contact list in the package, they just add a button to the outlook contact screen) and they don't select the default sound devices when you change configuration from the telephone line to the computer's mic and speakers (nor do they select the devices you configured last time - they throw away the whole config and pick the first devices in the list, which are almost never the correct ones).  This means that you can't hear the phone ring and andwer it from the computer - you have to reconfigure three sub-devices, which means that the person who called you has given up and hung up by the time you can say hello.Now it will probably work for most people in a simple home configuration. But anything out of the ordinary is likely to trip up this poorly programed device.  So the dream of being able to carry it with you so that you can have a conversation from wi-fi hot spots is doomed to failure, I think.  You might get lucky.  You might not - even at places that have well designed commercial setups.If you want to give this to a teenager so that they can make endless phone calls, fine.  (But not too long - if they use more than 20 times the average, and lots of these will not be used, you have exceeded their unlimited plan and they will cancel your service, with no refund). Don't think you can depend on it for home use, and the quality is not good enough for business, there were dropouts and breaks on a line where Vonage is perfect.This device requires a working computer to support it - you can't talk to tech support while they have you reboot your computer, for example, because rebooting the computer drops the conversation. So, well, it might be correctly priced at $20/year.Two stars might be too high - but I can imagine worse, and it is not too expensive.
150	returned	First of all, it is NOT automatic! So if you are wanting an automatic drafting pencil, you need to look else where. The pocket clip is made out of folded beer-can metal. Considering the price, I expect a much better pencil from Pentel.
307	kept	The product box boasts a 90% larger tab area.  I've attached a picture so you can see the difference in tabs compared to a standard file folder.Now here's the fatal flaw...when you put standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper inside the folder, the tab gets covered up and you are left with the same visual area as a traditional file folder.  See attached picture.The colors are nice but what appears to be orange in the photo is really a dark manilla color.The folders are nice overall but I wouldn't recommend them based on the larger tab size alone because for my use they aren't that helpful because I have to move the paper inside to see the bottom half of the tab.
6	kept	You get what you pay for.  Cheap is cheap.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  But to hand out to clients that will not return, it's perfect, that was we don't lose our better pens.
438	kept	This riser is okay, if you only paid about half of the current price. It doesn't feel that sturdy to me. I don't have great confidence that it won't topple or sag. It also raises the monitor up a little too high for me. I can raise my chair up high enough that the monitor is just above eye level -- it actually should be just below for ergonomic purposes. I thought it would be nice to have a little extra desk space -- being able to store a few items under the riser. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh that small benefit. I have already removed the riser.That said, if your current desk setup is such that you really need to raise your monitor significantly, and if your monitor is pretty lightweight, this would work for you. But I do think it's overpriced.
20	kept	There are two hundred sheets in the package which is the average size. This package of wide ruled filler paper looks like the standard elementary school paper that kids have always used. That is before you take it out of the package. Paper used to be two or three times as thick as this when I was in school. This paper if so thin that it's totally transparent when you hold it up to the light. When writing on it with an ink pen the ink goes totally through it. In addition it rips very easily and if it gets at all wet then you are done.Other that the thinness problem the paper is normal. The lines are the correct spacing and are dark enough for the most part but there are some pages that are lighter than others.The price of this package of paper stunned me at 3 dollars a pack. I can purchase the same amount of paper from my local grocery store for about 1 dollar a package. When they have back to school sales it's often only about 50 cents a pack so why on earth would I pay that much for paper?Overall when I consider the quality of the paper and the price I simply am not impressed and would not recommend this paper.
17	returned	August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.
23	kept	I got this paper for my first grader to practice writing with.  I never thought I would complain about binder paper, but this paper is pretty awful.  The paper, while it serves its purpose, is really quite thin.  I wouldn't recommend using pen on this paper, and heaven forbid you try to use marker or anything liquid on it.  With pencil, it works just fine.  My biggest issue is when you need to erase.  If you have a light hand, erasing shouldn't be a problem.  However, with wide ruled paper, most people who use it are little kids...and if your kid is like mine, erasing is practically a full arm production.  The paper is not durable enough to withstand the erasing of a six year old or from people who are vigorous when erasing.That aside, the paper does serve its purpose.  My kid, when he didn't make mistakes, was able to write very easily on the paper, and it didn't smudge much.  If you're pressed for time and want to order paper online, this will definitely serve its purpose.  Otherwise, I would wait for upcoming back to school sales.  You can get much higher quality paper at a comparable price.
242	returned	I usually love 3M products, but this is just junk.  What is odd, is I have used this product before and liked it.However, this time, the tape does not stick, well, except to itself.  That is not all...the cutter doesn't cut!  Is this some kind of joke?All I can think is either this was a defective batch, or the quality has certainly fallen...which would be very sad indeed.
76	returned	This tape dispenser is not heavy. One cannot remove tape without holding the dispenser. Fortunately, I have one that is 40 years old that IS heavy. Don't buy this one no matter how inexpensive it is.
159	returned	We have a white board that the kids play with and I thought these markers might be good because they each have their own eraser... no more fighting over the eraser.  But these markers seems harder to erase than other we've used and the erasers don't cut it.  Two fell off the first day we used them and one is flaking into bits.
191	kept	Okay, so in this line of products, not a lot to choose from, so in a pinch, this one's pretty good - it's cheap, and has a lot of compartments. But, it's cheap. Very cheap...ly made. The 39 compartments have little dividers that won't stay put to save your life, and what a pain when they get caught when you try to open a drawer, trying your best to get the divider out without breaking it (which I've done twice now), only then to have the extreme frustration of having whatever you had in that divided drawer, now all mixed together. Now you get the pleasure of separating whatever it was ... try that with finish nails ... aaarrgghh.That said, after searching and coming to the point of giving up, I'm actually planning to find my round-to-it and, one of these days dump everything out, then get some darned glue and put those things in permanently. Then, I do believe it will at least restore some of my sanity about the unit.
366	returned	Honestly, I ordered these from Vine by mistake. I saw "laminating sheets" and just blindly clicked because I was excited to be able to order something to use in my newScotch Thermal Laminator. Unfortunately, I completely missed the "SELF SEAL" graphic on the front. I really think "self seal" should be in the listing title.Anyway.After testing these on small insignificant things like magazine pages (for cut out recipes) and Lego Minifigure checklists (which are folded and tend to get ripped a lot) before trying something I didn't want to ruin...I came to the conclusion that I'd just rather use my thermal laminator. Trying to get a good-looking application is kind of like attempting to put on an iPhone screen protector...you need to do it with no wind, no fuzzies floating around, and perfectly stable finger work and then it still isn't quite right. Of course, you don't need medical precision to laminate a recipe, but for the anal retentive person (like me) it just didn't look and feel how I wanted it to. Plus it feels somewhat flimsy.If you do a lot of laminating, I'd seriously consider a thermal one. Otherwise, if you really want something laminated, I'd just go to your local office supply store and pay the $1.29 a page.
1	kept	Overall I do not recommend this product. I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes. Bought this as a replacement as I require a calculator with specific test specifications. Works great and very intuitive, however the keys require just enough more pressure than they used to so that it is annoying. Perhaps they will become broken in. Not yet though.
357	returned	The phone itself is decent enough, but the loud-speaker wasn't very clear. Several folks in my family had a hard time understanding people when using it. A replacement didn't help; apparently it's just the design. If you like to use the speaker-phone feature, keep looking.
314	returned	I purchased this No Soliciting sign after getting one too many magazine sales people at my front door.  It arrived quickly and I was pleased with the appearance given the low price.  It comes with two-sided tape and little grooves on the back where you can line up the tape, making it easy to mount. While this sort of thing isn't going to be super-attractive, overall I thought it looked fine on my front door.Unfortunately, after only one day on the door the sign melted.  Seriously, just the heat from sunlight on the door destroyed this sign in a single day!  This was July in Maryland - it didn't even reach the 100 degree mark.  I'm not sure if my sign was some sort of lemon or if they simply can't withstand direct sun but regardless this product did not meet my needs.I will be returning it immediately, but I would still recommend it for applications where it wasn't going to be in direct sun because it looks decent.
21	returned	I am so disappointed in Mead. I know that this is a standard product, not a luxury version. It is just plain old lined paper. But it is such bad paper. It is thin. It has not tooth. The printing of the lines is not consistent. They are darker in some places than others.  It is thin enough that my lefty went through it easily.This all just makes for an awful writing experience. Basic doesn't have to mean worthless.
395	returned	these are decent - not decent enough to justify the price of them considering the weight of the paper being used in the pads. They are nothing special and the paper is very sheer and lightweight. This wouldn't be a problem if they were not charging a premium price for sub par paper writing pads.
71	returned	While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape, I can't see that it is really worth the higher price.  As with all new products, I like to try them out exactly how the directions say before doing things my way, and the directions for repairing a paperback book are pretty much useless.  The tape rips easily, so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across.  What "tabs" did manage to not tear off were of no use repairing the book in question, so I quickly abandoned the suggested way and did my own thing.  I am thoroughly not impressed with the product and am very disappointed in its quality, especially considering the price.
147	returned	This one is going back - after about a month of moderate use it just stopped working. The other reviews I read were so good, and i was disappointed.
306	returned	These are so thin. I bought these because the reviewes here said that they are bold, not fine, and that the name is confusing.I was very happy to get me some bold point pens in all colors of the rainbow, but these are super fine, barely there, thin-thin-thin pens. I did not like them at all.
384	returned	The keyboard tray arrived at my house in a very large box, weighing nearly 20 lbs. After dragging it in and unpacking, I found that the majority of the package was taken up by a clunky wooden board - the tray.For the nearly $140 3M charges for this tray, I felt that the quality was just not there and the instructions were terrible. It took me forever to figure out what goes where, and in the end, I was not willing to destroy my desk in order to use this product.
368	kept	They didn't work that great and it drove me to make the decision to buy a home laminator. The machines are small and aren't that expensive these days.  I don't think you can do a good job without heat and without it being a pouch.
399	kept	It's ink. It works well and lasts OK (as long as you use it in time .. these things expire, in my view, a hugely cynical money making ploy from HP).As ink, it's just fine. Good in fact. However, it sticks in the throat that this stuff is so expensive, so I can't give it more than a 2 because every time I purchase it, I'm not happy.Conclusion, I buy this because I have to, not because I want to.
91	returned	There aren't a whole lot of things to say about a tape dispenser. This one is clearly meant for small jobs and if you are sealing a lot of boxes this one will only lead to frustration. First of all the cheap design of it means you have to hold the cylinder on the sides. This also means they can't include much tape since your hand has to fit around the entire piece. The tape was suitably sticky to seal my box but when I cut the tape with the serrated edge it would snap back onto the roll every time which means I have to go back and use my fingernails to peal it back off the roll. For a single box or even several boxes this might not be a big deal but if you planning on moving and have a lot of boxes pulling the tape back off the roll each time will get really old. I also had a problem with the tape tearing when I was pulling it back off the roll however I've never seen a tape dispenser that didn't have that problem. On the other hand if it didn't snap back onto the roll each time I wouldn't have to worry about it tearing.Scotch claims that this is refillable but God only knows how you get a new roll of tape on since it fits over a solid plastic axle and it has the look and feel of something disposable. This is clearly intended for the budget conscious customer but for my money I'd spend a little extra to get a quality tape dispenser with a handle that actually is reusable and can hold more than this tiny roll of tape.
180	returned	It's ink...it works.  What else can I say except that these cartridges are overpriced everyplace I've looked, and we go through them like water.  I think by the time this school year is over we will have spent almost $800 on these stupid things!
43	returned	this came bent and just warped looking. When siting on a desk it takes up waaay too much space, but I suppose mounted on a wall it would be more useful. I just seems so large, bulky and not very convenient.
459	returned	I received a credit from the seller for the first of the two cartridges that I purchased because it left big black smudges down the side of the paper. I had the same problem with the second cartridge from this order, but didn't bother to go through the hassle of a refund. I just lived with the flawed printouts. Since this model is a drum and toner all in one, I know the problem is in the toner, not in the printer and the source of the smudges would be within the cartridge.
103	returned	I've been using the CT-12 for over a year. It seemed like the perfect home office phone...portable; hands-free, allowing the user to type and talk; compact and comfortable. It's caller ID-ready, has good noise reduction and has a speed dial function and mute button. In addition, Plantronics has one of the best warranties I've ever experienced. I simply called when my first phone stopped working and they sent a new one within a couple of days, no hassle, no paperwork. So why only two stars?First, the belt clip is inadequate (especially for those of us who never wear belts.) The clip is too weak to clip to jeans, so I always have to wear a shirt with a pocket in order to have a place to put the phone. This is a serious flaw, as I discovered the clip's weakness only after the phone fell off my pants and onto the floor the first few times I tried it.Second, the number pad is frustratingly small. It is easy to misdial with keys the size of a pencil eraser.Third, and most important, the unit's phone jack seems to have a design flaw. I am on my second phone within one year and each one has, over several months, started crackling and cutting out. At first I thought it was the headset, since holding the cord a certain way would eliminate the crackling sound. On a hunch, I bought a new headset from another manufacturer, plugged it in, and immediately started getting the crackling noise. Now that my warranty has expired, I will not be buying a replacement phone, but looking for a new manufacturer altogether. A real pity, I loved this phone.
