449	kept	The yellow section really helps me organize my notes and take out the more important information. However, an 80 page notebook for $6? No. There are much, MUCH cheaper options out there. This is good quality, but come on, you could get a yellow highlighter and a few notebooks with more pages for a lot less.
149	returned	Ordered these in two sets, and it took a pretty long time to get them - about 2 weeks. Should've just bought them locally because this was a ripoff. I got the plastic holders, but no labels so had to spend time making my own. Not really a deal breaker, but the deal breaker was the quality of these. It's like they were rejects or something from a big office supply place because sometimes I couldn't even insert the plastic label holders into the slots. Would never order from this seller again.
468	returned	I did not like these markers at all because they are translucent - sheer, difficult-to-see color that makes writing difficult to see at a distance.  The ink is not like normal dry erase markers whatsoever, and it is simply not true that these markers produce &#34;strong, bold color.&#34;The other claimed benefits - such as caps that prevent rolling, and a visible ink well - did not matter to me as I could not see clearly what I had written.
207	returned	I am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because:-- sound quality noticeably poor, it is tinny (to me and folks I call)-- zero consideration of voicemail.  This phone has an answering machine (if I could buy one that didn't have one, I would), but you have the ability to turn it off.  On or off, if you don't use it (set the rings to 6 or more so that your voicemail kicks in first) and someone leaves a message on voicemail, the phone has no way of indicating that there is a voicemail message for you to pick up.  The user has to pick up the phone and listen for the stutter dial tone to detect whether there is a voicemail.  Other phones I've owned years older have the flexibility to deal with this quite common situation.The phone has good points, it has a solid feel to it, the volume of the speaker phone is good, and the basics, like lit keypads and easy to use menus are there.But, for me, the voice quality (a key factor) is lacking and the issue of voicemail notification combine to make the phone not one that I would recommend purchasing.
184	returned	The 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform claims that it encourages a comfortable, neutral wrist position. Like many people, I spend a lot of time on my computer so I'm always eager to try out any product that helps with comfort and ergonomics. Does the 3M WR420LE's performance justify the high cost? Let's find out.PLATFORMThe platform is the only feature that separates this product from plain wrist rests. It's a strong plastic platform to place your keyboard onto. There's space in front for the included padded wrist rest and two sets of rubber feet are also included. I assume the rubber feet are why 3M describes the platform as being adjustable, but I wouldn't call it truly adjustable since you can't adjust them on-the-fly.The rubber feet come in two sizes and attach to the bottom of the platform, using 3M adhesive. Attaching them to the rear of the platform for a positive tilt is easy, since there are templates, indicating where to put them. Every single keyboard I've ever used, except for Kinesis Contour keyboards, had positive tilt feet/legs. The true benefit of the 3M platform is its ability to produce a negative tilt. Unfortunately, if you want the platform on a negative tilt, you'll have to eyeball the rubber feet on your own; 3M forgot to include templates for negative tilt feet.WRIST RESTThe included wrist rest is very, very nice. It has antimicrobial protection and is filled with a not-too-soft, but not-too-hard gel. The wrist rest is wrapped in a soft, leather-like material and is by far, the most comfortable and durable I've ever used. I ended up just tossing the platform to the side and using the wrist rest by itself.CONCLUSIONMy experience with the 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform was rather disappointing. It's not truly adjustable and 3M failed to provide templates for accurately attaching the rubber feet for negative tilt. If not for the wonderful wrist rest that was included, I would have rated it even less. The thing is, you can buy the wrist rest by itself, for less than half the cost of this platform/wrist rest combo. I suggest you do just that and forget about the platform.
46	returned	Okay, so these business cards aren't all that expensive, but if you can afford to spend about $12 knowing that only about 60 of the cards will print well enough to actually be used, well, kudos.First things first, I have a really nice printer. My ink cartridge is brand-new. Yet any sort of image I tried to print came out fuzzy. One of the designs that I tried never dried properly (even after sitting out in the air for half an hour after being printed). So I tried using just text, but the first two cards on the page would print in the proper font and the rest would revert to the default font!That brings me to the Avery.com templates - don't bother, they don't work. No matter how many times I realigned, played with my image and text layouts, etc. - the first two cards would print okay, and the rest would be a disaster. I bought these cards despite the bad reviews that stated exactly what I found in regards to the templates and problems with printing them, thinking "hey, I'm pretty good with computers/printers/technology in general, I'll be able to figure it out". Nope, nope, nope. Go to VistaPrint or a similar site and print a couple hundred business cards for $20. It's worth it.
331	returned	These envelopes offer a novel way to seal your security envelopes.  Just lift the flap and seal it shut.  These would be great for both small and large mailing projects.  Although the glue was very sticky and did not allow me to open it without obvious tampering, I would like to have seen a thicker line of glue.The security imprint was not very secure in my opinion.  I placed a standard CC bill in it and was able to hold a flashlight to it and read the contents.  Perhaps the light blue imprint would defeat a casual nosy person holding it up to the sun or interior light, but if you actually hold the envelope against the light source, it is clearly visible.More glue and darker ink would get more stars.
296	kept	As for the ink cartridges in general, there's not a lot to say - they are ink cartridges and they work just fine when they are not defective.That said I, like several others here, received a defective black ink cartridge.  I figured out the problem - the black ones don't have the little plastic tray on them that they are supposed to have, inside the foil packaging.  That led me to the obvious reality that some were improperly packed from the manufacturer, and the lack of the plastic tray on the cartridge allowed some to be punctured at some point.I know this because I did notice a little puncture mark on the foil package of the black cartridge.  I opened it carefully to find that ink had leaked out within the foil packaging.  If the plastic tray had been there it would mostly likely not have happened.Amazon is the best and they replaced my order immediately.  I received another set that was just fine, but I think that was a stroke of luck for me because the black cartridge in the new set didn't have the plastic tray either.  So, I can only figure that it's a hit & miss deal until they no longer have the ones that were improperly packaged by the manufacturer.
137	kept	My wife bought this to open those annoying plastic clamshell packages. I wound up using a scissors instead. Here's why.This product comes with a small retractable utility blade (you can buy one for a dollar in Home Depot) that barely extends. The theory is to use that blade to start a cut in the clamshell, and then effortlessly slice through with the fixed blade in the opening of this product. I tried it without success on a small clamshell package, and then just used an ordinary scissors, which worked fine.We keep this in the kitchen and use it as a utility knife to cut through the tape on packages, so it's not a total loss, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. But even a deluxe utility knife costs much less than this product, and also has a blade that is larger and protrudes further (I own one) and hence cuts more easily, not to mention that the blade is replaceable (unlike the blade on this product).Bottom line: I didn't want to throw this out, so I am using it. But I would not recommend this to a friend. Instead I would tell a friend to look at the Zibra Open-It (which I have reviewed on Amazon), which is a much better product. However, I would also tell a friend to look around his house to make sure that he does not already have a utility knife and a heavy duty pair of scissors or shears that will accomplish opening clamshell packages.
474	returned	The Nyrius Global Entourage7 certainly does not lack an extensive dictionary in a number of different languages.Unfortunately the sheer volume of phrases combined with a 1980's era interface makes this thing nearly impossible to use as a quick means of communication.To make matters worse its single line screen simply can't display a full phrase without first a button push and then a painfully slow text crawl.  The result is that you can't quickly scroll through the available options, as most of the available text reads "Where is the.." or "Does anyone h..."  Even the most patient of good samaritans is not going to have time to wait for you to find the most appropriate phrase.But it is inexpensive, and I suppose as a device for a non-urgent situation that might require asking for specific items or help (such as a hospital visit, etc) it might be somewhat useful.
288	returned	I've had this about a year.  On paper the features looks great. When the machine is in a good mood it prints and copies ok.However, the printer frequently misreads the ink cartridge level as "Low" and then COMPLETELY QUITS WORKING, even with a new ink cartridge.  The only way to get around it is to do some voodoo like Reset process that I found online (see below).  It is extremely frustrating and I would not recommend it to anyone.How to reset Canon MX310 printer low ink signal1.  Power off the printer.2.  Holding the stop/reset button, press and hold power button also.  Hold both buttons together for 5 secs.3.  Still holding the power button, release the stop/reset buton, then press the stop/reset button twice.4.  Release power button (the screen should now say 'Service Mode').5.  Wait until the power button lights steady green, then press the stop/reset button three times with a 3 sec space between each press.  On the 3rd press the indicator should turn steady orange.6.  Press the power button once, (the orange light should go off).7.  Open the printer and remove both cartridges.  Wait for 10 seconds.  Replace the cartridges and close printer.  Wait for 30 seconds.8.  Press the power button, and wait until printer has shut down.9.  Press power button to power up.  The printer will feed one piece of paper, then ask you to set the language.10.  The page counter is now reset!  Enjoy.
413	kept	I actually happen to have a regular "hot" aka thermal laminator at home, so I was able to do a side by side comparison.  My thermal laminator uses pouches up to legal size, which might limit its use as compared to a roll lamintor, but it's never been an issue for me.Anyway...The cost of purchasing a small to medium use thermal pouch laminator versus this heat free system is nearly the same.  No substantial cost difference there. However, the cost of the laminate material they use is radically different.  You could buy Three Hundred 9" x 11.5" pouches and One Hundred index card pouches, both in 5 mil (the thick laminate material) for the cost of One 90-foot roll of 5 mil laminate material for this heat-free system.  (A difference of about 200 feet of material.)So, for cost effectiveness, this Scotch Heat-Free system isn't the way to go.Since you could potentially laminate something that was 17 feet long, this heat-free system does have a leg-up there.BUT, as nearly every other reviewer has noted, once you get a wrinkle in this heat-free system, it's there for the rest of the roll.  With pouches, if you get a wrinkle or an air bubble, run it again with a new pouch.And thermal systems have motors to pull the material through.  With this system, you have to crank it.  So unless you need to laminate things during a power outage, the convenience factor goes to thermal systems.I found this thing rather unfriendly to deal with.  There are too many thing that you need to worry about: lining up the paper perfectly, watching for wrinkles, the laminate material sticking to the machine...My personal experience with both systems makes a traditional hot laminator the clear winner.
337	kept	What happened to the index cards of old? These are so much thinner than the card stock index cards that I'm used to. I imagine that trying to shuffle these while giving a presentation or speech will be quite difficult. I miss the thickness of the older cards. While these will work for what I need them to they aren't the quality that I was expecting.
252	kept	The instructions are horrible. If I could give stars for that, it would be negative 10. I've put a bakers rack together with many more parts and found it so much easier because all the parts were labeled and every step was laid out. This is ONE PAGE and I had to make a copy of the front page so I didn't have to flip back and forth trying to figure out what went where.The casters did not snap in, and one caster had blue gunk in it that I ended up getting all over the place. I simply ended up putting them in and since I won't be rolling it around often (and I received this in exchange for review)it's not too much of a big deal. However, had I paid for this I think I would have sent it back.As for the unit itself - the top is thick and sturdy and the sides are also quite sturdy. I appreciate the folder holder that slips on the side easily. Even with horrible directions and realizing I had to unscrew a few parts to screw them back again (which I noticed another reviewer had the same problem!) - it took me about an hour. I don't put things together too often, so someone who has a knack for assembly or more experience might have a better experience. There was a point where I was so confused and frustrated I thought I was missing a part and almost trashed the whole thing - if you get to that point, just step back, take a few breaths, or a shot of bourbon (or both) and realize it's NOT YOU, it's the them, and then tackle it again!Looking back on my experience, I would NOT pay the 119.00 it's currently going for.
497	kept	These are labeled Office Tape... Wrong!Office Tape is 3/4&#34; wide. These are 1/2&#34; wide... too smallI did not know how wide office tape was.

469	kept	I was attracted to the sleek design of the new Philips ID155 and thought I would upgrade my current phone system (Motorola MD681, 5.8 GHz). My current unit has the Motorola base station with two other wireless phone units on each floor of my home. The Philips has the same optional remote units that you can purchase separately.After trying out the Philips I found that the sleek design of the handset was too small to hold for long periods of time and my hand would cramp up. In addition the hands-free speaker-phone seemed to cut in and out when the person on the phone was talking, so I was not happy with that function.There were a few things that I did like about the phone. It was easy to figure out the programming and includes an easy to read 51-page printed booklet. I loved the variety of built in ring tones including whirls, flicks, rings, buzzers, techno, ragtime, march, cha-cha, and asian (my favorite was the bell 2). It has a pretty blue indigo display and the unit it's self takes up very little counter space with a 5"x3.5" footprint.Overall I loved the look and some of the functions of the unit, but will stick with my current Motorola just for the speaker-phone and comfort of the handset. You can turn off the answering machine function of the Phillips quite easily, so I will use it as an extension phone in my spare room until my Motorola conks-out.If you are looking for an inexpensive phone system that takes up very little counter space, this is the unit for you!
128	returned	I ordered this pen and the first one had a super scratchy nib - it can happen and it is a Fine nib, but it sounded like I was ripping phone-books while writing.  So, the exchange came promptly from Amazon - this new one isn't scratchy, but it writes very... choppy is the best way to put it. It doesn't skip exactly, but line width's vary wildly even when writing at a consistent speed.So, the second pen had a nib that looked uneven (not the tines).  The sides had different angles when it bent in to make the nib point.  This was clearly visible to the naked eye so I imagine this didn't help.  The main issue seemed to be the 'required' way to hold this pen - it's a good angle, but sometimes you need to hold something slightly different.  The second pen I got, the nib would have worked if I could tilt the pen more, but then my finger was holding the edge and not on the 'guides'.  I saw no easy way through internet searching to pull the feed out (the nib comes off easy, but that won't change the angle).  For a $20 pen, this wasn't worth the hassle.  It isn't like this is some nice desk pen people 'ohhh' and 'awe' at.  It's a fucntional pen that needed to work right the first time and every time - it didn't.I did give it a second star for the fact it started writing instantly, every try.  Even my more expensive pens occassionaly require a few strokes to get the pen fully up to speed.  This lamy wrote the second I put the inked converter in and never stopped.  So, if you get one with a good nib/feed - it should be great.  I can't just keep sending it back and playing the lottery.
215	kept	I bought this as a replacement for my old Photosmart P2350 printer, which was good, but didn't have a fax machine. The Office Jet 6310 does, and the price was right, so I got it.This is a straightforward multifunction (4-in-1) office machine. What's good about a 4-in-1 is that it does 4 things in one! The 6310 has a fax machine with built in 33.6kbps modem, a color scanner, copier, and printer. The fax machine has an auto document feeder, which is nice for sending multiple pages. Up front is a panel for the various functions; scanning, faxing, and copying. There's an alphanumeric pad for faxing, and a backlit LCD dot-matrix display. You can hook this printer up to a home network. There are slots for memory cards also. There's an Ethernet cable port in back, so it's network compatible. I have mine hooked up to my home wireless network through a router, and it works fine.HP says this will do 33 pages per minute black and white and 25 color. Obviously it's an exaggeration, because it depends on the print quality. A fast draft print will come close, but for anything else, forget it. I'd get good color prints in over a minute on the maximum DPI. It uses print cartridges quickly also. I burned through a color and a back and white in a couple months of light use, less than 200 pages. HP cartridges are expensive and rarely go on sale.This does print great photos, although not as good as a dedicated photo printer like the PhotoSmart series. The Canon Pixima 4-in-1 series machines do the best job, but were a lot more expensive. Black and white, text comes out clean and sharp, but not as sharp as a laser machine. The scans come out good, but expect to wait for them. Same with copies. Scanning and copying are both PAINFYULLY slow with the 6310. Other machines do much better, and the higher end HP 4-in-1's perform all these tasks quickly.Overall, this is a good machine for light use or occasional use. It would be best for someone who needs to send an occasional fax, scan, or copy something. It does everything I ask it to, and does it good enough.Pros:Low priceHP qualityreadily available ink cartridgesQuick printingGood print qualityNetwork readyMulti-card readerAuto document feederConsSlow print speedsPainfully slow scanning and copyingExpensive ink cartridgesPhoto printing could be betterCartridges don't last long
126	returned	Epson claims photos printed from PictureMates are waterproof. This oft repeated claim is blatantly false. I'm disappointed that professional reviewers haven't exposed this farce. Newly printed photos seem to have some waterproofing but that quickly disappears. Test it yourself. Simply place a drop of water on a months old photo, wait a few seconds, gently mat the paper. The result is a ruined photo. How is that waterproof?I bought this printer because of the great quality (true) and waterproof photo feature. I'm really disappointed with the waterproof claim. They've duped us all.Kudos to the other photo printer manufacturers for not following suit with equally false claims. It must have been tempting to do so.
181	kept	This is a genuine HP ink cartridge...although it seems to run out rather quickly. I don't know if HP is filling cartridges with less ink; I hadn't noticed the quantity levels. Even with lower online price, it still seems to be high priced. I will now compare quantities carefully for future purchases.UPDATE (8/10/12): I guess this is really the only (original HP) choice I have for my printer. I love my printer...great copying, printing and scanning abilities. Thank goodness I haven't printed too many photos or color documents. So, I don't buy these cartridges too often but, I just bought another one here to save a little money at least.
143	returned	As an employer in Boston,MA im always trying to diversify my catering business with equal numbers of woman and men. But as time passed,the women became more educated and left my business for more skilled jobs outside of the kitchen. So when i found out that i can find some women in binders,i immediately jumped on the opportunity. I bought two dozen of these binders expecting them to be full of women and even shipped them via 1-Day Amazon Prime shipping! When i got my package from UPS i noticed that the box was a little smaller than i expected. Once I fully opened everything, to my surprise i saw that the binders were completely empty. I called Amazon customer service immediatetly and got connected to an agent from India,who seemed very confused when i tried explaining to her that my binders were missing the women i was told about. So unfortunately it looks like i was deceived by some guy named Willard on TV in regards to these binders :/These binders maybe good for a couple papers but lack the women i was told about. I hope amazon is understanding and refunds me when i try giving them a call again tomorrow
90	returned	I would suggest another brand. First thing is the plastic itself is not clear to begin with, poor design or Quality control.Used multiple times but still got either bubbles or not very good contact between the two pieces.
396	returned	It seems funny to review a cheap pen like this.  However, every time I pick it up to use it irritates me.  These pens are fat which I don't like.  They have a really wide tip, again, which I don't like.  They do not skip but every day I have go through this ordeal to get it to write.  As long as I'm writing something every few hours it will be OK.  The ink is permanent ink, which I do like.Basically, I'm just disappointed in Paper Mate.  I have a PM pen in my wallet that I have been using for probably 25 years.  It's the perfect refillable pen and of course (1) you can't buy them any more, and (2) it was made in the USA.These little cheap crappy pens are just not for me.
195	kept	Bought this printer several years ago.  Performance was average for an ink jet printer.  Construction quality was mediocre-minus.  For no apparent reason, one day, I found I couldn't seat a replacement ink cartridge in its receptacle.  Some of the innards has shifted around and it wouldn't accept the cartridge.  HP support was hilarious.  The poor chap that took my call had to walk me through all sorts of inane questions starting with: "What version of drivers were we using?".  After about 30 minutes of walking through the bronzed block diagram he eventually agreed it was a hardware problem.  And, to their credit, HP mailed me a replacement frame which did fix the problem.
432	kept	I realize the fact that I can't get it to send the receipt info to Quickbooks is my fault. However, NOWHERE could I find any help for this issue. I went to NeatReceipts website and found out that I'd have to pay money for a helpline policy.So, does it scan-- yes, it does great. You can organize your receipts using their software. However, the only reason I wanted this was to save me time and have the items go directly into my bookkeeping program.I will continue trying to figure out the software issue. Of course any help that anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated-- as long as I don't have to sign a contract and pay for it.
311	returned	This dispenser works as intended, but gets in the way during use, requires product-specific refills, and is only a little more effective than a desktop tape dispenser.I used this dispenser wrapping some of my this season's gifts, and found it got in the way while worn on my hand or knuckles (as recommended)-- I wasn't able to manipulate the partially-wrapped gifts very well one-handed.  I have average-sized male hands, and the strap is tight across my hand.  I was able to wear it on my wrist a little more comfortably, but found the convenience not much different than having a more versatile desktop tape dispenser nearby.When I put the unit down, it often ended up with the "wrong" side down,  causing the tape poking out to stick to the dispenser itself.While I'm usually a gadget-freak, this unit is a little too specific without adding much function.  Unless you work at a gift-wrapping station, not recommended.
5	returned	Our printer is listed on this package, however it is cleary the wrong cartridge.  Ours uses the 220 which is shorter.  Rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering.  The number is clearly visible.
85	kept	I had hoped this would help opening the volumes of business mail we get daily.  While it works good on a lot of things, unfortunately it cuts whatever the contents is way too frequently so I have to take the time to tape whatever it is back together.  I have to be cautious what I open with it so not to destroy any critical documents.  It opens the envelope ok but by cutting off way too much of the envelope creating this problem.  I would not re-order for business purposes which is unfortunate because it was priced good and it is very portable.
177	kept	I must say I was a little disappointed in this Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener. I expected more than one blade just from the weight of the sharpener. It seems like a very heavy duty one and has a nice sized shavings dispenser. However, the pencils come out sharp all up one side but the other side doesn't have the wood pulled back from the lead at all. We have found we have to manually rotate the pencil while it is in the sharpener to get an even sharpening. It's a little inconvenient since that doesn't always work either.
354	returned	Not cedar! Not sure why this came up in a search for cedar pencils. They almost feel and smell like plastic.
61	returned	These pencils used to be great. Now they must be made with some kind of plastic or something in them--they feel weird, smell weird, and don't even sharpen right. How does a pencil company get THAT wrong?
246	returned	I bought this printer to use at home. In this setting, people usually have only one phone line. I would expect that it will switch to fax if the the incoming call is a fax and let the answering machine receive it if it is a voice call. I tried many differnt values for DETECT TIME and CHECK TIME for the ANS mode. None of them works. I found from the web that this is a known problem. If you buy this printer expecting to use in this setting, I would strongly suggest you find other printers. I just cannot believe that this printer fails this basic function existing in almost all fax machines.Comment after one week: I have tried many values for CHECK TIME and DETECT TIME for ANS mode. I found that CHECK TIME=20 secs and DETECT TIME=40 secs work for me. It works for four ring case that answering machine doesn't have messages and two ring case that answering machine has messages. The fax will only pick up after the outgoing message is over. So you will have fax beeps in your answering machine. Canon support gave me 30 secs for both values. But it works for the fax from Canon not for the fax from other places I tried. These two numbers have relationship with the time the phone rings to the time outgoing message is over. For me, it is 23 seconds for the four ring case, I figure that 20 is good compromise between the 2 ring and four ring cases. Good luck.
374	returned	I got this 3M foam mouse pad 2 days ago and I'm sorry to report that I have nothing good to say about it. Okay, maybe the fact that it doesn't slip would be considered a positive, but it ends there. The mouse pad is sooo uncomfortable to me. The pad part which is supposed to support your wrist is rock hard, I'm not kidding. I cannot use this mouse pad for longer than 10 minutes as my hand goes numb. Time to reorder a different one...Stay away!
436	returned	don't like it.it is expensive,does'nt last long enough considering the price.Amazon has the best price I could find and it was still expensive.almost cheaper to toss present printer and buy new verse the price of ink.
448	kept	In my experience with this particular letter opener, I have found it to be too dull to do a good job opening even plain, white, standard-thickness envelopes. Rather than creating a neat slit across the top of the envelope, the paper buckles, shreds and usually a corner of the envelope rips off, making it difficult to remove the contents of the envelope.
233	kept	This is probably a quality ink but considering its short life and the less than quality Epson printer it is designed for, I can't recommend it.  Save your money and buy a Canon.  I know that most ink jet ink cartridges  don't last long but these cartridges seemed to have a VERY short life.
350	kept	This whiteboard is so poorly made!  It's cardboard and flimsy plastic held together with staples.  The flimsy plastic clip that holds the pen bent the first time I pulled the pen out and now it's too loose to hold the pen.I misunderstood from the description that it needs to be attached with (included) double stick mounting tape; I had thought it was magnet mount, but it is not.  I don't want to attach it to my wall or fridge with the tape because it's so cheaply made, I think I'll need to replace it after a month or do, and that mounting tape is always so hard to remove from whatever it's attached to.  So I guess this will get donated to my kids' school or some such.
274	returned	returning; it's not a cross cut shredder; my mistake because it states that it is stip shredder in the copy.
114	returned	I previously gave this printer 5 stars.  However, beware.  If you print, say, 50 pages in a row, the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca. 4 pages per minute.  HP tech support confirms this, and indicates that a cheap printer 'without a fan' overheats, and compensates by stopping the continuous printing...it could not be expected to do any better.  Then why is it rated at 15 ppm?What nonsense.  The printer is misrepresented.  If you only print a couple of pages at a time, then this is fine.  But if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts, this is a BIG problem.
434	returned	Ink is over priced for to little page coverage.  I have 3 brother printers and their ink cost is about one third that of this junk!!!!!!!Read my other reviews this is one of the few negative reviews I have ever written.
163	kept	The colors on these markers were bright against a whiteboard, which is good because I have difficulty seeing things written on a white board from a distance.  What I didn't care for was that the magnets had no power... the markers were constantly on the floor - and because I have two puppies, I now have purple dry erase marker that I am trying to remove from the carpeting in the front room - the marker dropped off the board while I was at work and apparently it was similar enough to a chewy stick to have been fair game.I admit to never having been a fan of the eraser on the back of the marker cap - and I'm still not.  I'd rather just use a regular eraser then have that bulky thing on the back of my pen while I struggle to write legibly (I'm a lefty, dry erase is not my friend).If you are buying for the size and colors - these are fine.  If you are buying for the magnetic properties, I would look elsewhere.
11	returned	This stand may be good for pamphlets, ring-bound manuals, magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books. It is unstable and the page holders can't hold any page open for even a nano second. Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand or Mighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holder instead.
289	returned	These were used with adults and children and there was a problem with the ends of the lanyard pulling through and tearing the pocket.  We went back to using the clip-on ones. (You can pull the lanyard through and make a small knot between the metal piece and the pocket.  This helps.)
171	returned	My mistake ... I thought I was getting 48 different colors but this package is for 6 packages of 8 markers each. Please read the description before buying!
133	kept	Wish I could return these-they run just like the others into surrounding colors.  Used on muslin fabric project, will try on a firmer type of fabric
140	kept	The cartridge worked alright so my complaint is the deceptive wording that hides the fact that it is a generic or refilled product.
347	returned	Great concept. It would have been four star item if it didn't drop my calls after three minutes of talking on the phone. Also I don't know why, but it interferer with my Skype. I ended up buying ooma, which is more expensive, but considerably better.
185	returned	As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not a truely adjustable product.  Once you set the tilt (if you choose to use tilt) it is set and cannot be re-adjusted.  When I spend hours using my keyboard every day I like to be able to increase or decrease the tilt angle a little so my hands and wrists feel less tired.  Remember the "old-fashion" keyboards with adjustable legs?  That was what I was hoping for.  The gel wrist pad is also firmer than what I really like, there is some cushion to it but not much.The cost-to-benefit ratio of this platform is poor in my opinion.  For the somewhat expensive price you don't have true adjustment.  If your computer is shared and one person likes positive tilt and the other negative tilt or tilt at different angles, this product is not for you.  If all you want is a wrist rest you can find many here on Amazon at a fourth to a third of the price.  The antimicrobial feature isn't particularly important to me although if it is to you, you can still find wrist rests with that feature for much less money.Sorry 3M, you make some fine products but this one isn't for me.
58	returned	I purchased a set of these pens at Target roughly a week ago.When I am writing with this pen it has an inconsistent flow of ink, half way through a work it &#34;dries up&#34; the next work it runs dark, and repeats this process. I have tried both pens and have the same issue. Regardless if I use more/less pressure, change the angle, write on different paper.The pen writes poorly. Would not recommend or purchase these.Still searching for that perfect pen...
478	kept	Everything about this chair is high quality, form the included screws and instructions to the fabric and feel of the rubber armrests. The seat cushion is very very comfortable.I have 1 problem with this chair:I'm 5-6 and I have it at the lowest setting and my (bare feet) barely reach the floor. Wikipedia says average US male is 5-9.5 and average female is 5-4. So why do chair manufacturers make chairs that exclude so much of the population?So for me the adjustability means nothing (relative to my desk and monitor) since I'm stuck at the lowest position for my legs to be comfortable. I know I'm a short guy but most women are shorter than me, does that mean this chair is not for them either?The other thing to note is that while you can adjust the tension for the back rest, the main cushion does not lean with the back (in a good way).EDIT (June 2012)changed star rating form 4 to 2 because the main cushion lost it's cushionyness. I'm on my computer all day so I used it all day for over and week and now it's shaped like me and not nearly as comfortable as the first day or 2. (I weigh 185 lbs, if that makes a difference). I can see an impression of my ass on the cushion first thing in the morning before using the chair for the day.Can't recommend.
37	returned	The wrist rest is to hard and the mousepad is small.  I did not like it and returned it to Amazon.
493	returned	I see that these have great reviews and I wish that my review could also be a positive one.  When I saw that Avery was offering up Repositionable Labels I was excited and decided to order for labeling my kiddies school notebooks and folders.  After much chagrin, I have come to the conclusion that these truly do work as advertised but because of that do not seem to adhere to all surfaces the way other labels do.We have never encountered any issues with labels peeling off of anything until this batch.  No matter how much I press and rub my fingers across - they still seem to peel at corners or the bottoms!  It has become a daily chore of checking my girl's school folders/Mead composition books and re-pressing.  The packaging states that they are repositionable and over time they will become permanent.  Is that the problem??  Then why would I ever want to ship anything with a possible peeling label that has not "cured" itself into being permanent.Since I had such adhesion issues I was able to test the "repositionability" factor and they do indeed peel cleanly off; the issue arose when they weren't as sticky the second time around as the first.Do I recommend them?  At this point and for my use... no.  I am beginning to wonder if there was an issue with the adhesive in my bunch after the glowing reviews from others.
255	kept	What is one to say about name-brand ink cartridges! They are all over priced and seem to work no better than cheaper clones.
458	kept	Canon support told me when I purchased this printer about 9 months ago that a linux driver was being developed.  All I want is to print from either Windows or linux; I don't need to scan or fax.  However, there is still no linux driver.  If you're running a linux OS, choose a different printer.
32	returned	This 3M Copy Holder is almost good; half-baked design and cheesy construction make it a bad deal,even at amazon's deep discount. (The MSLP is absurdly high!) There are several different ways tobreak the copy area, as it is made of very thin transparent plastic. The legs are weighted, butwould be far more stable with some sort of crossbar installed between them...this could certainlybe done by someone who is reasonably handy. The holding device is nothing but a thin elastic heldby two sliding plastic pieces which will also break easily. Replacing the elastic shouldn't be tough,which is good, because it's definitely not going to stand up to heavy use- maybe not even light use.Replacing the two holders, though, is probably next to impossible. Why weren't some extras included?It must be said that the few books and catalogs I used for testing were held open pretty well.This product is not designed for very thick books, however. It's also not designed for long-termuse. Why pay this price for such an inadequate unit? There must surely be better ones available.Those who need a sturdy copy holder for heavy duty everyday use are hereby urged to avoid this one.Shame on 3M for peddling this junk- one would expect far better from such a company...right?
428	kept	I spent an entire morning trying to use this scanner on 3 computers, and ended up 1 for 3.  My first choice was my older Mac; turns out the Neat driver software won't install on it (doesn't say why, just an error message that it won't install) and Image Capture and VueScan won't recognize the scanner, either.Next I tried my laptop with Windows 7.  The wifi doesn't work, but that shouldn't be a problem when installing a scanner driver, should it?  Well, partway through the installation, I get a message that it won't go any further without an Internet connection.  What the?  And there's no option to cancel or abort the installation - I had to reboot to get out of it. Ugh!Next up was my laptop with Windows XP, and this time it installed, although it stopped at one point and said it needed IE7 or higher in order to install (?) But at least it's running, after I registered at the site with the product key.This might be a decent scanner if only the software wasn't so slow, clunky and 1999-ish.  I scanned several business cards, and while there were errors on each one that needed editing, it did accurately capture the phone numbers on all, and names on all but one which had the name as a company-like headline.  With recipes on letter-sized paper, it just takes a picture and you have to categorize and write in notes yourself.  Receipts are the best thing for NeatDesk, it seems; it easily picks out store name, date, total amount, sales tax and payment type, and lets you categorize it and generate a report.I'm not really up on document scanners, but looking around Amazon, it appears that there are much better choices available.  Or why not get a printer/scanner/fax all-in-one, that just plugs in and works, and can be networked?  This looks sleek and pretty next to the iMac (which I can't even use it with) but functionality leaves a lot to be desired.
290	returned	These tiny magnets are so weak they don't hold stuff to a refrigerator.  come on!  What else are tiny magnets for?  Pass.
261	returned	I am a teacher and tried these out last Friday. I use my whiteboard all the time, so I figured these would be a great solution for easily cleaning my board without having to use any sprays. The white spongy side worked fine- not great, but fine- it took off the marker and left some ghost writing, just like my standard erasers do. I read the instructions about getting the sponge wet to remove the ghost writing, so I tried it...all it did was smear any writing that was there (I tried it both with writing on and off the board) and leave huge water marks behind.Before writing this review, I came to see what others were writing and I was really confused with all the 4-5 star ratings on these erasers. I figured I did something wrong, so I gave the erasers a second chance. I tried again- following the instructions, as I thought I did before- and had the same problems. I was comforted to see another low review from someone who experienced similar problems.Since these are just sponges, they don't seem like they're going to last very long. I'd rather stick with my standard whiteboard erasers that are less expensive but do the job just fine.
313	kept	This little gadget is "okay" but I am puzzled by the need for it.  I have never found a regular tape dispenser to be overly difficult to use so I fail to understand why paying 5 times as much to have a tape dispenser with pre-cut tape attached to my wrist is very beneficial.  Not only do you pay substantially more for this method, you are forced to use a set size of tape (which, for me, was quite a bit larger than I needed in most cases); Yes, you could cut the tape sheet in half but doing so really defeats the purpose of this gadget (which was designed to simplify things and by cutting the pre-cut strips now requires more work than the traditional tape dispenser).The premium you are paying for this device is not worth it.  I gave it 2 stars because it is Scotch tape which is good tape but I recommend saving your money and sticking with traditional means of dispensing tape; it really isn't that complicated.
271	kept	Have had this printer for about 2 years. It still works but tends to drive me crazy.NEGATIVES1. If it turns off, it requires me to either print a test page or cancel a test page-both take about 1 minute2. The software sometimes just break. I've had to uninstall and reinstall everything multiple times3. The buttons on the printer with/without connection to my laptop also sometimes decide not to work4. It was really difficult to use until I  learned to use the HP solution center5. Ink is not cheap6. No document feeder-so takes forever to scan/copy multiple pages7. No wireless printingPOSITIVES1. It still prints, copies, and scans-well most of the timeQuality of print and speed of printing is average at bestThis thing is defintely outdated for now. Go to wal-mart/best buy and you could find a newer better model for half the price listed here.
361	returned	So far I've had this printer almost two weeks, and I think I've finally figured out how to get it to stop crippling my system.At first, the drivers on the CD caused my internet connection to drop every minute or so. I downloaded the latest drivers from the HP website and at first it appeared that things improved, but I discovered that the drivers caused my computer to hang after a short time and hose my system so bad it wouldn't even shut down! On one occasion of turning my computer off without shutting down, it actually messed up my operating system and I had to rebuild my machine!I can definitively trace the problem to the HP drivers because the problems occur only after installing the drivers, the problems disappear when the drivers are uninstalled, and even on a freshly built system I experience the same issues right after installing the HP drivers!For those stuck in a similar rut, here's the steps I've gone through after many hours of tinkering and talking with HP support to get things working (hopefully):1. Download the latest drivers from the HP site. Version 4.42.0.0 seems to work okay.2. Don't install the "Smart Web Printing" components (they may hang IE).3. Give your printer a static IP address through the controls on the physical printer (you can't do it through the management software).4. Disable the three HP-related services in services.msc.5. DO NOT allow an automatic update installing the ~April 2008 Imaging Device Functions "critical patch" which will corrupt your system.Other than the driver problems, the printer itself is fantastic. I've had printers hooked up to print servers before, but never an all-in-one that allowed printing, scanning AND fax-related activities over the network. The supporting software is also fantastic. Not only can you launch a scan from your network-connected computer, but you can designate that you want it in a searchable format (.pdf, .rtf, etc.) and the optical character recognition (OCR) software does a good job of recognizing text and sizing it appropriately (thus the scan is not just an image, but a document whose text you can cut/paste/etc.).Also, apparently you have the ability to have received faxes save straight to your computer over the network instead of being printed out, the two-sided printing is better for the environment, as is the Energy Star rating which is a big plus in my book!In short, the driver situation makes this purchase a sketchy one, at least for Vista owners, but the great features and capabilities of this printer have me hanging on instead of returning the printer hoping that HP will eventually resolve the problems.UPDATE:Actually, even with the above tweaks, I still exprienced problems with the drivers crashing my system (e.g. freezing after waking up from sleep mode). I even went so far as to downgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit, but my system is still dragged down by this piece of garbage and there's no ETA on an updated driver which has sat unchanged for at least three months.Sad. It's a good product marred by awful drivers/software.I'd take both stars away if I could.SECOND UPDATE:If you're looking for a good WiFi printer, but own Vista, consider theEpson WorkForce 600(which I'm now using successfully with Vista) orHP's Officejet Wireless 6500, which is basically the "certified for Vista" version of the J6480.
202	kept	In the past I had done some pencil sketching and have been considering taking it back up. I'm a bit anal retentive about my pencil point; I like it good and sharp. So when I saw this pencil sharpener I was interested. I could set it on a corner of my drawing table and refresh my pencil whenever it got too blunt, rather than having to get up every so often to sharpen again on my wall-mounted Boston.Unfortunately, I find it is good pretty much only for your garden-variety number 2 pencil which, indeed, it does put a nice sharp tip on. I was less successful with softer drawing pencils and also with colored pencils. Even with the nice sharpening job it did on the number 2, sometimes it would sharpen to the nice precise tip, and other times it would only sharpen one side so that the opposite side had a sheath of wood on it.I must confess that once it didn't work on several of the different kinds of pencils that I already use, I did not try it out on other brands of pencils, or on larger pencils I was considering buying for shading purposes. Perhaps I'm pushing the pencil or holding it at a tilt, although after the first non-centered pencil, I did deliberately try to insert the pencil as straight as possible.I haven't given up on it yet, but so far my old manual Boston does a more consistent job of sharpening straight.
132	kept	This is just your average notebook. The product claims that it can be opened and will lay flat, but that is just not true. I only had this work one time, when I opened the notebook to the very middle. If you just want a basic, wireless notebook, this is fine and dandy, but the bottom line is that the product is not as advertised.
