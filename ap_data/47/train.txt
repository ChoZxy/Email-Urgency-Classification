If you choose not to vote ,your heard loud and clear.  YOU DON'T CARE!!! You are voting by default. Blessed is the silent majority for those who do vote the less opposition the more power of their vote casted will have.    Can't fix stupid but we are electing them to public office due in large part to the silent majority who choose not to vote.  To my fellow citizens who choose not to vote I suggest that you find another excuse for not voting voice, not being heard is an alternate fact. Suggestion offered DOG ATE MY BALLOT.

Republicans are straight up bat sh** cra cra for electing this guy, when will they stop laughing at his antics and realize he is harming the USA.  The Republicans that voted for this moron need to pull the thumb on their voting records, step up to the plate, admit they were wrong.  Really shameful Republicans would elect such a moron.

Those "journalists" knew one thing had nothing to do with the other- to deny that is simply a defense for the case that those inept journalists should be fired. . Nope- they didn't use the "same standard."  It's sad your selection bias is so bad- you should get out more.
980	mildly toxic	THANK YOU. I'm so sick and tired of people acting like the military is filled with precious snowflakes that will be oh so very #triggered the minute that someone isn't genuflecting before the flag, the anthem, or the notion of invading yet another country for capitalist interests.   How on Earth did this dumb association get made between such pageantry and people in the military without it getting laughed out of the room on the first day? It doesn't even pass the laugh test....the idea that because someone at some event involving ENTERTAINMENT doesn't do the proper rituals at the proper time would be insulting to those in the military? Ridiculous.
498	mildly toxic	Oh Wave, how wrong we were to assume this killer deserved to have any of us stand up for him. I first thought like you, that we should show some respect because he turned himself in. Knowing the vile facts now, it isn't possible to kick this offender down enough. He and his mother are the lowest of scum.
107	mildly toxic 	Anyone who supports a convicted terrorist and murderer who fought against Canada and our Allies with the Taliban should be embarrassed to call themselves Canadian. Khadr was sleep deprived? Boo hoo, what about the Canadian soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan? What about the IED's Khadr was filmed building? Omar Khadr is a traitor and a Canadian by passport only, he had spent a total of 15 months in Canada prior to his capture while fighting alongside like-minded Taliban cowards. The entire Khadr family is an embarrassment to Canada and so is this payout. Khadr is owed nothing. Canada looks like a pathetic joke among our Allies.
767	mildly toxic	Cowards who attack civilians in their pursuit of their cowardly deeds!  Cowards, weakly, cowards!

Educated and clear thinking people know Trump is an imbecile but their is a sizable portion of the public that have now been outed for being part of his ilk.   We are trying to figure out how to treat them.....do we make fun of them for being stupid?  That is not nice, but frustration pushes many in that direction of belittling them....do we treat them with kindness when they are filled with hate and poor logic.... just what is the answer..... they do not deal with facts...complex problems are simplified to the point of irrelevancy.....it is tough dealing with angry dummies.

"Let's all see whom and how we can hurt the most today!"  The twisted alphabet soup of agencies and programs that are being cut/eliminated/reduced have real impact on actual people.  Is there a list somewhere of those next on the Gov's chopping block?  What is the Fed going to DO with this land they are so cavalierly repossessing -- from those who have a long history of being oppressed and lied to by the same Fed?  Are there undeveloped resources out in that desert that are crying out to be exploited?  What is the freaking purpose of all this rape and pillage being methodically undertaken by the Trump administration?  I think I need some right-wing mansplaining, and darn quickly, because this (et al) just seems shockingly stupid.

951	mildly toxic	As soon as Trudeau announced his 2% surcharge for incomes over $200,000 I immediately stopped working that year.  Since, I've cruised along slowly taking on average 3.5 months vacation per year.  I will not go over that $200,000 mark and pay any more tax.   How can people not understand that over-taxing anyone is a disincentive.  The more people who refuse to work only to pay more tax, the worse our GDP becomes.  Trudeau . . . smart like a stick.

"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."  The Charter's rights and freedoms are guaranteed, subject to being limited in a reasonable way. So we have freedom of expression but we also have libel laws, as an example.  Our rights are not given to us by government. They're integral to being a Canadian. They supersede government- they are the bedrock on which all the rest of the Constitution of Canada stands. The Canadian people grant power to our government, and for its side of the bargain the government assures us that it will not trespass on our Charter rights.

So, leaving them alone will not stop this regime from developing farther and better weapons.

They aren't a democratic government at all, but use the appearances of democracy to give their entitlement practices a mask of legitimacy. The poor and ignorant have been fooled for so long, but people are slowly coming to the ANC for what it is: a self-serving Mafia!

834	mildly toxic	So if I read you correctly, it’s their fault for not staying fighting the enemies we’ve created by our invasions, bombings,etc. for them? How ungrateful they are for not seizing that opportunity. A simple “we’ve made mistakes”, excuses everything and it’s all better, eh? The umpteen hundreds of thousands of innocents we’ve consigned to death and misery vs Putin’s thousands, hardly a fair contest.  So your wary that Putin has gained entry into our government are you? How about recognizing that our government ranks up there with Putin's in terms of savagery and uncaring for any and all human life that gets in it’s way. That’s black and white thinking and reality for anyone not wearing blinkers and who actually reads sources other than the propaganda section of the NY Times. But I can see I’m wasting my time replying further... so adios.

You're naming and disdaining several dangerous and violent people as "the nastiest" or among the nastiest, while at the same time, earlier in the thread, you're calling for mollycoddling and babying (paraphrased) the guy shooting near the highway and threatening people.    Which is it?  Violent people are nasty? Or they're pathetic people who need a warm blankie and "understanding?"
762	not toxic	Pretty stupid.  Thousands unemployed in Alberta with no chance for anything  And to be told by more 'experts' that they should keep working.

This is simply getting ridiculous how the failed drama teacher tries to justify something so unethical. It makes your skin crawl trying to picture how this egomaniac thinks Canadians will agree to this.
628	not toxic	I think that one thing to guarantee a fair trial for defendants would be to require both audio and video evidence to back up police testimony. Police testimony should not be admissible without audio and video. In a recent trial I witnessed, the police had parked their cars a block away from the scene so there was no video available from their dash cams. The police testimony contradicted the audio portion of the tape, but neither the prosecutor or defense attorney challenged the account. Since juries are more likely to believe police, anyone who doesn't have video evidence to contradict police testimony is likely to be convicted by a jury or a judge. Requiring video evidence would keep the police from perjuring themselves to get a conviction. Innocent people would be more likely to go for a jury trial rather than accepting a plea bargain for which they give up their right to appeal. What percentage of your cases actually went to trial?

Each trying to steal market share from each other. Now watch Iran screw with its enemies and send US oil stock to toilet as we see. I hope anyone with stock in oil or by products eats it. Never enough money, never happy with millions, always want billions or trillions.  America is in toilet where she belongs  because of her unfettered greed, arrogance and stupidity in wanting to rule the world instead of being an example to the world. We were the example of freedom, opportunity and hope to a dark world. Now? America just shut off any light for everybody but rich and stupid bumpkins like her in every nation!

Truth is, all the self-righteous emoting about the Weinstein sexual abuse case is just cheap, tawdry,  gossipy entertainment for the vacuous American masses who need to get their daily cheap thrill without taking responsibility for their actions. Maybe  I'm a cynic, but I wonder how many of these shallow self-righteous people voted for Agent Orange who was a known sexual abuser.  We're  being entertained to death.

Still, if you can get your pro-life friends to push the issue, I bet the Roberts Court, including Kennedy, would allow it.  Of course, the GOP would likely demure because it would upset its funders.  After 2018 you won't get another chance unless the Democrats insist on compromise to end the issue.  Your best terms are available if you do not delay.  Delay means you agree with the use of the issue for electing Republicans and not helping the unborn.  It is that simple.  Immigration is that kind of issue as well.  It is mostly alt-right xenophobes fighting ethical manufacturers and farmers fighting bosses who like coyote-bought labor that they can treat like slaves. The only real solution is repeal right to work and all immigration restrictions.  No more coyotes.

Must be such a dreadful existence to wake up in the morning hating and fearing people who present no threat to you and never will. Why are so many Americans so ugly?

906	not toxic	Misconceptions and Realities About Who Pays Taxes    Only if you ignore that the 'other half' pay federal taxes that the wealthy don't often pay do you get the misconception that the wealthy pay most of the taxes.    Those Pew studies and those Joint Committee studies don't count payroll taxes and other federal, state and local taxes.  Saying 80 percent of tax breaks go to individuals vastly overstates the percentage of tax breaks when you account for the value of the tax breaks, individuals get almost no value compared to the value of tax breaks for the wealthy.  In short, the Pew so called analysis and the Joint Committee reports are not to be trusted for a complete picture, they are carefully curated to push a false narrative.  Only the most naive people, and that includes Senators and Congressmen, take those reports as the whole story.

I've been there and helped rebury remains that were exposed from the animal caused erosion. To see literally hundreds of remains, exposed hearths and middens was deeply disturbing.  These animals have no value other than to a bored crabber and should be removed. They are no better than rats.

539	not toxic	I can understand how a "display of wealth" might "expose" some aspect of India's caste system (although I'm a bit hazy about how it would apply to South African Indians, who don't have a caste system). How "displaying wealth" could "expose" "racial prejudice" escapes me completely, I'm afraid.   Why mention the skin tone of the Indian man? Or the newness of clothing? Or the "Afrikaans-speaking" man's language? ("How many prejudices do you have?" I ask myself.)  Seems to me, you went there for a less than honourable reason, and security spotted you immediately - not because you are black and your friend South African Indian, but because you stood out amongst those who were there for honourable reasons.  I think the Guptas are poisonous, but this kind of "journalism" serves no productive purpose.

You seems to not have very firm political morals and principals jumping and moving as the debate changes. This is an article by Ivo on the conference just ended in Durban and their scheme for the world's poor etc. He takes it apart and you somehow have meandered everywhere (especially into your socialist vs capitalist topic, are you not tired of it by now?) except answering specifically his points, good or bad. Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?. Stick to articles subject and keep consistent.  How many people does SA's coal industry kill per year and what are you doing abvout it?
757	not toxic	"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.

O'ahu has an ongoing traffic problem and neither the State nor the City has done enough to alleviate the symptoms or found a way to fix this major issue;  Rail was touted as being a tool with which to lessen, the traffic burdens on the highways, but that turned out to be a "bald faced lie"  Take a look at the early costs of rail, set at $5.6 billion dollars to build and now take a good hard look at the costs to continue building rail, now topping $10 Bilion dollars and rising; can you say with out a shadow of doubt, that rail will be built out for that amount of finances?  Realistically, I wouldhve to say "No!"  As the costs will continue to mount, whether you cut the project off at the Airport terminal, Middle Street or at Ala Moana, while HART needs FTA approval, before they cam move on it.  Then there are the issues of "maintenance....."  meaning more money down the black hole!
193	not toxic	nodaddynotthebelt -- mahalo for the stats! Fascinating stuff. Re increased rear-ends after cams are placed, I'm guessing that it's because speeders are conditioned to step on the gas -- instead of the brake -- when the light turns yellow or just turns red. They simply don't get it. In other words, either way, it's the same people, speeders, who are raising the accident stats. Don't pass the law, and they'll continue to kill and maim others. Pass the law, and they'll continue to rear-end others because their instinct is to step on the gas when they ought to be stepping on the brake to slow down. Rear-enders and light-runners are probably from the same population and should, therefore, be taken off the road for good after two strikes. We can't afford a third strike when every strike might mean a human life or limb.

63	not toxic	Intel Community: ‘How can we work for a President who Undermines our work?’  Days before taking office, he compared America’s spies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.  American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.  Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: “The person who said that should be ashamed of himself,” Brennan said.  Coats’ predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump’s comments “a terrible, insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”  Trump’s opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.  Not surprising in a treasonous traitor.

770	not toxic	And the reason junkies steal is because illegal drugs are expensive, and often junkies have been incarcerated before, as Howard notes, and can't get jobs that will pay enough to buy drugs. If, as other nations are doing, we decriminalized drugs we'd avoid most of what Howard complains about. If tobacco were illegal it'd be so expensive people would steal to get it. C. Everett Koop, former US Surgeon General, said nicotine is more addictive than heroin.  The World Health Organization advises drug decriminalization, and it's obvious our war on drugs has NOT worked and in fact made things worse, especially when such laws are enforced by thugs such as Cunningham. If you want a better society first clean up the ranks of those you empower to enforce your laws. "The ethics of a nation are only as good as its leaders --" said Will Rogers, "never better." Start at the top and work down when you want to fight crime. Howard has no credibility as an advocate for punishing law breakers.

I even caught one idiot with his two-year old child toddling around the bank next to the rushing water.  I asked several people that I caught on the wrong side of the tape, "You just ducked under tape that says "Police Line - Do Not Cross.  What do you expect me to do with this?  You DO realize that I could arrest you?".  Dumb, sullen looks in response.  Apparently I was the bad guy.

Those 10,000 will then be responsible for ferrying all goods and information in and out of the two countries. The 10,000 will have employment for life and a very high standard of living while the people in the other 36 states that export to Canada as a #1 client, will be toast. Good on 'em.

I don't understand how you are so quick to turn your back over the pledge but not a damn thing about all the pro athletes doing drugs, sexually assaulting girlfriends and wives and committing serious crimes when they are role models for our children. What kind of message is that? Imagine if the stands were empty because a player beat up his baby momma again or got arrested for DWI. Imagine the message that would send to our youth. I am a firm believer in the pledge & respecting our country. Look at the role models we have for our children. We pay billions for athletes and musicians but we don't have money for schools or medical care. And we wonder how things got so bad.

32	mildly toxic 	"Trump said “I’ll tell you about that maybe sometime.." I predict that Trump will renege on that comment like he has done on so many of his "promises". Trump is the Liar and Thief of the USA.
398	not toxic	Don't be a fool, Bigfire45. Nobody agrees with ISIS here as far as I am concerned. A number of us just happen to share their assessment about the intellectual capabilities of the current POTUS.
129	toxic	Gee, has he done anything positive, howler? Do enlighten us.  Here's a wild thought - maybe the stories are negative because he's such an incompetent, petty windbag? Why waste your time defending it?
126	mildly toxic 	Just remember Wynne loves to throw these law suites around as taxpayers flip the bill. She is one arrogant person.
341	mildly toxic	Pollution EXISTS, that is not a joke - the fraud is that we are being told to pay for them to continue while they can create shell companies and dump MORE toxic waste in waters/lands and in our backyard - literally.  if you think the bombing non-stop for years in countries is not cooking the earth, then you are severely stupid. They are not using perfume as bombs.

820	mildly toxic	Oh...Libtards in Canada! The uncharted territory of brainwashed idiots. Let us join US libtards in the popular game - nitpick the Trump...So much fun - no matter what he does or say. I guess this is the main reason why we have "drama teacher" Trudeau as our "PM". O tempora, o mores!
764	mildly toxic	Have fun while it last, Trump the racist soon to be impeached plus others include his family. No class grab a$$ molester.

489	mildly toxic	"Neo-Confederate is best translated as Neo-Traitor Group. The treason continues, even after the CSA was defeated in 1865."  Bring it, racist traitors. After you surrender again to the Armed Forces of the United States of America, we promise you that Reconstruction will not be as lenient as it was the first time. About a century of occupation of your flyover states will serve as a right proper chastisement for your impudence.

161	very toxic	You must have eaten a lot of lead paint as a child. It is illegal for Trump's comments to have a bearing on the sentence. He won't receive anything you think he should receive, and once again, you will be proven to be a know-nothing cretin.
541	not toxic	you missed the point totally, nobody said that he did not have the constitutional right to do what she did, they are questioning the appropriateness of her actions.  acting like a jerk in front of a national tv audience is not proper demeanor for an elected delegate representing the democratic party and Hawaii.  she brought shame and dishonor to us.

774	mildly toxic	"I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect."  Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted.
503	mildly toxic	The problem is that there is no equivalent to a PATRIOTIC  party, that TRULY would FIGHT for this Country. It is sold, owned by scavengers, rotten corrupted politicians who only think in their shit-soiled pockets. It is the same all over the world. This world is dominated by EVIL.

944	not toxic	I guess...if it showed a better looking garage.   What I'm mentioning is actually shown on the front page of the Blue Chip supplement in today's paper.   The photograph mutes it...seeing it looks plenty worse, imo.   I often drive by Bascom Village--a St Vinnie's project.   It's nice looking and good materials were used.   But I cannot understand why 20+ (water/electric) meters lined up on a wall have to be so visible.   Seriously, it's a huge eye sore.  They could build a structure over it, like a cabinet., or place appropriate shrubbery to hide it.   They'll hear from me soon because I find that neglectful.   This lack of aesthetic takes away from the other decent work.   Why certain details are neglected  that aren't crazy expensive...multiplied by a gazillion...sigh.
625	toxic	Some of you a pure assholes. You don't know ANYTHING about these people. Why don't you get off your dirty ass and come see if they need help. These are people in need, and all you can do is sit at your keyboard and judge them.
308	very toxic	Why call one bully to deal with another one? I doubt seriously I one of the dumb asses highlighted in the story would continue with a 9MM pointed at their head.

But all the socialists, liberals and progressives in this forum called me stupid.  Oh well...
688	toxic	The garbage that is being created by CNN and other news agencies is outrageous. Trump was elected and now the left can't deal with it. We had to deal with eight years of an administration that had no respect for the constitution or the American working class. Obama is not a fan of the U.S. so we have to keep those like minded people away from the White House. The left is a cancer that has infiltrated our society.

532	mildly toxic	Funny! A short while ago I responded that Yes! I am more convinced than ever that Trump is stupid. Beyond stupid. A monumental moron of historic proportions...  But my response was disallowed.  So here's the rub. You can ask. as you did, if we think Trump is stupid, but we can't answer in the affirmative or else our posts get deleted. That kind of sets up a one-sided argument, don't you think? Not much balance there.
157	toxic	I bet that these "Communist Infiltrators" are enjoying the increased value of their "retirement investments'. Such losers

Since the early 70s, open any electronics built in America and find chips from American companies like TI, Motorola, Fairchild made in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, etc.  trump fed many people a big nothing burger and they liked it.

Unfortunately, the POTUS is an idiot and contributes unnecessary risk to this whole issue.      In the meantime, keep up the good work on trying to polarize opinions!

10	toxic	NO !  There are no alternative facts. Go check for yourself. It is people like you, who have no idea what you are talking about that has gotten this State and Country into the mess it is in. People who think the Goverment, be it State or Federal, can spend the peoples money better than they can, is stupid and nonsensical. Politicians use taxes as Personal slush accounts to continue their carrers, buying votes from the lame and the lazy.
27	toxic	Seems more to me like the far right whack jobs have their racist misogynist in office than any supposed recent "liberal" leanings of GW.
597	not toxic	Explain to me this: You are indicted on charges of "Impeding federal officers from doing their job", But the media has been allowed to call you a terrorist, an accusation your actions do not even support, and the court has been allowed to treat you like a terrorist, locking you in a 6x6 dark room with no sunlight or artificial light and NO mat or bedding to sleep on even though your actions AND indictment do not support such treatment? Ammon is allowed 1 hour per day out and that has been shortened to 15 minutes multiple times. Thats our justice system at work? Not only is Ammon and the others being held as guilty until proven innocent, but they are being held in conditions that dont even support the charges brought against them. Justice and Liberty for all?

964	not toxic	This is a power grab for more of our money. Soldotna is doing the same but on a smaller scale. They want more money for their pet projects. Look how much money Soldotna spent on putting in round-a-bouts on Brinkley Street, you cant even go around the round-a-bout at East Marydale without running over the curbs if you are driving anything bigger that a mid sized car. I often wonder how the ambulance gets to the hospital without running over the curb unless the just avoid going down Brinkley. This is what I mean by pet projects that are a waste of money. What the he_ _ was wrong with the 4-way stop signs? All governments try to say we will do this cheaper than what you are paying now in cases like this but in the end you end-up paying more either through more or more restrictions on what you can or more importantly can not do on your land. I wonder if this partly has to do with taxing the oil companies if they do the gas line into Nikiski
245	mildly toxic 	Ranger, are you calling Alaskan Natives domestic terrorists? Because last time I checked I haven't every heard of any Alaska Native strapping on a suicide vest.

I don't see any Aryan Nation race type groups. I haven't heard of any religious cult issues and mass poisoning. So Ranger, tell me what is makes you think Alaskan Natives are "domestic terrorists?" Or is this just racist bullshit you're peddling?
