598	mildly toxic	Hold the phone.! Sunny Ways said the balance will budget itself!   Are you glad you elected that idiot? Guess what “That means making really tough choices",means? Health care will go to a two or three tire system. The biggest expenditure won't be health care but servicing the debt.   Anyone who voted Liberal deserves this but your poor children and grandchildren do not.
563	mildly toxic	You are a fraud, using a modified name that is already in use and well known. Find your own identity and stop using someone else's as an insult to that person.
181	very toxic	oh please - buying the fake news of those who disagree and can get media attention that Francis is not clear.  Really?  Prove your assertion?   Again, stating an factually crippled opinion with no documentation - you sound like Ms. Huckabee trumping Trump.  Two synods on chapter 8 - with all but overwhelming votes in support.  Where is the confusion?  Suggest - only for folks that have skewed their faith journey into a catechism test with check off boxes.  What that has to do with faith is anyone's guess.  This is one of your *dumbest* opinions in a while.  Yep, if you repeat the *not clear* matra often enough, some actually think it is true, factual, and real - you have been played as a sucker.

638	mildly toxic	What is lame is a country that goes through so many mass killings and still does nothing.  Now that is pathetic.  You know at one time conservatives valued human life.  Sanctity of life and all that.  Wonder what happened.  Now no big deal.  let the lead fly, can't pass any regulation to reduce the chance of it happening.  That will take profits away from big business.  Disgusting!

You have contradicted yourself at least once and probably more times, as well as exhibiting a writing skill level that would get you a C at best on any high school freshman paper. Get a grip, look at yourself, stop making a fool of yourself. Once more, your writing will improve if you stop capitalizing random stuff.

574	mildly toxic	The Democratic caucus bent over backwards to get Republicans to contribute as the ACA was being openly created over a year and a half mr. travis. There are over 100 Republican  amendments included in the ACA. If you don't know that by now after all these years then it is because you are ignoring the truth or your information sources are intentionally misleading you. A man can only "know" as much as his information sources tell him after all.
796	mildly toxic	Beyond silly and it won't make any difference at all.

392	very toxic 	Exactly. The mayor and his gang of sycophants have no trouble collecting the revenue and taxes Trump Tower will bring but feel the need to virtue-signal to the vacuous, politically illiterate Lululemon set.  Meanwhile, these hypocrites turn a blind eye to foreign investors gutting Vancouver's housing market, the world's worst housing bubble. Disgusting, simply disgusting.  Vote out the BC Libs in May.

892	mildly toxic	What a hypocrite if there ever was one!
552	mildly toxic	Ohhhh! Okay, now I understand the whole hyperbole thing!  So, basically you're saying that Trump just said he'd get rid of the ACA to sucker the dumb Republicans into voting for him. All 74 percent of them. Got it. But you weren't fooled. You knew he didn't really mean it.

44	not toxic	Right on!  The sad part of this focus on bashing Trump is that they are missing the opportunity to channel that passion into positive, constructive ideas and build a platform to fix what they think is wrong.  Unless they ain't got any ideas -- which is a definite possibility.

379	mildly toxic	Let me be clear, your world is not my world and it's not "our nation."  THREE MILLION more votes for Clinton.  That puts you in the minority.  The clown is in the White House.  Let the circus begin.  My conscience is clear.

533	mildly toxic	When you consider the source - he writes like the Trump we've all come to know -  "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters", a racist,  misgynistic, liar who only brings hate to the table.
167	mildly toxic 	OMG.  The articles says that 'Murkowski voted yes as she felt the full senate deserved to vote on DeVos and in deference to the presidents selection as she has done with prior administrations.   Huh??  What a lie!   Does she think we forgot that she sided with the rest of the Republicans to prevent President Obamas selection for the Supreme Court from even having a hearing.  What a hypocrite!

Do tell us more fake poll information Tommy.

383	mildly toxic	I love how fellow troglodytes vote in agreement with you despite your falsehoods.   Let me see our middle class taxes were lowered and this also benefits the wealthy (but yes they did rise for those making over $200k - boo hoo).  Our corporate taxes are already in the 10-15% range and have been for a long time.   So where are these tax increased under Wynne or Trudeau, name them???     You believe Trump can get rid of half (just a guess) of federal revenue and it will benefit society?  You think that is how it works?  Do tell.   How does the fact that within the next 20 years we will ALL lose another 10-20% of jobs due to technology?  Tell me how that factors in for you?  What about the fact that globally we are adding about 80 million more people a year but require less labour?  How does that factor in, let me tell you?  Should we always just let the .01% reap the benefits of technology none of them have invented?   Simple minded answers are for the far right among us.
755	mildly toxic	How did people die from blanks? You idiots seriously buy this garbage? Bullets make noise when they hit pavement. People bleed when they get shot.  Multiple eye witnesses reported "fake gunshots".  Want ads released last month on cregslist for "crisis actors".  A video of a witness who held a man shot repeatedly, who suspiciously had zero blood on his person.  Multiple photos of "victims" who have been photographed at other "terror" attacks.  This whole thing would be believable... if you've never seen or fired a real gun, never seen someone bleeding, or heard a ricochet.  Big thank you to Hollywood for helping people believe this ridiculously staged event was real.  Go to a gun range - then you might be able to distinguish a real gunshot from a fake one.   #FALSEFLAG

491	mildly toxic	She may be, but so what? Who cares -why- she assisted in capturing murderers?   The "stop snitching" BS is a misplaced, moronic, perversion of the loyalty that should exist between -honorable- people. Unlike honorable people, if scumbags weren't uniformly idiots they'd -expect- their scumbag friends to "rat them out." After all, they are all scumbags and would all do it to save their own hides, or for money, or for whatever momentary puerile preferences or whims flash through their pitiful, empty heads.
35	not toxic	The answer to your question, shiftworker1, is that the Canadian electoral system assumes that non-voters are equally (un)happy with whoever is elected.  It ignores non-votes and awards legislative authority to whichever party gets a plurality of votes. Of course, your proposal that "we all not vote" is not a credible proposal, and therefore just wastes our time reading it.

601	mildly toxic	hate filled agitators trying to get the whole thing blown into a police issue, really sick people out there with a foul mouth as big as a garbage dumpster, really disgusting. police have a duty to protect us all and when an arrest is being made the public should stay out of it. this jerk mouthing off wanted an incident to explode, loser.

At least folks like Andi and me will know what hit us.
728	mildly toxic	"Trump supporters are stupid."  You do - of course - realize that when you label people that way, they simply vote for ANYBODY ELSE once they get in the voting booth, right?

123	not toxic	My first impression of Fairbanks in May of 1990 was "What a dump. I bet I end up living here." I ended up living here. It is decidedly not a dump.  After several years in Denali (where I met my now wife) we settled in Fairbanks for better job prospects. Initially I wasn't sure about the place but as I came to learn the extensive trail system the mountain biker in me went nuts. I also found plenty of things to get involved in because Fairbanks residents have to create their own good times. People here are doers. When you meet someone questions don't revolve around jobs, we ask where have you hiked/biked/hunted/fished/climbed/etc. In other words, how have you taken advantage of this place and what it offers? You can go to a party and find a millionaire swapping trail tales with a plumber and they've known each other for years and you can't tell which is which from the looks of them.  As for suggestions, visit in March. There is no finer place on Earth than Fairbanks, Alaska, in March.

569	mildly toxic	This area of military property is quite likely NOT open to the public as any type of Free Speech Zone for demonstrations and NEVER HAS BEEN.  Do you realize if the military allowed it to be that they could be liable in Tort for any person who may get injured or harmed during one of these agitated demonstrations???  I heard the demonstrators were making people driving by angry.  What if someone threw something and put a demonstrator into a coma... you think the military should accept that severe liabilty risk so you can go yell at a hotel THAT ISN'T EVEN OWNED BY TRUMP???  You people are reacting stupidly - with all due respect.  ;-)
857	toxic	"may have"? ...and you want to know why americans hate the news media. HILLARY CLINTON IS A TRAITOR. BUT SHE WILL NOT BE PUNISHED.

353	not toxic	Although on trade, inflows and outflows with the US are roughly equal, there is a large difference in US ownership of Canadian companies, versus the opposite.  I would think this would constitute a bargaining chip.  That is, we could tax repatriated corporate profits from foreign owned companies at a much higher rate than profits retained in Canada.  This may induce the sale of some assets, increasing Canadian or favoured trading partner ownership, reducing the importation of goods, and creating jobs here.  The down side is some loss of efficiency and increase in consumer prices.  But that's the trade-off the US is making; why not do the same here?

566	mildly toxic	It's a stupid question Conservatives are the party of principle and freedom.  Maxine Bernier seems like an ideal candidate to replace the Celebrity Doorman.
991	mildly toxic 	Trump is a national disgrace.
448	very toxic 	Oh stop, Wuss boy, Obbummer, SMerkel, etc had a great strategy called appeasement and suckholed to this twerp instead of taking him out. Now he has the bomb. You pacifists caused WW2 when you wouldn't take out Hitler,  We are just cleaning up your PuS$y mess. Stand back and let the big boys take over before the world falls into WW3 from your incompetence.  Go back to your snowflake shelters and your college basements you measly wimps

432	mildly toxic 	This Adrian loon has the dumbest headline in history. Give your pen a shake. Fog Horn aka Trump asked Comey for loyalty and to take it easy on Flynn end of story. What a writer this loon is.
221	mildly toxic 	Blah blah whatever Putin's says is true blah blah blah Trumpski never lies blah blah Obama is bad because...I'm not a racist blah blah blah emails are evil; Russian ex-KGB dictators who kill off anyone who disagreees with them are good blah blah blah I love anyone who attacks my old country - the USA - because I hate the boogie-woman Clinton more than I love my country  blah blah I fell for Putin/Trumpski/Republican propaganda and am now brainwashed blah blah... #traitortomycountry

390	not toxic	' One grifter to another,   ….Trump is nothing but a grifter surrounding himself with more grifters.
902	mildly toxic	This article is baloney!!!! Just a typical negative Toronto journalist! I can't believe how negative our journalists are for such a wonderful city! So because the Red Sox and Yankees spend a lot they will be good?? Even though almost every analyst agrees that those two teams overpaid by a ton for their deals?? The Yankees do not have near enough talent to be relevant this year. I love how you just dismiss the Blue Jays with all the good players on their team! You do realize they had the best pitching staff in the american league during the regular season last year right??? Typical negative garbage!!!
9	mildly toxic 	Only a fool would believe that the MSM is not biased against this president.
554	toxic	20 million "motor voter" votes were cast and counted.  They ALL went Demo-liberal.  I'm being VERY generous in proposing only 5 of 20 million cast, were illegals.  Of course they voted, they're not idiots.  Stick your head back in the sand, I'm sure it's comforting.
665	mildly toxic	This is ridiculous!  It was the Conservative Party that broke the law and violated his rights.  Why are we responsible?  It's time to start a petition to force the Conservative Party to pay all of this settlement.  This is about the law and those who broke the law.  The Conservative Party is guilty as hell, as per the Supreme Court ruling.  Hey Harper, get out your damn cheque book!!
26	mildly toxic 	Trump with brains. Malignant brains, but brains nonetheless.
22	mildly toxic 	tsboy>  Klastri is a liar and a pretty good one.  Tried to convince me that I was a liar, when I called him out being an outright liar, who is always twisting the facts.  You gott'em by he "whatevers."
31	very toxic	Kind of like you and your small-minded, repetitive and utterly banal drivel.
325	not toxic	typical empty stupid reply based on hate over anything constructive
923	mildly toxic	What an outrage, an American president who cares about the welfare of the American workers. Well, feed me garlic and call me stinky.
104	mildly toxic 	No worries.   This guy is a coward. Just like all bullies.   Besides, he doesn't know how to actually get anything done. Just blister, menace, and grope, as long as he holds some kind of power over people.  Besides, he's got such a short attention span he's already on to the next golfing trip.
605	mildly toxic	Gerald Butts. Prime architect of Ontario's Green Energy Act. Same drivel McGuinty spouted years ago. Look at Ontario. Coming to a Canada near you.

996	mildly toxic 	Cory, Cory, Cory...you and Governor Hickenlooper and Senator Bennett did a great job during the floods...but that was then....Governor Hickenlooper and Senator Bennett have continued their successes, while your 15 minutes of fame seem to be over... Gonna ride that pony until it dies...??   Gonna kill it by killing Americans in support of the Oligarchs and billionaires...Shame on you..!!!
738	mildly toxic	No surprise. Look at what Mulroney's idiotic spending did to our national debt. He's no better than Pierre, so this is no surprise...
272	mildly toxic 	Opening up people of a different race to violent acts including death by idiots, by inciting her followers to violence, is offensive. If anything happens to the Jones family, Dembroski should be charged as an accessory.
456	not toxic	Stealing from sick children is utterly despicable...but you're cool with it because he's a Trump. Better check your moral compass.
712	mildly toxic	Liberals are now and always were a party of privilege. This and Hollywood being sexist are the two worse kept secrets ever. What observation is next..that the playboy mansion hosted a lot of sex parties?
2	mildly toxic 	And Trump continues his lifelong cowardice by not making this announcement himself.  What an awful human being .....
785	mildly toxic	Fool anymore with my Tax Free Savings Account and you are dead! Some people are good savers and should not be punished any further than the last claw back.
780	toxic	Another Trump/Bannon/Breitbart boot-licking sycophant. Notice he wears a cap like his hero. "I have great name recognition," says this Trump toady. Just one more GOP loser.
622	mildly toxic	Shelia Jackson Lee is a moron.  "In 1997, while on a trip to the Mars Pathfinder operations center in California, Jackson Lee confused the planet Mars with Earth's own moon, asking whether the Pathfinder had succeeded in taking a picture of the flag planted on Mars by Neil Armstrong in 1969." She is so stupid that she should not come out of her house and show her face in public.
443	not toxic	The Trump chapeau should read: Make America Misogynist Again.
399	mildly toxic	Goddammit guys. Get your act together! You were a breath of fresh air post Harper era but we're starting to smell the rot already. Are you advised by morons? How could Morneau be so tone deaf to something like this??? And worse is Trudeau defending the practice! Gawd....is the ethical bar now that low??? God help us all.
855	not toxic	Ah...... he was assassinated
914	mildly toxic	How dumb can they be to think no-one would notice. That is maybe the most annoying part.  WE ARE WATCHING YOU TRUDEAU.  And this kind of smelly preferential treatment kills your credibility
29	mildly toxic 	Lol really. No offence but that’s an idiotic statement. I’m not looking for likes from the douches on the left/ right political side of things. You can’t honestly think this though. Our government federally and provincially across Canada works exactly like this. The more money in the more money spent. It is always, and will always be spent with little oversight, common sense, little efficiency. That’s it. You see provinces with hst taxing more that have massive debts. Obviously more money didn’t make them better money managers, quite the opposite actually. They post phony  surpluses but debts are ever increasing. The problem is the way money is spent. That’s it. Bloated public sectors that’s sole obligation is to become more bloated. What bloats more then more money. Don’t be naive to think less equalization would magically turn these inept politicians to manage money any better. That includes cons, libs, and dippers. They have zero sense of money management and probably never will.
499	mildly toxic	Socialism, FAILS EVERY TIME. Always has, always will. Welfare idiots love handouts, always have , always will.
96	mildly toxic 	what describes you - idiot, dufus, stupid, dumpy, etc.  not name calling just describing your behavior and thinking
214	not toxic	I have an idea the main export from the U.S. over the next few years will be illegal aliens.
807	mildly toxic	Perfectly acceptable comments get zapped but this trash stands? Flagged.
388	very toxic	And you dont know how to apply the word "too".yep, you are one of them there highly smart kinda broads. LOL. What a fkn moron.
667	not toxic	"It is one of the uglier qualities of the time in which we live that criticism of one's own is seen as some kind of threat, even a variety of disloyalty. I have always been a proud man of the left. I have never been a Stepford wife. Besides, part of the rationale of being on the left is that you should have an allergy to agitprop, no?"  I think the editor must be on summer holiday.
483	very toxic	Idiot isn't a hate word. And you're an idiot. Flag away coward.
460	not toxic	How about one article about genocide white South African farmers.Stop talking about Trump every day.
779	mildly toxic	I have zero sympathy for this lowlife. He murdered one person, was probably connected to two other murders, and who knows what else he did. Just because he was good enough to play in the NFL doesn't mean anything as far as his worth as a person, which is zero. A lowlife loser is what he was. Glad he's not wasting my air anymore.
507	mildly toxic	Poor Hillary. So unloved. So unlovable.
120	mildly toxic 	What keeps me up at night is the fact that these coyotes don't even have concealed teeth permits...they can just go around biting and tearing anybody they want to shreds...totally legal!  Absurd...crazy..totally re-puke-ligan
261	not toxic	When you hear that, run like hell.
64	not toxic	hit em low
782	mildly toxic	I enjoy these comments by people who aren't required to prove what they claim. "guy in my building"...  As for Shelly Glover, I wouldn't know. All I know is she belongs to a party of bigots that don't give a rat's patoot about any minority.
821	not toxic	Once again the world of "cults" causes death. Wherever there is religion there is violence .....since it first began. Wars, genocide, atrocities all in the name of their mythological gods.  From the Crusades to the Middle East.......thousands of years of not figuring it out. How stupid is mankind. So many have yet to realize that man created god.
867	mildly toxic	His crash is under way. The most glorious and horrendous political crash in modern history. You say that his supporters are firmly entrenched to support him. He is their leader, their Hitler, their Stalin. But there are a huge number of people who voted him that weren't those nutcases. They were bitter and angry "average Americans" and "tried something new." They are immediately streaming away from support of Trump's presidency - by the millions each and every day. Only three weeks in to his time of "rule." Don't get too optimistic el Duque and I am hoping that the millions who love him won't ruin their country by "screaming" their points for years and years afterward. An embarrassment for America worldwide - except maybe in Moscow. Look at today's polls. Trump is crashing AND despised by the media. You will be horribly disappointed when he is "politically" dead. A modern-day demon.
582	not toxic	You are right about that now,  But is was a multi year deal in place before the CRTC wrongly stole their exclusivity rights for Canada.  That anyone not blinded by their phone bill sees this as fair needs to give their head a shake.  The NFL sold exclusivity in Canada to Bell.  Then the Canadian government usurped that exclusivity so people could watch commercials.  Bell lost 40% of its audience and any profit on the deal.
137	not toxic	USA has 11 million illegal immigrants from Mexico  Trudeau with naive sentimental feel-good touchy feely "compassion"  declares Canada will welcome refugees (also economic migrants?)  Trump says to teary-eyed Bambi Justin "You can have all 11 million"  Just don't call them "illegal", call them "undocumented" and give them "sanctuary"  Problem solved
