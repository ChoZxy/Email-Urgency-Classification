801	mildly toxic	This country is turning into one big bureaucratic disaster.   Canada needs less government and  MORE jobs.    And who do you think will fill all these cushy positions?   The fifedoms and silos are fully erected federally and Provincially where endless meetings and money sucking leeches do nothing but milk the cow dry.  Not a single tangible shred of this whole thing doing anything fir Canadians.   Lots of words and phrases with no detail.     And yet you lower my TFSA limit....what a joke.
792	mildly toxic	Of course they do.   Stupid people really have to meet everyone else half way if they don't want to be called stupid, starting with not saying stupid things.

611	mildly toxic	SB 21 is the cause of the budget crisis?  No, a decade of bi-partisan raiding of the bank is the cause.  A bunch of fools on the left and right who thought that oil-prices would never drop.

577	toxic	There are many sources for hamburgers, and sugary frozen drinks in this state. There is only ONE provider in Anchorage for CABLE internet. Due to the high capital expense to establish a cable network, there is a 'high barrier to entry' so it is unlikely there will be any competition soon, especially  given GCI's  size and power, and ability to drive any competitor out of the market.  Please, your argument is tired and intellectually dishonest.   You must work for GCI, to post such a stupid comment. Either that, or you're a Republican.

349	toxic	"Trump, Putin and the threat to liberal democracy "  By July 1st 2017, 80% of Canadians (and Europeans) will be so thoroughly disgusted by the lying draft dodger/con-artist /Trump, thus the chances of the Trump mix of nonsense, lying, racism and far right lunatic fringe ideology will be completely and permanently stricken off any and all serious political consideration by Canadians.  The man/Trump is an liar of mammoth/biblical  proportions. If the minority of Americans that voted for him are happy with the election result, well, good for them.

298	not toxic	This is an idiotic article. Top flight Canadian universities (Toronto, UBC, McGill, Montreal, Alberta) compete internationally to attract faculty, administrators, and academic leaders. We have two Canadian universities ranked in the world's top 35 (Toronto, UBC). Do you really think that's possible paying "public sector" wages?  Bottom line ... if we want world class universities, we need to pay competitive wages. $500,000 plus for a President is not remotely out of step with what the competition pays.
765	toxic	why do ignorant left wing nutjobs like you think that? see loser we support trump for standing up for his country, we wish we had such a leader here to do that for use so we call out our childish PM who is too busy working the UN phones to care, , so stick you hate stupidity lefty, we know leadership when we see it, and we in canada do not have it.

Some of which are some of Europes largest selling models.Ford sold over 1 million cars in Europe in 2015 while GM sold almost as many. Trump is an idiot that is going to cost American taxpayers jobs and money and likely drag us into it as well. When you have a team of people that no practically nothing of what they are supposed to represent then it will end very bad.

When I started to figure out why is the day I started to grow up. The day I started to be a conscious human being. The day I realized people like these on WWA are pathetic idiots. Massaging their egos with the carcass of a small animal. Feel big you guys? An un-examined life isn't worth living. Yo make me gag. Grow Up!

Thirty years of stupid pet tricks that always had me wondering how anyone would even think about doing a real estate deal with him.  Turns out that was just part of the total dysfunctional package.  And Lisa has seen the same crass, insulting, low brow antics we have for the last year and a half.  The Groper Old Party has done itself in largely due to the silence of those like our three Horsemen.  Pathetic.

You really are kind of a pee-baby, Martin.  Trust me, out on the coast we see Portland people coming a mile away - you're dressed like idiots, you look frail and sad, you've got a "let's pretend I'm a lot like Jeremiah Johnson" beard, and you got to shitbird hangouts like the Chart like you're on fucking safari or something.

So why has he helped kill so many, so what will stop him from killing more, nothing so far. So why do we have troops over there and in the middle east even, just to make men out of boys. Maybe we should just build a bunch if golf courses over there and frustrate the hell out of the Syrians. There are no answers to the nonsense.

978	mildly toxic	Only leftist and idiots would take this joke of an article seriously. To begin with we are dealing with the Washington Post.They are the unofficial mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. When was the last time they printed a story that wasn’t slamming Trump or Republicans? I will answer for you, never.  The story is based on a poll.  What a bogus premise to smear Republicans.  I’m going to take a poll in Green Bay to find out what team in the NFL is the best.  “Almost half of Republicans want war with North Korea, a new poll says.”   Fake! fake! fake!  No they don’t. No one wants war. When was that poll question asked?  “Do you want war with North Korea?”  Mmm didn’t get to answer that one.  The question asked was about support for a preemptive strike.  That is talk of strategy.  How is this for a poll question:  How many Americans, Japanese or South Koreans should die before America stops them: A) 100,000  B) 500,000  C) 1,000,000 or D) none of the above, we don’t draw lines anymore.

966	not toxic	City staffer: “We can’t spend our way out of this crisis. We don’t have enough revenue. We’re going to need significantly more help from senior govts to achieve the targets.”  Spot the incongruence? Staffers need to get back to their jobs processing paper to avoid the huge backlog of housing supply waiting to be released. The private sector can (invest) spend the way out of the crisis, but staffers (drien by their unions) want to funnel the funds through their grossly inefficient hands.

38	not toxic	There's rarely opportunity to agree with Bennet on much, but in this case he's right.  Trump is POTUS mostly because the electorate has grown so sick and tired of the status quo in Washington DC.  And electing Trump was their backlash.    And for the final paragraph, he'd be more accurate if he'd replaced the word "price" with the word "cost".  Prices are high because costs are high.  Any reform needs to be focused on COST containment.

He said that "You won't believe what they're finding" and that he would be releasing their report "soon." We didn't know then what we know now: that when Trump promises to  release "proof" for any of his lies, he's lying -- in fact, it's Trump-speak for "I'm lying through my teeth." There was no report, no investigation, no investigators -- there was always and only Trump's filthy, racist lies. Here he is on The View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emkDpm_vQDg

However, the last election proved they aren't the majority and they're not out the 500M/yr Obama spent on "PR" that went to fuel this nonsense via actors trolling comment sections and professional "organizers".  Left in their vacuum are the anacharists.  Previously hiding in the shadows, they're front and center now that the professional organizers have thinned out due to budget cuts.

Quickly wash it with soap and water, apply Neomycin-Bacitracin antibiotic ointment from Long's and generously cover it with a big bandage. Change them everyday and reevaluate the healing process. Pus or clean? These things are cheap insurance. you never know if your kid has a weak immune system. Hospitals are overwhelmed and full of stupid uncaring doctors, nurses, and support workers mixed up with good ones. This kind of accident will continue again and again. I strongly suspect people didn't care because they saw them as inferior people from the Pacific regions. The award should have been $10 million, and people should have been fired. That was a human child who died. Who will be the next one? A white one?

736	mildly toxic	O'reilly, like trump and roger ailes, is an over-sexed lunatic.  They all, apparently, believe they can do anything they want because they possess power over others.  Pathetic!  Wonder why trump felt he is a good candidate to defend o'reilly?  Oh, yeah, he is a narcissistic child who never learned appropriateness.
36	mildly toxic 	C*nt, Tw*t, B*tch, Wh*re
149	mildly toxic 	Yep, there are tons of em. Guess how dumb they are?
406	mildly toxic	Wow!  The idiots in Washington accuse Syria of preparing for a chemical attack without any credible evidence and then claim victory when no attack happens.  I wish could do something like that.
18	toxic	All you ever talk about is trolling, you and your Troll president can burn for all I care
230	mildly toxic 	What exactly is suspicious about it? Taking the advice of the entire democrat party? Partisan politics is our reality. It's not my fault democrats complain when they get what they called for. They are hypocrites, maybe they are mad Obama didn't have the stones to do this himself.
21	toxic	"Watch people die from taking away their healthcare"  DING DING DING!  Winner of stupid post of the day award!
442	not toxic	Who wants to deal with a condo board politics and fraud?
620	toxic	You idiots must all be on crack!!! Mushers do not mis treat their dogs and fewer dogs die on the Iditarod than in the homes of you idiots!!! The public dog owner does way more damage than a musher to their dogs. Running dogs don't run unless they want to and are well cared for athletes. Put that in your dumb ass pipes and blow it up your noses along with the crack!!!
984	toxic	No dear, that's you. The right is known for having elevated spin to an art form.  The left just speaks in regular words, easily understandable to anyone with a basic education.  Oh wait, I see why you don't understand the plain meaning of words. It's a combination of stupid coupled with an inability to think as a result of listening to right-wing-nut propaganda constantly telling you to disbelieve the plain meaning of what you see, hear and read.  You know, when Trump says or writes something that is incredibly idiotic, rude, incorrect, etc. and then the news reports it, followed by his spin doctors coming out and "explaining" that he really didn't say what he said, or didn't mean what he clearly meant, etc.  Tell me, if your kids tried that crap on you, would you fall for it hook, line and sinker the way you do with Trump? What kind of a parent would point to a narcissistic, greedy, morally bankrupt, cheating pathological liar and megalomaniac as an example for their kids?
522	mildly toxic	No evidence that Obama wiretapped the orange dude; plenty of evidence that the orange dude is a pathological liar!
747	mildly toxic	More like Trump is undoing years of stupidity.
259	mildly toxic 	This whole thing is so stupid. They are just lemmings, doing it because another more popular player did it. They don't truly care about the issues, they want to show their dissatisfaction with Trump. Many people fought and died for the flag. This is complete disrespect for our country and the sacrifices that were made.
111	toxic	Another brilliant lefty who has chosen to ruin his life for a petty political prank.  What are these knuckleheads learning in school?  It certainly isn't common sense.
264	not toxic	All this guy did was divide our nation. What an embarrassment this guy was.
192	mildly toxic 	What a gross waste of taxpayer money!!  It's looneys at our muni who continue to fritter away our money and who will make life in Anchorage that much harder for everyone.
431	very toxic	The treasonous seditious protesting anti American commie fag cant accept the outcome of the election so he likens the president to adolph hitler its his own partys fault they lost total loser. Canada awaits you. Suck it.

116	mildly toxic 	Not necessarily stupid.  Willfully ignorant is more likely.  That's why the average Trump supporter knows zero about the green economy and truly believes coal is coming back under Trump.
485	mildly toxic	and rmiller back living the usual stupidity ,, trump will be approving keystone almost immediately,,, YOU are always slow on the uptake never mind reality
508	mildly toxic	This article is just a Gigantic pile of BS geared make Vets in Alaska look bad.  Slop like this is why vets like me can't get a call-back after a job interview.  Every damn time they see my DD-214, it's like they're looking at a criminal record, and it is entirely due to "journalists" like the scumbag who wrote this filth.

301	very toxic	And you are an idiot, a dummy, and a nit wit.
919	mildly toxic	This guy is either stupid, brain dead, or a liar,  think a bit of all.   It is his government’s policies that allow cheap labor to flood into the Canadian IT sector through the Visa program, while at the same time companies like TATA , IBM, Accenture, and CGI  have mandates to offshore 80 % of the work. So the Canadian work force are being fired. He must think we truly are stupid, I guess if you get your news from the CBC or the Liberal Ministry of Propaganda .   While Trump tries to protect U.S. jobs, Junior does nothing, Cami is sending 600 jobs to Mexico yet dumb dumb says nothing. Trump has stopped thousands so far.  Maybe it is small but to those who kept their U.S. jobs Trump will have voters for life.

949	toxic	@ Valleyisles57 You must be new to the game. If you disagreed with O or MO's policies you were labeled a racist, brownshirt, bigot, hater, obstructionist, n_zi, idiot, sycophant and whatever derogatory name in Websters you could find...and outside of that book too. Welcome to politics.

297	very toxic	I wish this moron would have been shot to death by the US soldier instead of the other way around. I hope that 10 million is given to the soldier's family who actually deserve it.

189	mildly toxic 	Its the new way today, lie, cheat and steal , but its always the other people's fault.  Spence is a liar, a cheater and a thief of work but people seriously,   its not his fault it's yours.
639	toxic	Oh dear ... another Trump-bashing opportunity for the Clinton News Network and the liberal media frantically aping them. He won. Hilbilly lost. You all look stupid. Get over it.
112	toxic	He is our brother, but he isn't our president.  He is an intellectual and moral imbecile.  He is also a Russian agent.
846	not toxic	What Desa is saying here people is that there shouldn't be any mercy for rapists especially child rapists.

287	toxic	"they weren't full blown sexual preditors, narcissits, liars..." Bill Clinton - NOT a sexual preditor, huh? Barack "you can keep your doctor" Obama - NOT a liar, huh?  As for President Trump, it warms my heart to see that he distresses you lefties so much.  I hope he will continue to do so.
773	toxic	"It can't possibly be related in any way to the illegals living in the state." You were being facetious when you said this, meaning that you blame illegals for the crime in this state. You don't have to be explicit with me. Yep, those damn illegals--the best excuse for your failed life since sliced white bread
772	mildly toxic	As controversial as it appeared, we needed to show our collective strength and resolve. Our voice needed to be heard loud and clear.  YOU SUCK !!
14	mildly toxic 	Just who  does the buffoon think he is representing?
463	mildly toxic	Entitled trump’s goof old boy criticizes others for using a computer & then threatens violence while using one.  That’s the comedy.  Trumps’s Dumbing down of America.

689	toxic	Your vote was extremely based on stupidity.
33	mildly toxic 	tens years ago i contacted the PDR and suggested that the time might be good to work with alaska on building a gas line.. alaska rejected them without even consideration despite china being flush with cash and hungry for gas.. and set up another infamous boondoggle.. the transcanada-exxon rip off that we are still paying for and have yet to receive anything of value.. hundreds of millions of dollars on studies.. and buyouts.. i hope china says f you alaska.. you are nothing but ignorant people..
993	toxic	It may have been legal but it sure wasn't moral. That's never a problem for Trump. Morality is for suckers. Right little hand supporters?
