111	3	You guys are morons. I’ve been a customer for 40 years but no more Gillette for me. Joining the Dollar Shave Club took about 4 clicks. You insult your customers, you lose your customers. I don’t believe in being offended. I’m not offended.  I’m mad. And I’m taking my business elsewhere.
222	1	As a white man i dont like the white persons verse. I would never use that word. Especially when discussing the differences of a black person vs white person. I believe when arguing we should let the smartest of both partys discuss. Anyone who would fly off the handle and say the N word doesnt deserve that kind of platform
175	3	4 years ago age restriction didnt matter on youtube, now you have to scan your passport or creditcard, what a joke youtube has become. I wanted to listen to this song but i cant cause i got restricted  by my age on a song that has facts about life. If youre reading this boomer youtube grow the fuck up , youre gonna die and we need our younger people to grow up fast and make a better world then living in the past and staying in the past in the future.
71	1	Toxic masculinity... Racist, uneducated men... tired, dated sorts :(  Luckily, there are alternatives to those dated hazards.                                                                                                                                             Y'll swipe razors, we'll swipe men. There are plenty of mentally healthy men out there <3
404	2	Oh god sometimes you have to rewatch it once and awhile to remind yourself that this is not disliked for a meme, but it genuinely feels heavily cringing to soul devouring. I'm in pain
292	1	The NFL: honsetlty Kapernick, we truly understand you now and absolutely agree with you. In fact, I want to invite you to my personal place to show my appreciation in person! I will text you the address, just call when you arrive.  Kapernick: "I just arrived"  The NFL: "Ok, now go inside"  Kapernick: "Going inside now."............... "Who are all of these guys in here?!?!?"  The NFL: 2:09 - 2:16
419	1	pov: ur fav youtubers are in this video but u still find it cringy (this is literally everyone) (I finally understand why it is so cringy but I personally dont hate it that much lol)
733	3	This word is crazy, this shitty commercial gets more attention than the people in war and the army, people will still choose cola, Pepsi is like a worse version of cola
894	1	U cupped what w your cold 🥶 strange  👐 ..... 🤔 wait till someone in jail cupps MR. Thicke from behind w their cold strange ✋. Will def put it in perspective 4 him. She didn't deserve that. Shes so pretty and sweet. I just love her ❤
82	1	How can common sense receive so much hatred? I'm In Sweden where I live there's no controversy about this commercial at all because most people in Sweden understand that the message in this commercial is true.
893	2	She appears naked she seems to like it she wants attention a man can’t handle him self when a women purposefully wants his hands on her and after 8 years she decides to say Robin grabbed her boobs …….. can’t we be less blind and just look at the picture her name has dropped out the media she wants a come back
146	3	Corporate advertising trying to influence people's mindset, it's nothing new but who do they think they are to assume the position of moral arbiter when they are a business so we know their number one objective is profiteering, no profit making institution should have authority over people's social values, conflict of interest it's that simple, it's not hard to see why people are pissed off.
208	1	The shit that the guy was saying in the beginning sounds absurd bc it absolutely is but people hear that on a loop every single day. Actual people have to listen to that kind of hate instead of living carefree. I’m so sorry.
317	2	youtube what happened with the dislikes you do it to protect companies is not for the little youtubers the little youtubers are the ones who have less dislikes 🤦
168	3	White culture and Black Culture (White people and Black people, didn’t want to call them people cause I don’t want to get cancelled on YouTube for this shit.) But they will never get along. Never. That’s just how the world works.
9	3	Such an inspirational add that they deleted the comment section on the original upload. Toxic masculinity cant possibly be any worse then forcibly silencing the overwhelming majority of people who seriously disagree with you just to premote your own agenda. Joseph Stalin would be proud.
573	1	I guess if Chris reversed his joke on Will ,about his big ears he would have murdered him ? LOL get a life Will, and stop being your wifes's  puppet , or should I say Cough door mat  .
262	1	How I look at life and his song is everyone needs to respect and love and help one other we truly in end times covid 19 world wars u name it there enuff problems out there in the world why add to it. Pray ur lord and savor comes back to save the day a men but till then let's love and help each other
153	1	You should consider your race for marriage only not to kill.you can take care of race without being racist.racism is when a person starts thinking his race is superior than other
202	3	stop selling drugs ,stop your gangs, stop abandoning your kids,stop blaming other people,stop being lazy, stop thinking you all dat and ffs sake stop using the word ni**er at every chance, youre the ones keeping that word alive
788	3	Why is this happening now when in the video she's grabbing him 53 seconds in rubbing she'd chest off his Back and she's topless sorry but IT'S not like he's rubbed her breast or something by accident because he's going to have to look for her blobs first As there is not NOT MUCH there ,Why DIDN'T you stop shaking YOUR toosh and walk off and tell someone , Just My Opinion !!!
55	2	Anyone who has dealt with enough females during his life knows that "toxic masculinity" is nothing but a children’s game compared with toxic femininity.Quite interesting (but not surprising) that people,society and mainstream media love to act like only the first one actually exists.
256	1	I think what makes this so good is that it shows the extreme disenfranchisement that is on both sides of this issue. The truth is in the middle. As I was listening the the “white” side I was thinking wow this doesn’t reflect what I think about black people or Trump and I realized that that may be the same for the other side as well. The point is finding a common group and listening to each other. And loving each other despite our faults and issues.
101	3	Don't forget that Gillette is part of Proctor & Gamble so it's all their products that we need to boycott, permanently.  Just take the time to read the labels and if it's P&G, put it back. That's what I'll be doing.
821	2	Wow! Subliminal messages used to be subliminal! Now there just written out, But I like all the negative comments! Makes me think there are more awake then asleep!
838	1	Gotta give Emily credit here. In the vid she proper goes for it! The other girls are obviously doing their bit, but she's pretty much "f**k it, I'm going all in"
499	1	No one has the right to put their hands on anyone in anger. If Rock had known, he would not have made the joke. Smith’s first ever Oscar and it was lost on his stupid outburst. This should have been handled way better and never in violence. I’ve lost respect for Smith. He and Jada both have spoke openly about violence and it’s all been lost….
297	1	I can't even share this that's where we're at I love you my brothers and sisters but we are all brothers and sisters I love y'all how does the government make us where we can't share something like this
107	3	Thank God the Guardian is reporting on this. Finally, a completely unbiased mainstream media outlet with no history at all of endorsing crackpot feminist ideologies, a source we can trust, will bring us the raw, unvarnished truth without attempting to influence our opinion at all. Komment Macht Frei!
52	3	I will use the last of my Gillette blades then switch to another brand. 20 years I have been loyal. Idiots. Thanks for man hating your own customer base. Is there there an equivalent women or LGBT add, because white men are not then only ones who discriminate? Idiots.
751	1	Here's a thought what if she groped him or touched him uncomfortable would people be in uproar then? Only it can work both ways. Plus anyone one can say anything nowadays and it's trial by social media 🤔
799	1	I'm here after reading the news about Emily and now I see Robin slapping another girl's ass in the background.. 2:50 I do hope the foot slap at 3:51 was Emily's!
196	1	It doesn’t matter how many times I listen to this song it still brings tears to my eyes and I’m not even from America, or have even been! This is just human shit and it’s so fucking sad!
468	3	Will Smith needs to be pulled over by some Mean Racist White Cops and have unspeakable things done to him, in front of his wife... that should bring him back to mother earth alright!
264	2	I hate this song if you wanna make point than do it but don't sit there and say nigga when you white that ain't right I don't gotta problem with the point he is making I have a problem with the way he did it
322	1	Honestly, this isn't too bad as I remembered. YouTube isn't a niche platform anymore, so it's only natural you don't have time to watch or know 90% of the popular/upcoming creators. You can no longer have the same atmosphere of the first ones now that you have so many other groups to represent. Yeah, it feels corporate, but you can't really show so many different creators and genres in a "youtube video-like way".  19 million dislikes was too much.
364	3	2018 was terrible  2019 we didnt even try 2020 we didnt even make one  2021 we stopped making them forever and we removed dislikes to avoid embarrassment  2022: we are still trash
879	3	I thought that Rotacrotchy was just a great actress trying to act like she was too good for him, then I found out that he sexually assaulted her and that's why she looks she hates him, but she wants the money and the fame, so she is basically a hooker and he is a thief for stealing music.
449	3	Susie the CEO of YouTube she's making YouTube look like it's just a busted babies she's making this site look like a family friendly s*** happen to the old days the game with dislikes what b******* is that they're basically getting rid of freedom speech
448	2	YouTube rewind be like:                   2018: tried but failed                  2019: didn’t even try                  2020: didn’t even make one                  2021: cancelled YouTube rewind
608	1	People sure get their panties in a knot over anything.  It's a Fucking Pepsi commercial not an act of Terrorism! Damn. Just STFU then and have a coke and smile 😁
89	2	My comments and dislikes are being removed. Wake up people selective censorship is very real. The left owns all social media, "think for yourself and question." 😉
589	3	I HAVE ALOPECIA!  NO REASON FOR PHYSICAL ABUSE OVER A WEAK JOKE.  Will Smith is WEAK SAUCE in my book from here on picking on smaller dudes.  Do that to even smaller Kevin Hart -  see what you get?  KHART is badd!
295	1	We are all human being the only difference is skin color I don't believe that all these racist thing both white and black are the result of just the skin of a humans color.
635	1	And fuck the illuminati the elite making us poor, feeding us illnesses and making us hate one another just so they can get the powers to control us and tell us what we should do and cant do. Just remember folks, the elites 1% own over half the money that is in the world today and that wont change anytime soon unless we the people do something to change that. So power to tge motherfucking people and bring despair to the elites who don't give one fuck about the average Joe. Peace out niggas
423	2	YouTube, by removing the dislike button, you lost the only record you were holding!  🥇Most Disliked Video: YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind - Dislikes: 20M  You now don’t hold any records so you lost the one record you ever held by removing the dislike button!!!
306	2	The funny thing is, looking back at this rewind. There were actually lot of things that I enjoyed about this rewind. But, it was all the incredibly cringy and political stuff that made me hate it.    Also, that pewdiepie, Mr. Beast, and many other content creators that were important that year didn’t make it in.
20	1	I actually agree, we all need to hold ourselves to better standards ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) If you know what I mean. Something along the lines of law and order, and cold hard facts over pain and sentiment.
439	3	Jesus why you shoving diversity down our throats I mean your favoring everyone that’s not a straight white male. I mean sure that’s great to show diversity but your over doing it to the point that it becomes what I like to call corporate diversity where you shove your diversity agenda down every one’s throat
739	1	To those who don't understand what's wrong with this video, what's wrong with it is that it trivializes black lives matter and police brutality. It makes light of serious issues. As if these problems could be solved by giving a police officer a can of Pepsi lmao please. It was tone deaf and inappropriate
611	1	A standard can of pepsi contains the equivalent of 15 spoons of sugar.  The zero cal version contains extremely high levels of aspartame which has been linked to a range of health problems.  No version of Pepsi is in any way shape nor form good for you.  There is even a solid argument that Pepsi is worse for your health than smoking.  Oh and this advert is offensive.
5	1	I am crying in gratitude. Thank you for this necessary ad. Keep going. With a do many dislikes you know you’re striking a chord. Men can do better. Thank you for asking them to step up.
68	1	It might have been a well intended message when they were mooting this around in the boardroom, but its delivery is clumsily put.  Not a great moment for disposable razors.
131	3	Wow negative advertising working at its finest. And Gillette couldn't give 2 shits about the argument..... only that there is one. Gillette taking a page from Howard Sterns Love'em or Hate'em shtick! Gillette wins here not Feminism or toxic masculinity whatever! dummies.
293	1	If we can be under one accord, under 1 god & a universal set of laws that governs us as humble beings we wouldn't need organizations like BLM (blowing lots of money) to fool into having more hope than faith. The spiritual side of it is the world is ran by evil we must overcome.
216	1	The first part of this song sounds like he trynna  downgrade all black people , and the second half is doing the same thing with whites , this happens with anyone and anyone racism is only a word because “Human kind” made it that ,this is a money making industry he knew if he said “ni***” a thousands times people would wanna tap in and view
83	1	i remember when this was released it got so much hate by men, and still is, but i’m so thankful for Gillette. most companys “feminism” is cringe and useless but Gillette was one of the few to do it right.
384	1	Genuinely hope there's a rewind 2021. Regardless of how much hate these ALWAYS got for being very corporate and everything nobody wanted, but it was always something to look forward to hating. Humanity needs a villain, and youtube rewind was a reliable way for us to band together, despite our differences in opinions, and just hate something together. It was beautiful 🥲
490	1	That was wrong of Smith. I’m betting if someone like 50cents or any other tough dude made that joke he would have thought twice about it . Jada would be visiting his ass in the hospital
595	3	Hasn’t Will Smith made a joke  of poor taste? Chris Rock is a comedian, to roast someone in a comedy way is just for entertainment. The entire Smith family should hire “ top notch” mental health specialist. A “red table talk” is a joke at this point. As of Sunday, Will Smith is a punk and bully!  There’s enough violence going on in the world.
160	2	what i hate about this video is the forced stereo type, the actor done a good  (the white dude) job but to make a real impact they should have hired a kaki wearing semi 6 out of 10 non american so in the end we learn nothing
40	2	Agenda 21...in order to create gender equality you need to prop up the female gender and push down the male gender. Only 12 years left for the 2030 goal, this will only get worse
443	3	"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened to Youtube"
687	2	I don't think this is offensive but it does play on the stupidity of the millennial generation. The only thing bold about Pepsi is the health risks you take drinking it.
158	1	I have loved this for 2 years I'm from Scotland but the systematic racism in the US is really hard to watch Esp when you see a cult leader like trump make it worse When. Will the US realise that people are people  We all feel the same  A disgusting country So glad I wasn't but there Scotland the brave
629	2	i don't get it, i herd this was some sort of commercial that people didn't like but i doesn't feel like a commercial, all i see are hipsters and a few token minorities walking down the street drinking pepsi every now and then. what is the message? i don't think the message is to drink pepsi because after watching this i don't feel like drinking pepsi, i just feel confused.
826	1	Ain’t it time they put the royalties of this song in the hands of charities helping rape/sexual assault victims? Especially after what just recently came out about what happened on the set of this video…  just an idea.
110	3	Still seeing the dislikes go down and the likes go up. This isn’t helping you Gillette, it’s making you even more pathetic than before.  WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU’RE DOING!!!
924	2	The fact the dislikes have been removed really shows how pathetic these big corporations like YouTube are.   Its essentially like Amazon removing the reviews from the products they sell.   I judge a lot of my content I choose to watch via the like to dislike ratio. Now I am unable to do that and instead are being forced to watch content I do not want to watch. Shambles, corrupt and disgusting.
154	1	Its so hard being on my shoes when people ask me what I think about this... I came from Puerto Rico having to trap on the side to make it through the day.. no job offers no money coming and government help didn't do shit when you have 7 people on a two bedroom house... Came to the US and been working since 18 12 hours 7 days a week.. making 6 digits a year paying high taxes... I completely understand both sides of the story but we're fighting the wrong opponent
381	2	Hello from the future, in the year 2052 an outbreak of ultracovid 51 has forced youtube to replace the dislike button as ultracovid is a meme disease spread by unwittingly watching bad videos....but due to people developing a lust for awful clip videos linked to mega covid 49 this video now has pure positive responses.
703	2	I'm an adopted, disabled, transgender, lesbian, mexican black woman that sometimes identifies as half native american and half korean but I'm still not offended by this.
221	1	🙌🏾👏🏽👏🏽 This powerful classic is a definition of how not to let our differences divide us & make us hostile to one another. We can live harmoniously in this world if we choose listening & understanding, over hostility & war.
327	2	222 million views and 3 million likes!? This video must clearly be awesome and loved by the community since I have no way of viewing negative feedback unless I scroll through the comments. Wonder when you guys will fix that issue too
341	2	Youtube: we can't have youtube rewind 2018 to hit 20M dislikes remove dislikes! Community: creates an browser extension to allow you to see dislikes again thus allowing us to see 20M dislikes
523	1	I can't stand jade she's famous for what? Exactly absolutely nothing.  Chris is a comedian and takes the piss for a living. Will Smith I have lost all respect for him and will never look at him the same way again.
415	3	I don't know why but this video is so much irritating .... Meaning less.. Bad script and dialogue... I just hate this video.. This is the reason people are disliking this video.. C'mon YouTube you can do better 🙄.
298	1	*6 Words : FUCK RASCISM and Fuck Rascist people 🖕 - It doesn't matter if your white, black, or even blue, were all human and need to start acting more like it SMFH*
349	3	Hiding the dislikes? 👎 Take that beech.What you gonna do about it?Remove the comments?Since you hate dislikes so much here's more for you- 👎👎👎👎 Cry about it idc.
205	1	Joyner Lucas is a "story-teller" rapper. This song is iconic for the times when it came out. If you can't understand the Objective view he is trying to show , for each side, than umm yeah try a little harder and maybe you will understand that himself as a rapper is ridiculousy underrated.
16	2	I Will never BUY Any Gillette product again! I swear , as a principle from watching this add. I know many, many more thousand of man will think and feel the same . Now, how silly of you (Gillette) to get involved in social engineering, manipulation of gender politics. You people jumped the gun and will reap the benefits. So long suckers... Enjoy the ride of REALITY! !!!!
336	2	19M dislikes. That’s as far as we could go before we were defeated. We must win this war. Brothers. Rally to the cause of defeating YT and bringing back dislikes now
272	1	This video moves me on so many levels. As a young white man, I hope that black and white will fully integrate one day. Even though we may disagree on some things doesn’t mean we can’t love and respect each other.
116	2	Goodbye Gillette, will never buy another product from you or your parent company as long as I live, don't need your preaching or your pandering to the me too "progressive" bandwagon.
532	2	Will Smith wants Chris Rock to keep his wife's name out of his @*&%! mouth.  But that isn't the problem.  The problem is Will Smith's wife can't keep other men out of her mouth.
540	2	Will Smith is in the wrong --- I hope his son will take down his post as if they are proud that Will smith protected and defend Jada whatever- he is not right out there and he should apologize to Chris Rock in person.
359	1	Like the other people in comments, Let's take a moment of silence for this video. It has 19mil dislikes and holds the record for most disliked video and now the dislikes are getting removed.
412	1	i know the rewind was bad but its nothing to fuss about. ive seen some comments saying youtube is the worst platform to ever exist but i think yall needa chill even if the rewind was garbage
326	2	Youtube: Everyone controls rewind  Youtubers: what about us?  Youtube:    ;-; not you  Random actors that prob want nothing to do with this: he-  Youtube: yoink
881	2	If it was so traumatic why is Emily just now speaking up?  I'm a women and we need to speak up when it happens, not years later. She might have saved someone else the trauma of being around RT.
505	1	Everyone’s so sensitive nowadays. Imagine not being able to take a joke like that. Pathetic. You’re a celebrity yet you expect not to face any criticism or unpleasant comments regarding you and your wife. Also it wasn’t even that bad of a remark. Will smith is a clown!
571	1	Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
808	2	Did not read Emily’s book but she is 🔥 in this video.   Probably a pretty toxic set with what the song is about and TI and Thicke are  weird anyway.  Too bad people can’t be professional. Pharrell makes 🔥 music always
282	1	You guys dont want change. We as hispanics, we dont want to see people hurting others but we also dont want to see others allowing people to hurt them. You guys just dont want change.
617	1	To be fair I believe its a publicity stunt. Pepsi pay huge money to advertising agencies for ideas to create attention with focus groups and then television guide lines to pass. This 'controversial' advert was most likely thought out and orchestrated and has now went global hugely pushing the brand and in turn Kendall more. Its intelligent marketing. Gold Star
872	1	At 2:18 when he blows the smoke into the model’s face - her reaction is comical.  So Emily, did you really listen to the lyrics of this song before you agreed to do it? Complaining AFTER cashing the check and fame. On top of that y’all knew TI is into sex trafficking and y’all still showed up for this, NAKED with moneys on the floor is a strip joint platform.
166	1	I know this is about the conflict between us black and white people but I can’t help but also think about every other race and how every race has had at least some type of racial conflict with another race none of us understand each other because we haven’t experienced and wore each other’s shoes and until we listen to each other and understand them racist conflict will always exist
37	2	Once again they prove only straight white men are capable of being held accountable for their behavior & actions............the rest of the world gets excuses and a free pass to act however they like.
151	1	3 years later i really wanna start a thread of replies under this comment to see what people think the message of this song/video is. Or what this song/video means to you. Please can we start a thread becayse i think every single person can have a different interpretation of what is going on in this.
410	2	Removing the 19 million dislikes and keeping the 3 million likes is like a used car salesman telling you 3 positive things about a car but never mentioning it was in 9 previous accidents.
19	1	How can so many people don't understand this video? This video is addressed to men that are against bullying, harassing women etc. but don't act if they see other men do these things. If you act to prevent these things this video basically says that you are a hero. This video says that most men are already against this behaviour, but don't act to prevent.
233	1	When he said "Trying to find a job but nobody call me back yet" that hit hard for me. I'm constantly applying for jobs and calling them but they always give me an answer like "our spots are taken" or "try applying again another time". And then that makes my family think I'm not trying. Like I legit am but these corporations are the ones not putting in effort. And then because I'm not getting hired I got no choice but to sign up for stuff like EBT and other public assistance
22	2	As a white male with no Special groups willing to stand up for me ( can't ever accuse someone for treating me bad because im a man or discriminating against me because im White this ad kind of puts the nail in the coffin for me Makes me feel like Suicide is really the only way out. Can't some commercial make men feel good about themselves ? Or must we all assume because we are men we just just doomed.
446	3	It's crazy how 19.5 million individuals woke up and thought "You know, maybe we were too harsh..." and removed their dislikes. All independently! Bravo youtube.
887	2	Everything about this is creepy... The lyrics, the video, the way the guys are behaving in the video... The presence of TI after learning how he does pop up virginity checks on his daughter while participating in things like this!  What the fuck ...
536	1	An educated guess! Smiths wife has alopecia areata. Alopecia simply means balding. Areata is usually characterised by perfectly smooth bald spots that come and go anywhere on the head. It is an autoimmune problem nearly always brought on by stress. So if it’s his career that causes her ongoing stress? I doubt she’ll stress much longer because I’d recon it’s all over big rover for him. And what’s the go with the big boy 😭 what a twatt
263	1	Well im white. Dont ever expect to understand how it feels to be black it's just impossible.  Also impossible for me to understand how white people or ANY PEOPLE could have so much hate and judgment in themselves.  I dont know either side.
113	3	Wow!!  What a staggering attack on the male population of shavers. I presume in these days of equality they will be doing an equally insulting Venus razor advert showing girls and women hair pulling and fighting and bullying too..after all.. bullying is not gender specific.
268	1	I can’t tell if this is pro democrat or pro republican, but the point still stands; there is a disconnect between the races forged by unknown causes. We all just need to have more understanding and forgiveness for one another. May God guide us toward a path of peace
195	1	I look mainly white yet mixed and growing up I saw both sides. I use to always get in trouble and blamed for being raised in the hood, but when I got older, I saw police treat me nicer since I look fully white. It’s really fucked up how the system works. There is no “law” to keep people of color under, but the culture does.
435	3	I just came back to rewatch this video for whatever reason and I had to replay some parts over 10 times because I couldn’t believe how cringe some of this stuff is
355	1	All of these 6 yos thinking that yt removed dislikes to make THIS video dont look stupid lol Rethink your life, they are doing this to stop the haters for good.
399	2	OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH. YOUTUBE, HOW DARE YOU MAKE A TERRIBLE REWIND AND REMOVE DISLIKES. THAT'S IT. YOU ARE GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED FOR 988954234534524253463454645242534452354645732423436456345634535 CENTURIES. GO TO YOUR FREAKING ROOM NOW.
323	2	Good news everyone! Not only has the dislike amount been hidden rather than completely removed, but the dislikes on this video has increased and has now hit 20M!
25	2	The problem with the ad is who is this targeting? The answer is that they're targeting all men. The problem is that immediately it basically tells you that you need to rethink the way that you are as if you personally are to blame for what other men do.
118	3	Man-shaming at its best...Why don't we grow up, stop playing the helpless Victim role, and start playing the Victor role. Take charge of you're life and stop whining about natural human behavior that has existed since the beginning of the human race. Women have more authority and get more options in everyday life than men do, simple fact.
489	2	I still want to believe this  as a scripted act. I had a lot of respect for him. But it seems that he is just an ordinary human being with brilliant acting skills.
516	1	I do not approve violence, but I also do not like “pejorative humor” that makes a lot of people laugh at the expense of another person, let alone if the joke is about a health condition. In 99% of the cases, if not all, the person target of a pejorative joke does not like it at all even if he/she shows a polite smile. Moreover I read that this is the SECOND time that Chris Rock makes a “joke” to Will’s wife during an Oscar ceremony.
333	3	YouTube is such a weakling. Y’all still mad about this rewind? I can’t even call them a (cat) or else the staff will get on the floor and cry and I get banned. I miss old YouTube
469	3	Imagine your family watching you getting slapped in your face by a  tough guy in front of the whole world. Will just lost so many people's respect including mine. I'll never watch his movies any more .
305	2	"here's to the people who put aside their differences" and then in the same breath "here's to all *women*" "here's to all *asians*" sounds like you actually want to emphasize those differences.
283	1	I still cry every time I listen to this, first time I heard this I couldn’t agree more with what’s going on in our current world, this will hopefully give people motivation to change future generations. Thanks Joyner and god bless.
762	2	Seriously. It's hilarious the amount of people who don't pay attention to what the songs are actually saying. Like "you're beautiful, its true" song that plays and weddings and dances, it's a about a stalker.
831	3	Emily/ She has got all the publicity she needed or wanted earlier, so why playing victim cards now. it's all because you chose nudity then and and now. DF generation
583	3	Needs to be his last academy award too...& that one should be revoked...if they don't take back that award, that's a clear message that they absolutely DO endorse, condone & support violence during their program...he should never be allowed back...inexcusable...props to Chris Rock for being more of a man than Will Smith...
165	1	I am 63 and I do not ordinarily listen to rap or hip hop or whatever this was, but I liked it.  Dialogue, it's all about the dialogue.  If the politicians would just stay out of the way I think we could all be what Martin Luther King wanted us to be.  He had a dream, why don't we make it a reality?
173	1	There’s so much shit that’s so accurate about this but there’s also a lot of shit that ain’t accurate at all. Like it’s back and forth he say 1 thing that makes perfect sense but the next line make no sense at all.
73	1	Although I think this commercial is like something out of South Park, if not for the whole "OUTRAGE!!!" I would not think twice about it. At this point both sides are as easily offended it seems.

670	1	damn by the way the media was blowing this, shit up I thought this Kardashian trash pile was going to shoot the cop, kick a baby,  then set fire to the flag and put it out by poring a Pepsi on it.
192	1	Funny how everyone claims this song for theier side D: event hoi both sides are just 50% right.. both side talk bullshit and some truth.. It represents the real world so perfectly..
114	3	Ahhhh, so THAT's why my Gilette stock plummeted 23 percent in two days! Well, time to dump that stock. It's worthless, now! (Leftists don't shave so they won't be buying Gillette Razors and women use other brands for their bodies.)
652	1	soooooo.... what's wrong with this commercial of Pepsi ? why is so many people upset for ? Get a fuckin life please you stupid idiots it's just a commercial. lmao
259	1	I wanna love you Joyner...but the comment to lil nas kills me there is nothing wrong with a metaphor about gayness. People tell gay children they will go to hell but you don’t care about those children...
291	1	We as the overwhelming majority of the people of this earth must come together and realize that all this divide and hate between us has been caused by the elite and those at the very very top. They want nothing but to dominate us and the easiest way to do that is to divide us. As much as I hate to say it, they appear to be winning. However, that doesn't mean we cant make a comeback and unify and create a future that will serve in OUR interests, not theirs. All I can do is pray for that😔.
15	1	Everybody who has a problem with this commercial is guilty of everything they think they're being accused of. Not even gonna f***ing argue about it. I think the message is great 👍🏽
467	2	I think the Will Smith Chris Rock slap even is TOTALLY FAKE! Watch it again... it's totally a stunt! I think it was for ratings... Totally fake the entire thing... If he really hit him, his lip would swell... also Will knows how to box, that slap was weak. totally fake!
18	3	Aint no such thing as toxic masculinity. Men should fight, men should be dominant, men should work hard, men shouldnt show emotion. Its the way of the world and its what built humanity.
87	3	Gillete has fallen to Feminism...but there's one that still holds value,thats called Dollar shave club,Thanks for being there in a moment of darkness in society.
