261	1	Never fails to make my day... I'm an aspiring artist and last year I had a racist boss... Im sure he was always after me... But I was fired before I got to ask why he hated me so much... 2 sides to every story...
775	2	Just the title of the song...makes me think of "gray rape", a term in which consent is unclear and funnily enough the siutation in which those girls were in for the video
155	2	So many overly PC uptight SJWs missed the point of this when it came out. Joyner is representing both sides here, and he doesn’t hold back or pull any punches. I wish more people understood the point he was trying to make here
79	3	Well Today I bought Edge shaving gel , Irish spring body wash , Right Guard antiperspirant , BIC razors and I checked that they are not from Procter and Gamble , Make sure you all check the product to NOT be from Procter and Gamble before you buy ,read carefully , only buy from brands that don't discriminate against gender . Don't buy from a company that insults you as Toxic when you have never been toxic.Ok
494	3	So Denzel Washington is saying it's ok to assault someone just cos you got triggered! It's a lot of emotions??? Sure I'll just use it to hit someone and say it's a lot of emotions!
308	1	Everyone: “This video has over 19 million dislikes”  Me: “It probably has 100 million dislikes since it’s been removed from everyone who was pissed it got removed”
278	1	I'm not racist  case I know everyone is equal  that's what some people still don't  want to understand  maby if people pay attention to the main parts of this song maby just maby something  in this world will change.🙄
563	2	no wonder he didn't make a penny out of his last man in black movie because he thinks his life is like a movie and he is so important and has to take everything seriously
289	1	I ain't saying yoo-toobs is r-r-r-r-r-r-r-racist but ever since feb 1 and their beginning of black history celebrations i've been getting quite a few planet of the ape movies in my rotation or algorithm. Anybody else have that ish pop up on them?
481	1	This a travesty for the Oscars.  Will Smith had a real chip on his shoulder (egged on by Jada?).  Jada has voiced many unpopular opinions and should be able to take a joke.  This is a show of elite power and privilege even in Hollywood.
75	3	Nice manipulation of the likes and dislikes and censoring of comments Gillette, be a man and stand up for your self and own your mistakes.... Oh wait,  better ask your wives boyfriend for permission first, so that you don't trigger someone that might be offended buy you taking all the hate it like a man
144	2	Hey Gillette, I've been buying your products for 13 years. Today I just subscribed to the Dollar Shave Club for the foreseeable future. Singling out your target market is asinine.
115	3	Well done Gillette. You have totally solved "Toxic Masculinity" with a single ad without offending innocent men. For your next effort can you also tackle "Toxic Femininity".
210	1	We should all sit down, have a conversation with our enemies and try to hear the other half of the story that you didn’t know. That’s how we will solve the problems that we have in our society.
229	1	I get the point of the song even though it's 3 years old but I'm just gonna point out as a 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇺🇸Italian American when blacks particularly rappers wanna say white people "steal" black culture we laugh cause black rappers literally stole their "gangster" style from the Italian mafia which is hilarious cause old school Italians weren't known for their fondness of black people
321	3	Guys I had a dream where YouTube realised their mistake and immediately reverted their change I seriously thought it was real 😂😂😅But then I woke up and found out they didn't
677	1	I don't get the hype I don't what's wrong with this ...... it's like being in the 90's again .... and people have done the same thing in real life .... instead of Pepsi it being water ........ man people need to stfu...... whinning little babies over sensitive or what
129	1	Thank you, Gillette, for telling the truth and daring to challenge men to change.  The dislikes of this great video only prove how difficult it will be to change the world and make it a better place in spite of these so-called "manly" men who do not want any change.  Keep up the good work and continue to fight the good fight.  I applaud your efforts.
408	1	To be honest I just can't see the problem with the video though I mean the only thing that's missing is Minecraft other than that is really just a good video I'm suff cuz it seems like YouTube tried their best but still that many dislikes that's just sad they even did the credits to the people too I still can't see the problem with the video
937	1	Dislike. Wont lie the song isn't that bad. I hated on it in elementary school cause of the trend. I'm 24 now and like it, but I have to follow tradition and continue disliking it haha. It's like I like it, but my official status is dislike just cause it's tradition. And now we have to say dislike cause YouTube removed the dislikes 🙄
353	2	i find funny how YouTube removed some of the most disliked videos out of their own platform to protect the creators but they even bothered to remove this one lol, we hittin 20M soon bois
437	2	Boys and girls, it has hit 20M Dislikes.. I know yall cant see it but i have an extension that lets me see it... IT HIT 20M BIG MOMENT IN HISTORY RIGHT HERE YALL
502	3	You can tell that neither one of these boys were raised in the hood. Chris Rock just stands there and let the man smack him in the face without even trying to avoid it.....Yeah, Wow! Meanwhile, you have the sissy Will Smith confidently sucker smacking Chris just knowing the boy wouldn't fight back. To top it off Smith get an oscar for a movie that looks like it was made for Lifetime TV. That was the biggest joke of the night.
835	3	She says he "groped" her... and it's like your damn naked in the music video!!! And your rubbing against him in the bed!!! She just need money for a drug habit. And she trying to sell that book hard!
510	1	I'm sorry she is to toxic for him. That man was laughing she wasn't he had to defend her before he had to hear that from her just like her cheating was his fault. And I'm sorry she do like who Chris was talking about and him and Chris are both comedians they make money talking about ppl so I will say it again will leave her she is killing u. And FYI Chris took it professional I give Chris the award not will
479	2	Only in Hollyweird can someone win an award and talk about love within an hour of slapping and cussing someone in front of audience.   It must be a privilege to be black and rich because my white ass would have been kicked out of a venue for doing something like that.
26	1	JUst asking , how is this bad? I mean, gillette just started a campaign to stop other men you see from doing bad things. They're not saying that all men do this....
171	1	Guys check out Tom MacDonald. If you like this guy you will appreciate Toms music. In my opinion Tom Macdonald is better but i appreciate the message this guy sends.
587	1	You know it's messed up ET and all you other channels and stations where's the stuff Hunter Biden. I've heard more about this Bull 💩 to memorize it. Only a half a day and way bigger than Chris Rock getting smacked. Know why you're not covering it it's cuz you're some punk ass liberals.
861	2	You wanna be in a super sexual music video and cry about how you were touched inappropriately lmaoooo. Either don’t be in sexual video where all they do is touch each other weirdly or don’t cry about it for clout years later.
465	1	ok so she rolled her eyes an will gets up to assault another actor/comedian. Now, who knew she had this disease?? surely not that many people until the Oscar assault on live tv. but will should have handled that a better more professional way. Stop blaming irrational behavior on love. We know you are better than this or at lease we expected you are. Chris owes Jada an apology and Will owes chris an apology also. Will Smith  needs to be the man we know he is an not by the use of his hands.
228	1	Everyone claiming to understand the song, but yet turn around and argue with someone who’s coming from a different perspective, claiming you understand is just dividing us more 🧑🏽‍🦯
76	3	They want to neuter and sedate the next generation of men, there is nothing wrong with those kids wrestling. Wrestling is a sport that has been participated in since we were cavemen, we see animals play fight too. The masculine energy which coalesces in aggression, ambition, conviction, and risk taking is what turns the cogs of history
772	3	This woman writes a book about being fondled by one of the artists as a “video vixen” yet she agreed to be in the video without a bra on with men?? What did you expect would happen??
325	3	ok, we all know youtube removed dislike number count because the CEO was mad by the fact that the video with most dislike is made by the own youtube.   Amazing job youtube, you stupid.
316	1	Wow! 3 million likes! This must be a really good video with a very high public opinion! They really must’ve made a hilarious and relatable video to do that well!
121	1	To all the guys saying this ad is saying you're bad people. No, it's showing you the toxic behaviours you may have, and showing you how to be better. All this ad is Doing is telling you not to bully, not to encourage typically masculine behaviours in your kids and not to inappropriately touch a woman without her permission. If you don't do any of those things, you're not under any fire. If you do these things, you can change. It's not hard.
345	1	The things that makes this rewind bad is that it doesn’t really rewind on the year they need the most popular creators of that year being showcased and it’s very cringy if they ever do another rewind it should be like mrbeasts  edit:The end of the rewind was farely decent
100	3	I would rather shave myself with a rusty windscreen wiper than use your brand ever again.  Pandering to the masses and your guilty until proven innocent mentality is disgusting.  The good men (who are the majority for the record) will not stand for this
220	1	Notice how all the new comments are disagreeing with this song. Just shows how brainwashed and influenced people can get from social media. It’s almost as if someone disagreed with this song and brought along their sheeps.
315	2	From Wikipedia YouTube rewind 2018 had 19.90 millions dislikes which makes 86.65%  It became the most disliked video on YouTube in 6 days 10 hours. First and fastest video to hit ten million dislikes.  Milestones include: 1 million in 9 hours 1.4 million after 12 hours 2.4 million after 24 hours 4.6 million after 48 hours 5 million in 2 days 5 hours 10 million in 6 days 12 hours 15 million in 24 days  Like this and don’t let them forget this
62	3	On top of stereotyping all men as misogynist pos this ad is also pretty much racist towards white male Did you notice the skin colour of the men/boys doing all the negative things, and the skin colour of the men/boys who are "saying the right thing, acting the right way" (starting at 48 seconds onward)
348	2	Why is youtube censoring regular content and channels in 2022. Opinions are not one sided and trying to cause division will not help youtube. Stop this nonsense
854	2	Crazy how ppl get away with ripping artists off. And makr songs about rape basically . secondly, I know Allen thicke more than I know robin thicke.. Thirdly, T.I is worse at dancing than he is rapping..and that's tough to do
136	1	My son, who is 13, and is about to start shaving. His dad just bought him another brand of shavers, not knowing about this ad and its controversy. My son just asked, after watching this ad, "Why can't I get these shavers?"  He is going to the market to get Gillette shavers (@Gillette) now.
542	1	Slap in the face for GI Jane??? Tough fighting honest marine character! If people sitting at the awards like Will Smith Rickey Gervais would no longer live he would have been shot dead.
288	1	It’s insane to see how moving this is. It’s doesn’t give anyone shit. Shows people don’t know the others life and gives two perspectives that are unique. This Rapper done so well
117	2	Gillette WHY its been 4 days now and my pubic hair is out of control. Might just have to poke my nob inside me and then i might be able to use your products again
594	1	Smith is an animal that should be locked in a cage in the county jail.  He is a disgrace to all men of color, and all Americans, portraying every wrongful stereotype about men of color to the entire world.  The impudence of this jacksss to do this at the Oscars and the impotence of the Oscars not to eject him from the theatre.  Chris Rock is a class act and good things will follow as he ''let the show go on''. Even though it was just the Oscars, that no one watches, and everyone hates.
570	1	One thing's for sure, I will not be going to the movies to see any more of Will Smith's movies. Will Smith is a complete embarrassment to all of America! The award he received needs to be snatched.
555	1	This guy (Will) should be banned from any Ceremony! I always knew he is gonna freak out on sb! He is emotionally damaged and can’t control himself, apart from the fact that he has no manners!
438	3	Hey YouTube why the dislike button was our only form of natural selection to keep horrible creators away from a platform that is already bad enough amazing channels are getting strikes and demonetized every day a lot of them being innocent we want Joji back YouTube has truly become their own enemy
335	3	Youtube was probably embarrassed to have the most disliked video of all youtube history, ig that's why they removed the dislike counter.  W to all those people that disliked this video tho
385	2	Youtube y'all was just mad that's the only reason y'all took the dislikes away 💀 what's the point of even having it there then if all you're gonna show is the likes. It looks stupid...
123	3	Hey Gillette,  do you get that this won't blow over and you have to do damage control.  Nope because your too stupid and your share holders are beyond pissed off.  To the CEO who said "It was worth losing 8 billion dollars"  yeah tell that to your share holders.  I predict Gillette bows out of the shaving business and they just tell a lie as why a whole company and brand got failed by a few bad decision and why it is the "MAN" fault
380	2	Youtube if you are reading this please bring back the dislike button. The creators can literally see the number of dislikes so there is no point in removing it, everyone wants it back and it was a bad decision to remove it.
444	2	omg there are 3 million likes and 0 dislikes!! the vidoe may be good but i don't know at all sine there are no dislikes!!!!!!   yea no youtube has made theirselves a lot cringe
431	1	This video is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten for how much people loved it and have come back to love it more!!!...hoping for this to reach it's destiny soon*
147	1	So is it just cool to hop on hate trains now? Honestly don’t see anything that should offend a man here. If you’re not the one bullying or sexually harassing women why should you be offended of this video? If you know you’re a good man then do not let small things get to you like this. Be a man, not a boy.
862	2	Everyone coming back to watch the video in detail 🤣 tbh irritating me all these people speaking up years & years later. You could of then! Ruining people's lives years later when might be completely untrue.
320	2	imagine removing dislikes just because you own the company and don't want your videos to have to dislikes and as an excuse you say : "we dont want any harassment !1!1!1" so cringe
339	1	Today is a great day guys, the new version of the Youtube Vanced app has incorporated the dislike count ! Also great to see that we still kept pushing that button, there are currently > 20 M dislikes 🏆
491	1	If will hadn't pulled that stunt, someone like me would have probably laughed at the joke and move on but his actions prompted me to dig deep about the situation with his wife
180	1	the true meaning of this song is suppose to reflect "both sides" but the truth is different people have different viewpoints on this sort of thing doesn't matter if your labral or conservative there is usually never 1 person or group of group of people you can fully relate to so good for the 4 people whos viewpoints align exactly with one of the people in this video but it won't be this easy when it comes to the whole country.
4	1	The saddest thing I saw relating to this was a woman who responded saying that 'the biggest killer of men under 35 is suicide, so men should be encouraged to open up about their feelings more, so well done Gillette!' In reality, suicidal thoughts are often tied in with feelings of worthlessness, guilt for things that aren't your fault, self-hatred, and a belief that the world would be a better place without you in it. All feelings that this ad has so thoughtfully encouraged.
671	3	People caused so much controversy because of giving a cop a soda? So basically people are upset for trying to unify a cop and a riot. Being nice to police is a sin that they hated on this so much and made these actors apologize for showing themselves being nice to a fucking cop. What’s wrong with people.
255	1	Just listened to this song for the first time. @JoynerLucas, you wanna get a virtual drink or some shit? I have 3 serious questions, and I think you'd be a great outlet for the answers I need.
486	3	Last time Will Smith slapped someone and it was caught on camera he exclaimed with a laugh "He's lucky I didn't sucker punch him!" Chris Rock should have been warned, lol! Smith hits whoever he wants. But he's a star so I guess he's above the law.  What a sad example he has become for all the young men who will now see this since it's gone viral.
1	1	Men in the comment section be like: ”Oh no! They are addressing me for the things that I do and I know that I shouldn’t be doing, like sexual harrassing and bullying! They are so making me feel like a bad person for all these bad things that I do!!!! I am so triggered! They are hurting my masculinity and ego!! 😭😭”
743	3	All she did was give that fucking police man a van of Pepsi during a protest or something, it's not that bad, and the worst part is, Kendall is getting all the blame and I don't think that's fair
566	1	I finally saw the whole thing... Some say its the oscars & what will did, was wrong because it was the oscars... Ok But  defending his wife after someone clearly hurt her feelings + almost like bullying because she does have alopecia. ( my bf would have done same) Chris should not have been that mean, too me wasn't even funny... I would have been embarrassed..
204	2	this is not the serve y’all think it is. how y’all hugging at the end when he got a make america great again hat and basically spit in your face yelling alm & saying slurs uhhhhh
270	1	Soon you'll be denied work, food and even medical care based on the color of your skin and not the color of your character. Then America will fall and Socialist and Islamist will fight over our land. At least this calling everything racist and blaming covid for everything will stop and mental illness (LBGQ) will be a thing of the past. Enjoy being a prisoner sheeple.
362	2	Here is a Dislike Button For: -For This Horrible Video -For This Stupid Change -For The Worst CEO Ever -For Brands -For Politics  -For YouTube’s Own Channels -For All of The Horrible People Who Run YouTube -For All Of the Company -For Made For Kids Change (2020) -For 2019 Rewind -For YouTube Rewind Being Canceled  (You Get The Point!🤣)
511	3	will smith should go to jail and he's a bad father for letting his kid to tweet " and that's how we do it" way to go will, your kids are just as bad as you!! the rich and privileged! Despicable!!
425	2	Hey this video has the most dislikes on YouTube. Betas felt embarrassed and removed them from the platform I'm sure I'll be able to tell what videos are good and bad now.
376	2	give us the dislike button back! we know what the "targeted dislike attacks" your talking about are! if a video gets this volume of dislikes it probably deserves it..
109	3	This ad portrays that most guys are like this. Which is definitely not true. Yes there are some men that act this way but most of them definitely don’t. This ad is stupid and Gillette should go out of business
817	2	If I was Paula Patton I woulda divorced this man (Robin Thicke) WAY before ANY drama surfaced about him. ONE watch of this video is enough to make most people divorce their significant other.
275	1	All i can think about is the lyric about donald trump starting a war and only thing that happened out of that conflict with North korea was trump going over there and paying them a visit . meanwhile you buffoons' chose biden and now we might be in  world war 3 . thanks to all you nitwits and idiots who thought trump was bad . No ! Democrats and biden is bad. he is the weakest leader weve ever had. lets go brandon .
64	2	I agree that some of the behaviors depicted were inappropriate, but I take umbrage at the suggestion that these were the behaviors of the majority of men, and that this was typical male behavior. I have bought my last razor from Gillette.
829	1	First time ive watched this mess completey. Did they really write RB has a BD in balloons on the wall? Oh robin if You got a BD you dont hire an intern to blow up balloons about it
605	2	It's just a dumb commercial.  No controversy needed,  the commercial just sucks.  Pepsi  has a history of awful commercials.  Just ask Don Johnson and (RIP) Glenn Frey.
181	1	Unfortunately this perspective will never happen until Gods Kingdom Comes. We are living under the dominion of an invisible living creature named Satan,  who hates mankind simply because God loves us. Not until Satan is no more will there ever be peace on earth.
457	1	I just wonder how would people feel if Jada got up there and slapped the host. Would people be talking about her being strong and standing up for her family or would she be deemed crazy and violent?
400	2	What youtube says: "No more dislikes becuase you abusing it" What youtube actually thinks: "No more dislikes becuase we don't know how to take criticism even though being critisized means you improve"
331	3	The only reason hey removed dislikes is because of this…thing YouTube was like “ok let’s lie and say we are protecting small creators but we are actually just mad at people for disliking our video”
354	2	I shall miss the Godfather of YouTube dislikes (19 million), although a good meme it also showed how little they started to care about its users over the years and how out of touch they became to be. Rest in peace YouTube dislikes.
50	1	To the men that answer a call to stop hate with hate, I cry for you, and for who you will put out into this world. you were the ones who threatened me, who hated me, who spat on me, who called me slurs from your cars, who told me I would never do anything. You were the ones that laid yourself in the hearts of strong women and weakened them with lies and deceit. you are the real enemy. no one has told you to stop being a man, we are only asking that you learn to be a better one.
492	1	What time was it or how far into the Oscar did Will hit Chris?  I am thinking they did it at the beginning so it would go viral and people would tune in for ratings, this whole thing was scripted by Will, Chris, and the Academy,  camera angles like the movies and actually, Chris put his hands behind his back and put his face forward. Ratings were low so they found a way to shock and awe people, drama queens.
149	1	I've been a gentle men all my life . I am not married because the women  already were living with jerks. You cannot get a date. They would even tell me they were jerks.
99	3	Just re-discovered the fun of shaving now , using a single blade safety razor. As far as I can tell, the Chinese manufacturer has no intention to lecture me and has no connection to Gillette. Also, the end result is actually a smoother shave, probably the angle of the blade, zero clogging and shorter strokes used .Thanks Gillette!
91	1	I really don’t understand why people are so mad lmao. This ad is literally talking about positive masculinity, to cut the toxic masculinity out of our society because it’s become such a huge problem since the damn 20’s and even farther back. To me all the men or ‘boys’ making such a huge fit about this, I hope you know you are the problem and you need to revaluate you’re self. This ad isn’t talking about all men either, so why so offended?
119	3	Want to observe nastiness at its best? Watch the average 7th grade girl in action around her peers. Colorful ones are the dandiest! Like the Kellogg's brand, I will never buy another P&G product ever...
86	1	But why on earth is getting rid of these genuinely bad things a problem?? Like someone saying that fighting and being a creep isn’t okay should NOT be an issue??? Anyone who has an issue with this ad is just upset someone put a spotlight on men’s disgusting behavior
819	1	I was compelled  to view the video after reading about Robin Thicke grabbing the model’s breast. Though Robin was clearly wrong, the production.company should have rethought having women dancing around bare breasted in a video about violating boundaries,. This seems like an unpredictable situation at best and an outright disaster at worst. …. yes a man should keep his hands to himself but some men will always “blur the lines”.
848	1	I used to hear this song so often on the radio in the early 2010s and I loved it; I didn't discover the name of this song until today in a video showing the most popular songs of each month since 2010; I never knew this song was about rape, I think my childhood is ruined now lol
273	2	A black man was shot in the mouth THIS YEAR....Zero BLM.  Zero CNN.  Zero NBC.  There was no trial, it was deemed "self-defense".  Zero outrage.  My guess is that the shooters are connected with high ranking Democrats in Pennsylvania.  Just a hunch.  Try and find the story on Google.  The media in America has been lying to you for DECADES.  It is all about the narrative.  It is all about control.  WAKE UP!!!
389	2	I know I'm late to the party but it's just such a shame that YouTube are pretending to listen to the people when all they're doing is just advertising the most family-friendly YouTubers on the platform. Not saying that there isn't some genuinely good creators in here but honestly?  Wonder why they're removing dislikes.
35	3	Lol they pressed the reset button for likes dislikes. Pathetic attempt of damage control Gillette, you look even more ridiculous now. Thx god screenshots exist.

280	1	Comply less problems. Do the crime, own it. Most of your problems if not all are created by yourself. SMH. If his Grandmother was a slave he would be over 100 years old. Hype it up!!!! All lives matter.
177	2	like bro why attack someone because they like a certain person or have an opinion also the fact that the media is splitting us appart is dumb like how the media never talks about the good cops or about 90% of them and will only cherry pick the bad apples to make black people mad that this is happening and then that starts conflict splitting us appart when will people start to realize that we are all friends
105	3	OK let me get this straight, only SOME men are courteous and kind. "some men is not enough" That's right, we are all objectifying, misogynistic and violent clones that say boys will be boys and cook BBQs. For some reason I can't see Venus putting forward an add with clones of women in the kitchen.  Yea boys will be boys, it helps for boys to have rough and tumble play, sorry to burst your.oestrogen bubble Gillette.
266	1	We should all sit down, have a conversation with our enemies and try to hear the other half of the story that you didn’t know. That’s how we will solve the problems that we have in our society.
69	3	To all those who "dont undestand the backlash": Imagine taking on denial of child custody, golddigging, gossip, "toxic femininity" in a tampon ad directed by middleaged man.  Cuz yah know, ad director Kim Gehring is a feminist woman...
559	1	Oh my, absolutely disgusting and disgraceful behavior and physical abuse by Will Smith. The whole world are witness to this unacceptable behavior. His award must be recalled and he must be charged with physical abuse! 😩😢😩😢😩
719	2	I detest the p.c. culture immensely. Shut up & pretend it's the early 90's where you can say what you want. America is supposed to have free speech. It's called the first amendment but, I see a bunch of snowflakes got their knickers in a twist & have nothing better to complain about. I'm glad Pepsi pulled the stupid ad. Now, if only United Airline's CEO would resign & their airline treating people better I would be really thrilled this week!
478	3	Imagine your wife F***king your son's friend, you'll go crazy like will smith, but the problem is Will Smith keep telling himself that it's Ok, no dude!! that's your wife! why would it be Ok, look what happened.
135	1	Gillette also makes women’s razors, this was likely targeted at that demographic. Not an inherently terrible message here, but certainly an ill-conceived campaign for a company that markets its products to both women and men.
488	1	I have vented and I still think Will is a Donkey!  He was nauseating.  I didn't see his film and I won't see it.  Also,  those crocodile tears, accepting the Oscar, was garbage. The tears were disgusting. That was acting. Only apology needed then, was to Chris.   Was he drunk?!  What was his problem?  He made an A - -  of himself. You DON'T hit someone for any joke, even if it was in bad taste!    That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!
67	3	You've got to be kidding me?............................ALL men are lumped into one category?  Who wrote this?  I think I will continue buying Gillette products............................NOT.
673	3	I find this ad offensive. Pepsi would of never used a black woman giving a soda to a white officer especially during a protest. This is white priviliege at its finest. A white woman coming to save the day or is viewed as a Saint to others saint. oh please.
170	1	We all humans we gotta learn to be equal not just blm tho alm that’s all of us not just whites not just blacks all of us not just Latinos and all of that as well all of us I love everyone equally
746	1	A little cringy..... but i get the message...  When everyone was pissing the walls over this i assumed something bad occured in it. But no... it's Americans being pissy about everything, like always...
93	1	All razors are expensive, so trump just told his Magit hatters that using a steak knife for that morning scruff is way better. He sometimes watches Malaria using one. Crazy times...
450	2	Dislikes make us to learn our mistakes. Without critics we would never know what we are doing wrong. It's like to say to kids everything good without saying them that they are doing it wrong or not. That's why they must've to return it.
462	1	What's so sad is his son posted how proud he is of his dad's cringing  physical assault on Chris Rock. I can't believe no one intervened. You can see the absolute shock and disappointment on the faces of the Williams Family. He totally ruined all the hard work in just 1 bad action.
223	1	Hes kinda telling the truth tho.. I mean its wrong to assume to think all white people are like this. But how does being black keep you from getting a job? Wasn't it king von that said nobody ever gave him shit so he had to rob. Why would anybody give you anything. Also Obama was a trash and didn't do anything for black people... At least trump reversed the very racist fair sentencing act written by joe Biden. Lmao y'all got rid of trump and put in a much more racist president
361	1	today is the day that youtube removes the dislikes api. alas, we never made it to 20 million dislikes, but i think 19 million is still something to be proud of.  good work soldiers
102	2	So long Gillette. I'm a 20 year loyal customer that you called toxic and insinuated that I'm a rapist just because I have a penis. You're company should be ashamed of itself, retract the add and come up with some apology to fit the insult. Not sure if you could win my loyalty back. And definitely not my son's either. Great job!
493	1	Idk the relationship between Will and chris but it's comedy. That wasn't even a harsh joke to me. Let alone offensive. He could have called her a cancer patient or something. Instead, he jokingly said should looks like a fuckin action hero basically. Obviously I'm missing something here. Can anyone help me understand this. I'm curious lol
94	2	I want the charts of poor behaviour that other gender does to other. I wonder ho would win by ho was thrown at the Street or left   without children. Gillette spend some resource on better research...
581	2	Of course a black man defending his wife is a travesty 🙄  I'm so sick of this. Y'all more mad about the slap than the insensitive, disgusting joke that was made at Jada's expense.  When are we going to stop tolerating this? When are black men going to ride or die for black women. We're are all the pro black hotel brothers standing up for Will ????
388	1	Hello Youtube. May you perhaps, add a Central finger in the middle of the dislike and the like pushables ? Incase the picture show is really horrific. Thank you.
674	3	*seeping with sacasm* omfg this ad is so offensive, having people stand together and shit... uh wtf has the world come to. I mean a cop didn't even get beat up! *again seeping with sarcasm*
56	2	I stopped giving my money to Gillette after this ad and have saved over $100 easy per month since. And now with a a different brand I’m using I’m getting way better shaves
200	1	There's a major difference between racism and statistics and that's where it separates.  It's great when you spend decades working hard to get a decent house in a decent neighborhood and riff raff starts moving in and your property value goes down and you owe more than your home is worth so you move somewhere else and a once decent neighborhood becomes a ghetto.
368	1	You know, i thought i was sad 2020 didnt have a rewind. I wanted them to make more because I thought they could improve. Fun fact, as of writing this comments this is my first time watching this video. Atleast 2019 wasn't as bad
299	1	You can tell the white guy really was starting to understand the black guys perspective based off his facial expression’s. I just wish it was like that more in the real world!!
596	2	Should be arrested just proves elite’s can get away with everything who are the wokes going to approve of in this situation ….I’ll never watch another will smith movie again
463	2	end times Hollywood stunt drama to brainwash younger generations minds same like those of Hollywood malfunction lifestyles and clothing practices in real world  and again driving people back to Hollywood world and fake news like sheepssss
859	1	Back in the day, I didn't really pay attention to the lyrics but seeing them some uncomfortable and those guys behavior made me not liking this song, now reading the lyrics and the story of Emily made me not like this song way more.
416	1	*Coming back to this Rewind now that it's 2022, what's cringey is that we hated this and 2019's rewind. After we got hit by the pandemic, we're all boo-hoo-I-wanna-go-back-to-what-it-was b******t. This was still an A+++ for effort. Not all platforms listen anymore (*coughs* T!kT0k *coughs). We took everything for granted.*
120	3	Ohh... I wonder why whisper, stay free, etc sanitary diapers don't teach women how to bea real women.... ! So these corporate assumes that only men need to. be taught morals.
43	3	i would like to know where these idiots live, i mean, seriously you never see dads  divide two children ? if they are play obviously you let them play, but when they aren't you divide them, it was like this from the beggining of the human race, even animals do this... WTF they are talking about?? in what world they live??
520	3	Even at that, it is wrong to walk up to another man on stage and strike him in front of live tv. It is pure aggression and a serious act of violence. Just wondering if Will  Smith was white. The street of America would probably be filled with chants of "black lives matter" right now.
199	1	3:03 This video doesn't get enough credit for it's cinematography. Some of these shots are so amazing   Edit: To those who don't understand, I like to think of cinematography as a way of saying something without speaking. This frame shows in particular shows both men  but visually separated, a metaphor for either the racial division in the US or just the division between these two men, depending on how you interpret it
215	2	PHUCK M&M!  PHUCK THE LEFT.  HE SAID HIS GRANDMA WAS A SLAVE! LIE!  HE SAID WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF RACISM! LIE! This country is majority white! You don’t like it the get back to where you was bought from! Damn! Did the British keep the receipts? I sure hope so
81	1	I want to know what is wrong with people! How is this a bad commercial? Why can’t people go on the internet without getting OFFENDED at every single thing? You have no idea how toxic masculinity affects billions. Jeez.
535	1	Will Smith is a thug loser who committed aggravated assault on camera and should be charged and arrested and given a minimum 90-day prison sentence and enrolled in anger management classes.  Totally unacceptable behavior at the Oscars and he should return his Oscar! Chris Rock = 1  Thug Will Smith = 0  Will Smith has a history of thug slapping people.
209	1	3 years later and history repeats itself. It’s just shameful the society we live in. I hope that the world will change and our color won’t determine who we are and what we do.
212	1	Joyner should win a award for song. People took song wrong but I see at end they hug and that what he trying say. Sometimes pain gotta be exposed so it can heal
96	1	Get this ad execs, two boys don't expect to be stopped playfighting, a man doesn't expect to get stopped by some random stranger because he wants to chat up a women he fancies & it doesn't only take a man to stop an individual being picked on by a gang, just a person with moral fibre....
253	1	I think a lotta people don’t realize that the point is both sides are “right” but actually wrong. They are both the viewpoints that keep race discrimination alive.
768	1	Emily whatever her name is, is thirsty. Robin doesn’t get a pass for touching her inappropriately. But she used it to gain attention for her book. Emily should thank Robin for her career.
378	2	Taking this away 🙄👎 for the "smaller creators" and totally not for large creators, celebrities, corporations and politicians. Oh and also your crappy Youtube rewinds too.  A moment of silence for the 19 mil dislikes that will disappear into the void. 🙏😔
58	1	Men should better learn to to not sexually harass women, nor bully or be malicious towards other people in general. How fragile do your egos have to be to be bringing up  so much drama over such a common sense statement. Is it because you're one of the people this is referring to?
422	1	As cringe as this video was, it kinda made me feel nostalgic of the times which have passed. Crazy to think back to when I first saw it in 2018. It was such a simpler time than 😌
509	1	Since when does a slap sound like a microphone thump? Well, it doesn't. Pretty sure Ole Chris himself thumped the mic as it was behind him in both hands, to try to make it sound real. Remember people, these are actors.  They put on a "performance" every year.  LOL
797	3	Always hated this basic song back in the day, still hate it. Robin Thicke's face and stupid hair always pissed me off for some reason now I know why.  Bunch of over the hill mothers who hit the proverbial wall listen to him boring music.
459	1	As he said "it was out of character for him" to hear all of the laughter over a joke that you realize is hurtful and personal to someone you love, hurts. Leave it alone now. Chris Rocks family may be upset, but I bet the women in his family see the real.
328	2	incase anybody is wondering there is a web browser extension called 'Return YouTube Dislike' to bring back the dislike counter. the video is now up to 20 million dislikes by the way.
342	2	Hey guys. Since they are removing the dislikes not because they care for small creators but because they only want to do it for themselves for their own selfish reasons. In the next youtube rewind. We should flood the comments by saying disliked. Then lets see how youtube feels towards that.
895	1	I was going to say that Emily's book and accusation (which comes 8 years after she danced naked for the market) is going to destroy Thicke's professional career. Then I remembered Thicke has no career whatsoever...
226	1	I been talking to someone in my friends list about racism. We are both white. He has said things this white guy in this vid says. So I sent him the video. Hoping maybe he sees he is deluding himself.  There is a lot of people who are racist, but live in denial that they are even though they say racist shit. And thats the ones you have to rationally show them the error in their ways and this song tries to do that. Love it. He is one bad lyricist.
63	3	Shaving products are sold and used by all men, thus portraying men as bad in the commercial targeted at all men is representing all men. By showing that bad men are the standard and being decent is an exceptional deed, they are saying that men are pervy, mean, violent, rapists. Except for black males who are perfect. Great and realistic commercial Gilette, I'll be sure to stop beating up other guys and shutting up all the women at work now!
794	3	Watched this just now for the first time out of curiosity bc of how often Emily Ratface comes up in headlines, with a new gripe. This video obviously catapulted her into fame and all she does is bitch about how violated she feels. And she's annoying AF in it.
198	1	I can respect this. They make it a bit of a hard pill to swallow at first by showing extremes, but they show extremes of both sides and try to get together, try to understand each other.
258	1	Only close mind people would be bias. They tend to be the one being chained with no freedom the most. It all about personal experience or just people hopping on the bias train of either side.
242	1	3:52White man has more chances to pass interview for job then black man. Even though they both have same qualifications. Black and Brown man's are not lazy they are being discriminate everywhere. And this is why this song doesn't make any sense.
137	1	The people upset about the commercial are the ones the ad is meant for. If you're offended by the ad, then you identify with the toxic masculinity, not real masculinity. Ask yourself why.
569	1	Im a black man and I felt so embarrassed that a black Oscar nominated actor slaps a former Black Host of the Oscars right before another black man, Questlove, wins his first Oscar. This all happened on the same night the legendary Sidney Pointier is honored In Memoriam at the Oscars. Will ruined and tarnished this moment forever.
599	1	First I don’t think Chris will ever say jadas name in public again. Second violence is never an answer communication Always is best. Self control is the hardest to master but when you do- Level up
189	2	uhh...nah i have an idea. stop groupthinking and saying "we r proud blakk brothas! its our cultah homie!" your culture is one formed out of desperation due to slavery. its a slave culture. so by the transitive property you are choosing to still be slaves because your celebrities are saying its something to have principles in. pathetic. #self #enslavement #the #sheeps #one #flaw
338	1	👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
810	2	dancing along with the one acussing of harrasing you is a bit sus on people's side... you didn't grow the day before and I think you knew what kind of people you are working with.... 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷‍♀️. IDK i just search about this scandalous thing but that is just a stunt to destroy someone.. no offense. 😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣
485	1	What I saw is a man who laughed at a joke that he found funny at the time it was delivered and turned to his wife to realize that his wife wasn't laughing with him and there, you knew that he has fucked up and he felt like he had to do something to save himself from trouble and explanations later, and acted out of a crazy impulsion. But he's right about one☝🏾 thing he said , love will make you do crazy things alright,when you're not getting back the same amount of love that you're giving
250	1	People are saying in the comments  “I agree i hate white ppl” “i agree i have black ppl” but you guys don’t understand what the actual meaning f this video is. If you pick sides YOU’RE THE PROBLEM!!  This video proves no matter what color we are we can be friends and people still get mad when black ppl date white ppl. It pisses me off
429	2	Here is a Dislike Button For: -For This Horrible Video -For This Stupid Change -For The Worst CEO Ever -For Brands -For Politics  -For YouTube’s Own Channels -For All of The Horrible People Who Run YouTube -For All Of the Company -For Made For Kids Change (2020) -For 2019 Rewind -For YouTube Rewind Being Canceled  (You Get The Point!🤣)
432	3	Imagine being a full on billion dollar video sharing company and having to remove dislikes off your entire platform because you were severely bullied by your own community
219	1	I say the same thing every time I listen to this song both of them are right and so fucking wrong at the same time. But the ending is the best part man all people need to do is hug it out and just talk to each other man understand each other. And if you leave this video saying the white dude was wrong or the black dude was wrong you've got the wrong message my guy. This will forever be one of the greatest and most important raps of all time.
72	1	I really don’t have much of a problem with this.  Don’t see what all the hubbub is about. I mean, it’s peddling opinions with which I don’t necessarily agree but it seems like the overall message is positive. 🤷🏻‍♂️
393	3	Watching this and my body has this reaction , I shake, shiver, turn my eyes away from screen and I dont remember what its called.      Oh, itrs cringe..,just simple cringe
182	1	Anyone seen that one meme that like  I’m not racist nigga pull yo fucken pants up nigga  Then the black dude gets a audio  of an African tribe  Also y is the white dude so good at saying nigga
234	1	Ian and Tanner were involved in a rollover wreck this morning off Canton road. Poor Sarah. The milkman, Rich Satchel, is swollen with rigid pride as he totes his loads of...
350	2	YouTube: Removes dislikes so that they can make another rewind  Everyone: Uses addons to view dislikes.  Seriously, can we get the next rewind to 50m dislikes? We don’t care about the majority of cringe youtubers on the platform, if they don’t like dislikes, they can disable it themselves. You forced it on everyone so that if you made future rewinds, people wouldn’t complain if you tried to hide them. In reality, this created even more hate.
761	2	So, is it just me (LOL) that see's that this a child molestion song?  I mean he has got these woman in white underwear and plastic around the bottom...diapers, anyone...anyone?  God O Mighty.  Just realized it after I saw the video.  What is wrong with people!?  Right there in our faces.   Not sure how he has the nerve to keep this up.
455	1	Good job to Will Smith for physically assaulting a comedian for making a joke about his wife even thoug Will Smith found it funny and only assaulted C-Rock because his wife gave him a dead eye stare probably the same thing she does when she cheats on him and tells him he's the one to blame but hey maybe he is the one to blame since he's such an aggressive abusive monster as seen.
92	2	I've always been respectful to women and I do not like being labeled a horrible mysoginist and sexual abuser. But this is an illustration of the real issue, the giant misandronism that's been going on. Millions of people supporting these attacks on men
451	1	Did Chris know about her condition? Anyway, that's physical assault & I would've had him charged. Definitely protect your wife but to do that in front of all those people, Will looked bad in the end.
501	3	Not cool at all. No excuse for punching someone, not even for love. People say all sorts of hurtful things to others EVERYDAY. So imagine if everyone went around hitting others for it? It would be a war zone. Plus, he’s a comedian. So what, I have alopecia too. Wft cares. Jars is not anymore special than the rest of us. I lost total respect for WS. Imagine how the different the debate would be if Chris Rock were a woman punched by WS. There’d be total outrage. Violence is violence!
472	1	Yeah, a man slapping another man.  Duh, who cares.  Look at how gorgeous Jada is with her new hairstyle.  Love it and have been wanting to do the same for a long time.  She's an inspiration.
148	1	This commercial takes guts to make and guts to put out there. Whether or not you believe the ad is justifiable, the message that we ALL (whether male or female or non binary) can do better to set an example for the generations that follow us should not be overlooked.  –A 17 year old who believes in the best of humanity
498	3	This really show what kind of man Will Smith really is weak. No respect for him from me Chris Rock meant no harm people's can laugh when something not aimed at them. Redeem yourself Will Smith.
167	2	It's funny when a white person says they don't like black people it's racist but when a black person says they don't like white people everyone agrees. I wish all people would get along no matter what skontone or any difference. I love all people and it angers me when people have to fight for their right to live free. For example I want to end BLM so it divides us less because BLM is just separating white people from black. #peaceforallraces
351	2	Entertainment value: 1 Cringe: 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
512	1	I used to respect Will and his family (relationship) but I found out they're a mess like many others. He was just an immature hypocrite, acting like he cares so much (after what she did).  Btw what did Chris say? I don't want to watch any awkwardness so I've not watched the video.
480	1	Now cause of chris rock making it okay to bully others and insult others with diseases other kids in High - school and middle school will follow suit and bully cancer patients and other people who lose their hair or have diseases that they can’t control. It’s sad.
405	3	Yea this vid is so obnoxious we’re so inclusive drag! Asian/Asian culture! Etc exclude some of the biggest creators. Not to mention the video was just bad in general.
458	1	Will Smith is a perfect example of privilege. If Russell Crowe slapped Chris Rock like that he would be labeled a racist, sued, and put in jail. Will Smith on the other hand gets an ovation and an award. We cannot have hypocritical double standards for any group of people. Violence is violence.
367	1	Well the time is GMT+8 2022 03 06 13:52, the plug-in still working. Youtube should know the fact that disable dislike display function won't remove any cringe from your activity.
874	2	Anyone actually defending her really needs their brain checked because clearly shorty ain’t use her brain starring in this video, how you gon star in the video then try to bad mouth the dude, does she really expect it to be a friendly video? She really gotta ask them for details on the music video before participating smh
287	1	If you hear "Two Sides" in this song. You're a part of the problem even if you don't contribute. Remember its Joyner the entire time not two artist. He gives two sides and the video helps so much to get the actual message across. In a world of hate and racism, it's almost impossible to ask two sides to say their side of the story and then still find common ground and unite. If you ONLY see left and right by the end of this video. You sadly missed the point.
332	3	Wow, a video with 3 million likes? I'm certain the dislikes are nowhere near that much likes! Surely the difference between the likes and dislikes must be MASSIVE!
274	2	The comments on this video thinking this bs is high IQ makes it all the more hilarious. This is such low brow garbage that fails to even make a point beyond topical, surface level comments.
140	1	How is this a bad message to be spread?.. its about men treating women and each other with respect and love . How can you be mad at this? So what it's only about men and not women, gillette is a mens razor company ! You need to stop getting offended by everything you see and take time to think things through before commenting .
312	1	If people really want a dislike button where the count is visible to others, makes one yourselves! Simply make a comment that says "Like this comment in place of a dislike button" Workarounds :)
142	1	I'm a muslim btw I'm not a liberal or a feminist I don't really see anything wrong in this commercial  They're not removing Masculinity  They're redefining it so that It's cleaned from harming others
346	2	So basically YouTube was being a child over the fact that they had so many dislikes and also the fact that company’s were complaining so now company’s can whatever they want (as seen with pewds vid) and YouTube is basically not helping those who are actually helping it
694	2	This trivialises all that we stand for. However kendall is not to blame for being younv and nieve. Pepsi is wrong for using blm as a means to sell pepsi!! Inexcusible
373	2	for those not using the d¡sl¡ke extension, the current d¡sl¡ke count is 19.9 m¡l, so lets get it to 20 m¡l before December 13 where they hide it's API completely  I have to use "d¡sl¡ke"  because youtube shadowbans that word for some reason
17	3	whats even more embarrassing is the actual men who took part in this ad                                            oh and btw, are they trying to create a feud between black and white males?
814	2	I have no idea why they felt the need to have those poor animals that are probably scared to fucking death in their ridiculous video.. not impressed Pharrell..i expected better for a video!
374	2	Just so you know: if you write something along the lines of "nEM dissy like btton" your comment gets "lost, forgotten to time" (Weote this with sommany errors to get past the algebra)
65	2	Boys of today are the men of tomorrow' So this is aimed towards little boys who are 'responsible for other peoples actions'? Because I always see little kids walking about with facial hair 🤔🤔   Let's just blame ALL men for what other men did 🤷‍♂️   Bring back the times where people weren't offended by emotions.
251	1	With all that’s happened in the past few years, there’s still no understanding and I guess it comes from the people that dislike this video. What’s so hard to understand what this video is about? Or is it that you don’t want to understand? Sad world we live in
302	2	I can still see the dislikes. So I really hope to see it till the end when it gets 20 million dislikes. Everyone stay strong. P.s:I'm holding off the update. But not sure how long I would be able to do so.
683	2	What the hell has that got to do with Pepsi.  Why do businesses get involved in areas like this, they must know it's going to be controversial, surely Kendel knew that too
41	3	Definitely a sexist ad against men they will lose a lot of business. Anything bad in this video women are also capable of what does that have to do with razors? And also why is it bad to confront a girl that you like? what would he have done asked for her number is that a crime?
269	1	The message isn't that white people or black people are right or wrong. It's that all this hate is thrown around on both sides and it's for nothing because nobody knows each others struggle. It's not  white vs black so much it's hate vs love.
554	2	See this is what happens when we let Blacks sit down at the table instead of serving. You just know eventually they're going to put their feet up on the table right in the middle of the meal.
78	1	This ad is fine. Society's too pumped up. Not every statement can cater to all sides of a debate. It should be judged based on its message, where thay helps or harms. Not on' all else it could have said but didn't.' This isn't the sermon the mount. It's an ad.
249	1	This is the very first time I see this video and couldn't stop feeling a bunch of things. First angry and then couldn't stop crying. OMG, hoping the fkn racism finally end if people just realize we all are the same bunch of stellar dust with a beating heart 💓
290	3	I mean really? What is this guy bitching about? Being black isn't an excuse for failure anymore!  I have three bosses and their black....stop whining about being black
497	1	I thought this is scripted at first. But then I realized it's not😳Chris Rock handled the situation in a very professional manner. Kudos! They both have mistakes here, but I feel like Will's action is unjustifiable.🥺Just my opinion though...
194	1	I agree with the white side a bit more tbh but I feel that there’s a barrier between the two I’m Native American and I never try to offend anyone I think it comes off as being racist towards black people because I just don’t know about their culture and I feel like the way the world is right now I should feel ashamed by choosing the white side but I don’t I think the white side made better and stronger points
340	2	👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
414	3	Don't worry, this is still the most disliked video. Not just on YouTube, but any video ever filmed or created. Simply disliked because everyone knows how corrupt and biased the "YouTube Team" is. Not even a team. Keep making bad decisions. Keep making this socialism.
557	2	Will laughed coz he did not realize immediately what the joke was exactly about, but then he realized that it was about Jada’s medical condition ! So he was defending his wife’s honor! A joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for Will to bear and he reacted emotionally! Chris Rock deserves that slap!
271	1	For this guys grandmother to have been a slave and him have gotten to know her (assuming he's in his 20s) she would've had to have been in her 130s when she died.  Slavery wasn't that long ago but it wasn't recent either. It was made illegal 156 years ago. I'm not arguing with any points made here but his grandmother was not a slave
161	1	The thing I see is..and especially with the black side of this song... you don't know, you don't know. So let's open up and introduce each other to our worlds. Make sure we understand each other.
244	2	Slave síndrome bs!!! More victimhood !!! Keep riding that horse !!!  Is better to men up stop whining for free stuff with ridiculous argument like slave sindrome bs !!
517	3	Something you worked your whole life to achieve but sadly that thing is gonna be negative reminder for Will Smith for the rest of his life. Life's work and character achievements both received at the same time. Too many I'll tempered and an uncivilised people in Hollywood.
257	1	That hug at the end tho... I don't know about you but there's some watery substance coming out my eyes.  Master piece and needs to be blasted out of every radio.
781	1	"I don't know what happened! I was doing a shoot for a music video which glorifies sex, wearing nothing but my panties, rubbing my bare breasts on an intoxicated man, and all the sudden he grabbed me!"
773	2	Why does he have to do videos with skinny Fake hoes!!! why can’t he do a Video with big Woman .  men like a big woman that have meet on them not skinny Pencil that can break..
141	1	Why the hell are there so many dislikes and negative comments? It’s not saying all men are toxic or masculinity is explicitly toxic. It’s saying we should do our best to avoid being negative toxic people.
246	1	Notice how the black guy didn’t say I’m not racist when callin out the whites but the the white guy said it meaning Joyner Lucas doesn’t think that blacks can be racist
550	1	It makes no sense, Will laughed at the joke and then he just hits him??? Please, Smith has bigger issues if he is that triggered and violent... And yes, the joke was garbage, but hitting him is not the answer, that stupid macho men protecting his wife attitude, please what a pathetic excuse
231	1	Just enjoy the fucking music and accept whatever message comes your way. Joyner is incredibly talented and i'm sure one mans understanding is misconstrued unless both men are hyper sensitive and very empathetic. These people tryna say they understand the message and others don't are creating divide even in youtube comment sections. Fuck all y'all, Joyner Forever
310	1	Wow 3 million likes.  One would think that this is the most loved video on youtube.  Youtube is so great for covering for itself.  We need alternatives to youtube.  Granted, big tech has monopolized itself by attacking platforms like parlor.
865	1	Sad that Thick is accused by Emily Ratajkowski that he touched her boobs during  the making of this clip. I'll guess populist femalic crying is the new normal. First want to figurate in a porn videoclip, getting rich and famous, and when thats over and your out the picture then accuse a men.
156	1	Im brown i think brown are atleast 1/3 of earth Middle East the Native states of the Americas Mexico brazil Argentina Indians Indonesians i think i can say for all of us where tf is the yellow n brown part?! 😂 are we just ghosts lol
476	2	It takes a real Man to do that, You  go Will Smith 👏 defend your Wife  She don't deserve that, and I'm not a fan of Jada neither, but even I don't  believe She deserves to be disrespect  like that like dog fu*k Chris Rock never thought he was funny no way.
133	1	Tough commercial to make. I think they took it to far in portraying traditional macho madculinity as something too negative.  But we are men we can take it. Just do it better next time.
651	1	wht is everybody's problem these people wouldn't let anybody live in peace like it's just an ad everyone is like "she's so stupid" she has no talent" before judging someone u should probably look at urself first and see how ur making fun of her like that's so rude if ur smart then u should just ignore u don't have to spread so much hate 😑 it got banned becuz of PEOPLE FUCK U  and kendall gives no fucks about this fucking hate cuz she's smart and knows how to "ignore" something she doesn't like😁
28	3	I am done!  Been use their Sensor razor for over 24 years....DONE!  I will find my other products for household from SC Johnson!  And it is time to sell my P&G stock!  Vote with your wallets gentlemen!!!
260	1	Today I went to Popeyes that dude told me “buy food for you white boy not me because I’m a black homeless” even tho I didn’t anything bad to him that’s really sad
334	2	Youtube can’t even take the critics from dislikes, soon they will remove comments, likes, shares… Just for them to feel good about theirselves. It all started with monetization and ads..
738	2	stupid advert. as for offensive, alot of people are looking to be offended, if you look really hard there is likely cause for offence, but that's right in all sorts of situations. Can we all just get along? please.
621	1	*Conservatives:* THIS AD IS SHIT BECAUSE IT PANDERS TO SJW ISSUES! *Liberals:* THIS AD IS SHIT BECAUSE IT TRIVIALIZES IMPORTANT ISSUES!  Maybe Pepsi can bring us together.
508	3	Probably an unpopular opinion BUT if she really was that insecure about her shaved head she would've worn a wig. And if Will was really THAT hurt by the joke he wouldn't have laughed and he would've been a real man and just had a private conversation with Chris.
267	1	We are all human no matter the race religion or class. It's only when we let these personal things define how we act to others that they truly divide us. Whether it's black or white. Jewish or Muslim. We don't need to hate eachother blindly. Hate should be reserved for those who wrong you, and pedophiles.
201	1	I can respect this video because of both sides being equal with the stereotypes they talked about but I can’t respect the people who hate in the comment section of this video.
471	1	Was Chris Rock ignorant of her condition? If so then that was a terrible joke. But hitting someone is almost never the answer. I wish Will had just called Chris out with words. That said, I get it. He loves his girl.
700	3	Better ending ...Riot breaks out ..Police use their 40.cals and assault weapons and start spraying the crowd with automatic fire ..Kendal gets shot in the face and starts bleeding profusely...THE END
411	3	on other videos everyone is asking how come nobody likes this video or stuff like "these 3 dislikes are given by this and that hater". but i'd like to know who in the hell likes a video like this, considering its not a bot
247	1	so this is good song it speaks both sides accurately and why we clash and 90% of it is facts . but ill def say is alot of the things said on both sides are wrong a bit more on the "black" side idc if you think i have to live something to understand it you fuckin dont understanding is understanding regardless and both sides refuse to accept others and one side more than the other.
844	3	Why this girl complaining about getting groped even though she agreed to be in this music video. Isn't that on you?   Also, seems like a good way to market a new book don't you think?
454	3	will smith is just a WEAK punk, when you sucker punch somebody, off guard they suppose to fall....Chris said: "what was that? my mama slapped me harder than that" ...
85	1	Men know right from wrong. Men are NOT monsters that society needs to shame into acting more like decent human beings. I just want to take this opportunity to say that men (and women) are inherently good inside and being a man doesn't make you a future creeper. Men shouldn't be made to feel guilty for the actions of specific individuals.
206	1	Not even black but i love y'all the hate needs to stop we can i aint no Martin Luther king but as he once said I HAVE A DREAM  not trying to change anyones thoughts but we can heal this world again AS ONE
382	3	Present: *Wow… such a good video! 3M likes and no dislikes! Just wow.*  Past: *19M dislikes-*                                                                                (rip)
445	3	Don’t mind me, I have come to pay respects to the worst YouTube video ever made. Rest in piece 20 million dislikes (2018-2021) 😥. I hope the people who did this feel good that they are now protecting politicians and massive corporations instead of stopping animal abuse content and protecting users from scammers like the cucks that they are.
801	1	remember when everyone hated this song when it came out when literally almost all rap songs objectify women? Yeah people were that stupid and offended back then now it's only gotten worse. Not saying I like this song though...it still sucks.
80	3	The problem with this video is that Gillette over-corrected.  99% of the bad behavior in this commercial is done by white men and of the bad behaviors, there’s a black man or ethnic man trying to “show him how to be a man” or calling him on it.  This is what is pissing off white men.  Gillette is basically saying white men are the problem and that’s hard for them to swallow.
303	2	this is how the 2018 rewind dies as the video with the most dislikes in history and it will stay that way forever, then a ramdon comment will say, use me as a dislikes button for the video xD
483	1	"Pulling Will aside on a commercial break"?  really? Aside? Onstage? Why were any of them standing onstage? When you pull someone aside, standing on stage infront of dozens camera is not a thing.
185	1	the fact that white people who are friends with 0 black people say it still!!!🤯😳 and me over here the biggest white boy friends with all the black people at my school and they say to say the N word and me who’s never going to say it no matter how long i know them or how many times i’m told to say it i’m never going to. but heck some people would never understand what i just said but some people know the meaning in every word what i said is.
150	2	People who don’t understand what’s wrong with this ad have fallen into the trap of identity politics.  Correlating things like bullying and harassment to masculinity then telling me it’s my job to police other men because they share my sex.. we are individuals and aren’t responsible for a group which we are arbitrarily assigned to
699	2	Wow! With all the horrible shit the Police have been doing to people; people Protesting about important things; like wanting clean drinking water;  to Police brutality on innocent black people; and this is the commercial they come up with. OMG... "Here Mr.Policeman have a drink of Pepsi"   If I was the CEO of Pepsi; I would be firing someone right away; or maybe you should resign yourself. Just sayin
12	3	Doing a feminist commercial for mens shaving products, depicting men as freaks and as toxic, blending together things that have nothing in common such as getting into a fight, sexual harassment, bullying or boys fighting... I wonder what could possibly go wrong
39	1	What is wrong with all of you? Why are you hating on a message of hope, a message of change? There’s nothing wrong with this commercial, and if you believe there is then you prove Gillette is right in their message. The company is saying men can be better in how they treat other men and women, and in how children are raised. How is it so wrong to call out the truth?
702	1	Not really offensive, but pretty ridiculous. The commercial was doomed as soon as Pepsi decided to hire a Kardashian.   It would be really funny to see a commercial of people calming down rioters by sharing them cans of coke just before everyone breaks out in dance.
544	3	Will man up.....you were SO WRONG, own it, apologize personally to Chris and and and return your Oscar, you are not worthy regardless of the genuine tears....YOU DID WRONG BRO, VIOLATING someone, implementing violence.....BLOODY DISGRACEFUL.
612	3	Cops are all white males... Mob is filled with your super multicultural lets get along together people... some ununique unique musicians... and ofc the main protagonist is a woman...  Mob has fun while the cops are just standing there being mad...  2:39...  Pepsi...  You can clearly see what pepsi is trying to do here  Thanks for giving us this meme  peace out and bless yall and dont forget to put in that addblock ;)
433	2	Youtube i know it's been 3 years but this video is the worst cringe thing i ever saw now i dont like your platforn so much and bc yoz removed dislikes so nonody sees that you had 19 milion dislikes  Here is my opinion.
126	3	This world  is so F'in naive. We're born males but (those Of us who are) are MEN for a reason. Feminist advice for how a man should live with no frame of reference or experience of a Man's reality - and in a razor advert? F you all!
11	2	Gillette: Men can be better and are getting better, keep not harassing women, continue to stop bullying, and generally treat women and other men with respect. Men can grow improve and be good people. Men: NOT ALL MEN. FEMINISTS ARE RUINING EVERYTHING I WANT TO BULLY OTHER MEN AND HARASS WOMEN.
549	1	*Joke idea for 2023 Oscars:* The host pulls out cue cards, mumbling as he sorts through them. He pauses on one and reads "Jada Pinkett Smith joke." He becomes visibly nervous. Keeping his head down he shoots a quick side-eye glance at the Smiths, gulps, and slowly puts the card in his pocket.     *edit This will never happen. Because the oscars will be hosted by unfunny women forever and forthwith.
401	2	Im sorry for the 19m dislikes they had family too, if they could find a partner under 19 million others   R.I.P Dislikes  We will miss u especially under this video
49	3	I’m about two years too late and imma start not using their products anymore. Why do some people think that if it has to do with men, it’s not sexist. This is very sexist.
324	2	Rumble and bitchute have likes and dislikes. They don't censor you either. Google has too much power, and it's time we took it away, since they GOT IT FROM US AND OUR ATTENTION.
562	2	I think majority of us see Will Smith in a different light after this.  He wasn't defending his wife.  He was scared of his wife's wrath  if he didn' do something.  Jada is the husband in this relationship.
127	2	Guardian get over yourself, the default male condition is not fairly represented in this ad and you know it. Stop jumping on the man hating bandwagon have you not seen enough in recent years to know the consequences of this misguided self righteousness.
157	1	These are the problems we face after 150 years we all just need to respect people and understand everyone has their opinion, that does not mean racism ok, judging someone based of there skin color white black whatever That’s my view
434	2	This must be one of the best videos ever made on YouTube. I mean, just look at the Like count. 3 MILLION. I've barely seen anything like that in my life. Heck it must be the best video ever as it was made by YouTube themselves. Ingenious piece of work
97	1	Masculinity is not under attack. Masculinity is being redefined to not include harassing women or bullying people who are different than you. Masculinity is being expanded to a more loving space and if you can't handle that then you deserve to be left in the past with your hate.
603	1	So this is the commercial, huh? Nice. If this were the original vid I'd leave a dislike. But You didn't do anything wrong in keeping this abomination on the internet, so I won't do it here. XD
780	2	So I just read how Emily is complaining about being mistreated on the set while making this video back in 2013. Seriously, if you didn’t complain then, don’t complain now!! I’m so sick of women doing the crap they do then years later come out with a different story.
787	1	Not once did I see him grope her. She's the one dancing around him without a top. Once again rich people model problems of the spoiled. She got the privilege to be in one of the videos to one of the biggest songs ever and yet again something has come out all these years later. I have absolutely nothing wrong with being naked or showing off your body but come on like seriously she has something to bring up years later. It's all for publicity.
771	2	Thank god this song came out when it did and was cancelled right away. If it had come out like 10 years earlier I think it would have been very successful. It’s such a disgusting, creepy song and all the hints toward getting her drunk and saying “I know you want it” over and over again is just alluding to r!pe. This song needs to be removed from YT and any radio that plays it
547	3	The irony is that Chris’s remarks probably would have been forgotten the next day or gone unnoticed by millions had it not been for Will’s intervention. I wasn’t even aware of his wife’s issues and apparent cheating etc before this went viral. Still, he has more money than most people to retire comfortably and never have to work again.
398	1	🪦R.I.P 20M Dislikes☠️ December 6, 2018 - November 12, 2021💀 May You Rest in Peace and Enjoy the Heaven.👻 We All Loved You A Lot, We Will Never Forget the 20M People Who Disliked This.😭😭😭
461	1	I mean will was laughing at first like if u don’t have a since of humor about stuff like that than ur just gona be miserable I understand it’s serious I have type one diabetes but I laughed at jokes that are light heartedly towards diabetes because if I don’t have a since of humor towards these things than ur just gona be upset even more about it Idk that’s just how I see it.
232	1	Some of my grandkids are black and beautiful.  I love them, their fathers and their families too. I have Latinos too and Native Americans but I'm considered aryan but we are blended because #LoveHasNoColor
47	3	Well No more P&G , Gillette for me since being labeled by these jerks!  BiC or other from now on! Our local Shops just don't seem to be selling many Gillette razor at all! Wonder why?
145	2	This is such a great message, what the f is wrong with you all? Let's treat each other with respect and be nice to each other - what's wrong with this message?????
363	2	19,911,850 dislikes, for those wondering.  We're SO close to 20 million dislikes! Remember the count will officially disappear from the API on December 13th. Let's reach 20 million beforehand!
186	1	I was trump supporter before I went to prison. This has a whole new meaning now. Whites didn't accept me because I wasn't racist (enough). So I rolled with the fellas and learned everything about the world that I thought I knew.   Before I went in I was the guy wearing the red hat.
128	3	Gillettes going bust... I've been "sexually assaulted" by many women in the club and have you seen how ladies treat ripped men? just take it as a compliment....not get butthurt and cry over things that are petty and irrelevant.
103	3	So, I just watched this controversial video to find out what all the hoopla is about.  I found it to be quite excellent, with a positive and needed message. I say that all 'men' who find issue with it are actually degenerate cowards, lacking manly courage and integrity to stand up for what is noble and right. Thank you Gillette -you have just earned a new, loyal customer of your products.
159	1	If u think this is about “two different perspectives that are part of the problem🤓” ur mad dumb, this clearly shows that the white guy has very dumb arguments/excuses to be blatantly racist while the black guy disproves them with accurate points and counter arguments
545	2	You mean to tell me that Will Smith  slapped   Chris Rock over a,  joke?  But he didn't do anything when his wife Jada told him about the  entangled meant . I don't get it
760	3	How did Emily not know something was off with this man, I mean did she not LISTEN to the song, and the way the video was directed??? It was all there in front of her face!
586	1	Will smith cheated on Jada too. Before she did in fact. Stop blaming his wife for having too much “control” over him. He’s a grown man.. He could have easily just yelled from the audience like he did later or left. Assaulting was a disproportionate and an entitled thing to do. Especially how later he tries to come across some protective hero. No bro. Narcissistic. And Chris Rock didn’t even say anything disrespectful! Being called GI Jane is Literally a compliment agh..
633	1	I swear white people get triggered over the most dumbest shit I don't see nothing wrong with this commercial at all some of y'all are some really butthurt ass people y'all need help frfr💯
184	1	The only thing the white man said that was valid was "pull your pants up" everything else was just racist garbage and then had the audacity to say "I'm not racist"
243	2	Love all these anti racism groups who advocate against systematic racism yet endorse it through behavior, by canceling and making segregate everything....to funny because the system that crys it is the system they support...(most likely  unknowingly  you know because schools racist...)
330	2	2 days after the dislikes have been removed, I can still see them, I don’t know how much longer I will have them for but I am making the most of our time together. Keep your loved ones safe people 💔
735	2	The ad sucks because it doesn't represent reality. Throw a bunch of drugged up thugs and psychos holding Fuck Trump signs in there and then you have an accurate depiction
130	2	I have seen this ad late but I have always been an Anti-Leftist We are at war really this is war and as a man I am never buying anything from Procter and Gamble again
615	1	Ok to everyone in the comments that doesn't see anything wrong with this, it's the message they put out with it. It makes it look like they're saying that all the problems with police brutality and racism can be changed with famous people and Pepsi, it ruins the whole message
236	3	F*cc this dude, his passive-aggressive way of hiding his blood lineage and what they did to our people, if we listen to this clown and his indirect racism we're not identifying with our true selves and that's what he's trying to do not identify with his true self 💯
456	2	Different combination considerations: Black hitting white. White hitting black. Man hitting woman. Woman hitting man. Straight hitting gay. Gay hitting straight. Black gay vs white gay. White gay male vs black straight female. 🤔
643	1	I heard all this fuss about Pepsi and came here to see what it was about, watched until the end and was just left here like "?????" Lol. What the hell is wrong with people these days, so overly sensitive. It was a dumb commercial but offensive? Is it something in the food these days that makes people's buttholes clench every time they see or read something? Lol bye
33	3	Shame that there was nothing in the add about men been abused and attacked by women like I was in my last long term relationship, and how I and others like me stood up to it.
610	1	so let me get this str8. US has a clown for a president. PepsiCo finally comes up with a meaningful ad (no sexy JLo, Britney, Beyonce butts, not that I got anything against those) about peace and unity among people regardless of their job, race and it is "outrageous"?  that is controversial? wow. ok. why was it banned? who was offended by that? i don't get it and I don't mean to further offend anyone myself.
162	1	This is the truth-preach it.  I do not like rap and hip hop but the lyrics are truth in this one and the black community should get out of the democratic plantation, start thinking and getting jobs.
203	3	I have many issues with the song. First one that really grabbed my attention was the “my grandmama was a slave “   Is this bitch 200 years old or what 🖕and how nice that the white dude never touched the black dude but yet it was ok for the black dude to knock his hat off of his head. Love that white privilege we all have 🖕 “I’m not racist “ 🤣
337	2	I literally just came here to pay my respects to the fallen dislikes. RIP In Peace 😔        Edit:EVEN THOUGH NOBODY SEES THIS COMMENT. I WROTE RIP IN PEACE ON PURPOSE AYT!!!
560	2	Why didn’t Will Smith smack the shot out of the toy boy who didn’t keep jada Smith p@@y out of his mouth. Just asking for a friend. It’s clear that Will Smith is not right in the mind. I smell a law suit
309	2	20 million dislikes deleted. But on a positive side: Look at the top comments with 59k upvotes. They can't silence negative opinions. We will make our voices heard.
352	2	As Oscar Wilde once said, "There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about."   *We can all agree that youtube rewind had a powerful ending*
644	1	People need to get out of their safe spots and grow some balls. Get out of their high chairs and pull your big girl/guy under wear on. Shut the hell  up, it is just a commercial. No need to apologise Kendall. This country is full of babies.
14	3	I can't think of an instance where I felt more misunderstood as a man than this. It's terrible and hurtful to see what an toxic view some seem to have on other fellow humans.  It saddens me deeply. And I will keep on working hard for an world where understanding is stronger then blame. We are all humans. We are all different. We are all beautiful. It unites us more then separates. And I forgive the makers of this and hope they will heal and find kindness
441	1	To everyone involved in getting this to 19 million dislikes, I'm proud of having had the possibility of doing something so great alongside y'all. Goodbye dislikes, you'll be missed
164	1	What I think I like the most about this song is the "There's two sides to every story, I wish I knew yours" line because I think that a whole lot of unnecessary arguments could be avoided if we all tried to understand each other's point of view a bit better.
108	1	i find it funny how people are choosing to boycott Gillette for encouraging them to be better men, this world is upside down :") congrats,  y'all did it,  just when i thought there was hope
53	3	Threw my Mach 3 in the bin after +20 years after watching this garbage. Wrote to Gillette to explain why they’d lost my wife and I as customers but have yet to hear back (over a week ago). I’d guess they’ve been bombarded with people complaining they don’t appreciate a patronising moralistic lecture from a razor company.
163	2	We went from segregation to freedom and back to segregation.?  I guess that is what the people of color think?  I'm white privilege and need to quit my job and have a barbecue with the sauce and not be accountable of your actions.  I'm not racist but U think differently then me with your criminal activities.  (WLM!!!!!). 😎
248	1	It's sad that the response was so weak. Lets start with 400 of making whites rich, barred from  education, Jim Crow, Unemployment because of racial discrimination, white privilege. Red lining. On and on and on.  Instead, the black kid said the white man does not understand bbq. 😞
665	2	Is this a metaphor for all things Kardashians. They just sit around taking pictures all day when a brown dick walks and catches their attention. "Like, if he cares then I care cuz like black lives are like amazing, look at Kanye. yolo" and why is she grinning as she walks into a protest? "Like omg, I have to get this on snap chat, so cute. Iconic". what a disgrace. I wish popular celebrities weren't so empty. It's seriously fucking up the culture.
366	1	I feel like people should be more forgiving. I mean remember all the great memories all of us have had on YT. YouTube messed up just one time and this is how you guys ratio their video. No mercy in this world.
152	2	Bro really, I have been ignoring this song forever but i have grew up and this is messed up man, Your an adult you should really know better. Stereotypes aren't cool and we should not go off someones personality from their beliefs, culture or religion. I can understand the word that people may find offensive just because a caucasion guy says it but you can't just go at a whole community like that man.
281	1	Yo... My mouth is on the floor, I never heard this the song before, I mean really listened. Joyner Lucas, you are the man I don't think anyone could actually define racist more than the way you just did. You nailed it, you define the exact meaning of racism. Thank you!
604	2	I'll tell you why were disliking the video, because this ad is literally praising poison. 41 fucking grams of sugar in a pepsi its basically cancer in a can and to top it off they put piece signs that looks like the pepsi logo which is cringy and stupid af
225	1	Notice how the black guy didn’t say I’m not racist when callin out the whites but the the white guy said it meaning Joyner Lucas doesn’t think that blacks can be racist
54	2	Let's be honest, whoever needs one of these lessons isn't going to learn it from an ad..   also, what was not cool about the guy going after the woman? Not that I usually do, but is it somehow not okay to approach a woman I'm attracted to?
477	1	I think that wasn't a funny joke. You just can't Insult a sick person and make the whole world laugh at them. It's just like, the worst thing you can do! He fully deserved the slap.
790	2	I mean.. I remember watching this song on vh1.. The time it was released didn't like it at all. Wonder why Emily first agreed to go topless.. It's bound to happen liquors and all this shits.. That's why I like old 80s and some 90s songs. These days I only like what indie artists songs.. Rest is boring and dull..
402	3	I think we took for granted how much this video showed media platforms were becoming extremely disconnected from their main audience.   They used to appeal to normal people rather than favoring the agenda of the elite. To push for diversity and inclusiveness when really only whackjobs care about that.
706	1	Unrealistic representation of protesters in this day and age as they'd genuinely be burning shit and chanting stupid slogans. Accurate representation of police and the effects that drinking pepsi has.
61	1	Sorry but I don’t see the controversy over this commercial....just saying...however it has nothing to do with shaving the hair on one’s face and how good of a job their razors are at doing so....
84	2	Here’s a list of P&G (Gillette’s Parent Company) products and brands you may want to avoid from now on: -Always -Ariel -Bounty -Charmin -Crest -Clancy’s Potato Chips -Dawn -Downy -Fairy -Febreze -Gain -Gillette -Head & Shoulders -Olay -Oral-B -Pampers and Pampers Kandoo -Pantene -SK-II -Tide -Vicks
218	1	Some ppl are educating themselves rn and maybe they got caught up in it, they’re learning about everything white Americans have done to them and they start to blame the white folks of THIS generation. I’m sorry, I’m learning, it does hurt tho. I’m teaching myself stuff that I was never taught in school and sometimes I get carried away
386	2	I'm guessing this was the video that started it all. YouTube didn't care about content creators, they did not like the fact that THEIR videos were getting disliked lol.   Terrible decision made by YouTube.
124	3	I love how women are like I dont get how you dont get it. Oh I get it but what if Venus was like stop being a whore dont have more kids than you can support. Woman could be doing better. This is a generalization of woman and that's not fair. All guys are saying is we dont need companies trying to sell us stuff to tell us how we need to act.
886	1	How can this song be rapey? If indeed there were blurred lines it’s not like the woman would continue to let you make sexual advances to her without her making it clear to you. Rape is not an accident, it either happened or it didn’t. Stupid woke culture.
750	3	omg i cringe at all the comments like what is wrong with this ad? 😭😭😭 What's wrong with it is that at the start there is a black lives matter protest going on which of course is a great subject to have a commercial about *types sarcastically* and then at the end of the road there are policeman not letting the protesters through oh but then Kendall hands them a Pepsi so everything is okay meaning Pepsi can solve all of our problems even touchy political ones *types sarcastically*
818	1	Well its kinda like bad expressions on free to say whatever matters to you,and being funny about charges like let me put you down so can keep you there until ready for my way dark lanes.like ur preference is not my concern.You not into playing house.like all truths if looking for dare me too.
214	1	Being mixed I feel this all the time. Especially TRY NOT HAVING A SIDE, at least you got someone your color to give you a ride to let you have a try to bring you in love and be down to ride, I ain’t allowed pride? What about my spiritual guides? Native American mixture with no tribe, African father who up and died raised by my grandmother on that side.
48	2	It seems if you’re white you may not approach women anymore, a heroic black man will stop you if you try. Only men of color are permitted to pro-create now. Good soy boy.
8	2	Ah yes, teach kids that someone will step in and protect them, instead of teaching them to protect themselves for when you aren't around. You can't coddle your kids and then send them out into the real world as if they are ready... it's like raising an indoor kitten and then dropping it in the Savannah, they won't survive.
347	2	Why youtube remove dislikes button:  YouTube: so many dislikes in this video  YouTube: Ima delete dislikes button  Next 3 days...  Everyone: Dislikes button remove!?!?
371	3	YOUTUBE NEEDS TO RESTORE THE DISLIKES!!! THIS VIDEO IS THE PRIMARY REASON THAT THEY REMOVED THE DISLIKES, BECAUSE THEY WERE EMBARRASSED ABOUT CREATING THE MOST DISLIKED VIDEO EVER POSTED ON YOUTUBE!!!
7	1	Jesus loves you and is coming soon! ❤️ if you haven’t repented and turned from sin and accepted Jesus as Savior believing He died and rose again for you, today is perfect and scripture says that today is the day of salvation!!
360	2	Hey everyone who's coming to this video for some reason? This was actually the most disliked video on YouTube, and probably the reason YouTube changed the dislike button.  Just a reminder?  19.9 million dislikes
24	2	Awwee. Poor witto women and sissy boys. Be more manly, get beat up less. Be more womanly, get more respect. If that lady in the big meeting was home raising her children, 1- she would be respected by her husband and kisd. 2- her boys would know how to be boys. It's your clasic 2 birds 1 stone scenario.
57	1	Listen, if your a guy and you don’t do these things they aren’t assuming all men do this stuff so chill out. You should ACTUALLY be ashamed if you do these things, don’t get all mad about men’s rights in these commercials because again this isn’t against ALL men
143	1	the good men would be clapping at this ad. the men who prize their ego would be dismissing it. the message isn't ACTUALLY "all men are horrible." the message is a rally for those who are GOOD, to BE GOOD and TEACH our boys to be good. sheesh.
870	1	Who else came here because of Emily? this song and video isn’t about female empowerment, and imagine all the things that came out of T.I. (Side note: Why tf is he brushing their hair?)
372	2	⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠿⠿⡿⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⣀⡀⠀⠀⣇⣀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿
413	2	Browser extension for the win! I can still see your 20 million+ dislikes YouTube, try again! Maybe have a better excuse than the "to help small creators" bullsh*t
426	2	4 years have passed since this is so emotional. Maybe for this year or the next I would like to see the BLACKPINK song how you lika that and also that they do the dance with lyna.
553	3	Thug like behaviour onstage and vulgarities shouted from his seat. That's what the Oscars have become. Class and elegance that it once had, has been replaced by vulgar millionaires.
188	1	K I stand corrected I didn't watch it all at first but I dont really listen to this person but I thought he was the white person I like this person tho nice song
420	1	Personally I think this rewind is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every moment of it and have watched it many times. People give it too much hate when in my opinion its the best video on youtube.  P.S LOVED the will smith cameo he's my favourite actor.
42	1	I think it's funny how so many men are getting offended by this. It was made to encourage men to be better to each other and build each other up. It even said "we know all men aren't like this" it's because in this society you cant question men at all in any way without them getting upset. I think this was a lot better commercial than the average commercial of naked woman in the shower.
475	3	So many fake laughs in this award gala and Will smith is the proof.. I have always found awkward and exaggerated their reactions..After all, They are all actors, right?
824	3	Emily is literally dry humping and grabbing Robin Thicke while naked at 0:51 …. I wonder if she asked for his permission? Probably not. But this logic usually only goes one way. The truth is Emily was just looking for attention, hence why she brings it up 8 years later when everyone forgot she even existed .
285	1	Exactly we are all humans but blacks gave hate a new meaning and racism and racist was born fuck races we are humans and if you believe in god or not we are all his children and we are all family we need to start be the human race and not the human races and we just need to except that hate is hate in every color someone kills the same color or another color and that America in not the same as it was 150 years and that people are not just like their ancestors and the government is different too
296	1	We Were All Human Until Race Disconnected Us, Religion Separated Us, Politics Divided Us, & Wealth Classified US....... MAKE SURE TO TELL SOMEONE YOU LOVE 💞THEM
482	2	Idc what y’all say, Chris Rock deserved it. You can’t just let someone joke about something rude that way. Most people will let him do what he wants, but smith did the right thing. Will smith loves his family and will always love them. This is proof how much will cares about his family. Bunch of respect to him.
470	1	In the debate between who was more wrong, Rock for making a joke at Pinkett Smith’s expense (whether or not he knew about her alopecia), or Smith for handling it the way he did, there are no winners.
304	2	Quick tip : turn on incognito to see the dislikes ;) Edit : Youtube can remove my comment but then I will just go around youtube , commenting this on every video ;)
318	2	Youtube, you really are a stupid one, arent you?  You say you want to protect creators...... yet you remove dislikes so people are more rude in comments.   susan has ruined youtube
390	2	Before:I can't find the real rewind because of memes about it  After:Wow this vid must be the"Greatest" video on YouTube it sure "doesn't have 19 million likes".
391	2	Now that the beloved dislikes button is removed, somebody should regularly post a comment on every youtube video that says "this is the new virtual dislikes button, dislikes are now numbered by how many up-votes/likes this comment gets".
732	2	if you did not understand why this add is problematic: https://everydayorientalism.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/a-global-message-of-unity-peace-and-understanding-pepsis-white-privileged-gaze-on-protesting-bodies/
77	3	Lmao, now lets see a video based on feminist toxicity, oh the feminist reaction would be awsome, but of course there are ads only for men, that in itself it disgusting and sexist towards men.
757	2	I mean it was ignored how he acted towards Miley Cyrus because she allowed him to act like a dog because she also has zero respect for him or his wife. This unfortunately doesn’t surprise me at all. The guys a doucheeee
38	1	Can we please talk about how much hate women give each other? We call each other sluts and whores and all kinds of horrible things. It’s not just men, women tend to try and tear down women everyday.
211	2	this song really doesn’t sit right with me i could be wrong and someone educate me but still. the song doesn’t show “white peoples struggles” it’s just a white dude stereotyping poc and the black dude not even debunking them. and then somehow they come to an understanding???
724	1	so this is the video everyone is offended about? you all are a bunch of pussies who obviously have way to much time on your hands to offended as something as minuscule as a pepsi ad.
613	2	Pepsi has slandered Trump amd other republicans, told his supporters to take their business elsewhere, and now made a commercial in attempt to support these stupid protests and they still cannot win liberals over. When will these stupid companies learn to just stay out of politics?
442	2	I’m coming back to this monstrosity 3 years later to say that I lost dislikes today  Rip YouTube dislikes 😔😭🙏 You will be missed by all , and future generations won’t be able to see the amount of dislikes this vid got and deserves
286	1	It’s a deep deep meaning why this world is how it is. They haven’t even cracked the surface but I see where they both using they head to explain both of their Society
811	1	Um...WHY does that guy keep grabbing his crotch?  This is such a misogynistic video, and i hate it!  And, Robin doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to respecting women...
424	2	Need a tutorial on how to download...idk mods   Look on YouTube  Click something random  Didn't know dislikes for removed  Sees 2k likes  Just be good  Click link  12 Trojans, 5 viruses, ransom ware from 8 guys, -2M bank account
254	1	Notice how the black guy didn’t say I’m not racist when callin out the whites but the the white guy said it meaning Joyner Lucas doesn’t think that blacks can be racist
370	2	👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
313	2	I somehow am part of the chosen ones who can still see dislikes and lemme tell y'all if this reaches 20M dislikes before I loose that privilege I'm screenshoting, printing and framing it
409	3	Hey guys, this ain’t a good video this is to inform anybody who thinks this vid is good because there are 3 mentally disabled people who liked it, although there were 19,000,000 regular people who disliked it… but the dislikes got removed.
527	2	A Black man is called a criminal & demanded to apologize when he slaps a man in defending his Black wife honor, when she's being disrespected. White ppl don't believe a Black woman has worth, is deserving to be protected from attacks. Look at how those racist senators attacked Judge Jackson. Maybe if Will was married to a white woman the slap would've been justified, hail a hero, doing the right thing.
60	1	1:02 - SMH look at this animal. Everyone knows talking to a woman you think is attractive in public is not cool at all.  You should only ackowledge women as attractive online where they can easily block or ignore you. All that confidence and bravado is just toxic and hurtful to society.
691	2	not saying people should be offended by this or not, but if you really don't see why so many people don't like this then you are tone deaf, oblivious to society, and just in a echo chamber. Hey if you don't understand why this commercial is controversial, instead of blaming a group for being sensitive, actually speak to someone who feels that it is...and actually try to learn just don't try to "win" an argument.
466	1	I don't understand why Will did that when he clearly laughed at the joke himself, I thought it was hilarious, a harmless joke and honestly wouldn't have taken any offense to that especially if that was a long time friend 🥺
190	1	i remember being a complete lefty when this song came out and now 4 years later i've completely switched, even though my opinions on matters have changed my love for this song hasn't, still speaks volumes especially now
132	1	If you think this advert identifies you as one of the toxic and are upset about being called out, that's not Gillette's fault . . . that's cause for some serious introspection
538	2	Every men shoot respect the woman my respect for Will Smith im very sorry to say this a joke is a joke but he when to far..he did not a reason to offen Will Smith wife like that.that is a no no for me.sorry my opinion.
311	2	Alright youtube even without dislikes being visible this video has 224 million views and only 3 million likes. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to imagine what's the engagement on the other button.
172	1	I long for the day when we will love each other for who they are on the inside and their actions rather than who they vote for, the pigmentation of their skin, the way they speak. There is good and bad in every race. White people aren’t always the bad guys and black people aren’t always the bad guys. On the other hand, white people can sometimes be the bad guys and black people can sometimes be the bad guys. Stop hating all for the actions of a few.
890	2	"The director said she intended for the video to subvert power dynamics, placing the men in an inferior position as the women ignored and mocked them." A concept being not the greatest contribution to gender dynamics/relationships.  Stupid concept. Stupid video. Stupid performances.
959	1	Fun fact: With 610,703 views per day, this song will reach current world population of 7.7 billion people on 27th August 2044! So, if you want to be the 7.7 billionth viewer of this song then come back to listen to this song on 27th August 2044!
421	1	Jesus is lord. Repent of your sins, be born again, and turn to him to be saved from Hell! Turn away from all your sins before its too late. I love you and God loves you🙏🏼❤️
572	1	He slapped the dog 🐕s[bleep] 💩 out of Chris Rock on prime time at the Oscar's  Them boxing lessons training for the role of MUHAMMAD ALI came in handy That was a sweet hook 🪝👌🙌😀
580	1	Will smith will not tolerate other men making jokes about his wife..he will however tolerate other men having sex with his wife..this is a man of principle lmao
88	1	I think this is to the man. To not be anything like what on the video and do the right thing    If there would be a girl one maybe do the name as think be for do things next time
70	1	Putting masculinity behind the word toxic makes it seem like a male only issue. It's a people issue. Everything explained by toxic masculinity is just toxic behavior in general
44	3	Happy to report that I have not bought a single gilette product since this, not one razor or any shaving cream. It was actually very easy lol, also stopped drinking coca cola.
21	3	you will be cantons, neither I nor anyone of my family nor friends will buy more Gillette. women also have men in the family who are good to look after us and love and tell an aunt to smile beautiful is something very beautiful we do not want to be treated as bitter beings less stupid feminaziz and more to respect the man who also deserves it.
375	3	They needed critical drinker to be in this, black conservative and Ben Shapiro lol…yaaa obviously Shapiro would never EVER do something like this he is a bit too mature for it lol. This probably made him lose a little more faith in humanity lol  Wow this was some woke trash lol pre woke trash being completely intolerable to watch lol
582	1	Will Smith was craaaaacking up!! He was even clapping. He thought that was genuinely funny. If his wife don't like having a gi Jane haircut maybe wear a wig.plenty of other people do. I go ripped at my wedding for balding I didn't punch anyone.
899	2	Thr song is creepy af,but this isn’t the only song that objectifies women not the only song that made women feel like objects but at least this song gets the attention that it should get finally; the bad attention that weird creepy ass men should get! The way he is looking at women as if they were steak on a plate ! Disgusting 🤢
871	2	I remember this song being a bop in 2013 but listening to it now, I’m glad that i was a kid at that time and couldnt speak english… would have fatal results. This song is fucking creepy
397	2	This wasn’t even that bad 😭 I always thought people said so because it genuinely sucked but now that I’ve actually watched it on my own and the entire thing it’s literally not bad at all.😩
758	2	Who’s here viewing this video for the very first time ever following Emily’s revelation? I believe her, however I don’t think he intentionally met to assault her. This is not the same case as Weinstein.
277	1	NEWSFLASH: blacks aren’t looked down on because of good black people. It’s because there are so many bad!  Eminem went against Trump for money.. Trump helped blacks more than any president in history.   The problem with this video is everything the black guy said is mostly inaccurate and based off feelings instead of facts.  Obama was trash and trump did incredible things for all races in this country.  HE DID HIS JOB!!
543	3	It's more shameful, imo, that a lot of other people would have sat there and took it. What if a comedian made fun of your wife and she had a condition, what if she was in a car accident and a comedian made a gimp joke TO YOUR FACE?   If he remained seated, and yelled something back, people would be saying 'wow, that was inappropriate'. People are saying shame on Smith for reacting this way. Hell, I say shame on the people who would have taken the insult.
178	1	I truly think that the black father will lead the black communities out of the dark times that have plagued black families for decades. Come on black dads….your sons, daughters and grandchildren need you.
284	1	This genuinely might be one of my favorite songs of all time. The lyrics and meaning in this song are so well conveyed through the music and the flow. Joyner, just know that you are one of the most underrated artists of this generation and that you deserve so much more respect. Everyone these days wants brainless music that talks about the same thing, but you provide something much more heartfelt and meaningful. Thank You.
779	2	None of the “women” are there under due rest. But sorry girls if you are happy to cavort about half dressed or undressed, then complain about it down the line, sorry I have no sympathy. You should have made better choices. Women are been assaulted world wide, don’t have that choice.
51	1	This ad inspired me to buy my own gillette shaver, i used to use my wifes boyfriends shaver but his was too harsh on my soft skin. Thanks gillette, now my patchy growth is trimmed to perfection. By any chance do you sell any products to fill in the bald spots on my chin?
878	2	26 march 2013.  I'm sorry, despite its countless awards and longevity records in the charts : this song is a big mess, which has aged badly.  😑 There remains the video which reminds me that I also love playing with my wife's ponytail.    😋    😁😂
138	1	Intervene a street fight today...you will get stabbed or shot! Let alone beaten to a plup by the perps gang.  Best size up the situation before super hero intervening. 👍
