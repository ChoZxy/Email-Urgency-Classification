74	2	I guess male lions suffer from toxic masculinity too. These dumb liberals will be looking for toxic masculinity when they need defending or protection, wouldnt they?
34	1	The 85k is telling.  Guess you have to unlearn a toxic, degrading and damaging  definition of masculinity to learn a healthy one.  The message was there and clear,but unfortunately fell on dead ears(85k)
919	2	Now this video has 12M dislikes. When the dislikes count will be removed, like this comment everytime you press the dislike button at this video to keep the dislikes button alive.
95	1	I get the issue that it's a multi-million dollar company preachings social justice. But I agree with the ad, it has something to say and it said it. But I don't know how I feel about it coming from Gillette, but I think that it's good that it did.
187	1	Is no one gonna talk about him saying that his grandmother was a slave? Maybe I'm just being nitpicky, but that just not true. It's possible that his great great great grandmother was a slave, but that's still not guarantee. Still a great song tho
183	2	Systematic racismü•¥... Still didn‚Äôt hear the black dude take accountability... imagine claiming to be a king or queen then cry whenever the actions of your own choices. Catch up to youüòê... Imagine that a country is so racist towards black people that you have to fake hate crimes to sound relevant... ü§´ü§´... I‚Äôm not racist... BLM is..
238	1	Being white, that had to be uncomfortable to have rap that guys line. I think this song represents what alot people think and hide and that is the problem with America . People say they aren't racist yet they either subtly do things or the people who over compensate to try act like they aren't. All u got do is spend few mins with someone
29	1	I think the only problem with the ad is that they mentioned the me too movement....I love cause men‚Äôs razors are no joke but girl ones are dull and dim & I‚Äôll still buy but this was a good commercial on men being good role models for the sons of the future but not cause they‚Äôre toxic...people are toxic - regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. People just need to be respectful. Don‚Äôt need to love each other but damn why do we all hate each other?
473	3	What an uncomfortable moment .. Will Smith showed his pettiness and cheap upbringing ... shame on you man! Your wife fucked around behind your back and you defend her infront of the whole world.. what an ass üôÑ
343	2	By using Opera , you actually can bypass their system of hiding dislikes.  As of current time:  3.063.325 Likes Vs 19.839.681 Dislikes By all means , your system of defense is useless. And thank for the youtube staff for helping me with the coding.
578	1	You can tell it was wrong or not but he protects the honor of his wife too.  Could he protect the honor at this moment whit words down from the stage? I dont know how but there had to be a other way maybe.    Chris is an total A**hole and starts whit the bad bad jokes dont forgott that fact.
574	2	Hey, Will Smith, that was the most gangster thing I have ever seen. Standing for your woman like that. And the second most gangster thing I've seen is Chris stand there and take it like a man when he realized he made a mistake. Love both of you.
2	1	Women also shaves, so why not make a commercial about them too? They don't differ much with men when doing violence and harassment. It's not the gender but the behavior. The message is not wrong but it implies what the femenazis are preaching about are the only truth.
358	2	Imagine being a new YouTube user unaware on how horrible the video is, *only* to be seeing the likes and immediately assume that the video is great and worth it to watch
754	2	I can‚Äôt believe this is aloud in pop culture- males like this hyped up for speaking about women like this but just put it to a nice beat and make a music video and it‚Äôs okay? God what world are we living in if this is the way pop culture is heading?
369	2	This would be the last day to see how many dislikes this video gets before they were removed entirely on the platform starting tomorrow. I'm seeing 19,942,500 dislikes as of December 12, 2021 at 11:43 PM CST. We would not make it to 20 million dislikes in time because of that!
500	1	As a working woman, I have it hard every day and making a lot less money.  It's called life, Will.  Unless you are god, there is always a boss and people who will disrespect you.  Grow the fuck up.
427	2	Comrades, this video has now hit 20 million dislikes                    SaluteüññThe 20 millionth disliker might have not known that they made this moment possible. A moment of silence for them.
529	2	His wife has alopecia. You should NEVER make a joke about that. What‚Äôs wrong with the internet? I‚Äôm with this with Will. Keep your mouth shut if it doesn‚Äôt concern you! Imagine this happening to you infront of everyone.. extremely humiliating! Chris deserved every second of that slap. GOOD FOR YOU WILL!
678	2	Wow-- the social justice pandering is VERY obvious.  Way to make the hardships of ACTUAL activists seem nothing more than a fun fad.   Pepsi-- just stop. You're embarrassing yourselves.
598	2	dont apologize its the right thing to do its self defense, making joke of your wife is not a joke , hire the best lawyer, sue the emcee with provocation, unjust vexation, harassment coercion intimidation
377	2	Ok, we all know this sucks. But can we get some recognition for JaidenAnimation for actually referencing PewDiePie twice in the video? Also that's actually the only good part of this trainwreck :D
496	1	18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. HOLY BIBLE
59	3	Such a terrible commercial, trying to indoctrinate men into being more feminine and less mascaline. Cut off your balls with a Gillette razor, that will reduce your mascaline!
440	1	I xont fully understand why this video got so much hate can someone pls explain to me y? Also i can still see the dislikes cuz i havent updated and as of now its still 19mil
213	1	Everytime I hear this it makes me think on a deep ass fucking level.i even talked to my friend with this playing and we talked about how life be and how other shit be hard in life.
609	2	I will never buy Pepsi or their many other products like Frito Lay. Vote with your wallet. If you find a company offensive don't buy their products. I didn't like Pepsi anyway.
546	3	I saw Will Smith laughing at Chris‚Äôs joke while that bald lady was rolling her eyes. Meaning Will Smith was pushed by the bald devil to go up the stage and disrespect Chris Rock. I admire you Chris Rock! And my family, relatives, and friends got your back. I am very disgusted of the Smith Family. I think their popularity got to their heads! Tsk tsk tsk. I hope this Will Smith and his family won‚Äôt be allowed to the next academy awards! And to the combine ones‚Ä¶
134	2	I‚Äôve not bought a single Gillette product since this add, even my my wife and daughters have not bought me any of their products for Christmas or birthdays. Dollar shave club all day long.
539	1	Total BS, puss move on Smith. Pretty tame joke. Rock didn't know Jada's condition. Will laughs at joke until he notices Jada is offended. Assaults Rock on National TV. A guy 50-80lbs lighter. It was a sucker...slap. Rock never expected it and why would he? If Smith felt something needed to happen, like a conversation...take it backstage. Never cared for Smith as an actor. Think less of him as a person. Kudos on Rock for taking the high road. Hope he can let it go emotionally.
396	2	The real reason the dislikes are being hidden, ladies and gentlemen. Not about creators being harassed, it's about corporations not wanting their feelings hurt.    Hit 20M dislikes before the end though. Amazin.
6	1	REAL MEN DON'T SHAVE. HAIR DOSE NOT GROW ON THE FACE TO BE CUT OFF FOR GILLETTE. Notice how all the old greats all had a long beard. There's a reason why all  jungle warfare special service have a beard an extension of one's self nerv endings making one closer to nature and his surroundings. I also prefer a hairy pie xxx
676	3	How dare eberyone have a go at kendall First of all she didnt write the script aint her fault Secondly, she is making the best of nad situations  So take your small little butt out of your chair amd suck it up for god sake people are sooooo immature
279	1	I'm Irish Republican an I really feel for both sides because we were enslaved by the British but I see the white man's opinions too but really why does rave matter honestly its do stupid
813	2	No one looks like they are having fun in that video!! It‚Äôs just totally awkward!! And now with everything Emily Ratajkowski wrote about it - it‚Äôs just creepy and disgusting üòí
365	1	Every comment is about the dislikes now. Life finds a way, Youtube. If you don't put back the dislikes, people are gonna start leaving. And it will all be because you were embarrassed about your video.
666	1	This doesn't even make any sense.  What does cola have to do with protests? And why would you give a copper a can? Is it done sort of show of appreciation for him doing what he gets paid to do and is not having any trouble doing since the protest is vitally peaceful and good natured?
356	2	Nice video, it couldn't possibly be the reason YouTube removed one of it's core features, making it impossible to tell if a video is good or not, yeah, definitely.
541	2	Will shouldnt have slapped him. Fight words..with words. Not hands. Will didnt do nothin to August after August screwed his wife. That type of disrespect to your marriage deserves a slap imo
418	2	As of me writing this comment, December 22nd 2021, the video has achieved the mythical milestone of reaching 20 million dislikes (20,561,275 to be exact), the first and only YT video to ever do so. Rejoice.
240	1	wtf is the MA music scene like we either get straight gas or pure ass it's like you get orchid, joyner lucas, dropkick murphies, james taylor and then gg allin like wtf
877	2	Eight years on, I still think this is awful. If this is still popular now, why weren‚Äôt people in 2013 still singing along to songs from 2005, which were generally better?
576	2	Her alopecia just looks like a small strip. It‚Äôs not a terminal disease!!!  Well, I have psoriasis, I don‚Äôt hit people whenever they ask me why i have red patches on my hands.
207	1	This is very good. However, I‚Äôll only point out that for humanity, Obama may have been responsible for many crimes. Trump as well. Those who are in power, not all have positive intentions.
13	3	How to alienate your customers. I hope this blatant misandry cost Gillette a packet. Interested to hear of any estimates on this. I will never purchase another Gillette product , there mist be others who feel the same way .
235	1	W-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-W !!! Just WOW! How thought provoking...could possibly spark up some MUCH-NEEDED, uncomfortable conversations...fingers crossed ü§ûüèæ  Bravo, Mr. LUCAS!!! You just may join the ranks of hip-hop's best...JESUS CHRIST, I could actually decipher the words (lol) - NO MUMBLEDY PEG!
526	3	Will smith is confused, I think he‚Äôs had an epiphany about everything he wished he was and isn‚Äôt. Playing the roll of a great man within his family I think has opened deep deep wounds for Will. He acted out another man‚Äôs calling and now thinks that is his calling and his redemption in real life, his chance rewrite his own story. I think that this role has exposed things he believed in as a Father and Husband.  I think he needs help.
174	3	y‚Äôall are so fucking retartedüò≠the fact that y‚Äôall think this song is good is concerning , all the white dude did was rap stereotypes about black people there is no agree to disagree cause he ain‚Äôt say SHIT but stereotypes on black people he didn‚Äôt make any points at all & the black dude barley gave important info this song is stupid & y‚Äôall all are literally pons & agree with anything y‚Äôall hear
176	1	I love this is the first time I seen this video and I am loving it we all need to stand together and get the old people out of this damn government so we can live a better life and watch the Next Generation grew up to be positive and strong
407	3	The most disliked YouTube video ever is this video made by YouTube. Even more than terrible media and corporations legitimately hated by millions of users worldwide. One of the reasons why they stopped showing the number of dislikes in November 2021. Shame on you(tube)!
667	1	WTF... ppl are "offended" by anything these.  Grow up and get a life.  It's a stupid commercial because it makes no sense,  but there's nothing to be "offended" about.
697	3	they v put in so much minorities and leftist bitches are still offended. just another proof not to ever ever bend under the pressure of left pundits and social media outrages. it never pays off.
319	1	Everyone talks about how they don't most of the ppl, but u have to release how hard it would be to get all the corners of yourube together and not just show the mainstream youtuber
46	3	What a disgrace this advert is. Shaming all men because of the very few. Should i feel ashamed because i am a man? I hope this gets taken down or something is done because, like sexism, homophobia and racism, this is just not right.
484	1	This incident just showed the world what a narcissist Will Smith is. This joke feels ridiculously entitled enough to strut on stage, smack a grown man on live television and curse him out, then has the audacity to act like HE is the victim. The most hilarious part? The way Will was crying and fumbling in his speech like a infant and acting all wounded and hurt when he was the one striking someone who had the class not to fight back was just utterly pathetic lmao
31	3	If I wanted to raise a failure of a son I would go of this ad. Boys will be boys is an actual thing. Same thing as females. Why aren't there any female toxicity commercials showing it's not okay to be manipulative and passive aggressive? This is a joke
506	1	This crying will Smith did was the best Oscar performance I've ever seen, I see how he was trying to manipulate the crowd and get them to feel bad for him, i bet Denzel coached will how to get the crowd on his side
383	2	Outside of Will Smith, I'm so glad I don't know a single person in this video, nor do I understand any of the references. I don't know if this is bad or good, it's just pure confusion. It to truly feels like a random assortment of visuals and spoken lines created by a not-quite-cutting-edge neural network.
765	3	Imagine walking around topless for a music video about sex, in close contact with drunk men whose brains are biologically hardwired to procreate due to evolutionary forces that have developed over millions of years, and complain that someone touched you innapropriately while they were intoxicated.
548	3	Will smith they should take your emmy award back. U promited violence. I thought money would make u have more class. Rock is another fellow african american. ‚òπÔ∏è
169	1	I am a German 16 year old guy and when that song came out in 2017 I was something like 13 years old and that was one of my favouriye songs. My English at that time was not to bad I could ask someone on the streets where the Train Station is so my English was enough good I guess but after three years now and getting more advanced at the language I understand everything in this song now and It's stunning me it's one of my favourite songs again.ngl
112	3	Now i will never buy a Gillette razor again. Did'nt know Gillette generalized all men. Apparently i am a criminal gilette tells me. Even though i have never done anything that they are describing in my life.
534	1	WIll should NOT use hormone replacement therapy !!  YOU NEED to have a BRAIN FIRST b4 you use that stuff !! (oh and FIND A REAL DOCTOR not the assclown you are using NOW) !!
453	1	What Will Smith did was unacceptable but Chris Rock should never make a joke like that especially to a sick person. I remember a couple years ago he make fun of Asian people. It wasn't funny and offended the Asian community. I'm not a hard person but sensitive topic like race, religion, personal life, politics should never be make fun like this to a certain level of extent.
90	1	Feels like the only people getting offended by this ad have to be the men that think this behaviour is acceptable??  I can‚Äôt see why a normal, respectful man would feel so attacked unless they were one of the perpetrators of sexual assault or toxic masculinity
387	1	A was a was as by years under the sea part by the UK or he a was just to of you but run run run run or the monster will  come and eat you get the I by under years race race race race race part of a real July is a mind And i am the elafant post it into the wlord splits in and  they come and run o they run run run run run run i wlas  quickly running from the moment and then they came and ate me
588	3	I am tried of people like Chris Rock that wait for events that honor our people to use a distasteful Joke at a time of being honored & Make it about them or to do a stupid act & when it turns out different then what CR & the Network thought would happen because usually our Men allow people to disrespect us on a Major stage & just laugh it off Stop this wickedness & people should open their eyes
379	3	I think YouTube's decision to remove dislikes gave us the decision not to have respect for him. Seriously, how can a YouTuber now know where people like content and where they don't?! How can you know the direction of the audience if there are no dislikes? It will be much more difficult for beginners in general. This will only benefit the silly children's channel. Youtube fucked up.
179	1	This song is way to powerful, meaningful, etc. Joyner hit a lot of certain points in this song and it just shows the divide in mainstream and in our world, this song just needs a lot more people to talk about it and get the idea behind it
428	2	By removing dislikes you are not protecting anyone, you are only making this platform look more like Twitter in toxicity. Soon this will be full of hateful comments. by the way, nice try  YouTube to stop having the video with more dislikes, but this video is and will always be hated, it is not enough to browse a lot to realize that most of them think that way.
417	2	Wow, I just wasted 8 minutes of my life. If only YouTube had some way to indicate to me that this might be a horrible waste of my time. Wishful thinking I guess.
252	1	This it how it should be...like the end of this video.black people have no fault.it s a game of mentality and history.the majority of americans are racists and this is the reality.
495	2	This is not about Will and Chris. It's about the power of Jada's vagina. She has affair, he runs back to her. She dislikes a comment then sugardaddy gets physical. Then the comment: Chris Rick is the host for a reason and everyone there expects him poking fun. Its was a mildly funny comment and he even said "l love u jada". Power corrupts...
36	1	I‚Äôm not sure whether to like or dislike this.  I‚Äôm torn.  I understand, somewhat, that they‚Äôre speaking to now cause and future effect but I‚Äôm uncomfortable with aspects of how they‚Äôre portraying masculinity.  And I‚Äôm not a man!
688	2	Why can't they do anything without having to drag sex into a commercial,¬† it's Pepsi !!!Not ky jelly, it's always got to be about, "Look at me, I'm so sexy, drink¬† Pepsi"¬† Dum as hell
406	3	Everyone knows this video has 19mil dislikes no point in trying to hide it from the world. YouTube, you are a huge wimpy little coward afraid of being disliked.
530	3	Quite honestly, he wouldn't have tried that shit if it was Dwane "The Rock" Johnson. I would like to have a Crack at Will Smith myself. He ever smacks me and he won't be walking away that's for sure. He's in for the fight of his life.
521	2	Where were all those who could have and should have came to Chris's defense? Why is Will to cowardly to personally apologize to Chris? He's more worried about his public reputation it seems?
686	1	People see things wrong with this because they're so butthurt with everything that happens in the world. Our society is so fucked up because people think they're so entitled to their opinions, and because of that, simple things like this, get blown up out of proportion. Get over it people.
294	2	One question: why he got so far and still claims that he work very hard? I always thought I will be thiner if I start working hard.... Guess I was wrong...p.s. I am 200lb
314	2	Moment of silence for 19 almost 20 MILLION dislikes before Youtube covers its tracks and hides the rewind! Like this üëçüèª! Remember that youtube can still see dislikes so keep disliking the video!
197	1	This hit the core from both sides! A lot to unpack, a lot. This video deserves wider publicity and acclaim for trying to talk about the perceptions we have of each other but also of the need to come down to each other's level to understand how deeply affected we are by our histories. I'll be sharing this video, thanks.
533	1	I can't believe Jimmy Kimmel isn't roasting them for doing this IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR! That self righteous hypocrite gave trump shit for going on a podcast, but has no problem with this fart sniffing contest.
836	2	The fact he is saying nothing about this speaks volumes. Guilty as sin. Not acceptable behaviour that may result in the end of his career. Personally I hope it does.
522	2	Joke or not he shouldn't take the piss about alopecia especially at the Oscar's he's got a whole different stage for that when he does his own comedy shows I'd of definitely done the same 100% well done üëè will and congratulations on the Oscar win üèÜ
344	3	What this video thaught youtube? That their little echo chambers of insanity will never be accepted by the general public, no matter how much algorithmic manipulation your corporate scum try to use. Your day will come.
125	2	Don't try to pull down the greatness of a man on some cheap political grounds. Be grateful that men were men. If we weren't, we would have been an extinct species.
307	2	remember, if we ever collectively forget how many dislikes this had, just remember 222 million people have watched this over the last 3 years and only 3 million of those viewers liked it
795	2	I am definitely not a fan of this genre.  This video only cemented this. The only thing I can say is karma can be a good thing or it can be a bitch!!!! If you haven't already... y'all will be the bitch!
193	1	I‚Äôm mixed and My mom agrees with the first part and my dad agrees with the second part but neither one of them actually understand the meaning but me cause they don‚Äôt wanna hear the truth
104	2	STOP ALREADY! I am a grown man, I will raise my family, as I see fit. I watch sports to get away, not be preached to, i use razors to shave, not to be taught on life. God gives me free will and thought. He does not impose His ways on me, so STOP media, stop Hollywood, Stop New York, imposing your views. IF I want values, I will go to the bible and or church, or wherever I see fit. NOT GILLETTE! Your ad is TOXIC.
600	2	If you don‚Äôt know, Chris Rock made joke about Alopecia, a condition/sickness that Jada has had these couple of years. Imo Will smith was right to be angry, many good husbands will also do that even in social settings. Chris knew he went too far with the joke but he took the slap well, fair play.
430	2	It‚Äôs pretty weird it seems like YouTube removes dislikes and says it‚Äôs for small youtubers but they also say that they will make a new rewind, Coincidence I think not
856	3	Emily grow up! How much did you get paid for this video....how much have you earned over the years showing off your body....why did you choose to go topless in this video, the other models didn't.......welcome to the real world.....
300	2	You can‚Äôt agree to disagree on oppression and racism. This white guy literally was spitting out the n word like crazy and at the end they just hug and say they understand each other? This song is just a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all equal‚Äù circlejerk bullshit.
474	1	Will Smith has not been fine since Jada did him wrong, honestly, we don't know if it's been destroying him, to the point where he now serves her in a toxic manner.  I'm not too sure about Jada, kind of seems like a toxic relationship now and Will is the one having to go it alone on the crazy roller coaster.  His actions were of a man who has lost all peace and sense of self, behave with class, not as a reaction of their character but as a reflection of yours.
227	1	Yo, i just can¬¥t belive in your country is ¬¥¬¥normal¬¥¬¥ be racist. Here in Brazil if someone think like that, he will be expelled from society by the population, and here in Brazil the majority are white. And before someone say ¬¥¬¥Latinos are not white¬¥¬¥ eat my ass, im problably more white than you all.
239	1	Broadcast this on all channels at the same time like an emergency broadcast and wrap all this bs up that‚Äôs going on. Getting old. Everyone black, white, brown, yellow, pink, whoever.
357	1	I don‚Äôt know what everyone else is on, but as of November 18th, 2021 at 4:58 pm(eastern standard time), YouTube rewind 2018 has 19 million dislikes as I watching this on my iPad.
241	1	Did anyone stick around until 6:43 and actually read? A lot of people in the comments need to read that... "We were all humans until race disconnected us, religion separated us, and WEALTH classified us." WAKE UP people. I didn't know who Joyner Lucas was before today. I just listened to 3 of his songs and he fuckin gets it. Spits hot fire while layin down a lot truth. Joyner's eyes are open wide.
597	1	I think it was real , but you can see though where Will walked away kind of embarrassed because it was more like a bitch slap and Will wanted it to be more but his hand wasn‚Äôt strong enough to put Rock down . It made Will look kind of wimpy but he was too proud and embarrassed so he walked away and acted like he wasn‚Äôt going to admit he couldn‚Äôt put Rock down  . Either way , it‚Äôs still assault but still  I do think Will was both sorry and embarrassed by his actions all the way around
897	2	Is anyone gonna talk about the goat being in endless pain while a nasty model wannabe hold him hostage like if I seen this lady holding this animal with no clothes I'd slap her across the faceüòí
452	1	I can't believe he wasn't escorted out. He slapped the fuck outta someone and the later they let him accept an Oscar? They're like, "But...That's the Fresh Prince...that's Agent J..." lol
230	2	5 years later and now it's a cops' fault I'm done with this fucking shit, but blacks can call me a cracker but i can't say nigga come at me I don't give a shit I don't use it to be racist.
558	1	Yeah sorry Will but my respect for you dropped after this. How could you defend a woman who does not love nor respect you. Shameful what we let these women turn us into.
880	1	Fuck Emily these girls love attention she was made famous and then came out with o was touched girl we got more serious things like actually girls that have been raped and need help
436	2	This will go down in history as the most disliked YouTube video of all time. Unfortunately; YouTube has freezed its own creation as the worst video until the end of time now. Congrats on being #1! Yay!
224	1	I love it when the teens on teens react to this were like agreeing with only the "black" side and just trashing the "white" side but when the ending came up saying to stop dividing race they shut up.
394	3	moment of the silence for disappearing the 19M  and YouTube is making YouTube rewind for 2021 how horrible new now we can not break 19 M record shame on You YouTube shame SHAME
10	3	So let me see if i got this right ? Now Gillette want men to be feminine right ? And they want men to disappear from planet earth ?! And they want men to stop being men !? Wtf ??
579	2	Good for Will Smith.    FINALLY   -   Somebody got what he deserved, Chris Rock. His sort always believe they can get away with anything until a dude like Will Smith shows him otherwise. Normalizing diminutives is what Hollywood and the world at large constantly do - everything somehow becomes "acceptable." This is also how the world of politics operates.   And as we well know ... sometimes a diminutive is the ONLY thing which certain people can offer us.   And otherwise, a big fat empty set.
846	1	I thought the song was catchy at the time but the video was shit and horribly misogynistic (didn't even know about the unrated version) and couldn't understand all the ppl calling it "empowering" to women, but ok I don't get that from a lot of the "woke" movement these days either. Now I find out it's ripping off Marvin Gaye and the singer was indeed a piece of trash... well HAH!
27	1	This advertisment relies on an incorrect claim that "toxic masculinity" is a male exclusive issue. In reality, its comparing apples and oranges when concerning the flaws of male and female behavior
23	2	Putting the toxic masculinity thing aside, have any of you noticed how the guys who commit the "toxic act" are all white and the ones who pull them back and act as the voice of reason are blacks?  Where would we whites be without the civilisation blacks brought us during the age of Empires... oh wait...
32	3	Just added one more Brand to my list of "DO not Buy" list.. Not just gillette but the entire P n G line...  Thanks for letting us know which side of the fence u stood on.
329	2	Imagine creating something on your own software that everyone hated and then being so embarrassed you decide to hide people's opinions. Kudos to the great team that has been making so many other wonderful decisions for YouTube.
106	3	Gillette is taking an $8 billion write down. They're blaming competition and millennials shaving less, but could the real reason be their anti-"toxic masculinity" ad campaign? Men built Gillette and that dumb Ceo with her personal agenda will destroy it. Have not bought Gillete product since and will never again. Now looking at all Proctor and Gamble products for elimination.
693	3	People are wondering why it's bad well because the world right is in a position for world war 3 to start and the video made it seem that protest are happy and giving a Pepsi to a policeman will solve everything. Pepsi gave the wrong message
237	1	I don‚Äôt know if Joyner will ever see this comment, but ever since I heard this song for the first time back in 2019 I‚Äôve viewed everything and everyone differently. So thank you this single song somehow made my entire life better.
276	1	threres alot of pain in this song . times really havent changed . sad panda. hate people .. they suck not blacks .. or brown . hispanic ... wtf is wrong with poeple ..
460	1	Just think.  If you would be in Will's place and someone makes a joke about your wife.  If you stay cool and don't do anything - you don't know what love and honor is.
3	1	Great ad, simple valid message. The negative responses just show Gillette did their jobüëçüèª, sulking because your reprimanded or advised to do better is defs what kids do.
748	2	BEHOLD, THE GENIUS OF PEPSI!!!!!. Lets take our add of of youtube to protect our brand, then continue posting adds on youtube for free, AND THEN MAKE AN ADD THAT DESTROYS OUR BRAND!!!!!. Give whoever thought that a raise, they totally deserve it.
447	2	This is the worst video in history and YouTube wants to hide it? The best part of the remind was 6:57 YouTube this is a big problem because this just shows how much of a coward you really are
403	2	Susan deleting dislikes because of her own embarrassment due to ruining this site with bs like this is honestly the funniest thing that has ever happened in Youtube history.
30	2	We need a commercial to tell me to be good? Gillette is a POS company. Real men are good and fight for what is right and respect everyone's rights. We don't need a commercial bashing us like the majority of us are like that. Never using Gillette again!
503	1	Good lesson to so called comedians making jokes which are too personal or offensive jokes. Well done Smith, you are a real man. F**k that comedian and f**k comedy. Oscar has its standard and dignity which does not need these kind of comedies.
98	2	When will these companies learn that insulting your customer base is NOT A GOOD IDEA! The self righteousness of these companies is truly sickening. I for one have now chosen to boycott Gillette, if more people do the same they may get the message..
217	1	I heard this song when I was just starting to get into politics. I supported the right and I still support Donald Trump but this song put a lot of things into perspective. The fact such a unifying message was allowed to stay up on YouTube from the time of the riots until now, is mind boggling. The one thing leaders are afraid of is a unified people.
392	1	Is anybody from sambucha just wondering   Honestly gg to YouTube got 19 million dislikes most on YouTube bro.  It so funny YouTube got the most dislikes on YouTubeüòÇü§£
852	2	theres really mfs in this comment section saying this shit is nostalgic and the lyrics dont matter... if this doesnt gross u out theres something wrong with you
487	3	He did THAT because she felt offended, yet she's been cheating on him with a guy that's her son's age and making Will the culprit. This woman is the greatest manipulator I'd ever seen.
464	2	I never liked Will Smith.  His TV sitcom was stupid, silly, and not funny.  His movies also were duds, except for I Robot.  Moreover, his wife is just as guilty also.  Will was laughing at Chris Rock, until Jada gave him that look to ‚Äúget him.‚Äù  Like sucking a dog on some one.  They both Need to be banned from all future Oscars ad Oscar events.  Idiot.
515	3	you make most people busy more then ukrain russia war + you should say sorry after slapping chris ( i'm one of your fans) but fu.. off + your apology  meaningless
122	1	I see nothing wrong with this, but that's just me. No, not all men are toxic but enough are, I think more men need to be more open instead of always seeing one side. but again that's just me
265	1	The white guy.. genuinely..just really thinks he's not racist..and just seems like he really wants to hear the black guy's opinion. Honestly..we just need..to talk...we don't need to argue all the time.
66	1	Man, Woman, who cares. Every human being is capable of bad and good. I get that there is a divide, but why can't everyone put aside their differences and works for a better tomorrow.
628	1	I am a Black American and this video is fine.  Anyone hating on it, needs to get a life.  First of all it's not a Black Lives Matter issue.  It's a police brutality issue.  And trust me if Jenner, Kardashians, Bieber, and all these popular Instagram folks showed up at police brutality demonstrations the cops would settle down.  How many people were brutalized at the woman's march in DC with all those celebrities?  Not one.  Kendall Jenner...YOU ROCK!
139	1	LOVE IT!!!! This is the kind of message we ALL need to see in ads...if school doesn't teach us how to behave...and parents don't teach us how to behave...and sitcoms glorify bad behavior...where else are we going to learn HOW to behave...and WHAT is truth...and how to REJECT false narratives? Our educational system has failed, parents have failed, now it is sadly left to commercials to set the world right!
