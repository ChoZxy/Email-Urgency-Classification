302	4	Nothing wrong here, move along
827	4	I think they should all be brought up on treason charges.  This was a coordinated effort by the media and US intelligence people to discredit Trump, accuse him of colluding with Russia, and manipulate the public into voting for Joe Biden.  It's not enough to say "my bad."  This is very serious and quite possibly altered the outcome of the 2020 election.  Those 54 intelligence agents at least must be brought to justice, mockingbird media aside.

416	4	What college are you in?
40	3	Ohh, it wasn't like that at all bro. There were GROUPS that were really sex positive, like now, but it was FAR from everyone no matter what year you are talking about. The thing that DOES freak me out is that the most sex POSITIVE people in the 60's-mid 90's are now the most sex negative.
724	4	This is just so not right.  What the hell is wrong with this country these days.  A woman, especially a victim in cases like this, has the right to decide what happens to her body. Perhaps the family of rapists should be held accountable for the actions of their criminal family member.  Enough is enough.

898	3	this art style is used way before than woke era like comics from2000s have ugly character designs.The difference is now only that is characters are more ugly , manly and censored and does not look like female at all. Idk why they hate and fear women and as for Japan most it can be done to censor female  fan service not the art style because even with realism Japan has many fit and beautiful people. So i don't think it's gonna change other reason because china will cuck them.
170	4	Imagine hating on low-tier doctors who fix your posture-related problems without surgery or drugs.    So I’m sure you don’t know this but humans don’t exist like they used to.  Sedentary life styles, unnatural to humans, can ruin posture, which can cause a litany of other health issues, especially all up and down your backbone.  There’s a very basic doctor that exists purely to fix these problems, they’re called chiropractors.  You’re welcome.
173	3	No, he's always been a he and continues to be a he going by the Japanese character page (via Google Translate), despite being voiced by Yu Kobayashi now. Oddly enough he's voiced by a guy in the English dub, once again proving that subs are always the way to go.

545	4	Corporate wokification requires ideologues to infiltrate the corporate structure. First middle management gets quietly subverted and replaced, then upper management, and finally, the CEO is ousted for having a wrong opinion. This take about 5-10 years in the US.  This is easy in American companies where turnover is high, but Japanese corporate jobs are very often jobs for *life.*  All those american cartoon producers who made everything you watched in the 90's/00's? They crashed out of the industry a decade ago, if not more. Meanwhile, you go to Japan, and the head honchos have been sitting in same office since the 80's, and they only got to where they are because the guy who was there before them died. Not *retired -* ***died.***  And this is before we get into the thing where they're now the adopted son of the owners of the parent company, whose family has owned the parent company since 1403.  What I'm saying is; Good fucking lucking infiltrating and subverting a Japanese corporation.

783	4	Part of the reason you have a bed frame is to allow the mattress to breathe and to stimulate air flow. With the mattress just laying on the ground it won't get airflow. If that happens, because of the moisture given off because of your sweat, it can lead to mildew building up in your mattress which isn't good for to breathe.  Is it wrong? Not really Is it good for you? Also no

439	3	Man, does anybody still remember that Pixar used to be good? They had these movies, that were important events of the year. Remember, when the end of the movie Sulley said 'Boo?' and Boo said 'Kitty!' and Sulley smiled? Or when Jessie said 'You never forget kids like Emily or Andy but they forget you' and it felt like a kick in your stomach?   And now you are supposed to care about if there are LGBTQIA+ elements in a spinoff of a tired franchise that has bloody Taika Watiti in it and Chris Evans is also excited to be a part of the Pixar family while playing an impersonator of the real Buzz Lightyear.   Fuck this shit.

I checked with the Berkeley undergrad office and agreed it was weird I haven't gotten anything and told me to check with Haas undergrad office. I called Haas Undergrad during their open hours and open dates and they have never answered me. I am now really upset because the supplements are due at the end of January and I can't reach any type of help in any way. Any suggestions? Or is this an early sign that they are planning to deny me? thanks

925	4	I mean, it’s all nice and well, but there are no repercussions what so ever. Plus the post is not really a credible source when it comes to news anyways, so everyone will just ignore it to be honest.
978	4	This is actually history repeating itself. Back during WWI the Spanish flu was killing more troops than the enemy. But by the time the 4rh wave came along nobody cared. No more news articles on the subject. No more prevention was pursued and the forth wave quietly killed more people than the 2nd and 3rd waves. Living through this now I can understand why people just stopped caring back then. Really hoping this doesn't become WWIII.

128	4	It's the same where I live in Scotland, it's a very religious place :/  Most houses are fairly spaced apart, though in the first house we rented our neighbours house was about 40-50 metres away. She was very elderly and always had a carer visit her, the only time I actually ever saw her was when my partner and I were playing Frisbee in the garden on a Sunday. We weren't being loud or anything, but because she could see us from her kitchen window she came out of her house to stand in her garden and glare at us. We lived there for about 2 years and as I said, that was the only time I ever saw her :/  We still live on the island but my partner and I are more relaxed about the whole "no noise on a Sunday" thing, we are a bit further away from folk now we've moved. I'm just about to start doing some work in the shed, I know it's not ideal, but I need to work to pay the bills. If they want to offer to pay the mortgage I'd happily not work on a Sunday!

711	4	That's funny, because I actually met somebody from Moon Studio. Won't name names, but the structure and work ethic that was described to me is vastly different from this.   >At Moon, video and in-person meetings were rare.  This studio already worked remote well before the pandemic, their team being all over the place, and hence made efforts for rewarding punctuality, accommodating for the needs of the developers, and was otherwise being flexible, so long as the work was well done. I was told they meet in person once or twice a year, but with the pandemic that probably went out the window, however the teams had calls daily and all members had to be punctual. Never heard anything about a language police, and the studio has some deep european roots, so I think the culture was probably aimed at not wasting time on bullshit. Also...     >The tech tools that helped the team communicate could also be used to monitor behavior.  Even if you use something like Slack, you still are bound by rules and studio culture/etiquette. Again, If you spam off topic things, hammer on with memes, etc. you get a slap on the wrist for taking up space. The pandemic had teams rely on these platforms. You can send memes via other means. Sounds like whomever placed the complaints has the mind of a child that thinks that game development is not a high stress and complicated endeavor, and probably felt that getting called out for off topic rants as "censorship".

694	4	Couldn't it be a mix of truth and lies? If I had illegitimately procured compromising information I wanted to leak I would find some way to launder the information. You could anonymously give a stolen laptop or a laptop with the data you want to leak to a third party and have them "discover" the information. Given the inconsistencies in the computer repairman's stories and his general lack of details about who left it there, and Giuliani's severe lack of credibility, to me the most likely scenario is genuine (or a mix of genuine and false) information released in a deceitful way, likely to cover up illegal or unethical behavior used to obtain it.

Once I made it clear that I was INFORMING them that I’d be out, and not asking, they let up. They didn’t press the matter further. Perhaps it was to save face, so they could think it was still their decision. I neither know, nor care. They could have fired me, and well, it is what it is if they did, I guess. They didn’t. There’s other fish in the sea, and it’s better to be away from trash like that. Might be a blessing.

She was pretty absent) and my brother stays alive for his kids, he does everything for them, and is determined to give them the things we didn't get with our parent/parents. (Unlike our mother.) They are literally his world. So yeah I feel like this is inaccurate.   I can see how this wouldn't be helpful, and how some people are straight up triggered by it. However, I refuse to belive that there aren't some people out there who just need to know someone actually gives a f*ck. (Saying this from experience too.) Knowing someone cares that I even exist is one of the few reasons I'm still here.    Now I don't belive this should be the ONLY thing you say to them.  Help them get help IF THEY WANT YOU TOO!  Ask if you can help in some way.(often times you may be told no, but this might be nice to hear for someone) Maybe see if theyd like to talk...hell some people just want someone to sit with them, and not say anything..... but for others these things wouldn't work.....    Anyway yeah hope my points been made. I'm also just talking from ordinal experience here!!!

850	4	I don’t disagree that alcohol is harmful to the user and those around them. But drugs can have very bad effects pending how the person that took them reacts. Like alcohol, people can get behind a wheel with under the influence of a drug and cause the same damage that a drunk driver would. Some people get bad paranoia from weed. Some people are angry drunks. Bath salts make people turn to zombies. Some drugs make people think they are invincible while in their system. Fentanyl can get a body count higher than the party is was brought into in minutes. Etc. all this stuff is based in the person taking it and how they react.

17	3	Carole and Tuesday had some explicitly racial narratives going. It was very woke.
85	4	I would’ve cussed that psycho out. Ain’t nobody bout to talk to me like that.
72	4	And plus what really annoys me is the fact that parents too encourage the little ones to believe that...for me especially my dad
689	4	>current prudishness & also weird "realistic" ungliness  >>spreading to japan  You don't watch much anime.
