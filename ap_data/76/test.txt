563	4	Because the reasons they give for making such changes are either rich people hate or full-blown communist arguments, nothing reasonable.
181	2	I tried to put my 24oz tumbler in the dishwasher. It didn’t fit, she isn’t stretched out enough.
650	4	I'm glad I got sex out of my system by having it thousands of times with my previous partners. I couldn't care less about it now. I got to the point sometimes where it actually felt like a chore. It's overrated
235	4	This is like Yelp with their pay us or we make you look like garbage revenue model.   If you don't pay for enough ad time on a news network their talking heads can and will shit all over you.
28	3	This isn't 2007, Reddit is almost as mainstream as Instagram or Facebook. The greasy neckbeard days are long over. We're all normies here.

469	4	United Nation's official page pleaded for Russian - Ukrainian hostility to fall under a mutual agreement to avoid the genocide but remained silent spectator on current airstrike in Damascus by Israel, no condemnation for US airstrike in Somalia, no concerns on Saudi airstrike in Yemen, disregarded everytime Indian brutality in Kashmir and continuously keep a blind eye on massacre of Palestinians by Israel.        Such a hypocrisy and deception in name of "Peace" and "Justice."   ***condemn war everywhere***

553	4	I like how no one mentions that the guy rolled 666
551	4	I know this doesn’t work so well with internet strangers, but I always try to let the person I’m comforting lead the way. Do they want advice, and what do they want advice on? Do they want words of comfort? What kinds of words make them feel comforted? Do they just want someone to listen? Do they want to be distracted? What would best take their minds of their troubles? Or do they want to be left alone?   My go-to comment is “I’m sorry your in this situation.” No unwanted advice.  No assumption of what words they actually find comforting. No forcing them to talk. Just a simple acknowledgment of the situation. Maybe throw in a “I hope things get better soon,” if that seems appropriate.

531	4	Yeah. Some definitely are. But certainly not all of them and it's still useful and helps a lot of people. Painting all chiropractors with the same brush isn't gonna fix anything. People get back and hip problems that can't necessarily be fixed by pain killers and why spend thousands on a surgery when there's a possible other solution? I don't even wanna know how you feel towards homeopathy lol

5	3	Up until a few weeks before Russia invaded. The left wing media was talking about how Ukraine was full of far right militias and nazis.   Just google or youtube it. Theres a bunch of stories and documentaries  pushing that narrative.   So who knows, maybe it took Ukrainw getting invaded for the left wing media to pull their heads out of their asses.

414	4	I’m 69. Drank moderately my entire life. Stopped doing pot a long time ago for my own personal reasons - waaay before it became legal in my state. An occasional beer, even one or two per day isn’t likely to harm anyone. I think people should lighten up. EVERYTHING in moderation and you’ll be just fine. That is, unless your screwing around with drugs that can kill you by virtue of using them.
237	4	I choose to be an organ donor because it helps others survive and my family doesn't have to pay for a vault and casket to be buried in the ground. Once they "gut me", plant a tree, throw away my ashes.... I don't care. I'm dead and I helped some people after I went out. Why take up space in the ground?
892	4	**Oh, FFS.** You're a fucking tunnel-visioned idiot if you think sex-negative censorship of entertainment is limited to the 2010s and beyond.   We've been dealing with pervasive censorship of sexual content in western (I.E.: American) entertainment for ***decades.*** The only thing that has changed is the ideology/party "in charge" and their "reasoning" for doing the censoring.   Regardless of whether the left or right has been in charge, one thing has stayed constant in entertainment: *Sexual content has always been stigmatized and censored.*  The only reason censorship of sex seems more evident to you *now* is because in recent years, expressions of right-wing political attitudes have come under increasing stigmatization and have thus started to be on the receiving end of censorship just as much as sexual speech.   Seriously. Did you ever notice how porn kept coming under fire in the 1980s and early-mid 2000s? Obviously not, since right-wingers still had significant control of the cultural landscape back then via the bible-thumping religious right. Why bother scrutinizing censorship of speech in general if your *own* speech isn't subject to censorship?  *Censorship of sex, fanservice, and (especially) porn has been going on* ***this entire goddamned time.***  The only reason why you noticed it *now* is because your political speech is now just as frowned upon as porn itself.   Welcome to the club, asswipes.

174	3	They want to separate parents right regarding their children. If you don't think so, you're not paying attention. Same with sex reassignment.
662	4	I think very few women are actually supportive of this. One of Thomas’s teammates anonymously gave an interview regarding how the women in the team feel unsafe in the changing room due to a certain member not covering up their penis. In the same interview she says that only ‘2 or 3’ women on the team support it, and only threats from higher-ups are keeping the rest quiet. There’s 35-40 people on the team, meaning that, in prime trans rights demographic (women at an Ivy League college), less than 10% are in favour. Although these are people whose lives are being directly affected, which is the kryptonite for most shitlibs support for ‘progressive’ issues, I think this is still one of those things were common sense prevails.

533	4	Opinion: We are overcompensating in cutting off Russia. I think that countries are doing too much against Russia. So much that it also has begun to hurt the normal folk in Russia. I don't get what the whole end goal is. Do they want a civil war to happen in Russia, or do they want Putin gone? I mean sure cutting off huge state companies could be effective. And don't get me wrong, Putin is a dictator. But banning Russian gamers from networks, banning Russian animals born in Russia, even banning russians themselves? That would only amplify Russians hate against the west and hurts people in a bad way. And the hate against anyone who is Russian is also dumb. Almost like people hating all muslims because of ISIS.

679	4	Unpopular opinion  The U.S. should end WW3 before it starts. Russia will not stop with Ukraine. From what we've seen, Russia's ground troops are weak and they don't really want to fight Ukraine. It should be relatively easy to topple Moscow and free the Russian people.  Nukes, nukes, nukes... Here's another unpopular "opinion": I highly doubt any of Russia's 1980s technology nukes work. Even if they are operational, that's no reason to just let Putin do what he is doing to Ukraine. Fuck him. Let's go to war already!

690	4	This nominee needs to be postponed until we know if our president has been compromised
794	4	This is what happens when the people in charge of a society lose their power: they start desperately lashing out at anybody whom they perceive as responsible.  It used to be that the media was a respected institution and a bad press article would destroy you.  Now, the legacy media is probably one of the most hated groups in America, and deservedly so.  I'm glad that celebrities are banding together to support each other against the worst excesses of the cancellation mob.  Russell has always been very brave about speaking out for truth, even when it wasn't popular.  Of course it was only a matter of time before our elites ordered their lackeys to come after him.

413	4	Agreed. The problem is that there is a larger, more visible market for exclusive teenage girls. For example, teen girls have music made exclusively for them. What music is made just for teenage boys that doesn't also have a large fan base of teen girls, adult men and adult women? Teen girls are an easy target.

The entertainment industry at all levels, even voice acting, has clique-like tendencies and will protect those who are “in”, and Daman is definitely in.   Duncan would have needed to have been a saint and have a will stronger than Jacob to “win” this. He was not. Daman will get to continue on with a slap on the wrist if the parties involved even want to give him that. That’s just how the industry works.

693	4	I have mixed feeling about this as a medical student - I have seen 16, 17 year olds with bat shit crazy hipster antivax (not including Covid vaccine) parents who never let them even get the chickenpox vaccine that want it now. And these 16 year olds are plenty mature for their age.   Even yesterday I had a patient in the ED who had a bad bike accident and got really scrapped up on the trail. He never had a tetanus shot and his parents said no to a tetanus shot now. But the kid wanted it.   I think excluding Covid shots, a 16 year old should be allowed to get some of the true tried and tested basic vaccines against parent will

Never a chance to rehabilitate and become better humans who can actually take accountability and not commit crimes. Y’all are why our prison system is fucked.  Edit 2: I’m literally saying the guy who was assaulted is a great guy for doing something many of you dumb fucks do, kick and punch someone who is not even fighting back anymore. Just hold the fucker down and call the cops. Permanently damaging someone intentionally is literally no better than assaulting someone randomly. 2 wrongs don’t make a right. There’s literally a reason we have the prison system, there’s a reason we need to fix it so people stop going in and coming out worse. The majority never stop going to prison after escalating their crimes. Jesus… if you exist. Just… take me out, I’m done with these people. Looking for any goddamn excuse for extreme violence. This guy in the video deserves a medal cause nobody else is clearly willing to have the same restraint. Fucking cock suckers.
