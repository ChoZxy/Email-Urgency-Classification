887	4	This is true even anecdotally, without looking at the data. Most Americans are simply angry that undeserving "lazy" people receive welfare assistance, but just because you don't like the people that end up receiving welfare doesn't mean that there is fraud going on, and if you talk to welfare recipients, respectfully, it becomes obvious that most aren't going to split the atom any time soon. They couldn't commit fraud today if they wanted to, and if they manage, it won't be for long. It's very rare to find an actual case of welfare fraud and when you do find one, I bet that it will be someone who doesn't qualify somehow ripping off the government, probably someone with some financial, economic, or other university-learned training. So, not a poor person most likely. Like how all the pandemic relief assistance programs aimed at small businesses actually ended up being exploited by fortune five hundred companies. People just see what they want and the poorest people are low hanging fruit, so we get all these stereotypes about "welfare queens," especially from the political right wing, going all the way back to Ronald Reagan.

803	4	Indians look bad because they're discouraged from personal grooming and they're ingrained not to care about their looks. For ex , my brother was given a lot of shit for picking up stylish hairstyle rather than a nerdier one. Also Indian genetics are more predisposed to have higher body fat and Indian diet has least protein.   Also taking care of looks requires effort and Indians don't put in effort.

Even if the drawing was cartoonish, it is a representation meant to depict a certain thing. A drawn banana is still a banana. A drawn child is still a child or the depiction of one. When people start saying "it's not real, it's just a drawing" about anime CP, that opens the door to saying "it's just a photo, it happened a long time ago" about real-life  CP. It's disgusting, it's pedophelic

331	3	3 months 12 days :(
473	3	Think the biggest factors will come down to two things: international business and homegrown Japanese 'SJWs'.  For the first, you have no better example than the Kadokawa situation. There's plenty of big companies with a lot of power and control over a large number of IPs (directly or indirectly) that wish to follow in the internationalist footsteps of Shinzo Abe, and open the market not just to a wider range outside of Japan, but to capitalize on already-established overseas businesses and institutions in an attempt to make more money.   This has some positives, in the sense that in theory it could lead to more publishers taking the HoloLive approach of making ground in their business by establishing direct lines to different regions (for example, you could possibly have a Shonen Jump branch in France exclusively for direct translation and publishing as quickly as possible). But overall, the negatives quickly outweight any positives (already provided by fangroups) due to how much easier and cheaper it is to just capitulate to external standards. So many games new and old being censored for overseas 'consumption' by localizers; or worse, when developers and artists are self-censoring from the get-go in order to fit 'sensibilities' outside of Japan. For the former, you have shit like DMC5 and Atlus games; for the latter, you have Squeeenix remasters and the RE3R art director.  &nbsp;  As for the second point, I hate to break it to anyone that still hasn't caught on, but the ideological problem we are facing in Western nations is prevalent in most developed nations, Japan (and Poland) included. There is no Great Japanese Firewall preventing the same tactics of subvertion being utilized to undermine what makes Japanese media unique and enjoyable. Now, it is true that the Japanese SJWs equivalent aren't exactly the same as those stemming from the Anglosphere, for example; but having conversed with people both on this sub and outside it with knowledge of the situation, it is clear that their goals align in several points, and that they run in similar circles.  There would not have been a push by Taro Yamada, to rally otakus and other enthusiasts against the threat of censorship and subversion of media, if there wasn't already a push from within the country. If it hadn't been for the coof, how far would things have been taken by government bodies and big businesses to hide away all the 'icky' material that outsiders would have been exposed to during the Tokyo Olympics? Because there was already rumblings going on (heh) regarding those matters back in 2019.  &nbsp;  To summarize: Japanese entertainment will go woke if Japanese businesses do the exact same things that most Western institutions and businesses did when faced with that challenge. If there isn't a big enough push, externally and internally, to denounce and tell the moral busybodies to fuck off, if they take the knee and concede, it'll only give more ground to those that wish to ruin that media. Furthermore, if we continue to get western talking heads (like 'anime Youtubers') all talking about anime with the same methodology as progressive ideologues, always denouncing 'problematic' material and giving concessions to the activists, then that will only further tell the CEOs and artists within Japan that are straddling the fence, that if they want to get pull outside of the Land of the Rising Sun, they have to make constant concessions to fit "western sensibilities".  Japan might be in a better position than most, but that doesn't mean they are immune. So it's in your best interest to demonstrate and exemplify why it is that you enjoy and indulge in Japanese media more than Western (or at least, with more gusto), and hope to fuck that those that would agree with that position inside the country become 'redpilled' (as it were) to the situation in the West BEFORE the gates are opened too much. Gatekeeping is good.

7	4	It is a giant pendulum that swings back and forth, back and forth.   When you are on one of the extreme ends censorship and authoritarianism are at their peak. The group got power and now they will violate all their ideals to keep power. No more talk of freedom, you do things their way. However, the group that is not in power will be pushing for freedom and open discussion because it benefits them.  Eventually the in power group turns everyone against them and they get pushed out and the pendulum starts swinging the other way. In the middle you will have peak freedom. The new group isn't strong enough to force their rules on everyone and they are still fighting to tear down the old rules. That's and awesome time to be.  Then the new group gets power and it swings to the other end.  The pendulum swung more than once. Between the 1960s and the 2000s the hippies collapsed and the Christian conservatives of the 80s took over under Reagan. They a counterculture emerged in the 90s coming to peak in the late 90s, early 2000s. Then that counter culture itself became oppressive.  The political pendulum is always swinging.

56	3	It’s not going anywhere. Society is trending towards being more focused on realistic appearances and depictions of people. This is a movement decades in the works. We have been trending towards being less shallow in our media for a while now, it’s just being pushed harder and harder the further progress is made. People are impatient for the future and so now instead of a steady trend the curve has spiked. It will receive backlash and counter culture as a result, hence this post, but progress marches on.

25	4	Why is the war between Ukraine and Russia gaining do much attention globally? What other interests does EU oil giants have with Ukraine other than trillions of dollars of Oil?   Browsing reddit I see everyone piling up on  Russia for Ukraine invasion without even considering the other side of propaganda. I believe Putin has always been a bad businessman and must have always been a thorn in the OIL giants of EU and US. With Ukraine being led by a young leader who wouldn't take shit from Russia, I believe US and EU are not doing this to 'Help humanity' or Help 'democracy'. All this loss of life in last century or so has been associated with OIL giants. When it comes down to it,  OIL giants just want a different , like minded puppet as a Russian leader rather than an insanely egoistic maniac like Putin. I don't wish anyone harm and am not ignoring how sophisticated situation is. Yes, there are more reasons apart from OIL interest but all that has been winning in last century is human greed.   People pretend to be so uptight but when you take a moment to read last centuries wars, it's a struggle for  power and greed mostly motivated by natural OIL reserves. The Oil tycoons out there have been using everything that they can to pit people against people, countries against countries while being rich moment by moment.
289	3	The “How do you do fellow kids” energy is strong with this one.
197	3	I mean just don’t show up. It just sonic
11	4	Bro can you unzip that for me
988	4	Like 20 years once old sane people are no longer in charge
628	4	What do you think those camera lenses on your phone are for?
233	4	Oh, silly me, and I've just applied to Moon. Yup, within the last 5 minutes.
734	4	Man, American police officers come across as real cowards lol.
655	3	Last anon doesnt know what trade deals are, apparently. They've already been shilling that for decades
242	3	Sauce? Need to add this to my collection
276	4	I'll take the router, sell it, buy a cable, and have $495 and a cable
77	3	Actually, now taking 200 damage is not lethal anymore. Overshield was added and gives you a total of 250 health.
916	4	It's as plain as day to the rest of us.  I just cannot understand why so many people don't see what is going on.
698	4	God sank the titanic out of spite
444	4	Oh no, your X- Box is no longer handily connected to a platform known for unrepentantly distributing child porn.
594	4	Ignores the primary lore of the series. Changes Master Chief's and Cortana's role considerably in favor of focusing more on a so called "woman of color" (I guess Asians are only POC when convenient now). Nah. Fuck this entire series and everyone who worked on it.
67	3	Hey, as long as their fantasy depictions are still sexy busty women macking on each other, I'm all for it.
89	4	I've become so much like Eren Yeager, it's scary
393	4	To think I thought she was actually normal at first
154	4	Ooooof have some of that
673	4	showing pillows will not make me laugh
417	4	Only thing is think about the actual horses. Probably wouldn’t be the best for them if consumers used them as vehicles.
299	3	pray for Russia! when it was the middle east and Africa no one cared , but when it’s little white babies and women we gotta bend over for them!
726	4	Recently I haven’t been able to finish any films or tv series at all. They continue way past the point where they should have ended. This is especially true of sci-if series. They start well but slump in the middle, and I lose all interest.
199	3	If you want an idea who to avoid and who to go with, I'd reccomend browsing through this.  https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Category:Writers  1D4chan does a good job explaining who is good, who is bad, who's in the middle, and why. Obviously, don't follow it as an absolute rule, because occasionally they can come out with something good, but this makes a good place to start.  EDIT: Be aware, it does include a handful of people like Tolkien, Asmiov, and C. S. Lewis, but most of it is BL folks.

943	4	Are you interested in learning real swordsmanship? Are you a fan of Skallagrim or Schola Gladiatoria? Have you always had an interest in historical weaponry and fighting techniques?  Join the **Historical Fencing Club** of Berkeley(AKA Steel on Steel)! We use full-weight and well-balanced replicas of weapons such as the [medieval longsword], [Renaissance-era rapier], and [Napoleonic military saber] along with specialized protective equipment to learn how people fought with real swords throughout the course of (mainly European) history.  Using illustrated historical manuscripts from fencing masters like [Fiore dei Liberi] and [Charles Roworth](http://swordfight.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ART-OF-DEFENCE-ON-FOOT-1824-Fourth-Edition.pdf), we reconstruct their understanding of how to effectively fight with swords in dueling, self-defense, or military contexts.  No applications or dues required! Just sign up to our email list here to receive updates on our weekly meetings: https://forms.gle/CptU4mg5h3rYLp1G9  And/or join our Discord: https://discord.gg/PqQtkM5YVU  You can expect meetings to take place in the afternoon on the weekends on campus, and take between 1 and 2 hours each. Additionally, we may have occasional or regular sparring sessions during the week.
446	4	Stop putting Democrats left wing. I'm going to get downvoted for this but it's one of the many things that prove  a clearly how much this sub has shifted to the right. Dems used to be generally acknowledged on here as Authright, Centrist, or Authcenter.
482	3	this is lame, not only not helping Ukraine but also painted NA/NATO in a bad taste eventho NATO wouldn't really bother a name of a space foundation, why would they do such thing
525	3	Just remember that the Russian soldier ate their against their role
768	3	Unlike before I'm actually fully onboard this time.  Press "enter" to see my dialog options.
635	4	At least this is an actual unpopular opinion.  You’re still wrong but take the upvote
267	3	But does she have a cute little bottom.
370	3	Oh I'm submissive and breedable
915	4	I wish all racists did this when you confronted them... this shit is hilarious
678	4	I'm starting to feel like if we had unambiguous, full coverage video of him planning the entire thing (pre-election) down to the last detail, he would still be a free man.
837	4	And you're on reddit, get off and do your homework
967	3	Lib: “Please we like gay folks a lot and they’re pretty unhappy from continued historical mistreatment.”  PCM: “that’s not real, and if it is you deserve it. Look guys gay folks are sad that must mean they’re wrong!!”  I think a lot of y’all are pretty mean sometimes.
559	4	Invite me so I can check :)
842	4	Sorry bro, they are now part of the State mandated gf program, they even got social security number, we will be gentle.
568	4	What is the significance of the colour pink here?

878	4	The same reason I’d defend anyone else against the government
109	4	WH press secretary: "no idea if that's true"  Translation: it 100% is true and we are creating distance by playing dumb
148	3	It’s insane to me that so many people have realized the middle eastern wars have been BS and the war mongering Neocons and leftists played the American people.   And all of the sudden the propaganda from the west stopped? Russia and Ukraine showed that Americans are still as dumb as ever when it comes to foreign policy.
99	4	15 years too late lol
381	4	They realized conservatives are happier so they want to outlaw happiness?
345	4	Not all Germans, I guess. My neighbor here in my Belgian apartment is a German, and she's loud as fuck all seven days a week.
134	3	Who do you think you are you can tell people reality and truth?
544	4	This article is the most BS I’ve read in awhile… I love the last paragraph, pretty much saying all I wrote in this article is BS, “will reaffirm that President Biden’s policies coming into the White House did not help..” Then trying to recorrect again in the last two sentences… I call this talking MFing circles.. beat my head against the brick wall..
244	4	The thing is, alcohol is a drug, and drugs harm others too, depending on the drug type and the harm we’re talking about. Emotional harm can be devastating. You’re by no means wrong by saying alcohol is terrible, but other drugs can destroy lives too
135	3	you are now canonically my crush. that looks really well drawn
590	4	I'm withholding my praise for them to see if they bend the knee. If they release a statement saying, "Our 'corporate culture' is quite salty and we're  not apologizing for it. Don't like it? Sod off!" then everyone should give it venture capital.  Won't bet money on it.
158	4	If you have 400 fps for a game that runs at 60, do you really have 400 fps?
459	4	OP. I just want you to know that you are not alone, and there are many people in the world that loves you.
368	4	I started a book club at the start of the pandemic and we're going into our second year now! We'll be reading Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie this month. If you're interested in reading more and making friends, please consider joining us! We're a very friendly and casual community.  We meet Sundays at 1pm PDT on zoom. We hold reading discussions biweekly and have socials (online or IRL) in between.   There are no application requirements, just come on out!      You can message me on reddit if you have any questions!
838	3	Probably because their brain dead followers believe it. God knows I keep seeing them popping up in gas price threads spewing that talking point.
884	4	I have taken videos of the aftermath of my attacks. (idk why...i don't post but i keep them idk) but yeah dude a panic attack feels terrifying. personally i feel like i cant breathe and i need to hide in my bathtub to ground myself to something. I seriously don't understand how one can go and grab their phone in those moments.   I think people confused panic attacks with being upset or crying too often. It isn't the same at all...
366	3	Dudes got balls dumping those bombs at a Popeyes. Every single Popeyes or Church's I've seen is 6 feet deep in your local hood. Fuck him, btw.
405	3	Give me back my dog.
946	4	I believe one man made a post at some point, very well written, on how miserable it is to not realize the toilet seat is up. His balls touched the cold ass water, and mf found out. It's just common courtesy, if you CARE about everyone in your house, if you've ever stumbled into the bathroom at 2 am needing to shit or piss and didn't have the light on, if you've ever went, hey, i don't want microscopic bits of my poo to be flung about my bathroom as the toilet flushes, then maybe, just maybe, you should close the damn lid.
425	4	The scary part? His core base of voters don't care. People died on Jan. 6, and yet the overwhelming majority of the GOP wants to sweep the whole event under the rug.   At this point, what evidence could be brought up that would change his political power in the party? Even if Trump somehow gets barred from running in 2024,  his replacement is likely to be a Trump-sympathetic candidate along the DeSantis model.
927	4	Not all unpopular opinions are unpopular opinions. It is better to have a bad frame for many reasons
911	2	Did he pull some “You know who I am” bull corn or just being his typical weasel self?
865	4	cya man. i'll be outta here fighting some more demons. come back if you ever want.  *walks away while doom music is playing*
941	4	Well its another excuse to censor not only opposing speech but also the info about all the grooming gangs, muslims throwing acid on people, stabbings and all that shit.
50	3	Amateur. I refer to the stuff of my brother as my stuff (including him).
343	4	i dont think you can escape this homie, fake your death and start a new identity ASAP
186	3	I never doubted that Conservatives were happy. They have 8 million songs about just being a simple man drinking moonshine on your dirtfarm and loving your truck more than your 600lb wife.  Then again, they have the highest suicide rates. Lowest suicide states are NJ, NY, MD, MA, and RI. So maybe it's a southern hospitality thing to say you're happy just before you blow your fucking brains all over the cab of your F-150.
815	4	Jokes on you, I am turned on by the top one
784	4	Well, I am once again reminded that our favorite subreddit is full of heartless fucking ghouls.
529	4	This whole thing is just a big game of sports-like fanatics and validation-seeking for the insecure.
184	4	I'm throughly convinced my grandpa willed himself to death once he realized that hospital bills could ruin his saving for his kids. Once he went, he went fast. No lingering in a hospital room
642	4	They didn't say anything new that wasn't in the previous article.
478	3	it is not cuul to juul in schuul
338	4	time for daddy anant to step up to the plate
254	3	My state has zero income tax but high sales tax, which hits lower income.  Lets have fair tax and claw back some from the .01%.
817	4	Of course, everyone knew that at the time, but now they can get it out of the way and call it old news by the midterms.
285	4	The fine should be magnitudes higher than the initial offense.  I don’t see a deterrent here.
677	4	Dexter's mom got slaughtered by a chainsaw in front of him when he was 3 year old
777	4	Ah, well, at least they hit the mandatory "diversity quota". No white men! Yay! Set aside the fact that Chris Redfield is essentially the main protagonist and the face of the franchise, closely followed by Jill Valentine and Leon S. Kennedy. I mean, why is one of the best gaming franchises ever subjected to such humiliation for decades? It's a fucking sad state of affairs that the best and only movies somewhat worth watching are a bunch of Paul W. S. Anderson fanfiction to advertise his wife and a mediocre quality 3D animations... Won't even bother commenting on the latest Hollywood abomination. And now this...   Jesus Christ, how fucking hard it is to make a watchable RE movie? You have ~26 years of lore, all you have to do is to bring that to the screen. Fans will love it because they love the franchise and normies that don't know what RE is will love it as well. You don't need to reinvent the fucking wheel and change everything from the source material, the source material is already good enough for a zombie flick.  I'm starting to think that Hollywood is taking advice from Cinema Sins and their most retarded phrase "The books do not matter" as in "The source material does not matter" and doing the impossible to butcher the source material, no matter how good it is.
829	4	So there IS something Biden can do for oil production! Who would've thought? 🙃
550	4	My guess is between 5 to 10 years. Until the elites decide they already made the world ugly enough, so it's time for them to pretend once more that they are the saviors, ready to make the world beautiful again.  Really, it's up to the elites that are behind the ESG crap that itself is ready to support corporations for pushing something that most people won't support with money, all to support the trending propaganda.  If it continues for too long, my hope is for counterculture to become stronger against the ugliness worshippers.
875	4	WW3 good. Sign right up golem!
824	4	Also just a reminder this is concerning no bad health should be wished on anyone.
982	4	I dont have a partner
179	3	Stop using toothbrush to protect our God designed teeth!  Is toothpaste in the bible? No, because your body is perfect.  Coming to you soon. Or else it is all hypocrisy.
749	4	Thanks , now I know a country stretching for half a continent was never aggressive towards it's neighbors or anyone at all 👍
226	4	thats very confusing and hard to agree to, upvoted

357	4	OK, I'll bite. Why are depictions of naked people who aren't real unacceptable while depictions of people who aren't real getting murdered are acceptable?
257	4	If you happen to be a liberal democrat browsing this sub……  Honest question…..     How do you feel now? After seeing all that has happened in the last year?
223	4	Fuck Brian Warner.  There's a trail of bodies and broken people behind him and he's a giant shit stain on music and society. I've felt this way for nearly 30 years coming from South Florida.

906	4	I just use her real name

660	4	TIME FOR A VICTORY LAP, LADS. RIGHT AGAIN! Or do we not longer trust the science and science isn't real now?
666	4	Get it done. Just like they are. If you hate hearing sex, wear earplugs.  I guarantee this is not a problem that will exist past this point in life.  But jealously will. Forever.
55	3	I'm assuming it's a he-she that won by a lot? I just woke up and am half dumb. Not full dumb yet lol
700	4	The penny has practically no value and should be taken out of circulation just as other coins have been in US history. You can’t buy anything for a penny; vending machines and parking meters won’t accept them.  Harvard economist Greg Mankiw stated, “The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange. The penny no longer serves that purpose.
380	3	R34 artists: am fuck as fast boii  Hol up
350	4	I've had panic attacks and anxiety attacks a few times  The ones I think were full blown typical panic attacks I remember essentially shutting down and largely unable to respond at all the slightly milder ones that I think would be classed as anxiety attacks like the one I had recently I was l largely non verbal but was able to type.
631	4	Did you know that breating oxygen makes you a literal nazi!?!?!?!?
62	3	LPT plastic silverware can often survive multiple trips through the dishwasher also
215	3	Old people don't understand that because minimum wage, corporates don't have to raise salaries and can get away with underpaying people who work for them for years.. So I blame greedy corporates 100%.. My father started as a bus driver and was until he retired. At the beguining he could barely support the living costs of two, even with my mother cleaning stairs every day. But as the years passed he got little increases that little by litle allowed him to rid himself of debt, have 3 children and still manage to help us 3 in our adult life everytime we struggle financially.. The problem is not the starting wage.. If you have no experience you're expected to earn less, but after 5, 10, 15... years you should be receiving more, but you're not and that is the problem!
534	4	I mean, nowadays they seem to have anything and just pump it full of "le drama" with the actual shit you wanna see almost as filler.
182	3	Modern TV sucks in the US and Europe. If you want the good shit, watch something like Office Space.
487	4	Libbies are lickin' their lips at the possibilities...
653	4	Putin is the Emperor, Zelensky is Darth Vader and Biden is Luke Skywalker, right guys!!!
742	4	i cannot believe that i just read that "sharing on twitter is a handy feature on xbox", tell me there is a more contrary and unintelligent phrase out there than this?.
360	4	I would like to argue with you but that would be rant shaming and I don't think that's appropriate for me as a non ranting person.
876	4	The Left:  Can't afford to pay their student loans  Also the Left:  We all need to be driving an electric car which costs about $1000/month ($50,000, 4% interest, 60 months) which saves us about $250 a month on gas and a three time a year oil change).  Also assuming you have a one-car household.

883	4	Who cares? Let them win. If they lose and the Dems are in power they will just keep clucking along. Nothing meaningful happens either way. Nothing gets better.
474	4	Wow. A non offensive. Truly. Unpopular opinion.  Well done.
630	4	What are them Duke boys up to now?
412	4	Im all for sanctions on russia and all that other good stuff. But lets not forget the countless african americans that were killed by americas racist founding fathers, and the countless native americans that were killed so americans can “own” the land they own now. Let alone all the innocent women and children that were killed in iraq and afganistan.
97	4	Stop it. Every time I see these posts it reminds me of the cringe things I did in my past…
973	4	Greenwald misquoting and omitting information in order to disinform. Nothing new.
394	4	I'll be an optimist and say that it won't be as long as you think.  Currently, it's mostly AAA studios pumping out games with ultra-realistic graphics, which is unsurprising, as these are the companies shelling out the money to develop the tech.  Big AAA studios desperately avoid provoking the woke mob, especially since journalists will never take their side. Thus, no sexy female characters because "objectification," regardless of how said characters could be written.  However, when more advanced graphics tech becomes more widespread and accessible to indie devs, I think we may see a shift.  On another note, there are many stylized "non-realistic" games that see massive commercial success - Hades, Celeste, and uhhh Nintendo stuff in general. I don't think shareholders/executives are blind to this.
497	4	It was me, I sunk the Titanic.

151	4	Is this compared to all universities, or all public universities only?
869	4	Some sort of cognitive disorder in display here.
209	4	Yup. Listening to loud insecure voices is stupid af. Then to go even further and **empower** these toxic groups instead of just **ignoring** them is borderline insanity.  The scariest thing is that they are convinced that THEY are doing good and being virtuos and true...  My theory is that they essentially are a bully variance. Bully Recipe: have issues, struggle with confidence and mental health, start pointing fingers at others so no one will focus on *them*, the more you point, shout, shove and punch the less attention is on you and the better you feel. Everyone else around you now feel like shit too, mission accomplished and the Bully is born.   Wokeness stems from similar issues, from my experience, but where a bully would "only" affect one victim in their immediate surroundings, like a class or school these Woke fuck nuts are in a different more global school yard, however.   Being the natural born wizards and junkies of social media they often are and knowing how to involve anyone, everywhere, doing anything, they now impact also everything.  Add in some manipulation training and you'd just need someone with the combination of a high(ish) iq, psychopathic/sociopathic traits and tendencies and...wait.  Somehow something feels familiar here... I wish there was a way to look back in time and compare historic events with current ones.
613	4	Twitter hasn't been worth using ever since they banned Trump, but kept terrorist organization leaders and child porn.

454	3	this is such a good resource to link to when ever you come up against anti fan denialist
61	4	Probably means it was a shitty question...
108	4	This has never made sense to me. My most "left" view is my support of the vaccines, assuming they are safe and work.  If we have working vaccines, why in gods name would we ever lock up and mask up again? Like, it's fucking solved. If there is some variant that kills 1/10,000 people, and only those over 65 and with pre-existing conditions, what is the big deal? The flu already kills those people, along with a list of other diseases that would cover this whole page.
527	4	You watch because you want to see women lose.  I watch because hot women.  We are not the same.  Also gtfo Lia, u r not hot women
318	4	> and public discussion and jokes about the size of their genitals.   I didn't know I've been sexually harassed by every female comedian ever. Huh. Learn something every day.  *One of the quoted ""offensive jokes""*  > Tyler is the only person who is aware of my devious plans to kill the [circumcensored] by making them work to death through game development  It's funnier than anything Amy Schumer has ever done.  *From the GamesBeat article*  > The context of the conversation suggested that Mahler was truly making a joke, but it’s alarming to think he felt it was safe and appropriate to say such a thing in a company chat  Of fuck you mr "journalist." I'd bet a crisp $2 dollar bill you have skeletons that are actually racist, sexist, or whatever, on Twitter.  > This story is a portrait of the workplace at Moon Studios, as related by its game developers. The developers who spoke with GamesBeat had a common interest. They wanted other developers to know what it was like to work at Moon Studios before they considered joining the company.  That paragraph certainly gives me a hint as to what the people at GamesBeat are "beating."  > When I first saw Ori, and I hit all the reviews, it was a touching story in the cutesy, friendly way. And then I talked to the heads of the studio,” said one developer. “And it’s like, that’s not who these guys are. They are not these cutesy people. They’re very harsh.”  I dreamed of working for Apple for years. It was such an inspiring company. Then, I joined the company and discovered that they are not staffed by sentient fruit. This is harassment.   > “They have a mentality where they think they’re not politically correct, they don’t want to be censored, they don’t want to be corporate,” said one developer. “They don’t want to be like these other studios. But it’s just a justification to behave in any way they want to. Other studios attempt to make a comfortable work environment for everyone involved.”  So, naturally, the answer is that people on chat (I'll remind you this is about chat) to censor themselves. Got it. This person sounds like a mega-Karen.  > “The no-bullshit policy is for the two of them to be able to say whatever they want. And under the guise of like, ‘we’re just all being honest, human beings, we’re transparent.’ And if you can’t handle it, maybe this isn’t the place for you. You’re too sensitive.”  Yes dumbass developer. That's exactly what they are doing. You want to know what a "lots of bullshit" work environment looks like? Just take a peek at politicians, large corporations, HR, and PR. People who censor themselves still think your shit, but instead of telling you via good natured ribbing...they'll give you a PIP and then fire you in 6 months for not improving enough.  Every team I've worked on in the programming profession has been filled with individuals who use "fuck" as punctuation. The only difference is how close nit the team is. Tes that are distant, cold, and the embodiment of Office Space are very clean and disingenuous. People will work to stab you on the back for months with a smile on their face when talking to you.  The best teams tell "sexist, racist, and whatever jokes." You manager tells you early when they see something in behavior or performance that is a problem. And the managers Shield their teams from the high-bullshit corporate nonsense. Because good morale and team cohesion rely on not having to worry about whether or not you desk mate is working on making your position redundant for a promotion.  These people sound insufferable.
495	4	Wish victory to the people of Philippines and middle finger to all dictators !
825	3	We have evolved to shame shaming.  Yeah, I think people are easy to label things as shaming but people forget that you can say something negative without trying to shame someone. It's especially bad when someone says your blankshaming for saying something negative about a person that... literally has nothing to do with the topic. Shaming people is dumb, but people need to relax a bit.  I mean if someone has a point to make, I'm all ears, I enjoy discussions even if I don't agree with who I'm talking to.
166	4	Putin is the bad guy in the star wars  Biden is Luke Skywalker  Pelosi is princess Leia  Make sense now everyone?? 📓📝📝📝

And most other folks don't really care about Resident Evil.  This is Diverse from the start Walking Dead. They wanted a WD clone because that had done so well and when they couldnt do anything original they got the RE name and wokified it by lifting minimal pieces from it (names mainly) and just going their own way from there. Thats all this is. The use of the RE name is a vain attempt to have a ready audience for it but obviously theyre massively wrong on that  one.

I mean let's all go extreme and keep going. Oh and in any state like Tennessee, Florida, and Texas no man should be allowed to hold office. Only women.   This is how these people think will happen if women have rights.

853	4	This entire sub is a paradox
840	4	This is a horrible idea.    I live in Michigan and have a CCW permit.  As part of the process I was required to undergo a criminal background check and take an 8 hour class that covered basic gun safety as well as the laws regarding when defensive gun use is legal and when it’s not.    What I learned in that class was vital info.  We had people in the CCW class that had no concept of basic gun safety, no idea how their firearms worked, etc.  The class being a requirement keeps people safer.  I’m 100% convinced of that after taking it.    Also another reason for licensing: The state cop who taught the class explained to us that the reason you show that CCW card when you get pulled over is because it immediately puts the officer at ease.  He knows when he sees that card that you are likely a law abiding citizen, and you’re probably not a bad guy.  If I didn’t have that card, I’d be really nervous when a cop pulled me over while carrying a concealed pistol.  And so would the cop!  Which can lead to all sorts of bad things.
359	4	Telling me right now people love me would never help me.  I just watched all the people I care about that were supposed to be the most important people in my life turn their backs on me and leave me high and dry.    Telling me my cats need me.

I won’t treat anyone differently for liking because what your tastes are is completely subjective. But if your product is garbage in my eyes I have every to be a hater. If the creator doesn’t like it. Tough shit

81	4	People sell and give away bed frames for cheap/free on Nextdoor and FB marketplace all the time, if you were curious.  The practicality of mattress on the floor living depends on few things:  How you fuck, the condition of your knees & your ability to get up/off the floor, how much money you got or how resourceful you are, the quality of the  mattress....and the obvious cultural background. Im just gonna assume that the whole entire world hasnt bought into the "bed frame" as a concept and that there are other options that I'm unfamiliar with.  I've had a mattress on the floor many times. I didnt have a mattress for 6 months after one move and my mom's bf gave me his cot from when he was in the military to use in the interim....not great, but better than the floor.  Do you have a bowspring and a mattres? Or just the mattress?

90	4	Most people don't have the land or the money to keep a herd of healthy horses. Horse care is also a huge time sink. Expect to be covered to your waist in horse vomit or diarreah when it gets sick at 3 in the morning. Everyday you have to spend 3 hours on grains, cleaning, and grooming. You have to spend an additional 1 - 2 hours to train the horse to get them to be ridable. Every month or two, you need to get the shoes checked. Vet bills and medicine will be high.  And all of that doesn't include the price of proper tack that will go into the $1000's.  Most horse girls who have ever owned a horse will say they regret owning one in their teens. One horse just consumes their lives. They miss out on everything a teen normally doesn't miss.  Horse abuse is also a huge problem already in the industry and nobody can agree on stuff like whether to use bitless or bitted biffles. What's the proper way to discipline a horse. Etc. There will be more horses that end up being abused, especially if people are expecting them to fulfill a role.  And on top of that, they can kill you with a kick. Not everyone can and should own a horse.  So, would not recommend horses instead of cars. I recommend electric cars instead.  Edit:  Also doesn't include the months to years it will take to teach yourself how to ride a horse. Riding is not passive for the rider. You need to physically train to be able to squat and crush steel with your abs before you can canter and jump.

I’m not shaming anything,   to me is utterly meaningless and all my shits have been given  Is different to this  >If I see a man screaming at his kid in public,  Makes me look up and take notice.  Is the father is being abusive?  Or is he warning a child not to go near the edge?  Like everything more context is needed.  Shaming anything without understanding is just being an asshole.  Shaming things that need shaming, I am ok with that.

506	4	I am a firearm owner and a long time concealed carry permit holder and I carry nearly all the time. We just passed a bill here in Alabama to no longer require a permit for concealed carry and I think it’s a huge mistake.   Growing up (I’m 37) I was around firearms and I was taught very early, respect for firearms and how to use them. That prepared me to carry now. We can’t count on everyone having that kind of knowledge and I think we should strengthen our laws rather than relax them.   I am in favor of the following policies:   1. Required training and certification before purchasing a firearm with regular recertification. 2. A publicly available system for firearm buyer verification. Given buyer info, you would get a sell/no sell indicator and a verification number that would accompany the bill of sale. All sales would be required to use this system to eliminate the “Gun Show Loophole.” 3. Violent crimes / domestic abuse would be required to be entered in the system and could trigger a hold or denial. 4. Require permit for concealed carry. 5. Require more extensive permit for open carry. Unless you are law enforcement, open carry is not a good idea.  Now, I know the argument “this won’t stop criminals.” I made that same argument myself in the past. The above proposal would be about ensuring that law-abiding citizens are trained and equipped to handle firearms safely and responsibility while also making it very clear if someone is acting outside the law.  As responsible firearm owners, we should go above and beyond to ensure safety and responsibility.

76	4	>  **Article:**  A federal judge on March 18 blocked a Washington, D.C., law that allowed children in the nation’s capital to receive a vaccine without parental consent.  The parents who sued over the law appear likely to succeed in proving claims that the law violates federal statutes and will be irreparably harmed if a preliminary injunction weren’t entered, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden wrote in a 38-page opinion.  The D.C. Council passed the District’s Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act in 2020. It lets children as young as 11 get a vaccine without permission from their parents.  But the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 mandates health care providers who administer many vaccines provide information on the shots to the legal representative of a child.  Plaintiffs in the case and another similar lawsuit are parents who say their minor children are under pressure to get vaccinated because of a citywide campaign to push vaccinations, including giving incentives like gift cards to people who get a jab and the placement of clinics that will inject the children in some schools, with other clinics near schools.  The child of Joshua Mazer, one of the plaintiffs, visited a doctor’s office in the city without her parents and asked to get a vaccine, according to the motion for a preliminary injunction. The child confirmed her parents were not aware of the request. The office did not check the girl’s medical history or prior reactions to a vaccine and also did not provide any vaccine information, according to the filing; instead, workers convinced the girl to get two other shots as well.  The girl changed her mind at the last minute, which caused workers to “physically position themselves” around her, making her feel trapped. She was eventually able to leave.  Defendants, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said in a counter-filing that the court shouldn’t block the law, calling it “an eminently reasonable public health measure that does not require plaintiff or his daughter to do anything.”  McFadden, a Trump appointee, disagreed, noting that testimony from Mazer indicates his daughter, a teenager who lives in Maryland, is likely to try to get vaccinated in D.C.  The law presents a threat of imminent harm “because without it there is no avenue for minors to receive vaccines absent parental consent,” the judge said. “Removing the law would revert the District to the standard age of consent of 18.”  Bowser and the other defendants are enjoined from enforcing the law until further order from the court.  The office of Bowser and the D.C. Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment.  Aaron Siri, a lawyer representing Mazer, said on social media that he was “pleased to announce” the ruling in the suit.

744	4	Why are you still here if the tactics to save you don't work?
250	3	Threatening suicide when you get outed for being a jackass is a sign of not actually being suicidal but being incapable of holding yourself accountable for your actions and being a narcissist  My response to this news is a simple "ok" and "anyway"
94	4	OP this take is objectively stupid. You mentioned in the post that it’s a temporary solution but that’s literally the whole point. The longer you can convince a suicidal person to not end their life the more time you have to work with them and get them help. It’s not meant to fix their problems, just keep them alive long enough to have a better chance at fixing those problems. This take is shit.
103	3	Might wanna turn top comments controversial to something else
342	4	The sad thing is he knows the truth but he CHOOSES to be anti American .. Guys like him are more evil than the ones that slurp the koolaid
251	4	We would invent human-sized mousetraps instead.
912	4	\> the marketing gimmick worked!
632	4	I agree, too many horny posts on here
191	3	It’s just cuz Rowling chose to align with them so we are seeing the toppling of a god. It’s been a long time coming. She was a false idol after all.
670	4	Turns out alan got batteries for the flashlight out of various vibrators found throughout the campaign.
42	3	Everyone of the 50 “intelligence experts” that signed that is was fake need to be arrested for treason.
979	4	Wtf is going on with the gaslighting in here?? Literally nobody is sayin this shit.
682	4	Then don’t post your pathetic sob story on a public platform. You can’t seek attention and then cry about the attention you get.
859	4	So they want an African American dead? How racist of them. Completely disgusting.
987	4	Suicidal? He'd love prison though, all the non consensual sex he could ever want....Probably would need to wear a diaper after a month in though.
92	4	Looks like someone never took a stats class
458	3	Yeah, I’m cautious not to say anything, but when I hear people say they have a terminal illness, but they’re going to fight and beat it, in my mind I’m like, “But you just got handed a ticket out of this cruel world. You won the lottery! Why wouldn’t you take it?”
91	3	And here i was thinking someone was about to get hotboxed.
933	4	So... He tried to pass on the right while they were turning right, and now he's faulting them for being upset? Good on them for not running him over with their van
735	4	Why would artists be responsible for helping someone overcome a porn addiction? That's on you bro.
369	4	One of my sons works for Salesforce- says this is a real issue there, a lot of people there are upset this wasn’t done a long time ago.
252	4	Do we mean with a box spring? Or no?
203	3	Guess that might mean becoming a super senior
314	3	Its used by many white supremacist simply.
610	4	Teens are horny and that's fine and natural. Probably better to let them be horny here instead of other less safe spaces. We already have a rule about NSFW stuff and the mods can handle anything that might go too far.   It feels like you guys are trying to follow a Texas example when I think it's better to go the Colorado route. In Colorado, they gave free IUD's to teens and incorporated comprehensive sex education. Teen pregnancies dropped to almost nothing.   I think it would be unwise to try and suppress natural teenage tendencies and curiosities. Let them post and just report, moderate, and advise where necessary. If you ban it here, where might they go to seek it out instead?
958	4	Can't be cancelled when no one cares or even knows what he's doing... He's about as relevant as Nickelback.
187	4	Nah this sub is trash now
265	3	Wait a minute…i thought it was for sure Russian disinformation?,
364	4	They were placing people on the no fly list if they didn’t comply. I don’t understand why everyone has to deplane.

If you were a shopping addict and you were spending money you didn’t have, the most prudent advice wouldn’t be to make more money — it would be to spend less.   (2) Your income is your property, idc if you’re homeless or if you’re Jeff Bezos, the principle applies equally. Why should I have to give up 30% of my income only to have it be used to bomb kids in the Middle East? Private charities are far more efficient at delivering relief to struggling communities, and with lighter tax burdens there is more available income to donate. The Orange libleft and the authlefts have a difficult conundrum because the argument posed is always that people won’t help sufficiently on their own volition and thus government support is needed. This is difficult because if you doubt the good intentions of people as a whole, I have no idea how you can believe a communal society with the intention of helping everyone could work if all charity would collapse without government.  (3) Lower taxes = higher disposable incomes which yields higher spending and higher growth which benefits everyone. No, the ultra-wealthy don’t ‘hoard’ wealth. The only way you could hoard wealth without providing some ancillary benefit to others is by burying your money in the backyard where it’s dead to the economy. Every dollar in a bank account is money available to another person to loan to buy a car or their first home. And every dollar in a brokerage account is financing company growth which benefits everyone.   (4) Tax evasion doesn’t mean what you think it means. If I straight up didn’t pay taxes, that’s tax evasion. If I put my money in an investment account and make a return but only pay the capital gains rate that’s not tax evasion. If I put my money in a Roth IRA and I do not withdraw until I’m 59.5 and do not have to pay tax — that’s not tax evasion — that is prudent financial advice available to everyone, not just the super wealthy.  (5) Wealth inequality in of itself is not a bad thing. There is nothing inherently bad about someone having more money than you. You may disagree with how they use it, but I’m sure people would disagree with how you use your money sometimes too — but it’s your money, so you can do what you want with it. Same principle applies for the wealthy.   (6) Taxes can interfere with personal financial development. If you are offered promotion with a couple dollar extra an hour raise but that pushes you into a new tax bracket, that may actually bring down your overall earnings if your new wages can’t cover your new tax burden
636	4	I've never understood why Trump supporters labelled Bill Clinton a pedo because his name appeared on Epstein's flight manifest, when there's literally multiple videos and photos of Trump and Epstein hanging out, with one video even showing Trump admitting that Epstein was into kids. Oh, and Trump also appeared in Epstein's flight manifest.
220	4	One pillar of the DNC platform is grooming children
256	3	It looks like the grub hub animation.  I still liked the movie though.  The only thing I didn’t like was:  *4 young girls of all different sizes sit around and objectify men*  You can have a girl be a round ball, which is cute, but a boy can’t be the same and be attractive nor have representation.
114	4	They can’t really disable him at this point.
466	4	It will be during the mid term election, mark my word. They (DNC) are going to try to pull some bullshit.
324	4	I tried going to Cafe 3 at 12 today and they were closed. I think the website hasn’t been updated. But the Cal Dining email said Croads and the Den will be open this week, but will only accept flex dollars, no meal swipes.
65	3	The largest fraud going on is the amount of folks who were denied that were exactly what the programs were created for, and that's from the folks who are supposed to 'have our best interests at heart' when they get elected.
994	4	These motherfuckers are trying to Scalia him!
408	4	I forgot what the movie was called and thought you meant physically turning red. As in embarrassed or something.
320	4	Depends on what year you are and if you want to double major / graduate early, but there’s probably not much reason so take another hard class on top of what you have. Take a breadth or something.
400	4	Republicans have to keep shitting on Democrats to ensure their sheep stay angry and voting against their own interests in elections, but since truth hurts those personal belief bubbles, they just make some shit up and spread that like gospel for gawd, cuntry, and Trumpppp!!!
989	4	If go for the router, not everything can be connected with cables and then you can also connect about 150 devices by wifi to that router probably
327	4	Unbelievable this was ever allowed in the first place! What is wrong with these leftists?!
904	4	I would love to know where this sonic is.
10	4	I only believe this is real because the guy is from the UAE
27	4	I only know one guy that makes more than $300k a year. Fuck whoever wrote this lol
597	4	Good on them, glad to see they're holding their ground and defending the right to joke around and tease in good fun.
963	4	Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution in the male sex led to this  Thanks Mother Nature or God
212	4	Shaming is good in many circumstances. Some things should never be accepted as normal.
930	4	I don't think there is a person on this earth I despise more than Bloomberg.
322	4	There are very few societies that have actually criminalized lesbians but there have been MANY societies that have criminalized gays.  Edit: for anyone wondering seriously look up the legal status of homosexuality in the world. it’s staggering how many nations outlaw being gay but mot being lesbian.
488	4	my understanding is that Japan doesn't actually give a fuck how well their anime/manga does overseas, they cater primarily to the domestic audience, which is nowhere as infested with SJWs as here
756	4	My favorite season of the game
617	3	Shouldn't have allowed them to run away from a publicity stunt. I hope they all come back with child.
771	4	And what hump a tree like a monkey? No, thanks I'm good.
555	4	I see where you are coming from. But I love cemeteries. They are usually somewhere really pretty. Everyone there is respectful because it is a cemetery. There are flowers and different gravestones. I walk through them and read them occasionally. They were all lives. Every stone represents an entire life that someone lived. So if people get comfort and enjoyment it really isn’t a waste.
752	4	Where in Berkeley can I buy items like queso fresco and nopales?
445	4	I wish Ron would sign the fucking bill faster so he doesn't get pressured or lobbied into wimping out first. What is taking him so long? Is he a true republican or not?
105	3	I'm basically sick of the way the word shaming is used.  Like its always a bad thing. In reality, some people need a wake up call.
710	4	So here is something stupid I did last week:   We had a party at school where we were allowed to dress as we wish, I dressed as an Arabian rich man. Everyone was having a good time and I was as well.  I saw my history teacher and for some reason, I said: "communism is bad don't do it" while laughing.   In my head, I wanted to say something that would indicate that I'm a greedy rich man but it came out sounding very bad.   The teacher gave no answer and ignored me.  I'm cringing until this moment   How bad is the situation?
247	4	“I’m apolitical, but I do vote Republican more often than not locally, because I know the people personally. And I’ve always known that this party is supposed to be the one that wants to be less invasive in our personal lives, like smaller government.”  Yeah, small government from the part that since Nixon has been governing bases on morality. Keep telling yourself that.
975	3	Thank God, Mr Russia Russia Russia is an amazing imbecile, two things that never need to be spoken together, Schiff/Intelligence.
732	4	wait for him to hear about the Djibouti
118	4	I would honestly replace Twitter with Discord.
165	4	Must be that elusive algorithm at work again.
964	4	This by Sen Scott (FL) has been baffling from the outset. Raising taxes on poor people is never a good policy, let alone in an election year, and even more so when you want the majority. No wonder Sen McConnell distanced himself from this. Honestly, making Sen Scott the head of the NRSC was a stupid decision, it's like you're not serious about the midterms.   And in the end, you're really targetting GOP states more than Democratic ones.
245	4	This is one of those opinions that shouldn’t be unpopular, but people are busybodies so I just know somebody would make a big deal about what other people eat when.
759	4	I only trust a router if its in the same room as me, and I never have a router in the same room as me
997	3	Doesn’t rocket league have different hit boxes for different cars? You could be better with a different hit box
608	4	First, who the fuck cares? Second, is this really an opinion I’m confused
822	4	No but for real, nobody knows where the ideas for music come from. Or any ideas. Everything creative feels like it magically appeared out of nowhere.
