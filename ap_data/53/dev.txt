The superfruit can provide as much as 60 times more C per serving than an orange! The superfruit also contains a broad range of other important nutrients including antioxidants, amino acids, beta-carotene and potassium.

To make Navitas Naturals Camu Powder, the seeds are removed from the berries and then they are milled at low temperatures into a fine soluble powder. Many people in Peru enjoy camu-flavored ice cream, sweets and beverages. Navitas Naturals Camu Powder is a red-orange powder with a tart berry flavor.
