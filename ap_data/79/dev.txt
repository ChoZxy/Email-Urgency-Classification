I used to think I still held some conservative beliefs, but what do they even believe in anymore? All they talk about is childrens books and child porn without ever actually having a point. They are rude, unintelligent, and seem to be just completely out of touch with reality.

Think about the value of your house, retirement account, and small stock accounts, etc. Then the top 1% exploit the ever loving shit out of that loophole.The truth is that even now, closing that one wouldn’t even fix the issue. These days, the real rich don’t even pay capital gains! They take out loans at an even lower rate and back those loans with their securities. They never sell any shares and the interest they pay is actually tax deductible (again, a great loophole for the middle class but the rich exploit the shit out of it).They (politicians) refuse to make loopholes that phase out at higher wealth/income levels because they’re all goddamned crooks, but I digress.

74	0	Equity vs EqualityHear me out guys. If race real action in America was a relay race. How would you fix this issue? Now imagine 400 years ago a race began towards an American Dream. Whites ran theirs , Blacks ran theirs. However those presiding over the race were partial, locking the legs of the Blacks together. Giving them no chance to run a fair race. Hundreds of years past; I will propose to you a question later on. For now let us continue. So hundreds of years pass the batons have been handed forward each generation. Only 2 generations ago, a few decades at most; the rules changed and Blacks could run with their legs unburdened. &#x200B;But how will they ever catch up? Thought things seem equal on a surface level do they not, but how many hundreds, thousands of miles have been lapped by the White racers of the past? But who will propose a solution and what can that solution be? Do we hobble the white racer running now to allow the current Black racer to catch up? That would seem extremely unfair to a White racer who was handed the baton recently without much knowledge of the past. He would say “we both run with our legs free everything is equal we have the same opportunity to win”. But..but do they really? No they do not. So do you give the current Black relay racer performance enhancing drugs to force a catch up to counteract the forced disadvantage created so long ago on his ancestors part of the race ? Maybe that would make the most sense, but..but for the White racer running currently he would think it is vastly unfair and unnatural. &#x200B;So what do we do? It is neither fair to hobble a relay race team for extremely long while the other is unburdened then once the lead is unchallengeable to then free the burdened team and call that true equality. However is it fair to now give the previously burdened team an unfair advantage to catch-up to reverse the bias ness of the past?&#x200B;Is there a real solution to this equity equality challenge that won’t end up feeling like a flip off to a certain people who are alive in this time now. What do you guys think? I’ve asked myself this for awhile.&#x200B;TDLR: if race relations was a relay race with each race on their own team handing the baton off to their children how would equity / equality be created knowing that the black teams legs were chained and fell behind long ago? It seems as tho it is neither fair to hobble a relay race team for extremely long while the other is unburdened then once the lead is unchallengeable to then free the burdened team and call that true equality. However is it fair to now give the previously burdened team an unfair advantage to catch-up to reverse the bias ness of the past?

How liberal is it trying to get?I wouldn't mind if the whole country resembled the Netherlands. Congress and the President just turn a blind eye and lets the states do whatever they want. I mean think about cannabis. There are so many states where you can just smoke cannabis. This was outrageous even in the administration of Clinton and Bush.What about the drinking law? Why not 18? Why not legalize sex work? Not decriminalize, legalize.Why not casinos? Im not talking about indigenous territory. Im talking about big casinos right on Times Square, Ocean Drive, Hollywood Blvd, French Quarter, and every major area in every major American city. LIVE dealers, not just some rinky-dink machines.It may sound outrageous but this is the case in the Netherlands. Brothels are legal, cannabis is legal everywhere, casinos are found in every major city from Amsterdam, Haarlem, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, The Hague, etc...Why not remove bleeps from television? In the UK people say certain profane words on television and they are likewise another English-speaking country. How come they do it but the US doesn't?How liberal is the US trying to become? Does it want tot be like the Netherlands?

There are a bunch of extremists on either side that follow whatever their party leader says but people that think for themselves are usually in the middle. There have been good candidates on both sides in recent history but the bad ones usually make it to the end cause they fit the profile that the party wants the bestIt’s a ducked system but you gotta just choose who you think is the best

We’re experts from the League of Women Voters and VoteRiders, here to answer any questions you have about voter ID laws and all things voting across the country! March is Women’s History Month, and we know that women face particular challenges and barriers when it comes to casting a ballot. Our organizations work together nationwide to ensure that ALL eligible voters are prepared and confident that they have the information and ID they need to vote. Since the 2020 election, we’ve seen a surge in bills to add new or toughen existing voter ID laws from coast to coast. It’s part of a larger trend we’re seeing with hundreds of voting-related bills emerging in the vast majority of states. Women — particularly women who change their name upon marriage or divorce, trans women, low-income women, single mothers, and women of color — will be disproportionately impacted by many of these changes. This Women’s History Month, we’re here to answer your questions about how to help all women cast a ballot that counts. **Ask us anything about voter registration, voter ID laws, and what you need to do to make sure that nothing stops you from exercising your freedom to vote. We’ll be answering your questions from 3pm to 4pm ET.**We'll be answering your questions for both organizations from the u/LeagueOfWomenVoters account.MORE ABOUT THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS:[The League of Women Voters](https://www.lwv.org/) is a 100-year-old grassroots organization dedicated to empowering voters and defending democracy.

VoteRiders educates voters and assists them to secure their voter ID. We inspire and support organizations, volunteers, and communities to sustain such voter ID education and assistance efforts. VoteRiders is nonpartisan – we don’t take positions for or against voter ID bills – we just work our tails off to make sure that every eligible voter who wants to vote can get the ID they need. To do this, we partner with hundreds of organizations, including the League of Women Voters and scores of local Leagues across the country.

Understand what you did and why you don't agree with but never apologize for your feelings, it's pointless. Especially when the person you want to apologize to has many of the same problems that you had before. The democrats engage in just as much shady and sick behavior as the republicans do. As a former republican know that you can change your opinions and ideas without having to apologize for them. If you are a liberal now embrace that, but if you truly are a liberal understand that the democratic party often engages in iliberal practices as well, don't apologize to them, they are strangers, they are a political party, not a person. It's this sort of tribalism that is tearing the country apart.Never ever apologize for your feelings or beliefs, only apologize for your actions when warranted, and only ever apologize for yourself, not a group of people.

Where it falls apart is what was supposed to happen next: since companies had larger pools of investments, they would (in theory) be more willing to expand their businesses and pay higher wages to attract better employees.In practice, wages stagnated, we've experienced runaway executive compensation, and companies with large pools of Investments have utilized them to stifle competition"

8	1	"Debunking three videos from the right.Videos in question: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Y1m28hVtk&t=503s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Y1m28hVtk&t=503s)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgK4Io8pFPs&t=144s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgK4Io8pFPs&t=144s)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM)I started watching the first vid (from like 8min in because the link automatically goes there, lmk if that was a mistake) and it's clear that they are conflating their criticisms of the new pride flag from a visual standpoint (thinking it looks ugly or a unnecessarily complex is ofc a valid opinion) with the legitimacy of the pride movement itselfThey think that the pride flag isn't needed, and therefore anyone who uses it is self centered and arrogant. The premise that they state directly is that lgbt people are doing just as well as non lgbt people and don't have any major discriminationAnyone who looks at data would know that lgbt people still face increased rates of discrimination, violence, and social stigma and rejection. Literally the fact that most lgbt people still have to worry about how to ""come out"" to their family and friends, fearing anything from rejection to outright violence, is enough to justify people using whatever pride flag they likeThey're trying to convince their audience that homophobia doesn't exist anymore and thus pride is useless or bad. But they don't bring up any data or reasoning behind their personal opinions of it being fine in the UKThen they talk about the rapper, while doing so they imply that children who are too young to do xyz, can just cut off their genitals and change their genderIn reality, rarely does any trans child under 18 go through any kind of surgery. And if they do, it would only be after a medical doctor extensively observes the child and their records and finds it medically necessary for their mental healthAnd that only happens if the doctor is sure the child understands their decision completely. But that happens very rarelyBut people like Sargon Akkad or whatever his name is want you to think that a 7 year old can just walk into a doctors office and demand a same day sex realignment surgeryIn reality, it's more like a 16 year old talking to multiple doctors for years and everyone coming to the conclusion that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risksThe rest of that video is honestly just bad comedy ""haha trans people can't have kids but they'll try to get half the world"" or something like that.Last thing about that one: straight pride isn't necessary neither is a straight rights campaign because no one is going after the rights of straight people. Is there any political group trying to reduce the rights of straight people? No, but there are many who try to make discrimination against gay people legal.They outright reject that people rn are campaigning for lgbt rights because they think, for whatever reason, that lgbt rights aren't being threatened and lgbt people don't feel uncomfortable. Both are wrong ofc2nd videoOkay they're hyperfocusing on one argument they disagree with so farSo people were saying that the shooter was racist because he chose to target a place where mainly Asian people were. Their argument is that since the shooter didn't say he had racist motivations that it's crazy to believe the shooting had anything to do with race. If someone shoots an Asian restaurant and then claims ""I just wanted to shoot a restaurant"" you couldn't blame people for thinking that there are more motivations given the location he chose. Or if someone shoots a black church only to claim ""I just wanted to shoot a church"" then you wouldn't blame people for assuming he still had other motivations.Even if you disagree with people who say that we have to assume race was a motivation given the context of everything but the shooter's words, you can't just blame people for disagreeing with you or think they're crazy.Wait the murderer first targeted an Asian spar and then drove 27 miles to shoot another Asian spar?C'mon, they can't possibly think it's crazy for people to think he is racially motivatedThey really think that unless the shooter explicitly says it's about race then it's unjustified to say race was part of it?Subconscious bias exists for one, oh and he could have been lying. Racial terrorists tend to be treated harsher in court and prison than a random shooter.Literally if they just thought for longer than a minute they'd figure this out.It fits their narrative that people pay too much attention to race. That's the only reason why they are criticising people who say it definitely was racially motivated so much. They want their audience to think ""oh so people claim racism when there isn't any"" when it comes to other problems too.Then they talk about the model minority myth. They mention how Asians on average are performing better than black people on average despite also having had systematic racism. They claim Asians are doing better because of cultural values and then dismiss the idea that slavery is still affecting black peopleThe systemic racism that black people had to deal with was and is completely different than Asians. And yes, centuries of slavery is actually a good example. They must think that all discrimination is the same, no matter the type or duration.Third video:So kids show is basically saying ""families with two dads, two mums, or two non-binary people and any sexuality can be happy"" and that's a bad thing? The show seems kinda boring to me but like I'm not gonna make a video and complain about it being bad lmaoAlso, asexual people are accepted in the lgbt community because many asexual people think that there must something wrong with them or their lack of sexual desires may affect their mental health by affecting relationships or whatever, so ofc the lgbt community should be accepting. The lgbt community is about being happy with your sexuality, and asexuality counts.""agenda"" lol I love it when they use that word cause the agenda is just accepting people for who they are. If I had a nickle for everytime they use that retoric, I'd be a billionnare by now.Okay now he's saying that pride is forcing labels onto children and making them ""pick a box"". No.... It's about letting everyone know that if you are gay/lesbian/trans/whatever that it's okay and you should feel happy.If some gay child thinks that something is wrong with them, they might be helped by their cartoons saying ""it's okay to be gay""People like him think that if we wouldn't mention lgbt stuff at all then no one would feel bad. But our society is heteronormative (the norm is to be straight) so children might be confused if they don't feel heterosexual and we know as a fact that children who are lgbt face more difficulty accepting themselves.And LMAO, he just said that it's a undeniable fact that the ""cultural forces"" want kids to be gay. That's just so ridiculous. Pride is about accepting people who are lgbt \*because\* many people want them to just be straight.He says young people don't have a sexual identity yet, well what if someone gets bullied at school because they have two dads? Or because they like to dress differently or whatever. Why does this guy have such a problem with messaging that is literally just ""be proud if you're lgbt or have lgbt people in your family""I'd love it if this guy pointed out where and when the videos said or even implied that you shouldn't be straight. Notice how these people never talk about anti-lgbt violence or discrimination? It's because they want their audience to think that all this pride stuff is for nothingAlso why would there be such a massive effort to turn kids gay? Like who is doing this and why? There is no monetary or strategic advantage gained from that. His conspiracy theory doesn't make any sense because even the simple question of ""what would anyone have to gain from that"" can't be answered.Anywho, those are my thoughts on the matter, feel free to watch this dumpster fire yourself and share your own thoughts below."

Only 500,000 democrats showed up to vote the Virginia primary. 2,500,000 people voted for Biden in Virginia just 8 months earlier. So only 1 out of 5 people who voted for Biden bothered to show up to vote in the primary, despite the heavy television ads there running. Republicans held no state-wide primary but did things sort of like the caucus system. Come on guys, you need to start showing up in off-year elections, this is where the GOP is killing the democrats and why they control positions on the local level, which ruffle up to the state level.

They have much more progressive views (particularly about the LGBTQ+ community) than they used to, even if they misunderstand some things (i.e. why you would call a non-binary person “them” instead of “it” being a recent dinner conversation).

Mascots around the country with Native American origins are being removed, replaced, and targeted in general due to how they are perceived by the country. My curiosity comes with exactly what sets these mascots apart from others such as Notre Dame's Irish mascot, or older forms of people such as Spartans or Vikings. I mean no disrespect or trolling at all, this is a genuine curiosity that I have. And I just want to hear other people's takes on why these are offensive or harmful, when to me, I've always found them to be very cool and badass logos and mascots for the same reason I love the Spartans as a logo.
149	0	What the media is (purposely) doing a poor job of explaining is that the Supreme Court rejected the injunction of the Texas abortion law because the lawsuit wasn't brought to them correctly. The lawsuit was suing a state judge and clerk who are not actually tasked with enforcing the Texas abortion law. Meaning the Supreme Court really couldn't legally do anything about this lawsuit because it was put together last minute and challenged the wrong people. The Supreme Court's decision to not take the case in no way will prevent this law from being challenged in both state and federal courts.The real case we should all be worried about is the 'Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization' case from Mississippi that the Supreme Court has decided they will hear. This one asks “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.” This is the case that could realistically overturn Roe v Wade.
406	0	I'm not an American, but I thought I'd share my viewpoint.As I am Democratic and not Conservative, I was curious to see if I can start a discussion with someone from the opposite side about gun control. Here's some points that came up:1. There are A LOT of gun laws, varying state to state. Whilst they argued that a responsible gun owner will be aware of the laws, it is doubtful that all of the general public knows all of the details. To follow the law properly, you need to know the law properly. So a focus on educational classes about guns and gun safety might be beneficial .2. School shootings came into discussion. I was told that arming let's say a principle or headteacher would be beneficial in case of an incident such as this. However, I also pointed out that the right gun can fire several rounds per second. So simply arming faculty wouldn't be enough. 3. There is a disconnect between mental health and law enforcement. Apparently, there have been incidents where people with severe mental health issues have gotten a hold of guns and commited crimes. These same people were in mental health facilities before, and yet police or law enforcement were not notified when they were released. Thus, more effort needs to be put into decreasing the chances of them getting a hold of weapons.4. Limitation on the types of guns sold. So in this case, personally, I would ban handguns over rifles.5. Prison also came up, deviating slightly. The majority of people who go to prison go in for non violent offences and are released. The system though is terribly abusive and doesn't actually help. These same people come out with no life skills and end up commiting more crimes. More focus needs to be put into reforming the prison system as a means of reform and education (e.g. learning a trade), instead of punishment and revenge. If that happens, then it will address a lot of issues. It will also be much more safe for the general public, as the people released could very well be their neighbours. These are just some points discussed that I thought I'd share.

395	0	"when people talk about gun control, they're talking about specifics - not things like ban all guns.for example* HR 1446, would have closed the so-called ""Charleston Loophole,"" which allows a gun sale to be processed if it takes the FBI more than three days to process the background check. someone exploited this default approval to purchase the gun he used to kill nine people.* Boulder reversed a ban on large capacity magazines three days before one was used to kill 10 people.* GA tried enacting a law that tried to put a 5 day time frame before you could purchase a gun after someone killed 8 people hours after buying a gun.* Texas 7 dead after someone was able to buy a gun without a federal background through private sale. A backgorund check would have shown he wasn't allowed to own a gun.* Ohio - a guy waited until his juvinile records were were expunged so they wouldn't show up on his background check when he bought the gun he used to kill 9 people.* Texas - after his mother called police with concerns that her son bought an ""ak-47 type of gun"", police told her it was perfectly legal. Because there was no red flag law, he used that gun to kill 23 people.* After CA had a law limiting high-capacity magazines reversed, someone used one to kill 12 people. Police were also called his house a few months before because he was acting irrationally - a red flag law would have been able to take his guns before he killed anyone.* Because the law bars you from owning gun if you get committed to a mental hospital but not if you commit yourself. After self admitting himself to a hospital, he was able to buy a gun ank kill 17 people."

485	0	Assuming highly accurate / advanced AI.Ignoring their admission that AI needs to be tweaked / limited to make their worldview seem true, it would be impossible to do.AI will be used for war. AI's accuracy in logic would be required to have a chance at defeating competing AI. Any artifical constraints would send that accuracy careening off into space, and then you lose.That's the danger of AI, aside from the mouth breather's ideology in question. It literally can't be limited once it starts. That's why people like Musk often raise the alarm.Now, if we are speaking of purpose-built and fully isolated AI (like for making your coffee in the morning or flying a jet) that's another thing. But the unlimited AI will have to exist in parallel. Because it will for the bad guys.

And there you go. Liberals also have plans to work on all of those things to reduce gun violence. Or for that matter, just as improvements to society in general.Whereas your essay above seems predicated on the the notion that those things will not be addressed, and so super surveillance of society will be needed.

919	0	The sad news is that Cruz will be hailed as a hero for trying to “stand up for the law,” when he’s clearly acting like a child. The judge has been asked the same questions by every Republican judge and her answers have been consistent. She just explained in detail how the law is set and that Congress can change the law. Any disagreements between these Senators and the judge would be set aside if the Senators just changed updated the law or made mandatory sentences, but that would defeat the purpose of their allegations.

463	0	It is not a relay race, and there aren't any teams. There are just individuals, and the run is over when the individual dies. In the past the rules were skewed. Now they are not. There are some individuals who want them skewed. There are some individuals who think they are skewed. But all we can do as a society is ensure they aren't so that each individual's run has to abide by the same rules. Let people run.

72	0	Thoughts on Liberals and Rational Thinking?A huge part of the reason I've identified as relatively liberal is because I have strong reasons to beleive that many policies and ideas that are labeled as liberal are in fact scientifically sound. Having worked in (natural science) academia for much of my life so far, I really came to appreciate the scientific method, high quality data, trustworthy sources and rigorous statistical analysis as key components to forming opinions on any topic. Equally important is critical review and ability to change and adjust opinions if new facts are identified. At an earlier age I self-righteously thought that conservatives were far less likely to think in these terms, and that liberlas, on the other hand, were driven by scientific rationalism rather than ideology. While I still beleive that this is still true to some extent, the amount of liberals I have encountered that beleive in things dogmatically, refuse to debate hypotheses (or even consider alternate hypotheses), or cite research results with very little understandng an nuance has been disheartening.A few examples that have come to mind over the years include the gender wage gap - it's causes and nuances, how it is defined, what 70 cents on the dollar actually means. Statistics on race and crime, discussion of black on black crime or the relationship between black inner city culture and crime, in addition to all the systematic/socioeconomic/racism reasons that are discussed. Questions about trans athletes, bone structure, lung volume, etc. that presists even after hormonal treatment. There are other examples, but it seems like sometimes even raising or questioning these topics can get you accused of all sorts of terrible things. Another somewhat specific example, but one that is especially relevant to me, is Russia, since I am Russian-American. Putin is awful (and getting worse), and I actively participate in anti-Putin protests when I'm there. However, when I discuss him or Russian politics with US liberals, I notice that there are many blatant misconceptions. For example, people tend to think of Putin and Trump as having the same mindset - in some ways they do - but in others, they are absolutely different. For example, Putin is very much NOT an ethno-state nationalist, goes out of his way to cater to the conservative part of muslims in Russia, and has quite lenient immigration policies, mostly affecting people from Central Asia. The far right , at least the ethnic far right, in Russia hates Putin as much as the liberals do, and he has been equally brutal to both groups. Multiple times when I've brought this up, I've been called a Putin supporter, fascist, etc., even though it's an objective fact that just doesn't seem to fit into the liberal worlview in the US. There are other examples, but this post is already too long. What do you think? Are many liberals in the US (and elsewhere) guided by similar unobjective ideology/dogmatism as many conservatives? Is this a problem for liberalism?
