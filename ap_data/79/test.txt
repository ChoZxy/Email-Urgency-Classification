93	1	I mean, where to start? I think the obvious is recent events. Everything to do with Trump. The insurrection. The election lies. Not taking the pandemic seriously, and actively campaigning to get your own voters killed - you don’t owe *us* (Democrats) an apology for that, you owe it to your own voters. The thing is, your party owes not the Democrats but the American People an apology for basically everything it has done in the last 42 years or so, fifty if you think what Nixon did came close to the modern crap. And actually yeah, maybe Nixon really was where it kind of started, so start there. Apologize for everything your party has said or done since the election of 1958.

Wanna see what it's like on the other side. Then the next thing you know you find yourself confused and constantly thinking about it. What would it be like to just have a little taste. It doesn't mean anything if I just talk about it a little. Mostly just in jest. Then one day you find your self planning a vacation somewhere where no one knows you and you can truly be yourself and let your colors fly. Then you come home and this thing is gnawing at your insides and you just can't stop it. Then without warning at your conservative family christmas party it slips. You say you know I really don't think Hilary is that bad of a person and I really think Obama had a good healthcare plan. It all starts out just being curious.

It's as if to say progressives demand 2 sigma significance and conservatives require 6 sigma significance, although not directly analogous.Part of this is attacking proposals to see if they can stand up to the criticism, just how a hypothesis cannot be accepted unless you can reject every competing hypothesis.Where this gets messy is when you cannot show that a hypothesis is wrong, but you know you are incapable of generating *every* alternate hypothesis (no one is perfect). The intellectually conservative say ""it still might be false, so I can't accept it yet"" and the intellectually liberal say ""there's no reason to think it's false, so we should accept it until further evidence contradicts it."""

375	0	The only acceptable form of seeing the flag other than it's original form is to see it up side down. For obvious reasons. Coloring it blue, green or any colors of the rainbow doesn't mean much to me. It's politicized by bureaucrats and law enforcement as a scare tactic. Everyone wants to color it in to represent a political idea or expression of freedom. It's not that I dont accept the people or dislike it, it's that I have a understanding of how that flag didn't equally represent us in the first place. To lie to about it only to make myself feel accepted in the present day of something I was never meant to belong in seems stupid to me. It's become a symbol of nationalism that represents ideologies I personally disagree with. After 2016 it will be hard to navigate the separation of that flag and such forms of nationalism. And the more I see people disrespect other people because of that flag the less I am willing to even bother participating. At this point If it were on fire I wouldnt piss on it to put it out.

And I got to thinking 🤔 why is it so wrong to have a living wage standard across the board. Even 15 an hour isn’t enough for a single person anymore, let alone someone with a family. When companies can charge 3 times more than something was worth even 20 years ago, and pocket that profit- to then take and convert into for instance machines, robots and even in some instances the consumer into working for the company::coughs Walmart:: am I wrong? Or have we gone so for profit in this country that we have forgotten about the nations middle and lower class that is the backbone and keeps us going?

603	0	I can’t believe that Blackburn asked the same stupid questions as yesterday. The judicial oath mentions that judges must follow the Constitution. She was also explaining the sentencing involves any myriad number of issues, which definitely includes critical race theory. They think that mentioning the words Constitution and CRT will gain them points, but it makes them sound stupid. The worst part is that people fall for these lines. My own dad said that he’s worried she can’t “define a woman.” Also, asking for those court records is just plain evil in my opinion. They have no reason to ask for them other than trying to insinuate that information is being hidden in some kind of conspiracy. They’re literally playing with the lives of thousands of children over some stupid bullshit.

880	0	Little bit besides, but even though it would be difficult as fuck to confirm another justice the same year, because Republicans would fight hard against it, I hope that if Thomas dies soon, Biden would nominate Jacqueline Nguyen, who's been on the court of appeals since 2012, confirmed with vote 93-0 and would be the first Asian justice. Would be awesome to appoint 2 firsts in the same year.

I think that's what he was saying, caught it kind of half paying attention.Guessing it was referring to Poland....It'd be nice to see him sit down with Zelenskyy but probably going to stoke some Russian hatred, not that that really matters anymore.I was listening to Sat Radio on my lunch or coming in this morning (I usually listen to Fox for some reason) and some one asked about him possibly visiting Ukraine. I can't remember who they were talking to. Maybe a press conference they were replaying. I seriously doubt Secret Service would ever allow that in all honesty, but I started thinking....just F'ing imagine an attempt on him from Russia. Or even the implication that missiles in that general damn direction would create.

448	0	I think that the number of people who base their beliefs in dogmatic reasoning or partisan influence has gone up across the political spectrum, not just among liberals. The misfortune of social media and expanding echo chambers in real life have slowly started to suck out good conversation and debate and replaced it with the most tribal and irrational voices screaming on both sides. The best way for everyone to improve their political convictions is to actively seek out debate and conversation with people on the other side of the aisle. This is so much harder on the internet than in real life, but even in real life real barriers are being put up by both sides. For the first time in many decades, Americans have now started to see their enemies as legitimately irredeemable and excessively bigoted. This cannot continue if we are to succeed as a society. No matter how stupid/horrible you view the views of your opponents, we must admit it is possible they know something we do not, or are right about at least some issues. The only way for us to gain this knowledge and improve ourselves and each other is through directly discoursing with them.

702	0	During this lull of sanity, some were asking about all the references to a requested definition of 'woman'. This occurred yesterday evening, when Marsha Blackburn raised the question. Here is how it went down:“Can you provide a definition for the word, woman?” Blackburn asks. Jackson: “Can I provide a definition? No, I can’t.” Blackburn: “You can’t?” Jackson: “Not in this context - I’m not a biologist. … In my work as a judge what I do is I address disputes.”

996	0	Durbin earlier today:>Hawley claimed that Jackson had “a disturbing record” on child pornography. But Jackson’s sentences are in the judicial mainstream. As the Sentencing Commission concluded in its 2012 and 2021 reports, judges across the country consistently impose below-guidelines sentences in non-production cases due to a view that technological changes have rendered the guidelines outdated. For example, between 2015-2020: judges in the district of D.C., where Jackson served, imposed below-guidelines sentences in these cases 80% of the time; judges in Missouri district courts did so 77% of the time; and nationally, in 2019, only 30% of non-production child pornography offenders received a sentence within the guideline range.Going outside of the guidelines isn't rare:As for the general practice of going outside the federal guidelines, that's the norm for most judges. [Table 8. Only 42.8 sentences were within the guideline range last fiscal quarter.](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/quarterly-sentencing-updates/USSC_Quarter_Report_4th_FY21.pdf) Only .5% of those were above the guidelines. The vast majority were below the guidelines.

There are. Shall we talk about Cornyn wanting to overturn *Obergefell v. Hodges* (marriage equality), Blackburn wanting to overturn *Griswold v.

2	1	Toying with Conservative Anti-VaxersIf you ever want to melt the mind of an anti-vaxer, just say, “You know, I bet all the details of the ‘Plandemic’ were in Hillary’s email and it started in China because they hacked her private server.” Then laugh and sit back and say, “Nah… That’s be crazy, right?”I’ve never really seen someone spontaneously develop epilepsy as their mind short circuited but I’m pretty sure that was what it would look like.

I want there to be a federal concealed carry license that is valid in all states. I want there to be a better federal standard on transporting firearms so you don’t play gotcha with the local police. If there are children in the house, you need to secure your firearms. Other than that, I don’t care what you buy, how you carry it, etc. you must respect private property rules like business or schools if they say no firearms. Other than that, be safe out their.

I have the full intention of running for public office in the future and i am worried about how my past will affect me. Everything I’ve done so far has been as an immature teenager so I hope that will discredit some. For the record my past is not racist, illegal, sexist, homophobic, sexual, or anything like that, there are just pictures and videos of me doing what to the naked eye and without a thorough explanation would seem weird as hell, as they are outtakes from cheap short films me and my friends would make. Should I be worried about these videos/photos being leaked in the future and ruining my political career?

96	1	Not sure that it'll do anything but I commend you for trying!If you'd like to win a Republican primary, there's a good chance you'll have to pivot right and worship the defeated 45th President. Although you did say that you are in utah, maybe you can get away with not doing that a little bit there.I would think that local politics would probably be more suited to you since they tend to be less partisan and produce tangible results. Maybe consider that if this congressional bid fails? I wish you the best of luck

807	0	The GOP will spend years fighting against abortion because every life is valuable, then when the baby is born, they don’t care what happens to it. It’s pretty obvious from their discussions on this topic that they want to get rid of contraceptives too. They want more pregnancies, less abortions, and less poor people. Somehow that makes sense in their heads

483	0	Research and come up with your own opinions. Rather than become a mouth piece for a party. It’s alright to not be conservative on everything. Even though I am for the most part. Ethics in AI is important. You look at systems used in facial recognition like those used in the “insurrection” investigations. Those softwares are extremely unreliable when it comes to identifying people of color, largely black individuals because they are under represented in the development. This can lead to false arrests, and even guilty verdicts depending on the legitimacy given to the software. Everything deserves scrutiny, especially systems that can lock people away and take away their civil liberties.
