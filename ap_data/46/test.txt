565	1	I've been working in advertising for about 3 years now and I really like this company aside from my boss being anti marijuana. I used to be a pot head as a teen but now I micro dose for anxiety and depression. I've always taken pride in my work here and would never smoke on the job only at home, that is until last year when I lost my mother to liver cancer.   My depression got even worse after that and I couldn't focus at work so I took a week off to clear my mind. When I came back I started smoking at the beginning of my shift. Now in my three years working here I've never won anything or really got recognized for anything. In the last two months however I've won employee of the month twice.   I can't tell you how good it felt to receive that award twice from the same man who thinks that people who smoke marijuana are a bunch of lazy good for nothing drug addicts.  I'm not saying that pot is a magical medicine that will make everyone excel at what they do but it for sure has helped me keep my depression and anxiety at bay while being more productive than ever and being recognized for it.
94	3	This morning I had my first eye appointment in about 10 years and was feeling really excited to get in some new glasses!   I made my 3 year old son an appointment for the same time, so my husband came along to help. This also meant we had our 3 month old daughter with us.  The appointments were hectic with a toddler who didn’t want his eyes checked and so it took a little while to get through both visits.  By the end, when it was time to pick out frames, our daughter was starting to cry and ready to be fed. I decided the easiest thing for everyone would be if I fed her while I picked out my frames and sat to have them measured.   She was starting to get loud so I didn’t want to waste time running to the car for my cover, but I was wearing a nice loose shirt that I was able to lift over one breast and drape back down to cover my stomach so that nothing was showing. It been a while since I fed her so  my breasts were pretty full.   Everything was just about done, and I was sitting with the optometric technician at her desk, paying while sitting and feeding the baby. I leaned forward to sign the receipt and right at that moment, my baby unlatched from my breast and leaned back to stretch. My full breast was not prepared to stop so quickly, and the milk was still shooting out in the form of 3 strong jets directly at the technician and all over her desk.  I covered up quickly, wiped her desk with my shirt, apologized profusely, and left.  TL;DR was breastfeeding my baby and accidentally shot milk all over the desk at my optometrist.
186	2	[Conflicted]   I don't know if this is allowed here but I did what every one told me I should do when I wasn't planning it. Well something happened, she did something that made me pretty upset. After my post I felt like I was at my breaking point with how I've been feeling. I went off, told her how I've felt all these years, her anger problems, the selfishness just everything I  was sick of.   She didn't say anything and just let me talk. I regret going off but man was I just heated. We had a long talk, she asked me if I regret getting her pregnant, I told no, that I'm excited to meet our baby.   Well the talk lasted pretty long, she was emotional, I was emotional, it was tough. She apologized for shit that has happened in the past, how she has behaved, but told me she is not the root of all of our problems.   We are going to get help after our baby is born, she's far too tired right now. She did get mad at first, which made me even more pissed, but calmed down. I'm exhausted but damn do I feel better.   We are nowhere near out of this whole that we are in, she does blame me for being so passive and not putting my feelings out earlier because she said she has never even thought about a divorce. I do still have love for her, it's not completely gone. I am hopeful our marriage will be saved, I only see it working with professional help... thanks everyone.
599	3	Worked in a deli. Guy I've never served before comes in and orders a "small coffee with lotsa milk and 17 sugars". Can't exactly remember if I scoffed or laughed but the net result was I didn't believe him and asked him what he really wanted.  Stone serious the guy reiterated: "small coffee, lotsa milk, 17 sugars".  While making it I asked my co-worker/buddy what he would do he said "tell him to Google 'diabetes'" so he was no help. It always stuck with me because I drink my coffee black and bc he was completely nonchalant about a completely atypical order.  Fast forward to today I'm a customer in a bagel place a few towns over. I place my order with a 24oz iced coffee, black. The deli guy goes "man I don't know how you drink black coffee".  Just preceding the self-discovery that I'm a shmuck I asked "wanna hear a crazy story?" and launch into it. Just as I finish the story he looks over his shoulder at me. The instant I caught his bizarre look and he caught my deer-in-the-headlights look we both knew what happened. I paid and left without another word.  TL;DR I made fun of a customer from 2015 to a random guy in 2019 then realized after the fact that it was the same person.
564	2	I (15f) have two brothers (17m and 12m). This happened a few days ago, but I really need a second opinion.  I share a bathroom with my brothers, and the other day I accidentally left a box of tampons on the counter instead of putting them away. My younger brother asked me what they were, and I said that they were tampons.  Cue him being very confused, and my older brother and I realising that he knows nothing about any of this stuff. We decided to give him a basic rundown of the female reproductive system and he seemed okay with it.  That night, he mentioned to our parents that we told him about periods and they got pretty upset. My mom said that he's way to young to be knowing about this and that it was inappropriate for us to be telling him. As it turns out, they're planning on opting him out of Sex Ed. at his school in the spring because he's, in their opinion, too young.  I can kind of see where they're coming from, he is their kid after all and I definitely could have just said that the tampons were "feminine products". However, this is something he would have to learn at some point and that wasn't going to happen if they didn't let him go to sex ed.  I'm not really sure, did we seriously overstep a boundary here? AITA?  Edit: For those people saying that this is obviously fake because I haven't replied to comments or something, no, I went to bed. I was sleeping. Calm down.   To answer some questions: My older brother and I did mandatory Sex Ed in 5th grade, but my younger brother's was cancelled due to the state of the world. We also both did Sex Ed in 8th grade. I have no idea why they would opt out only him, but it's probably a youngest child thing.
182	1	A little backstory, So 3 weeks ago I bought a grill and was BBQing ribs(my first time) and they looked GOOD. So when I came back in from checking on them I yelled "Babe them ribs lookin SMACKALICIOUS!"(idk why I chose this word but it was the first one that came to mind) Then my 3 year old son copied me like "lookin mackawicious!" and I was like yeah SMACKALICIOUS! Giving him high fives and  me and him was just repeating that they looked SMACKALICIOUS the whole time I was grilling. I didn't think much of it and my wife and I thought it was cute every time he would copy me and say "MACKAWICIOUS!" Now fast forward to yesterday, I grilled ribs again but this time I wasn't as excited as I knew what I was doing and knew they would be good. I never once called them smackalicious or anything of the sort. I pull em off the grill, put em on the island and am letting em cool down a bit when my son walks up to me with his plate and said "daddy can I have some mackawicious?" I was like "huh? some what" and he pointed at the ribs and said " SOME MACKAWICIOUS!" and I just started cracking up and look over at my wife who is shaking her head at me while holding back a laugh. I then put some on his plate and said "no buddy they are called ribs" and he smiles at me and says "nooo its a mackawicious!" So now I have to find out a way to turn the fun word of "mackawicious" into the boring word "ribs".  TL;DR Yelled that my ribs looked smackalicious with my son the whole time I was grilling a few weeks ago and now my son thinks ribs are called, as he would say "mackawicious".
651	2	I(24F) and my fiance are planning our wedding for next year. We have a plan to do it at our house and keeping it plain and simple. My parents are helping with the wedding and have been amazing. There have been no issues with anything until this past weekend.   We have no problem with kids and children coming as our wedding date is in the summer. My idea is to have some games for the kids to play. We also have a pool for evening swimming. The issue has been about dogs coming to the wedding. Our two dogs will be with our sitter, who normally takes them for hikes and plays with her dogs. Everyone was very understanding and will not bring their dogs.  My fiance's cousin came up for the weekend to visit and brought is dog. The dog spent his time off the leash, running around the yard and getting into mischief. The dog chewed up a couch in our camper, which fiance was not happy with. When he asked about the wedding and the details, we told him all the details. He asks if his dog is invited and I tell him nobody else is bringing their dogs. He looks at my fiance for validation and he gives him the same answer.   His cousin gets upset and tells my fiance he will not come unless his dog is allowed to attend. My fiance told him that he is not backing down. Cousin leaves and now my fiance is getting messages from his sister that she won't be coming unless his dog is allowed. Some family have even messaged me that I am horrible and an animal hater.   AITA for wanting my wedding to be animal free?
236	2	About 2 months ago my friend asked me if I was seeing anyone. Generally I would have just said no but she said it kind of condescendingly like "heh, we all know that you're still alone." Anyway, I ended up lying and saying that I was seeing a guy. She told my other friends and I've been lying about it ever since.   All of my friends are married and all but two of them have children. I've always wanted to get married and have kids but I thought it would just happen naturally. When I was in college I had no shortage of decent guys who were interested in me, but it turns out that college is a rather unique environment. I have focused on my career and my friends for a long time because I just didn't think it would be all that difficult to find someone. Anyway, after I turned 30 I freaked out a little and started actually trying to find someone but I'm 34 now and I still haven't found anyone that I want to spend my life with. If I don't find someone soon I won't be able to have children. I hate being such a cliche but I can't help it.  Lying about having a boyfriend doesn't help my situation very much but it does stop my friends from making subtle condescending remarks about me being single and not being able to find someone. [Remorse]
29	3	TIFU: So in honor of the norm of this sub this incident happened about a year ago. I worked as a Travel Agent in rural Australia in a small office that was run by the largest Travel company in Aus. I had a client come in one day one of my very first who wanted a basic travel package to Vanuatu, sure no problems easy enough I work it up for them take their money and send them on their way until their tickets are ready (about 4 months after the payment). Fast forward 6 months I get woken up at 3am from our customer relations team letting me know of my colossal fuck up. We had a system that let us know of all flight developments for the tickets purchased by our clients cancellations, time changes etc. Now I had next to no training on this system and thus very important message got overlooked by my rookie eyes. It turns out Virgin Australia had cancelled all flights to Vanuatu due to runway conditions about a week after I booked these flights. So my clients are at the airport at 3 in the morning being told that their flight DOES NOT EXIST. Long story short we paid for 2 first class tickets, 2 weeks of 5 star resort accommodation as well as food and drink expenses. Totalling $15,673AUD. And was promptly "let go".  TLDR didnt know what I was doing customers tried to board a nonexistant flight and I cost the business 15K and lost my dream job
615	3	In 5th grade, I had a black history month project where I had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. I looked up ‘important African Americans’ and found a Wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so I thought. I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South African scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month.   TL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn’t realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.  Edit: Though Cormack was born in South Africa, he became a US citizen early in his career. That's why he was on the list of African Americans.  Edit 2: I feel like this belongs in greentext
470	1	The men's room at the store I'm currently working in is currently out of order, and has been for several days. I think this is probably related to the bathroom fixings on pallets in the warehouse, but it's not really my business so I've not asked. In the meantime, make customers can use the disabled toilet.  A bloke who saw this sign and was turning back towards the disabled loo was pipped to it by a woman with three children in tow. Oops. The look of desperation on his face made me pause.  I suggested that the women's, which is three cubicles (and not gappy American ones) are still functional, and offered to see if the coast was clear. It was, so I stood guard outside the door while he did his business in there. The woman who'd gone into the disabled hadn't emerged by the time he came out.  However, while he was in there a woman wanted to go in. I warned her that a man was occupying one cubicle at that moment, and she blew up. She threatened to get a manager involved, go to the papers about perverts being allowed in the toilets, and the works. She was _not_ happy that a man was invading sacred female space.  AITA for allowing a man into the women's loos?
340	2	So I started dating my girlfriend in June. We have a lot in common and I'm honestly in love with her. Last night, she had a sleepover with one of her male friends. I don't know him very well but he's a good guy. When I texted her late at night, she replied that she was in her bed. When I asked where he was sleeping, she casually said that he was sleeping beside her. Now that was kind of a shock to me. I know they used to share a bed sometimes before we started dating but I assumed that she wouldn't do that anymore. I tell her that I was uncomfortable with it and she immediately went to sleep on the living room couch.  I fully trust her but just the thought of her sharing a bed with another man fills me with unease. I kept feeling guilty all night because of it. Am I just old fashioned? Am I an asshole for not being comfortable with my girlfriend sharing a bed with another man?   Edit: Had a talk with her. She initially got a little angry because she thought I wasn't trusting her to be faithful, but then she understood that boundaries had to be set. This whole thing has just confused me about my own feelings. After reading the comments, I'm questioning whether I have puppy love for her. Maybe it'll change over time.
628	1	My wife and myself live in a house with 3 other people. We are self employed and work from home. Everyone else either works or are in college.  A few weeks ago the other three housemates told us that we were being inconsiderate because we were so often in the common space. They assured us that it wasn't because we were doing anything particularly annoying in the common space, just that we were there so often.   This really shocked me. I figured that the common space is always fair game, as long as you aren't being too loud, always taking up the whole couch so other people couldn't use it etc. I thought that if you want your alone time, you just stay in your room.  But the 3 of them all agreed that we were doing them a disservice, and they seem to think that pretty much anyone else would agree.  So that's my question to you, am I (and my wife) being the asshole for being in the common space so often?
806	1	We were both hired as temp summer employees, and though we technically do different jobs, we have to see each other and interact on a daily basis. Because of this, I figured it was probably best to just not let anyone know we were together at the start so that management didn't feel like we might be unprofessional working together.  The problem is they keep trying to get us together, like, calling us Jim and Pam and giving us random excuses to see each other throughout the day. Our coworkers say they think we just hit it off really well and are also trying to push us together. Our manager loudly stated that we have no policy against dating in the work place and smiled at us both.  He gave me a ride home one day when my car had issues and I swear the office was beaming. They all mentioned the next day how kind it was of him and that I should ask to go to lunch as a return favour LOL. So we went out to lunch that day.  It's harmless and I know it makes them happy to give them a project for the summer so we have just been going with it. We're planning on telling them we're going out before I leave (he decided to stay part time during the school year, I have another job lined up), but not telling them how long we have been together.  It gives me an excuse to hang out with my boyfriend all day so I can't complain.
639	1	Long story short: I work in a shop where a computer is required (basically an internet café), and my boss being the cheap asshole he is forces me to work with a shitty 2008 Samsung laptop with the shittiest specs, so slow and makes my interactions with customers awkward and my job painfully harder than it should be. I've been asking him to get a proper computer for months arguing that it would benefit him more than me (and it would)  His argument is always "this little guy got me to where I am now, he's our good omen!" Despite being perfectly capable of buying a PC with decent hardware with his bloody pocket change.  Today I had enough, so I just poured water on it's, wiped it out and let it dry. To my surprise it would still turn on, but the keyboard is fucked. So..  Now he's forced to get a better PC.  *Update: you were right. He suggested using a USB keyboard, not even a new one (which we sell) he brought an old one from his house. Needless to say the keys never hit the counter any harder.*
554	3	So at the pool yesterday my mother told me a guy was “looking at me” and she gave him my phone number which prompted him to come talk to me so I spent hours with him at the stupid pool.  Once we left I was incredibly angry with her and I yelled at her for being an idiot for what she did. She embarrassed me and she went against what I told her in confidence. I came out to her a while ago and it’s been in open conversation since yet she still did this. She told me I’m probably not certain yet so she did this stupid thing but the reason I told her is because I am certain.   So on the way home I was arguing with her and she told me to be quiet and then she called my dad and complained about “my behavior” to him which annoyed me because what she did justified my behavior. So I grabbed her phone and hung up on him and the freaked out and told me I can’t do things like that and now I’m in trouble for it. She took away things from me and I can’t do anything with friends for a week. I just didn’t want her to lie about me to my dad anymore than she was doing and I tried to justify myself before she made me look horrible. I don’t think I’m in the wrong for defending myself, right?
552	1	I, 20F, attempted to rent an apartment with my other friend, 19F, over a year ago. Unfortunately we got scammed out of a lot of money, the two of us. We were both young and inexperienced with this stuff so we were easily fooled. I lost about 3,000 dollars and she lost 1,500. I immediately started the lawsuit process. Due to me losing all the money I fell on hard times and I’m struggling financially currently, as she is as well. But she refused to file her own claim, and I am only permitted to have my money and compensation returned to me. It’s been a year and she hasn’t made any effort to pursue a lawsuit against them for her lost earnings, meanwhile I’ve spent hours a day at the courts for the past year trying to make a case and preparing for the hearing. I eventually received money and got much more than I gave initially because I was able to prove I lost a lot of financial income and struggled a lot based on the corporations scam. Anyways, even tho I received a large sum of money, it does not account for what my friend paid or put down. She could file herself and receive her money plus more back but she is trying to tell me I owe her half of the lawsuit. I need the money I received for medical bills, my current rent, and other expenses I have lost which is why I was granted the amount I was. I’ve explained to her she would’ve got her own money if she would’ve put the effort in and filed herself. She says that Im TA because she is owed money. Some of my friends say I am too and should just give her half the lawsuit. For reference I only got 5,000 USD from the lawsuit.  EDIT: typo
2	1	   Soooo this just happened.  I was reading my son (17 yo) something off reddit, about people not wanting milk from animals, but almond milk instead. Because we read each other funny reddit stories a lot.  He apparently wondered how one would milk an almond.  He, however, phrased it a little less than fortunate.  "how do you milk nuts?" In a catchy voice.  The look of sheer horror on the face of my 17 year old son, as he realised what he just asked his mother, was epic. It took him all of 0.5 seconds to go "OH, OH NO", and then the look of calm acceptance because he knows he's not going to live this down.  I proceeded to tell him how the "nuts" are squeezed to get the milky substance out (I have no idea how almond milk is made, but I kind of imagine they get squeezed or something), all while he was trying to hide behind his laptop, yelling "No, no mom stop". I actually cried laughing.  TL;DR my son asked me how you "milk nuts" and I explained it, he will be reminded of this fuckup at every available opportunity in the future.
355	3	I moved to a new city 7 years ago, and as a matter of course got a new, better paying job.  When stocking my new house with groceries, I thought "I'll buy the nice Himalayan pink salt this time." Over time I diversified my salt selection to include Maldon flakes, kosher salt, and diamond crystal, but left the Morton's behind. As the years went by I gained a bit of weight but nothing shocking, my hair got a bit grey, and my joints started hurting in the mornings. I eat well, exercise often, and take care of myself. No big deal, right? This is what it means to get older.   Fast forward to this spring and I had a thyroid function test come back abnormal. My doctor wanted to put me on thyroid medication immediately but I started doing a bit of my own research and we agreed to do a retest in 3 months.   I switched to a multivitamin with Iodine included and put the Morton's salt back in my pantry. 3 months later I've lost 15lbs, my hair looks like Fabio, my skin has cleared up and I don't hurt every morning. Went back in for a test and my thyroid hormone has returned to a normal range.   Tl;Dr: get plenty of iodine in your diet!
897	2	So, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. Anyway, I asked this girl Clara out on a date about a year ago. I was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. It stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. Since then I've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally I've had more luck with girls. I still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.  Anyway, me and a few friends I've made since last year went out to a gathering. I'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! Clara was there. I think she recognized me but I wasn't sure. Me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. The date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.  After this I went home and thought about where to go next, and I realized I couldn't really forgive her. So, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and I sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. I haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge I got was so sweet!   But, maybe I was an asshole though, what does Reddit think?
366	2	Ok so I managed at a restaurant owned by a douchebag of an owner who refused to allow us to pay regular staff a reasonable wage and refused to allow us a reasonable labor percentage (wanted 21% including management). Suffice it to say his expectations were absurd. However, the other 3 management in the team were good people. And we had a few solid employees as well.    A few months back I put in my two weeks notice and my district manager pulled some strings and got me almost a $3/h raise, which is pretty damn significant. So I stayed. Which was what he wanted. Obviously. I stuck it out for as long as I could but the stress became too much and it was affecting my home life. I put in my two weeks notice knowing full well that they'd be screwed because there's no way they'd replace me within 2 weeks and even with me they were short-handed as we'd just lost a full-time employee and fired 2 people.    It's been a week and a half since I've been officially off payroll and they've opened late and closed early almost every day since then. This obviously affects the owners profits, but I obviously don't care about that as he's a top notch cunt. But it also affects my former co-workers, who I do care about. But I needed to remain sane.   So, I ask you guys, am I the asshole here?
497	2	My girlfriend doesn’t usually respond to texts from weird guys on Instagram so when she got one from this dude I had asked if I can message him, a couple of hours go by of me talking to him and he gives me 500 dollars for an “Allowance” he then later asked if I can go turn 2000 dollars into bitcoin at one of those bitcoin atms. I say yes but when he sent it to me I was so dumb founded, I blocked him and changed all my personal info. Am I a bad person from this and can he get the police after me?
424	2	So I’ve been seeing seeing this girl for almost 6 months now. She’s super terrific to me, and I really think things are going better than they’ve gone in my most recent relationships. We met on Tinder! I personally deleted Tinder two weeks after meeting her because I was that into her. She told me she did the same about two weeks after that. However, a recent Instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. Figured I’d look at it, because we had each other on other social media’s (and I was curious) BIG MISTAKE  She’s got a substantial amount of followers and notes, but I’ve noticed all she talks about is her ex and how she’s in love with him, and other Tinder guys she’s gone on dates with. We started playing video games together recently, and I’ve just found out that her interest in them came from a guy she just spent last weekend with.   She has no idea I know any of this information, and I’m too into her to say anything. Please help! What do I do? TL;DR Girlfriend I’m basically in love with has a Tumblr talking about her recent tinder dates and undying love for her ex and she doesn’t know I know
517	1	This whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, "I bet you wish you had a dick." To which I responded, "no, not really."   He seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me "think about" why what I said was so upsetting.   I don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao
857	3	Obligatory this didn't happen today.   A while back I got out of the Navy. That old saying is true "swear like a sailor". I applied for a program called helmets to hard hats that finds jobs in skilled labor trades for veterans. My father is good friends with a guy who is in charge of the local branch of an elevator company.  So I applied to the international union of elevator constructors and was granted an interview. Union interviews, as I am told, usually consist of several promonent manners of the union. I'm this case it included my father's friend.  So I show up to the interview and sit down with 5 high ranking union members. My name is Richard. My Dad's friend says " So Richard what do you like to go by Rick, Ricky, Richard... DICK? Before I could stop myself I sarcastically replied "it's cock actually"  I pretended like everything was normal and the interview continued after an awkward pause. I did get the job and was admitted as an apprentice. Everyone still calls me Cock.  TLDR: Guy asked me, Richard, if I go by Dick. I sarcastically replied Cock, and now everyone calls me Cock.
568	3	This was 1996,  and I was twelve. I had just landed a small part on E.R.  where I played a burn trauma victim because my mother was cooking meth in our upstairs apt. A firefighter had broken my fall and I was rescued! As Chicago’s heroes brought me to the ER, George Clooney began to work me up; intubation, pads, vitals, establishing a line, all the while spitting out Dr. jargon.  Now, this is where IFU,  During the filming of this scene, George asked me if I wanted a his hat and that he would autograph it! I was so excited,  when suddenly the voice of my Mother entered my head telling me not to share hats, combs, drinks, etc with others. I was twelve, rationality hadn’t developed yet.  I told him no, because “he might have lice”. I remember the priceless look on his and the other actors and crews faces when I said this. Cut to later that evening after wrap, my Mother and I were making our way off set when I told her the story. She let go of my hand, and her jaw dropped as she whipped around to try and catch him in his trailer so that she could apologize on my behalf. Unfortunately George Clooney had already left for the day. Probably to go wash his hair.   tl;dr on set with George Clooney, he offered me his autographed hat, said no bc lice, and have regretted it ever since.
584	2	I(60M) raised a son(25M) and a daughter(26F) with my wife(61F). My wife's parents were very racist and against anything LGBT. My wife has the same beliefs as her family and it caused a lot of stress with the family. My son came out as bisexual when he was 15 and I fully supported him. I made sure that he had everything he needed and helped keep his relationships private until he turned 18 and moved out. My wife found out that he was happily in a relationship with another man and cut all contact with him.   When our daughter moved out and graduated college, she fell in love with a guy from Australia. She invited us out to dinner to meet her new boyfriend and my wife wouldn't even get out of the car.   Son and his husband had a small wedding planned this past October. When we received the invites, I asked my wife if she was going to attend her son's wedding. She argued that she wanted nothing to do with son's relationship and would never consider his husband her SIL. I went to the wedding alone and helped pay for most of the wedding. Son was disappointed that his mother wasn't at the wedding. My wife is still very upset that I attended his wedding and keep in contact with both of them. Wife is upset that I keep in close contact with both of them and will help with their finances.    AITA for not bringing my wife to son's wedding?
374	1	I went to take my garbage out last night around 8 PM, but had to get the can from the curb. As I walked to the curb, I noticed a car sitting across the street with a lady in it. She proceeded to shine a flashlight at me and ask my what my address was, as my porch light is out. I didn't really feel comfortable, so I asked her what it was she needed. She said she was looking for someone who lives on this street. I told her I thought it was probably down the street. I then went inside to put my son to sleep. As soon as i got inside, I saw her walking up to my front door shining her flashlight into my window. I opened the door and asked if I could help her, and she said "I don't think the house I'm looking for exists", so I responded with "ok well, this isn't the house you're looking for and I can't help you. Please get off my property." She seemed shocked that I reacted that way. I had never seen this lady in my neighborhood before, and it was dark out, and just a strange situation. Am I the asshole for assuming she was up to no good?
493	1	SIDE NOTE/ answer to a lot of questions of how I got away with it: Lucky I lived near a military base so we had so many military discounts, managers gave us the code to ring it in.  When I was working at red lobster in my early 20’s - this was my scam :(  Bill: $105 (paying in cash) discount applied: –$10.50 (10% off) tip: $20 Cash I kept: 30.50  I did this multiple times a day for three years and was never caught.
58	3	So this happened yesterday. Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee's and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought " Heck yeah, I'm totally winning as a Dad right now". So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it's subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying "Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit" as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says "Dad, what's prostitution?" To which I responded "Oh, it's just a form of business that some people choose to do"....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says "Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution" My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.  TL:DR Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.
437	3	Obligatory this happened about 14 years ago.  So I work in healthcare, I walk into this little old lady's room and do my normal introduction and let her know what I was there to do. I pull down her blankets to listen to her breath sounds when I catch a glimpse of a tattoo on her arm, then I blurt out "oh wow cool you have a tattoo" (I was surprised to see a lady in her 70s with a tattoo). Then I got a better look at said tattoo it was a very sloppy serial number. In that moment I realized that's she's probably a WWII concentration camp survivor, and that tattoo is probably a daily reminder of the horror's she endured.  I was pretty quiet for the rest of our encounter 😟  TL:DR I complemented a WWII concentration camp survivors serial number tattoo.
211	1	I (M 17) am a high school senior and just got a shave even though my mom is very against it. I have never shaved before and I just broke up with my girlfriend so I felt like it was time to turn over a new leaf and shave my facial hair.  I told my mom a couple months ago I wouldn't shave until I was 18, but I didn't promise and I changed my mind. My mom is trying to guilt me by asking "Do you love me?" and when I say yes she says, "than don't shave your beard".   She is also misinformed as to the myths of shaving. She thinks it will come back thicker and that less will grow back.  I think i'm old enough to make my own decisions but my mom is really mad. Am I the Asshole?
575	1	I have supported us financially for nearly 8 years. He quits jobs like he quits styles, so I have been the bread winner (and often the ONLY source of income) for our entire relationship. His father died recently, and he inherited some money. Now he wants "an itemized report of where every dime of his money goes"...like I get that he wants to make sure the money is spent wisely, but, I have always cleared every purchase with him even when it was "my" money because I feel like it is our money/our income even if it was my paycheck....now he suddenly inherits money (for perspective, it's still less than my salary, so we're not talking millions of dollars or anything crazy) and wants to know where HIS money is spent. I said, "ok, I will do that for you, but I find it interesting that you never questioned how the money was being spent when it wasn't 'yours' and it was 'ours'"...  I've now decided to withdraw "his" money from the checking account and hand him "his" cash so he can spend it and keep track of it himself (in the morning, when the bank opens)...so  he's pissed and doesn't understand why I'm pissed.   AITA for getting mad that my partner wants to account for "every dime of HIS money" when I've been supporting us for 7+ years and he's never been interested in our finances prior?
797	1	The summer between 8th and 9th grade, local dentist and family friend, Dr. Wyatt, hired me to file away a giant stack of patient charts. These patient charts were for every patient they had seen in the past couple months. The staff had let the task get away from them and nobody wanted to touch it. I’d guess roughly 1,500-2,000 Manila folders were piled haphazardly in stacks on a desk in the corner, and it grew every afternoon I was there.   Next to the desk was a 5x5 foot room with filing cabinets that stretched to the ceiling on each wall. I would sit in this room by myself for hours putting these charts in meticulous alphabetical order. It was absolutely mind numbing and I was a shithead kid with a bad attitude about it.   A few afternoons in, I started to realize every patient chart had return appointments that were not until at least November, and nobody would be retrieving these charts until then, and in November l would be in school, away from this hell. So I started filing the charts in random order with no regard for alphabetization. I would put a José Gonzales amongst a sea of Sarah Smiths. This dramatically increased my filing speed and work satisfaction. At the end of my employment I was congratulated by everyone on a job well done and I said goodbye and thanks.  I wonder what it was like to discover that mess. I bet that was a rough November for that office.
532	3	So me and my school mates are aware that our literature teacher, Ms. Sarah, is a novel-worm (bookworm). She constantly tells us how she loves to read, how books are her life, her current favorites, collections, etc.   One time, right after finals, the computation of our grades is about to happen and Ms. Sarah approach the students she’s kinda close with to donate 10 non educational books (she specifically asked for it) on this certain orphanage and whoever gives will be having additional points on finals. Many donated, including me. I sacrificed my books because i needed the points😭(I was a senior). I did get the points but they weren’t enough.   After 3 years, one of the students i was closed with who also donated, sent me a message of a woman selling pre-loved books on fb and guess what...  I saw the books i donated years ago to the “orphanage” on that post and Ms. Sarah was the one who’s selling. We asked the other students about it and they confirmed that their donations were also there.  Ms. Sarah, if you’re reading this...  You dirty little teacher, all of us, the students who donated were not satisfied with the 2 points you added on our papers.   I hope no one will buy OUR books, scammer!
133	1	I’ll try and keep this brief. Was engaged to a girl for a while. Not a happy relationship, all your typical red flag behaviours (very controlling, huge tantrums for minor things, personal insults and the general degradation of my self confidence).  On my bachelor/stag party (abroad) I met a girl. We got on well and she WhatsApped herself some photos I’d taken on the night out.  After the engagement was broken off I was feeling low. I texted the girl for some conversation and we got on well. I told her I wanted to visit more places. She wanted to come with. We eventually met up in a European city and had a great time, agreeing to do it again.   My ex and I are totally over. Neither of us wanted to fix or resume the relationship. However, AITA for meeting up and potentially starting a relationship with a girl I met on my own bachelor/stag party?
829	3	Last Sunday was my first shift back at work since we closed 2 years ago due to COVID. I noticed one of my coworkers who used to have really long hair had it cut shoulder length. So I jokingly asked her “Why did you cut your hair? It looked so nice! I was always really jealous of your hair!”  She tells me that her hair’s been falling out and become too hard to maintain. Keep in mind at this point she’s still smiling at me and playing along.  10 minutes later I hear my other coworker asking her if she had lost weight. She replies “Yeah. My kidney transplant failed and now I have to get dialysis once a week.”   I completely forgot about her kidney transplant!! She was super nice though and treated me normally throughout our shift but I still felt like such an asshole.   TL;DR: asked my coworker why she cut her hair and told her how jealous I was of her hair, turns out she suffered from kidney failure and her hair is a result of weekly dialysis.  Edit: My coworker and I had worked together for 3 years and for the entire time she’s always had waist length hair. It wasn’t my intention to insult her new hairstyle. I think I was just initially shocked and asked her those questions without thinking it through. I meant it as a compliment but reading your replies I understand I went about it the wrong way. I never explicitly said I didn’t like her new haircut but I see how that might have been implied through my comments and I will 100% apologize the next time I see her and refrain from mentioning changes in other peoples appearance in the future.
525	3	Okay... so there was a hike near my home called egg rock hike. There was this perfect, egg shaped rock that was nestled in the side of a cliff at the end of the hike. It was a gorgeous hike. Per tradition you would go up to the top of the hike and hold the egg rock. Me and my family went to the top of the hike, and of course I cradled the egg rock. But I dropped it, and it rolled all the way down into the abbess. I can’t believe that I was so clumsy that I ruined the hike for the entire town. I have really bad astigmatism in both eyes so I can’t see very good. We searched for an hour for the egg rock, but we could never find it. Honestly it feels like a fever dream. My family still berates me about it to this day. It was a natural, perfectly shaped egg and it will never be replaced. A couple years later, the hike was shut down because it was actually on private property.  I really wish this was a joke.  TL;DR: blind idiot ruins town hike
759	1	Edit- This got a lot more comments than I thought it would! My husband and I read many of the comments and we both had a good laugh. He has agreed that this is his mess and has renewed determination. Just wanted to say again that this really was all in good fun. My husband is not a jerk who is weaponizing his incompetence. He’s just someone who vastly underestimated the power of glitter! (But oh wow does he know now.)  This is a relatively light hearted dispute, but my husband and I are both convinced we are right. My kid loves to do craft projects. However, as most parents or teachers know, glitter is the worst. My husband thinks my insistence on no glitter is over the top and he came home from the craft store the other day with several tubes of loose glitter (my kid begged him for them). Of course my kid proceeded to get glitter everywhere. We both made him clean it up. But he’s 4 and obviously he’s not going to be able to vacuum it all up and wipe everything down without help. My husband tried his best but the glitter is still there. I could probably get rid of the rest of it since I’m more experienced with glitter than him (if you can actually quantify one’s glitter experience), but I’m refusing to help out of principle. Now, glitter is turning up on our clothes and getting tracked around the house on our feet. I’ve my husband google exists and he can figure it out. AITA for refusing to help with any glitter clean up?
803	1	So my best friend since childhood died lately. We've been together for everything, I was there at his  high school graduation, he was there at mine (He was a year older than me and he came to my graduation from his college). Our families have practically been closest friends forever.  Anyway, he died recently suddenly, but he tweeted out a few weeks ago "I haven't died yet, so as far as I know, I'm immortal"  Then he died.   Anyway, me and him always had a morbid sense of humor, and I was going through his twitter reminiscing yesterday, and I saw that tweet. Now me being a cheeky fucker i quoted the tweet and said "Guess not ya fuckin bastard"  It was met with outrage from some people, people that were not even close with him, I probably had like 8 people calling me an asshole until some of my other friends stepped in to back me up.  Anyway, i don't think I was being an ass, my friend would've died laughing if he knew I did that.  Asshole? I don't think so. Insensitive, maybe a bit from an outside view. let me know please
393	2	Hi, so my girlfriend and i watched a horror movie recently, called The Last Exorcism. Now keep in mind, i HATE horror, i get very scared easily. but she likes horror, and practically begged me to watch it with her. So, i did watch it, and have been very jumpy lately. It was pretty scary, because horror movies have always given me nightmares.   My girlfriend, however, thinks it's funny how i am. She has picked up me bad habit. She likes to sneak up behind me and make a loud noise to startle me. It's horrible. I hate it. I feel like i'm walking on eggshells in my own house.   So, last night, she went out with some friends. I was home alone, and after a few hours, she came back, but didn't tell me or knock or anything. I had no idea she was home. I went into my kitchen, keep in mind, this was after midnight. And she ran up behind me, wearing a scary mask with a scream. Without thinking,  out of reflex. I hit her. I punched her in the nose.   She was crying and her nose was bleeding. I repeatedly apoligized to her, but she pushed me away and called me a piece of shit. She packed up her clothes and left my house. She refuses to return my calls and has been telling our friends that i hit her.   I didn't mean to do it, but it just happened.   So, am i the asshole for punching my girlfriend as a reflex for her startling me?
6	3	I was doing my pre-test ritual of packing everything (panadol for back pain, a light lunch, pencils, etc.). I'm feeling that my eyes are kinda dry when I remember that there are several eyedrop bottles in the medicine cabinet. I sort through them and throw out a few expired ones, then grab one with the latest expiry date. I can't read the label because it's in Chinese but I assume it's one of those vitamin B-12 ones or just saline solution. So I put a couple drops in each eye and then catch the bus to go to the testing centre.   As I'm walking from the bus stop (which happens to be near a lake), I'm squinting and finding it very hard to see from the light reflecting off the water. I can't even look at the road because of puddles and even the painted white lines were too bright. At first I thought it was just my eyes not being used to the sun, but when I finally got to the exam centre, I found I couldn't even read words properly. They were all blurry and my eyes couldn't focus.   That's when I noticed something was wrong and finally looked up the one English word on the eyedrop bottle -- "Picon". Basically they're eyedrops used to dilate the pupils before an eye exam or surgery and this allowed way too much light to enter my eye. As a result, everything was so bright it was physically painful to look at things.   It would've been fine any other day -- I'd wait for it to wear off and laugh at myself, but it had to be right before my 3 hour exam. Yeah, it's not fun trying to speed read a lot of content when your eyes have trouble focusing.   TLDR: wrong eyedrops --&gt; dilated pupils --&gt; painfully bright/blurry --&gt; can't focus during exam
747	2	I’m going to be real brief. I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he’s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status.   But I’m pregnant with his child.  He is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn’t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don’t even know how she found my number! I’m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy.   I don’t think she’s the asshole because I get that she’s upset. But I definitely don’t think I am either!
624	2	So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.  I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control.  Well, it didn't stop.   Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.  The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH!  So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about. His audibly loud gf seems able to stop her moaning and screaming whenever the first floor Gargoyle makes an appearance.  AITA for making gargoyle noises to ruin my roommate's mood because he won't respect my wishes to not have audibly loud sex in the middle of the night on weekdays?
855	3	So, this one did actually happen this morning.  My partner and I's cat (Belle) likes to come lie on top of us in the early morning and chill. Usually she'll lie on my girlfriend but today she blessed me with her floofy love. I was sleeping on my chest so she camped out on my back, with her head just above my waist. I start to slowly wake up as Belle falls asleep... while I wake up I accidently let a lil doot sneak out, a lil doot that on any other day would have went unnoticed, but not today. Belle, who was blissfully asleep, jumps awake at the sound of my doot firing off right by her head, tenses and leaps forward, claws digging into and down my ass. I woke up fully to panicked ass pain and yelped, rolling over on the bed and pretty much crushing my girlfriend in an attempt to escape ass stabs while Belle scampered outta the bedroom for her life. Cue my partner crying in laughter while I try to explain why the cat stabbed me in the ass and how it wasn't my fault. To make it all worse this is the cats adoption birthday and she's avoided me all day.  TL;DR, Passed wind in my cat's face by accident on her birthday, she stabbed me in the ass and will no longer speak to me.  Edit: I fell asleep and now my most awarded post is about my cat stabbing my ass, I don't know what I expected. Belle is very happy she's made Internet people laugh, thank you all for making her birthday better, and thank you all for the funny stories you've added on!  Second edit: I spell the letters bad  Third edit: obligatory cat tax - http://imgur.com/gallery/uGlrHRm
676	1	This was in the mid 80's when security wasn't like it is now and also, lot's of families didn't even lock their doors.  The first time I ever did this was when I was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. I peeked in and said "hello" just to see if someone was home. No one answered. I stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left.  After that day, I was hooked on it. I would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. I never stole anything but I did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. I once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. I took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over.  I felt like I needed to leave a mark so I ended up moving dishes in cabinets. Like, I switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. I did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family.  I stopped after that. Someone did call the police but nothing ever came of it since nothing was stolen. I haven't trespassed in anyone's home but I do switch things around in other homes when I'm invited over.
276	3	I (M 26) share an office with my boss. I started a few months ago, and it was probably my 2nd or 3rd day when she seemed very ill and miserable, putting her head down on her desk etc.  I asked her what was wrong and she said she was having really bad cramps. They must have been really bad, because she said she was going home early.  I consider myself very sympathetic to the female condition, so naturally, I assumed she was just having a rough period. I said, "well, hey, at least you're not pregnant!" I laughed at my own comment and patted myself on the back for being such a relatable funny confidant for women.  Several months later she told me that her cramps were so severe that day because she had gotten an abortion that morning.  TL;DR Told my boss "at least you're not pregnant" thinking she was on her period when she had actually just had an abortion that morning.  I mean, it was true. At least she wasn’t pregnant. But I was still mortified and have removed this comment from my repertoire as I have said it to probably every woman who has ever told me they were having cramps.
938	1	I decided to quit my job a couple years ago. But then I decided I would just fuck off and see if they fired me. Well, I juts doodle on the internet all day, every day. I haven't done any actual work in years. I look like I am working, but I certainly am not.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm in middle management, so it's pretty easy to delegate in both directions and keep my schedule clear, lol.
362	1	No, I am not an anti vaxxer. I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.  I discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his "anti vaxxer sister" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me.   I asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?
592	1	We’re both students, im from the capital and he is from small city in our country. We are studying both at the same university. In his free time he likes to cook, make cakes, desserts etc. Lately his financial situation wasn’t good, i offered him help but he didn’t wanted to accept it. Last night he baked me a chocolate muffins and those were the best muffins i have ever tried. He started telling me that this month no one bought a single piece of the desserts he made. This morning i bring home the rest of the muffins and everyone home liked it.   This evening i called him and i said that my neighbor tried the muffins and she liked them, so she wanted to make a order of three doses of muffins. That was the lie ( many times i tried to buy muffins from him but everytime he rejected my money ) When i told him about the order he was so happy and he said that they can be ready on Tuesday. I said good I’ll take the muffins and will bring to my neighbor.  So now what im doing is buying muffins from him like for my neighbor but it’s actually for me,just to help him get through the crisis giving me the best muffins in the world in return.
353	1	So the other night I was driving through an estate having dropped a friend home.   These bunch of little kids out at like 1130pm in the dark are out messing on the roads on their bikes and scooters, no adults or helmets to be seen  This one particular girl, she was scootering slooooow toward me and just gazing at me, a noticeable car driving toward her. Slooowwww scooter huh is that a car I'll probably just stay on the road going so slowwww. So girl doesn't show any signs of moving off the road so I don't stop but I full beam her. My car lights are pretty bright anyway but my full beam are super. She covers her face, stumbles around and starts crying. I still keep on my full lights till she moves her silly ass off the road  If you're gonna let your kids play out at stupid o'clock at least teach them road safety!!
527	2	I know most non-Americans on here think Americans are idiots for how much stock we put in our ancestry, but the fact is that here in the US where heritage is celebrated and held up with pride, it becomes a large part of our self-identity.  My father's entire life he's been told he's 1/4 Native American (Seneca, to be exact) and that his grandmother was full blooded.  His parents taught him to take pride in that fact and his whole life he did.  He attended powwows, he read and learned about native culture, etc.  He even got a dream catcher and buffalo tattoo for his midlife crisis.  He's always been pretty into genealogy and has traced his father's side of our family back hundreds of years.  So, for Father's Day this year, I thought it would be fun to get him a 23andme ancestry DNA test.  We got the results back this morning and he's 0% Native American.  He's 40% Irish, 25% German, 10% Scandinavian and a quarter "broadly northern European".  He took one glance at the results, shook his head, went to his bedroom and shut the door.  A half hour later he came out yelling about how he should've gotten a shamrock tattoo instead.  I think it's going to take awhile for him to come to terms with it.  tl:dr-- My dad was told his whole life he was 1/4 Native American and made it a big part of his identity.  He's not NA at all and so my Father's Day present made him lose a huge part of his sense of self.
415	2	So this happened last week, and I’m still mulling it over, so I figured I would go ahead and post here.   Essentially, my office (very small, around 20 employees) has an admin assistant. Many people order lunch during the week, and she goes to pick it up. She’s paid hourly and also reimbursed for her mileage. I generally only jump on the lunch train with other people and order from the same place so that she doesn’t have to drive somewhere specifically for my food. The only exception to this is Starbucks. When there’s the BOGO after 3 deal, I will order something and then offer her the free drink for making the drive. I’ve done this 3 or so times now and have always given her the free drink. Last week, I was talking with another coworker who apparently had no idea this offer sometimes exists. She asked if I wanted to go halfsies for the next two deals so only one of us had to buy each time and both of us got a coffee. I agreed, but then immediately started to feel bad when said coworker excitedly went to go tell the admin about this great deal and ask her to go pick it up for us. Admin looked kinda disappointed. AITA?
238	3	I had been in the depths of addiction to weed and alcohol for a while, and decided to quit a few weeks ago. Things have been going well so far.  One of the things I enjoyed while stoned was eating Indian food, made as spicy as possible. The combination of the weed and the consumption method (dry vaping) meant that I could eat dishes that would have left me in agony before.  Then, a few days ago, I decided to give one of my favorite dishes a try again, one of the few that could cut through the weed and give me a rush. Placed the order with the usual challenge (make it so spicy you're worried about my safety) and chowed down. I figured that I would at least have built up some sort of tolerance.  Folks, it turns out taste buds heal. Between the lack of weed and the time since I had last had the spicy food, I was pacing and shaking after just a few bites. My dumb ass persisted, with snot streaming down my face and tears pouring from my eyes (if you have a cold, this is a great way to fix a stuffed nose; I would market it as the Sinus Blaster Five Thousand ©).  All in all, I only managed a third of it, and I couldn't feel my face for 20 minutes after.  TL;DR: tried to relive me glory days, got my skull obliterated by peppers.  EDIT: too many dishes in one sentence there. EDIT2: Turns out the alcohol probably had a lot to do with the spice tolerance, as a few pointed out. Don't crossfade, it's super bad for you and dangerous too!
893	3	So this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.  &amp;#x200B;  I started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It's a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.  &amp;#x200B;  Btw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.  &amp;#x200B;  Fast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She's thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That's significant.  &amp;#x200B;  Moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.  &amp;#x200B;  tl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it
553	3	Something a little more lighthearted, I was at Tesco today and came across about 50 egg timers. I set one to 1 minute just to see how loud they are, and holy shit those little fuckers let out a serious alarm clock blare.   Oh, and they’re the ones that you physically have to turn off for the alarm to stop sounding.  So, since my mum was down like four isles away trying to find sangria, I thought I might use my time wisely and started to set about 30+ of those egg timers to 30 minutes.  When I was done, I walked off, we got out the store and now I wonder how much havoc I caused.  I’m such an asshole sometimes.
205	2	My girlfriend is a very thin woman (5’4” 110lb) but she routinely fishes for compliments by calling herself fat, or even obese.  The first time she did this I was very concerned because she’s clearly not overweight, so I would reassure her that she’s very thin and that this is all just low self esteem issues. No matter how much reassurance I give she consistently refers to herself as fat. She doesn’t have an eating disorder either, if feels like she just does this to get attention and compliments (I’m more than happy to compliment her but she could just ask.)  I finally reached the tipping point when she referred to herself as “hugely fat” in front of my mother, who actually is overweight. My mom didn’t appear offended but it was clearly in poor taste. To lighten the mood, I turned to my girlfriend and said “okay Big Chungus” And everyone laughed (including our waiter )  Anyway, after that it seemed like playfully calling her “big chungus” or “megachonk “ or “on lawd she comin’” was the answer to this issue. When I reassure her, she persisted in calling herself fat, but when I call her “Miss Supreme Heftychonk Her Majesty Big Chungus” (just an example but many similar names to that) she realizes she’s not getting compliments and stops complaining for a while.   However one of her friends just emailed telling me that I’m emotionally tormenting my girlfriend and “ruining her self esteem.” Am I really? I reassured her for months before I lost my nerve and it doesn’t feel right to encourage fishing for compliments.
790	2	I’ve asked my friends, and they are genuinely divided, so I thought to ask Reddit. I (31F) am childfree, and I work with Chloe (40?F). We’ve become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. We are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.  Ideal friendship, right? Well, she has a 15 y/o son (Braden), who is really unclean. He stinks like rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. I know it’s not a neglect issue, because Chloe’s younger daughter (11F) has never stunk. Lately, I haven’t even wanted to go over to Chloe’s, and I don’t want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son.   Lady week was the last straw. We decided to go to the craft store together, and Braden wanted to come. I drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told her her son smells like ass and I basically can’t be around him until he works on his cleanliness. She sent me a text later (pasted here): “Hi yall-need-weed, the things you said about Braden were really uncalled for and I don’t want you to talk about my kids in a bad way. I am a good mom. Don’t talk to me until you apologize.”  AITA? Should I apologize?
13	2	Long story short, my boyfriends best friend since childhood doesnt like me. Hes repeatedly told my boyfriend he should end things with me despite the fact that I'm pregnant with his child. My boyfriend dismissed this and continued his friendship with this guy, I was a bit irritated but understood how important this friendship was to him so I kept my irritation to myself. That was up until a few weeks ago when this friend decided to IM me threatening to "choke me out" and "Curb stomp" me, along with a bunch of insults and such. Mind you, i am 5 months pregnant.  At this point i said enough is enough and told my boyfriend that its disrespectful to me and our child to continue to have any kind of relationship with this "Friend" He not only threatened me, but our unborn son.  He thinks im an asshole for asking him to end the friendship or have any kind of contact with him. Am I?
233	2	I have the basic netflix plan that allows for one screen. I let my parents use it free whenever I am not on it.   This worked fine for a while, however last night they decided that they wanted me to upgrade to 2 screens. I told them no, I didn't really want to, and that they could wait for me to finish the movie I was watching and use it after.   Then my dad texted me that he upgraded my account anyways. Saying that I'm being petty over $4 and that with how much they do for me this is such a small thing to ask. This royally pissed me off, and I signed every device out and changed my password. Now they won't be able to use it at all. They are both pissed off at me now, saying I'm ungrateful and texting me all night.  Part of me feels torn because it is only $4 more or so and I might be being petty, but I also feel like it's my account and I should be able to say no without being made to feel bad.  They do help me out with other things every now and then, but AITA for thinking that maybe those things shouldn't come with a condition?  Edit to add: I am not living with them and I am not financially reliant on them.
515	1	She was bullying me, she called me every name in the book and "accidentally" Crushed my foot during soccer in gym. In our school we have our phones in a bin and I saw hers (I knew it was hers because it had her name on it and she's the only one in our school with that name) and I grabbed it and I took it home with me. It didn't have a lock so I messed around and posted weird things on her social media and the next day I put it back, and on Friday she was freaking out. I don't feel bad
173	2	I'm a new grad student. Today one of my deskmates brought her emotional support dog into our studio workspace. I asked her about it and she told me it was an anxiety dog, which is a little ironic because dogs give me major anxiety, although I can work with it if it's a well-trained service dog and stays away from me.  This dog was not well trained. It whined loudly the entire time it was there, wouldn't sit still, and barked whenever anybody entered the room. It was distracting and the barking really freaked me out. I wound up needing to move to a table across the room, which helped a bit but isn't typically an option.  From my understanding, emotional support animals are not permitted in classrooms (I have an emotional support cat that I would never bring anywhere public), although from googling a bit I found that there are exceptions to this. I emailed my professor asking for clarification and he told me he would find out for me.  I would be really relieved to have this dog out of the workspace, but otoh I feel bad being so afraid of and distracted by this girl's anxiety support dog, which obviously she must feel she needs or she wouldn't bring it with her. Should I try harder to adjust to the animal? AITA for wanting it out of the class environment?
175	2	Yesterday online I saw a post titled “My First ever LinkedIn Video. Me giving out sandwiches to the poor.”   I thought this was incredibly vain so I commented “It was nice of you to do this but I’ve never been able to understand why people feel the need to video tape and post themselves doing something nice. Doesn’t this kind of defeat the entire purpose of doing a good deed? it becomes clear that your motivation isn’t exclusively that you want to help others?”  I received a good amount of hate for this comment so I’m wondering reddit - AM I THE ASSHOLE??
663	1	I can’t stand progress pics that have the “after” picture on the left and the “before” picture on the right. I don’t know why, but it irks my soul! We read left to right, why would you NOT put the “before” picture on the left!? It’s especially irksome when there isn’t much change and the pictures aren’t labeled! Then i get all OCD and spend way too much time comparing the pictures and trying to figure out which is the “before” pic and which is the “after”. I’m all about supporting progress &amp; I’ll cheer you whether it’s 4 or 400 lbs but for the love of sanity, people, put the “before” pic on the left! Or at least label the pics if it’s not clear!
404	2	So there I was, a 2nd grader that loved Yugi and all his normals, I had his basic deck and some of the booster cards. For almost a year, I was so happy with it, but I bumoed into an abandoned Curse of Dragon (2000 ATK, 1500 DEF, 5* DARK/Dragon normal monster) which Yugi had in anime and after 40~ish minutes of it sitting with no kid to pick it up, I took it.  So a day passes, two do and I am so nervous as if I destroyed some kid's life, but I can't go to that classroom because it's the summer holiday from Friday (I took it Thursday) and ever since, I remember that day,  the gut feeling of wrongitude for my lustful steal and it kept me up at night until 7th grade.  I am so sorry for what I've done. I have never since thought of taking abandoned stuff for the feeling somebody thinks it through and decides they want it back.  It's still in my cards. I miss old Yugioh days and how my tiny self and his moral compass decided I had to suffer for days for what I might have done wrongly. It seems cute to me nowadays.
593	1	We were at a party and my boyfriend talked to my friend for most of it. He's a bit shy and only went to the party for my sake, which is why I was so shocked when he kept talking to my friend.  He and her were laughing and talking the whole night. He tried to involve me a few times but I was getting upset so I didn't. We all played a few games together and he tapped her arm a few times to point out things (they were on the same couch together). I was crying by the end of it.  I told him about it and almost broke up with him over it. He acted like he didn't know what happened. I told him and he said "what? In no way were we flirting we were just talking". They both claim there wasn't flirting but they talked and laughed for like 3 hours together right in front of me.  My boyfriend still to this day claims I overreacted to nothing, I still feel I was pretty justified in being pissed.
608	2	Okay so basically title says all, when I’m bored I post something like a Craigslist ad selling my computer (my computer is pretty high end spec wise) and I set the price low and act like I don’t know anything about computers. The thing is I only mess with people who try to take advantage of me. I’ll make a fact situation like “son moved out selling his computer”. Once and a while I’ll get a reply like “hey the price is too low” or “hey you shouldn’t sell something that isn’t your property” these people I’ll respond nicely and sort of end that ad but most of the time you get people saying “this isn’t worth as much I’ll just buy the 2070 for 100$”. Sometimes I feel bad to messing with people and other times I really enjoy it.
630	1	Pretty much exactly what the title says.   My neighbours on one side are pretty grumpy and no one else on the street seems to like them. They're a couple who must be in their 60s now and they like to complain when we make the slightest increase in noise. They also like to play their radio as loud as they want to WHILST complaining about the noise level in our house. The wife has been racist to us in the past and they clearly don't complain about the louder, richer, white neighbours on the other side.  I'm not a particularly confrontational person and there's no point arguing with people who are so set in their ways. So one day I found a snail in my garden and just threw it over the fence. The way I see it: it's more humane to the animals, subtly ruins their day and has considerably less clean up than killing the slugs.  There's a tree next to the fence that blocks their view from the house into our garden so I throw just above the fence line there and as far as I can tell they've never noticed.
869	1	I'm going to try to keep this short and simple. I always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they want to get out of, just call me and I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before, I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We're only human and it's a part of life.  Last weekend I got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. She was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.  I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was happy she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.  I haven't told my wife about it, because I don't want to violate the deal I made with her. I want her to know that she can trust me. I just hope I'm making the right choice.
721	1	My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it’s her dream to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we’ve been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since.   At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I’m an expat and she’s a local), etc etc   Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I’ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we’ve been together, she’s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items.   The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she’d need to save to get started.   After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it’s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things   She’s called me TA, that I’m trying to control her money, I’m trying to humiliate her, make her feel “small” and it’s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing   IMO she could have made her dream come true long ago, and I was only trying to lay it out for her  AITA?
316	3	[Light] I was in a hotel in Vietnam, and the water wasn't working. I could feel a explosive diarrhoea coming, and I didn't want to poop into the toilet and just leave it there, since I was sharing a room.   So I placed some toilet paper into the bag, squatted and pooped into it. Then it dawned on me, I had a bag of shit and I couldn't just put it in the bin, so I threw it out the window onto a roof. It made a loud thud and now one day, someone is going to go on that roof, open that bag, and the stench of my decomposed poop in the Vietnam sun is going to blast them in the face.
45	3	I was basically a piece of shit younger. And this just hit me today like a mf train. I feel so bad.  What happened is that I was with my neighbor home, both 7, and we used to kiss each other whenever we were in private.   One time, she told me she loved somebody in her class. What I did was tie her to a chair, and told her that she couldn't get out after she said she loved me. This lasted for like 25 minutes at most, and after that I released her.  TL;DR : Neighbor I use to be a fwb of you can call it that at 7 said she loved somebody else, kidnapped her for nearly half an hour until she said she loved me
481	3	This did really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. This is a throwaway because I'm very embarrassed. Sorry about formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.  My favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.  This morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.  TL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.
31	1	Two nice shades of lip stick (I understand my friend's sephora addiction now), high heel boots, 10 chokers, clip on ear rings and nose rings, breast forms and a nice bra, two wigs (long red hair and shoulder length pink hair), 4 pack of thigh high stockings, pink "massage" wand, pink yoga pants, Japanese school girl one piece swimsuit, Japanese school girl uniform (blouse, skirt, socks, garter), and 3 butt plus (with lube). I'm so excited, everything arrives tomorrow.  I called off work today and I'm going to call off tomorrow. Life is a grand adventure. No throwaway, eff it.  Edit: Well, I'm still alive. Hell of a hangover though. Still excited for tomorrow.
751	2	I let a friend use my Netflix account a couple years ago, I am no longer friends with this, person yet they use my Netflix constantly. My family members also use my Netflix so sometimes it makes it a little difficult having someone else use it, Netflix is expensive and sometimes I can't use it because of the old friend using it. I'm not really in a position to speak to this person so honestly would I be an asshole if I just change it? Update - Password changed and all devices logged out! I feel relieved in all honesty.
502	1	I just click pair to whatever comes up, then when/if it asks for code I type in “0000” and it always works. I put volume full level and get a laugh out of their shocking reaction.
380	2	So essentially, when I met my current boyfriend he went to the store before watching some tv to get snacks. He was trying to be sweet and brought me back cheetos puffs because he said he remembered that I said that I liked them......I didn’t (and don’t) but it was a sweet sentiment, especially in a new relationship and I acted maybe a bit too excited about it. He, of course, got the wrong idea that I’m in freaking love with these cheesy delights and sometimes will still buy them for me as a nice gesture (I don’t mind, they aren’t horrible, I just don’t go out of my way to buy or eat them because quite frankly they stick to the roof of my mouth and go full ‘peanut butter crackers without a drink’ mode). Flash forward 3 years and he bought me a HUGE, nearly year’s supply, of dang cheetos puffs while going through a hard time to cheer me up.........what do I even do with all these puffs?
906	3	Essentially the title. This happened a few minutes ago but for most of my life up until now I've been saying "Que" to refer to "Queue". I vaguely remember picking the usage up from World of Warcraft but honestly cannot say if that's the case. This morning I sent out a work email asking everyone to check their "que" for a specific task. The manager emailed me separately telling me que was inherently wrong and not short for queue. I can only imagine they have been holding onto that comment for a while. I've been at this company for 2 1/2 years and have been pretty oblivious about the difference and they didn't say anything until today.  After mentioning that part, they explained they knew what I meant but have noticed other people started using the word that way too. I work in publishing and as they said, “I knew what you meant but spelling is kinda a big deal”.   TL;DR: I've been incorrectly using this word for my entire adult/work life, and possibly may have been slowly passing it on to other people? Whoops!
861	3	This happened years and years ago when I was about 15.  It was around Halloween and we still had a bunch of fake blood and didn't know what to do with it.  My younger brother wanted to prank his friend. So we came up with a plan where while his friend would be sitting in the kitchen I'd come in and tell my brother I wanted to show him something in the basement and take him downstairs.  I then ran a bunch of my dad's power tools while my brother screamed bloody murder and saying "please don't kill me" but then went silent after running the saw for a few minutes. I then came up the stairs with my white undershirt covered in fake blood laughing.  The plan was for my brother to then come up the stairs and pretend like he was a half dead zombie, but his friend took one look at me covered in blood and ran from the house screaming before my brother could come upstairs.  Within about 5 minutes, police cars just kept coming from all directions and they came running out with guns drawn.  The cops got confused and were looking for a dead kid, and put both me AND my brother in handcuffs not understanding he was the "victim" and wouldn't listen to our explanations and just kept screaming at us with guns drawn.  Eventually the whole thing was sorted out with no charges filed against anyone but we were never allowed in our dad's workshop again for like 5 years.  TL;DR played with fake blood, got handcuffed at gunpoint
534	3	So I teach at a Catholic school.  I teach physics and am in charge of robotics club. At robotics club we were talking about the use of robots in disasters and I decided to pull up a design on the projector and see if they could guess what function the robot served in disaster relief.  So I pull up the design and tell them a little about how it functions and let them start figuring it out when I hear a bunch of kids start giggling.  I look up to see what's funny and notice a text from Lesbian Regina (my gf's name in my contacts, in her phone I'm Cady Heron) saying she found the dildo.  Unfortunately I didn't have my messages hidden until you tap them.  So my entire class saw a text from my gf about finding our dildo. At a Catholic school. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before a parent complains.  TL;DR: Projected my iPad to the class, got a message about a dildo from my gf. Class saw the text.
168	2	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I got married last Saturday. Hooray for me! My sister was my maid of honor. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how “in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway...” (so cliche!). I thought her speech was really selfish. I think it’s super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how “strong” she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! Sorry if I sound selfish, but IMO there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. AITA?
798	1	So I posted about a month ago about my sister requesting I wear a long sleeve ankle length black dress to her lakeside wedding in summer, while being 9 months pregnant and I’ve gotten many requests to update    Well, I ended up having my baby like 3 days after making the post so I was in the hospital when the wedding happened, so I didn’t go. My sister was there when I pushed her out and apologized for being a bridezilla so all is well and I have a cute baby.  Sorry that this was an anticlimactic update but I give the people what they want.
111	1	I’m a secretary for a doctor. Most days I love it, some days I reeeeally fuckin’ hate it. The doctor specializes in geriatrics, and let me tell you, you may think she’s nice, *but your grandma is a bitch.*   Joking aside, I’ve worked at the office about 2 years now, and there is a wife and husband who come in who I despise. The wife is a dick to me, the husband is a dick to both me and his wife. They’ve hung up on me when they don’t like what I tell them the doctor says. They curse. They yell. They’re assholes. I’ve hated them for 2 years, especially the husband.   Well, he’s been in the hospital. We get the reports. I’ve wished to myself every day since last Monday, “I hope he dies.” Not meaning it, but hoping. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday - I hope he dies.   Today the office gets a phone call and I pick up. It’s the man’s daughter. She says, “Hello. I’m not sure Dr. SoSo is aware, but I need to cancel my father’s appointment for March. He died Saturday.”   I did a fist pump as I said “I’m so sorry. I’ll let him know,” hung up, &amp; yell-whispered HELL YEAH.   Anyway. Don’t be a fucking dick to people.
521	3	I was homeless for about a year and only had my car. I'd deliver food for multiple companies and it was barely enough to pay my bills I still had. Food was a once a day luxury most of the time, but every once in a while if someone took too long to buzz me into their apartment complex or didn't come to the door I'd keep it and mark delivered. This was pre-covid so orders had to be handed directly to the customer. One time a customer put the wrong zip code and instead of driving to the next town I kept it, they got multiple pizzas and sandwiches and it was enough food to last me almost 3 days. I knew someone had to pay for it eventually but my hunger and frustration with my living conditions got the best of me. It's the only time I ever stole something. I still deliver food but it always makes it to the customer now
680	1	I'm M23 my gf is F21 and we've been together for about 2 years now. Now I come from a very middle class family, dads a blue collar worker and mom has been working since I was a kid as well. My GF's family is filthy rich and even she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. Because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. Her friends also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the exact same way. Spoiled rich white girls who go to Western (my ontario mans will get this one). I told them to kick rocks.   &amp;#x200B;  AITA?
450	2	Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lez6yb/wibtah_if_i_fire_a_kid_because_his_mother_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  I know it didn't get that much traction, but here we go.  I took the advice and consulted with HR on this as well.  So... Sad update. He got fired.  We took the time and HR spoke to him about his conduct and performance, he admitted to slacking and promised to keep his mom under control (She quickly deleted all the messaged on facebook she sent to me to remove a trace thereof but the emails remain). He promised to keep everything up to standard and work as hard as possible. The focus was on his quality of work, his mother was mentioned but just as an afterthought of appropriate work conduct.  He then proceeded to amaze us for a total of 5 days before going back into his old habits again and being completely useless and even aggressive towards other team members making slight mistakes. He even charged x4 the amount of time for a quarter of the quality of work the other team members produce.   So his two week probation ended after 9 days.   I hope his mom never does this again, but all in all, his work ethic is what got him fired in the end.
89	3	So I work at a small business with about 5 employees. Usually everyone sticks to the schedule on the calendar. I was supposed to come in and open for the the day. I remembered not seeing anyone on the schedule. I got in about 15 min early. Unlocked the doors, turned the lights, etc. All of a sudden the Chinese food I ate last night kicks in. I run to the bathroom. I'm in there for about 5 min grabbing my stomach in pain. Eventually I pop in my ear buds and start listening to my Spotify to help me focus less on what's going on. I remember farting so hard I could feel reverb in the toilet. I'm one of those people who listens to their music on full volume.. So after about 30 min, which was still half an hour before anyone else was scheduled to come in, I walk out of the bathroom which is also in the longue where we have lunch and meetings. The owner was there having a meeting that had been scheduled by everyone after I had last checked the calendar the night before. Their faces were in disbelief. One person said "I suggest you change your diet" before they all broke out in laughter. It was not a great day.  Tldr: I was shitting really loud with my earphones in while an unscheduled company meeting was taking place right next to me.
384	1	Unless I'm at a hotel, I cannot fall asleep without listening to the soothing sound of Gordon Ramsey yelling. It's so bizarre I must have seen every episode available on YouTube at least 50 times. I often find myself quoting them as they are going along if I can't fall asleep. favorites include Amy's baking company, Oceanas, and Luigis.
756	1	My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.  For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.  So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?
691	3	This is my first year at school and I thought that I could do it but I just kept ignoring all my schedules and have stayed home in my apartment almost every day and only go out at night. Mostly it is because I am extremely mentally ill now, I think more of psychosis than depression. But I can’t tell my parents why I am like that because I would have to do an insane amount of explaining.    I am wasting my money and everyone else’s time but I can’t seem to get it together. I had insanely good grades in highschool too and I feel like this would be far to unexpected for my parents to believe without any further explanations.   I’m thinking about dropping out but I’d have to find another place to live because they only let students live in my place so I would have to sublet to another student. I have like one “boyfriend” from high school I could stay with at his other house he has near my school but I don’t know if this would make my life better or worse.   I feel like an absolute let down and like I just wasted one of the biggest priveleges and opportunities in life.
795	1	My wife and her parents have planned a trip for two days. We'll be going somewhere where there's lots and lots of fossils and museum's and things to essentially to take pictures of in my opinion. They joked about making it like a trip from her childhood days before smartphones were a thing. Then they got serious. They have decided that we will have no phones, no clocks, no technology of any kind. I decided that I won't follow that for a multitude of reasons. Namely that I want to have pictures of this place I've never been to before. Second major reason is that I'm an anxious person. And at night I sleep with my headphones in with background noise playing to keep myself from overthinking and getting anxious over nothing. I've done this for years. After declaring that I won't comply I've been given the ultimatum: I give up my phone and come or I don't go at all. They've also decided that if I choose not to go that it'll make me an asshole and her boomer parents will think I'm horrible and that I'm too reliant on tech. I also want to clarify more that Im not glued to my phone all the time. They disagree. Am I the asshole in this situation? What do I do? My wife told me "that's nice being a book" in regards to how I sleep. And every time I bring it up because I want to go, they all get mad at me.
720	2	January 3rd of this year my fiancé whom I’d been with for just over 5 years was killed by a drunk driver . I still haven’t been able to change anything in OUR room . Her side still has all her things just how she left them (she was very tidy ) . Every morning I still watch a “good morning “ video she sent me which makes me smile and sad at the same time . Yesterday I had flowers delivered to the house and hid them overnight as I always do and this morning before I left for work I put the flowers , her favorite chocolate and a card with a heart felt note inside on the nightstand on her side like I always do on Valentines (and randomly throughout the year ) so she’d wake up to them . I know I have to stop some time , just not ready yet 😔
562	1	Tldr: had a baby went to the bar the next day while child and mother were still at hospital.   So this was about 8 years ago but recently was told it was a shitty thing. So my daughter was born 2/10/10 and I have like 3 close lifelong friends with birthdays 2/11. One of which was my best friend (use to catch the bus to kindergarten together, we'll be 30 this year) turned 21 a milestone birthday. So these 3 friends organized a group party at a bar. So I went to the bar probably less then 24hours after the birth of my first child. Recently a different life long friend got a new girlfriend and she said I was an asshole. Couple points id like to provide: 1. bar was conviently located 1 mile from hospital 2.was there for an hour or two had maybe one or, two drinks, did not get drunk 3. Asked child's mother if I could go she said I could 4. I like beer So what do you think, asshole?
376	1	During class in elementary school, a friend of mine said he had something to show me and so after school ended, we met up in the bathroom and he pulled out what looked like a golden or brass apple from his backpack. The top unscrewed and inside it was this white powder. He took a pinch and sniffed it and told me that his parents and their friends sniffed it and it made them happy. So I said okay and took a small pinch and sniffed the powder. It was bitter and burned a little but it gave me a jolt of energy. Afterwards, we went bike riding and I felt all this crazy energy. We rode and rode around for what seemed like forever at seriously top speed! But then later, we got to a hill that we couldn’t ride up because it was too steep. We walked our bikes. The sun beat down on us and I suddenly felt tired. Then I felt this pain in my head. It was the first time, I tried cocaine and also the first time, I ever got a headache. I told my friend about the pain and he showed me a pressure point on my hand and to this day, every time I get a headache, I use that pressure point on my hand. Sometimes, I remember that day in 4th grade when I did cocaine but most times, I don’t.
178	2	I was with my ex for seven years. At the time she had a 2-year old, and when we split, her daughter was 9 years old. She called me dad pretty quickly, plus we all lived together. I thought we'd become a family proper through marriage eventually but obviously things didn't pan out and we split. It was amicable and we're still friends.  Her daughter is 14 now and still calls me dad. My ex hasn't started dating again but I'm engaged to my soon-to-be-wife. We all get along but my fiancee doesn't like that kiddo calls me dad. I'm not her dad, biologically or otherwise, but I was a father figure for seven years (and even beyond this, I still kept involved in her life).  My fiancee wants me to put the kibosh on this because it makes her uncomfortable. We want to start a family of our own soon and my fiancee wants my undivided attention on our child. I can see her point although I'm indifferent to the whole dad situation: if she calls me dad, whatever, but I must relent to my fiancee's wishes because I'm not staunchly opposed to her thoughts or anything.  I'm going to have a sitdown with my ex and her daughter and split ties to focus on my own family. But would I be the arsehole?
681	3	This happened a while back but it still comes up in my weird anxious mind from time to time. It was my first week of uni and I was talking to some people on a bus trying to make friends. We were having a really good conversation, lots of laughter, when I asked their names. One had the same name as my brother, and I said something along the lines of "Oh that's easy to remember, it's my brother's name" and their response was, under their breath, "well, that's obnoxious.". It made the rest of the bus ride really awkward, and every time I've seen him since he's blanked me.
425	3	So a few months back, I got two screws put in my jaw, and I've had to go back for what feels like a million check ups since. Today's appointment was a "15 minute appointment" just to "take some measurements." I walk in thinking it would be another routine appointment to measure my bite or something simple like that. Wrong.   I walk up to the chair and see the novacane shot. I know I've been bamboozled. I start panicking. I ask "whoa whoa whoa doc, what's that for? Nobody said anything about needles." I am informed that they're cutting open my gums to get a measurement of the actual screws. I've had no chance to mentally prepare to get a needle stuck in my mouth. It's a huge phobia if you haven't gathered that by now.   So I ask to get it done without the novacane. I've cut my gum on a sharp corn chip before and survived. Plus I've got a really high pain tolerance, so no big deal right? Wrong again. They start out and I'm fine for the first bit, then like half-way through I realized mistakes were made.   I make it a few more minutes, tears are streaming down my face and I hate myself. I have to pathetically justify the crying by saying its just a physiological reaction and assure them I'm fine.   I tapped out about 80% of the way through. And ended up having to get the goddamn shot anyway.   TL/DR: TIFU and thought I was a such a big tough badass that I could get my gums cut open at the dentist without novacane to avoid the horrors of getting a shot in the mouth. Wussed out 80% of the way through and had to get the shot anyway.
414	1	OK so I stalked a girl for like a year and then became friends with her boyfriend. I then went on his computer and planted a load of stalkerish things about her onto his computer. Stuff like photographs of her walking around town and a detailed diary of where she was and at what time. I made it look creepy and like he was a murderer on purpose to scare her.  I then revealed that there was a ton of creepy stuff on her boyfriends computer and she then found it and freaked out. I then helped her get a restraining order against her old boyfriend and the rest is history.  We're now married and have a child. World is strange like that.
817	2	My husband has a sore back. This means that I am doing the majority of the housecleaning as well as child care. It also means that I really can't leave the house. I have given up all exercise classes as well as going out with friends, as he can't lift our child. This has been the case for a couple of months now. The question is he will be going out for several hours tomorrow night, meaning I will need to take care of bedtime. Tonight he decided to go to a movie with friends, as he will just have to sit down, so it won't hurt his back. From his point of view he left later in the night and I wouldn't need him anyway. From my point of view I am just so exhausted from doing everything with literally no break (we have limited family support for babysitting) and about 20 minutes a day to myself. It just makes me so bitter that he is going out frequently when that is not an option for me because of his back. He thinks it is ridiculous that I would want him to stay home just because I can't go out and I honestly don't know. My friends aren't rational so I can't get an unbiased opinion. Thanks!
762	1	Throwaway because she uses this sub.  My (20M) roommate (20F) thinks I have a drinking problem. UK, legal age and all that. I work nights, in quite a demanding and stressful job, and sometimes (realistically maybe once a month? Every six weeks maybe?) when I get home in the morning I'll have a couple of drinks to relax and unwind. I honestly do not drink very often because I don't really like the feeling of being drunk, but a slight buzz is fine.  Now, without fail, for the last year every time I have been having one of these mornings my roommate has walked in. At first she didn't say anything, but the last three times she has. The first couple times she said "are you sure you should be drinking at this time?" and stuff about it being so early. I brushed it off, this is my evening. This morning I said something back because she accused me of having a drinking problem because I was drinking at 8am, I told her that I have been awake and working all night and her 8am is my 8pm so it's perfectly acceptable and I was tired of feeling judged for something so innocuous that I do once a month. I didn't raise my voice or insult her, I was firm. This is my home too and this is reasonable. She called me an asshole and shut herself in her room. I feel that I haven't done anything wrong, AITA?
249	3	So long story short I’ve had my retainer for two years now and completely forgot what it first looked like when I got it. This was until today when I dropped it and a piece of my retainer came off. I knew my retainer was dirty but I just though it was a thin layer of plaque but when that piece came off I realized that it was almost a 16th of an inch thick of plaque and that the blue I was seeing was how it used to be.  I was absolutely horrified at that point and proceeded to sandpaper my retainer for the next half an hour. Little by little I started to see it shed layers and get thinner. It’s still not perfect now but it fits a lot better and it actually looks blue. I now feel  stupid for listening at my orthodontist who said to just rinse it under cold water when dirty.  TL;DR there was almost 1/16inch of plaque on my retainer and I didn’t even know it.
492	3	I booked a hotel in what I thought was Venice for 10 days with the whole idea of seeing the canals and exploring the city. Climbed in my car with my girlfriend.... Put the address of the hotel into my GPS, and drove 12 hours to get to our romantic holiday....  Checked into our accommodation and asked  my girlfriend how we get to the 'canals' from here... Perplexed she looked at me and asked.... 'Do you mean The river?' I said no and explained what I meant... She snickered and burst out laughing... then explained to me that I need to go outside, take the first right and drive about 10 hours because I'm about 1000kms away from those romantic canals. Turns out I confused Vienna with Venice....🙈  We all laughed.. I felt like a complete idiot 😩 Reddit... Judge away...   TL:DR Booked hotel in Vienna and thought it was Venice. Drove 1045km just to find out my geography is worse than my math.  EDIT: Thanks for all the tips and advice. We will be exploring Bratislava as suggested and see some of the sights suggested. Gonna make the most of the trip. First stop,  the walking tour tomorrow! 😊  LESSON OF THE DAY  : Double check hotel bookings, or make sure your girlfriend does the booking next time!
36	1	I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.  Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty.   Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back.   So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?
874	1	I (26M) and roommates with (30M). Let's call him Mark. Mark told me that he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was to laugh. He asked why I laughed so I just explained.  I said that I can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women looking to further their career. But the dudes who go as fans that aren't in the industry are just weirdos and losers. I've seen videos/pics and they look just as you'd expect them to.  I think it's a bizzare and sad thing to actually be fans of pornstars to the extent to visit them at conventions..  ----  Well Mark called me asshole but tbh I don't see how I'm wrong. I asked other people and they agreed that people who go to these cons are weird and creepy. AITA?
604	3	About a year ago I joined a group of men that advocate for white nationalism and other far right nonsense. Too be honest I didn't care or like any of these people in the slightest. The only reason  joined them was because some of  my friends were going to that "Side" of the political spectrum and they were getting angry about stupid political shit like I was. I did a lot of crazy stuff like vandalism and basically getting drunk with other skin heads and Aryan brotherhood drug dealers. I slide down this kind of spectrum, I acted like a fool and made myself look stupid. Eventually after a few crazy events happened I stopped talking to my white nationalist friend and started doing my own thing for a while through mostly work. I got this crazy idea to actually go to a Synagogue, a Mosque , and a church just out of fun. When I went to these places almost all of those people treated me very well, including an elderly Jewish couple. They treated me like a part of their own family and introduced me to their kids. The Muslims treated me the same way and even gave me some free classes about the Quran. But I think the worst part of all was when I went to a catholic church and I saw every race on the face of the planet in this small town I used to live in. And I felt so bad about this whole thing. Because I had judged a lot of these people before they even knew me. But In all honesty I'm sorry I did some bad things to these people and I don't want any harm to them. I guess I'm glad that God helped me realize what I did was wrong and I don't want anyone to do the same things I did. But again I'm sorry for what I did I hope some of you can forgive me.
403	3	This happened about 2 hours ago, and I can't describe how upset I am.   My morning was going great. Got to work, helping customers (Starbucks), awesome. Go to break, and I take out my phone to text my wife and see how she is. I nlook down at my phone, and my heart sinks. It's a classic 'death blue screen, and has one word on it; erasing... As I frantically try to press and hold any button combination, I realize my attempt is futile. My phone contents are gone.  Ordinarily, who cares, right? Apps can be downloaded, messages retrieved, whatever. Unfortunately I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. Those of you who don't know, it has no memory card. Samsung's real fuck up. So what's my loss? Three years worth of pictures of my two children and wife, going back to before my son was born.  "But u/Ryuujin09 surely you uploaded your pictures to the cloud?" Nope. I'm stupid. No cloud, no computer save, just gone.  It seems my thigh wanted to break into my phone and do some rummaging, so much so that my password was inputted incorrectly enough times to not oknly lock out my phone, but to then restore factory settings.  Tl:dr, phone in pocket, thigh tried to break in. Phone protected me by deleting everything including three years worth of pictures.
518	1	I finally talked about my mental health. I pulled my doctor aside to tell him about my terrible home life, how it rips me everyday to see my Mom harass and put down my sister and threaten my dad.  How I’m angry about how she can spend our money and act like everything is fine when it’s not.  Talked about how she called me a complete failure based off a school grade i made 5 years ago that hurt me so much.  How I couldn’t sleep at night when she was telling at my father or sister about whatever the new problem this week was.  I’m getting counseling and family counseling. I really hope things get better. I’m relieved I finally got 15 years of pure stress and sadness out to someone who could help.
867	2	I’m a wife of 13 years and mother of two. I was getting so angry with everyone that I decided to start eating edibles almost daily to cope. My anger was really getting out of control and I was yelling a lot.   The edibles have made me so much more chill and able to deal with my frustration but I feel guilty. Shouldn’t I be happy without them? Sure I’m not as angry but now I feel like I’m such a bad role model. My husband doesn’t even know. Nobody does.
512	3	Obligatory, this didn't happen today admission. This happened over the summer about 5 years ago.   So, me and a group of my family members went on a vacation to Key West, Florida. Hot as balls but other than that it was a great trip overall.   One of the days we were there we walked down Duval Street where the majority of the stores are located. One of these shops has a young woman handing out free samples of what appears to be candy.  Now, maybe I was just hungry at the time but these things looked delicious. Like an oversized starburst wrapped in wax paper.   She offers the group of four of us these as we walk by and I very promptly take one. I was also the only one out of our whole group to take one, so that should've been my first red flag. Well, as I'm unwrapping this delectable treat she tells me "It's lemon". That's great! I love the taste of lemon.   So I chomp down on it and get about two bites in and she says "It's… soap". A lot of peopIe probably would've been able to realize this, but it's Key West. I was killing a lot of brain cells that week. I snapped out of my sweet tooth facade and immediately spit it into my hand, embarrassingly proclaiming "Yeah, I'm just gonna walk away now." Okay, I can see why someone might want a free sample of soap but DUDE, you gotta have a disclaimer before I try to snack on it. I had to go get something real to eat just to get the taste out of my mouth. So needless to say I'm a bit more weary about free samples now. Also I'm pretty sure this makes me an honorary mod of /r/forbiddensnacks  TL;DR I was offered a free sample which I thought was candy but turned out to be soap
904	2	I was at baggage claim at the airport with my son, who’s 3. We were leaving and as we’re walking away, this girl yells “excuse me!” At me. I turn and she points to her Starbucks drink which is spilled on the floor and says “your kid did that.”  I ask my son if he spilled it and he said he bumped it. The girl says “it was $5” and looks at me expectantly. I was pissed about how rude she was and the way she was just looking at me and expecting me to pay for her mocha frappa-whatever without even asking, so I just shrugged and walked away. My partner called me an asshole when I told her the story. AITA?
602	3	I work as a dishwasher at a small diner-type place. It's not the greatest job, but I stick around because everyone's friendly and I get free food.   The cooks there like to be creative with the specials. On this particular day the special was Oreo pancakes, which were just pancakes with crushed up Oreos cooked in. Then, they spread on what looked to be Oreo cream over the top. I'm still not sure if it was the real deal or some homemade concoction, but either way, I wanted some.   While I was washing dishes in the back kitchen, one of the chefs dropped off a bucket of kitchenware that needed to be washed. One of the items was an emptied container, caked to the sides was a thick white substance. With food on the mind, I immediately thought, "Oh sweet! It's that Oreo cream!"  Without hesitation I took a big finger full and put it in my mouth. This was immediately followed by a full face cringe. As it mulled around in my mouth, I realized it was pure, uncooked, bacon fat. I spat out what I could and spent a good five minutes trying to wash the taste out of my mouth. Hours later I can still taste the bacon fat, and I still have not acquired that Oreo cream.  TL;DR: I had Oreo cream on the mind, and the second I saw a container filled with a white substance, I took a big finger full and ate it. It was bacon fat, and it was disgusting.
291	2	My boyfriend took some edibles yesterday because he's finally on Thanksgiving break and wanted to relax. We also had a day out yesterday at a mall. He took too much and collapsed. We went to the hospital and he had some terrible hallucinations that made him think he was dying for around an hour and I comforted him and helped him through his panic attacks while the nurse was performing an EKG  on him, taking blood, etc. I say "near death" because it was all in his mind. The doc said he was fine and all of his tests came back normal. He just had a really terrible trip.  We get home an hour later and he seems fine. I made him a couple meals that he scarfs down and we cuddled until he passed out. While cuddling, I promised him that I wouldn't do any more drugs (not that I take any besides caffeine) since he wanted to swear off them and was very adamant about it. But now he also wants to toss out all of our alcohol and only wants me to drink when out of the apartment.  We don't drink often or much at all, maybe one or two drinks in two weeks. I keep some bottles of rum and Kahlua/Bailey's to bakenwith around the apartment and we have a couple of beers and a bottle of cider in the fridge for when friends come over. I think it's unreasonable and a waste of money to dump it all when I'll want to have a glass of something or bake with it in the next week. I usually can't even finish a beer, so this much alcohol will last us a while. When we go out, I buy tasting sizes because they're more my speed.  What do you all think?
311	3	 My sister is pregnant, 28 weeks. She had a massive falling out with her husband and wanted me to pick her up. I picked her up and brought her to my home. It took a few days but she opened up to me. The gist is that they had decided to give their daughter our mom's surname and pick out a first name from his culture. She also had gotten in touch with our father and was working on mending their relationship. He convinced her that he should name the baby after his dead sister. She agreed and when her husband found out that she wanted to name the child after her dad's sister. He freaked out and had said he would divorce her.  I don't know a kind way to phrase this but our father is a garbage human. He never had a good thing to say and he was and is racist. Her husband is brown. Her child is going to be mixed. How the fuck can she name her child because of our racist dad. This asshole told us to date white boys when we left for college! That was his great piece of advice.   I asked her if she was losing her grip on reality and she was being an idiot and of course her husband would want to leave a man who didn't attend their wedding and once got drunk during thanksgiving and called him slurs. I don't understand what she is thinking.   I made it clear that I thought her decision was dumb. She was crying. She wants to go back. She isn't talking to me and I know I hurt her by yelling at her. My boyfriend also thinks that I should have been calmer about it but I couldn't keep my cool
195	2	I got married when I was very young and had a child. We divorced amicably 7 years later. During this time I built my career and in fact my brand is based off my name. I became quite successful.   I’m now 35 and got remarried. During our dating and engagement I made it clear I would never change my name from my first husbands. First I want my son and me to have the same name. Second, my career was built off my name. Third, changing names is a pain in the ass.  Finally I identify with my name now. Not my new husbands, not my maiden name, and I don’t think twice it was my ex husbands name. I simply like the name. hyphenating it isn’t even an option for me.   My husband, though knowing my stance for years has suddenly taken issue with this. I offered for him to change his name to mine. I have reiterated my reasons above. I simply have no interest in ever changing my name to his. When the topic comes up casually he becomes angry about it. I’ve explained that it’s archaic and something I’m not interested in.   AITAH
687	2	I (m35) have a 16 year old daughter. I’ve been a single father since she was about 3 years old as I got sole legal custody due to some addiction issues her mother has. We have a really good relationship, but I always worry about her not having a woman to talk to.   Over the past few months she hasn’t really seemed to be herself, I know she went through a bad break up but I’ve been worried it’s more than that. I’ve tried talking to her, and my sister only lives down the street so she’s tried talking to her also, but my daughter is really keeping to herself and it concerns me.   She went out to see her friends for the first time since quarantine started yesterday and asked me if I could give her room a quick tidy whilst she was gone. I agreed because she does a lot of chores but she’s not good at cleaning her room. Whilst I was putting clothes back in her closet, I stumbled upon what I now know to be her diary.   I shouldn’t have read past the first page but I just wanted to know if there was anything going on she wasn’t telling me about. There were some pretty heartbreaking stuff for a father to read about how down she felt about herself, so when she got home I brought it up to her.   She asked me why this was suddenly coming up and when I told her I’d read her diary she absolutely flipped and told me it was an absolute violation of privacy and she’s completely humiliated. I told her I was just trying to protect her and she said it was none of my business and locked herself in her bedroom and hasn’t spoken to me since. AITA?
850	3	So this actually happened a few months ago but thought it was worth sharing. Anyhow.  I was out with some friends at the local club just drinking and dancing, enjoying ourselves. Suddenly I see this really drunk girl on the crowded dance floor that had fallen and was struggling to get up, I thought. Everyone was just dancing around her and ignoring her, so I went to help her up. I came from behind and grabbed her waist and tried to lift her up but she was very heavy so I didn’t succeed at the first try. So I tried again, this time even harder. This time I succeeded and lifted her off the ground, to see to my horrible revelation that she had in fact not fallen. She was a dwarf. I was holding a dwarf mid air. I dropped her in panic and ran away as fast as I could and left the club.  TLDR; tried helping a girl up that had fallen on the dance floor only to realise I was lifting a dwarf.
520	1	So I have been casually dating a girl for about 6 months. She comes over and we hang, drink some beers, whatever, go to bed. One time I wake up and my leg is all wet. I get up, and realize she pissed the bed. I didn't say anything mean, just woke her up, got her clean clothes to wear and put her in the other bed while I did the cleaning. Never said a word about it again.. Mistakes happens...  Fast forward about 3 months later, she comes over again, a little buzzed but not drunk, we hang out, do a dab, and go to the bedroom. We pass out and an hour later I wake up to that same wet leg feeling.  This time I almost lost it. I woke saying "you pissed the bed again! WTF". She immediately blamed me and said I did it. Lol...anyway, i ended up just telling her to leave and ill clean it up. But I am pretty much done with her.
953	2	My neighbor has a daughter who’s 7 &amp; best friends with my 8 YO DD. She also has a 5 YO son who is tortuously annoying. Talks A LOT, very loudly, interrupts constantly, whiny. &amp; his Mom, my friend, never corrects the behavior, so of course it persists! But surprisingly, the girl is very well-mannered.  We hang out &amp; chat at either of our houses sometimes while the 3 kids play, but if we go out anywhere, like a hike, festival, dinner, then the son has to come. (She’s married, but the relationship isn’t so great. Plus, the boy WANTS to come along.)  The boy’s presence is so profoundly unpleasant that I’ve stopped inviting her to join on outings &amp; I decline her invites. &amp; I feel bad. I would LIKE for her to join my family along with her daughter, but I don’t want to suffer in my free time. For the record, my husband, daughter, &amp; older son all agree that his presence is torturous.  I’m pretty sure continuing to just say, “Hey, thanks for the invite, but today doesn’t work for us,” is the best route, but I feel a little shitty continuing to evade individual invites until she gets the hint. I don’t think there’s any way I could say, “Um, could you teach your son some manners?”
513	1	This guy hit me up on Facebook. We would text and flirt and made plans to meet. Well, I clicked on his profile and saw that he had a girlfriend. I said I wasn't okay with the flirting and didn't want to meet anymore because he had a girlfriend. I said I didn't care and that I still didn't want to meet because it goes against my own values. I was respectful about it though, imo. I wasn't rude or mean about it.   Well, he started threatening to kill himself and that I wouldn't hear from him tomorrow because he would be gone. So I called the police department in his town and reported his suicide threat. He messaged me, angry and freaking out because he was going out to get his weed from his mailbox as they stopped him. He said he almost got in big trouble.   I regret nothing. I'd do it again. I just want to know what other people think. And to be honest, I really didn't feel like he would kill himself. But there was the smallest chance he could, and once this little fear combined with my pettiness, I didn't feel anything wrong with it.
729	2	I have a good friend that I've known for a few years. I also have a boyfriend. Last year he admitted he had feelings for me but he knew I was in a relationship. I said I understand that might be hard for you to say but I have a boyfriend and I'm not interested. So a few months later I helped him get a girlfriend. He has dated 2 girls--one went on to being his girlfriend for a bit--but is now single. About 5 months ago i think he hit on me over text by calling me sweetie and adding xoxo at the end. I told him that's not cool and he apologised and hasn't done it since. My boyfriend is fully in the loop with everything. And he has told me I can't hang out with him when he's not around (and he doesn't like my friend, at all, so he won't ever be around to hang out with him). I like this friend though. I am not interested romantically or sexually in the slightest but he is a really good friend. We text but my boyfriend seems to get pissed when he sees that still. I have talked to my boyfriend about this extensively but his stance hasn't changed. If i were to go against my boyfriend and tell him I'm going to hang out with this guy and do it, am I the asshole?  Edit: Was told to edit this in. My boyfriend is best friends with his ex girlfriend who he had feelings for and she broke up with him.  Also people aren't following the rules of not downvoting assholes.
970	2	So I used to hook up casually with this girl. If I'm honest I kinda used her a few years back because she was into me I wasn't into her but I also never said anything I didn't mean and was clear it was just casual.  Well we didn't talk for a few months and I actually started dating someone I really like, but it's still new. And the first girl hit me up asking to hang and I specifically told her yeah we could hang out in a group as friends because I recently started seeing someone.  She told me my reply hurt her feelings and I shouldn't have assumed anything. Now on one hand I feel like maybe I did hurt her feelings and could have been better but on the other hand I really don't want to hang out with someone I used to hook up with and hurt this new girls feelings and tbh the new girl is more important to me.
918	1	I usually think i have a pretty good grasp of social situations but maybe i fucked up.  Was on my first date with a woman related to my friend. Its going good, we're eating dinner, chatting when she starts playing the question game. "Whats your favorite movie?" , "Whats your favorite song?" ect.  I ask her "Whose your favorite president?"  "Hmm. It would have to be JFK, Ben Franklin, and Obama in that order."  "Oh, but Ben Franklin wasnt president."  "What?"  "He wasn't president. He was a founding father though and its a mistake a lot of people make."  "Maybe its a mistake that you made? Because I guarantee you he was."  "No, he really wasn't im serious." I think its still light so I laugh.  "Ok, one sec." She smirks and reaches into her purse/wallet thing and pulls out a 100 dollar bill.  "Who does that look like to you?"  "Ben Franklin?"  "Ha, there you go!"  I now realize she thinks you need to be a president to be on dollar bill.  "You know Hamilton wasnt president and is on a bill?"  "Google it! Google it!" She shouts in like a fed up laughing tone.  So I do and recite the Wikipedia article on how Ben Franklin was never president.  "Hmm. Ok?"  Complete awkwardness for the rest of the night. My friend later said that she thought I was a know it all and was condescending. AITA?
341	3	First off, dear redditor, I am sorry. This is my fault.  So what happened exactly?  I woke up this morning totally excited to post my first TIFU about how I accidentally made my cat eat her own p o o yesterday. Wooohoo, exciting and funny tale. I write it all out and perfect it, only to post and have it removed!   hmm, must be a glitch, maybe I need to flair it.   Reposted, and bam! Same thing!  I messaged the mods asking why? Apparently there is a rule about 'scatological' content. I responded asking how the top post was able to fly by the rules (I mean the dude put a cock ring up his butt and pulled it out, soiled fingers and all). Mod was unaware and asked for the link, so I sent the link and was sent a very concise "Thank you".  I hit refresh and alas, his post was removed!   I feel a crushing sense of regret and I hereby announce my debt to you of 10k karma, effective immediately.  TLDR: I accidentally snitched on a post, and my cat still ate shit
761	1	I just came across a post on here that reminded me of something I did in high school.   So the rich pretty girls always had an issue with me for some reason because I refused to be picked on/ let them pick on anyone else:   So the one day they were walking behind me in the hall and sprayed me in the back with a grape juice box, ruining my white uniform shirt. Instead of losing my shit, I hatched up a perfect plan.   Our high school had lockers, but the rule was if the locker wasn’t locked the school could do nothing if anything went missing. They provided a lock at the beginning of the year to ensure this.   Well all the popular girls shared a locker, and never locked it. So during 2nd period, I went to the “washroom”. I stopped by their locker, stole about $100 collectively and took all their mascaras and dipped them in the toilet bowls and put them back.   My sister was in the office later and saw the mean girls walk in and say someone stole their money. The office asked if it was locked ,too which they replied no.  So the office told them they couldn’t do anything or check cameras because it was their fault it wasn’t locked.   The next day one of the girls showed up with pink eye.   Looking back I would never do anything like this now, but damn did it feel good to get those bitches back.
124	2	It was friday and i was playing poker that night way too long, like maybe 4am. I had to work first shift which started at 6 so i called my boss and told him i dont feel well and would rather stay at home.   I told the doc that i have pain in my chest every time i breath in, which was a lie.   Anyway he sent me to x-ray for check and they found shadows in that specific area. After more checks and a surgery i got the diagnosis, cancer. Had to go through chemo and radiation.   3 years in remissin now, i am 24
304	2	I went to college on the other side of the country. Made some friends, but after a while things fell out and I moved back home.  One night, a friend from college was home alone, bored, and drunk. He was chatting with me, and decided it'd be funny to play suicidal (going so far as to take pictures of an injury and claim it was self-harm). After multiple attempts to reach out to our shared friends in the area, I called his local authorities (because remember, I was on the other side of the country).   His argument was that lying for him was completely in character (which is true) and that I should have known that, but I hadn't talked to him in a while. People change, and his story seemed pretty believable. I figured better safe than sorry when gambling with a friend's life. He was pissed because they ended up taking him to a mental hospital and it cost his family like $1000 or something. He broke off contact with me after that, and told me never to contact him or any of my old college buddies again.  So, am I the asshole?
881	1	20 years ago I married my wife. I was only 21 years old and only knew her for a few months. It was arranged. I have seven other siblings and couldn't stand living in that house anymore. No privacy, having to give money to my parents, I was sick and tired of it all.   We are middle eastern and told my mom I was moving out. She said the only way I could move out was if I got married because people in our culture just don't move out.   So I asked this pretty arabian girl I knew if she would marry me (we knew each other for a few months). She said yes.   I didn't want to marry her, but I needed to desperately get away as I couldn't take it anymore.   We struggled pretty badly and lived in a raggedy apartment that had a rat problem and we had to share a shitty car.   I don't regret it, I love my wife as much as someone who knew them for 10 years prior would.
742	2	 About 10 years ago I (f, 21 t the time) moved into a nice little house with my best mate (also f, 21) and after a few months one of her friends (f, 22) joined us. Having an extra person in the house was great cos it meant we could save a bit of money on rent and have more fun on the weekend.   As it turned out my new room mate was a lesbian who would take the pair of us, as her mostly straight friends, to the really good gay bar in the city. We all tended to hang out a lot. Go for dinner, see a movie, etc.  After a few months my best mate/original room mate started coming with us less frequently and eventually stopped coming all together. My other room mate was always the one to suggest a night out and usually tried to pay for both of us.  Well after a few weeks of us going out as a duo my other room mate asked how things were going and how did having a proper girlfriend compare to casual makeout sessions at the club?   I was confused! Turned out my mate had stopped coming out on girls nights cos my other room mate told her she planned on asking me out. I being the naive dumbass I was didn't realise that I'd been dating my lesbian room mate for the last 3 weeks.   After a late night discussion with my best mate sitting in on the conversation pissing herself laughing we worked things out and went back to platonic friendship. Eventually she moved on and her new girlfriend moved in with us for a bit before they branched off on their own.   I am definitely not against having a girlfriend but next time I hope I know that we're dating 😂😜😊   Tl:Dr - Accidently dated my lesbian room mate for 3 weeks cos I was too naive to realise the girls nights out were actually dates.
645	1	When I was 15, my mom left the family. For a long time, no one knew where she was or even if she was okay. Eventually, it was discovered that she was just “too overwhelmed” and left to handle herself. My brothers and I were raised by our uncle and my dad from that point on, but it was hard. I became like my brothers’ mom and had to grow up quicker than I probably should’ve. I got into therapy and a few years back and have been doing better.  Recently, I found my mom on Facebook. It was by pure mistake because I reconnected with some other maternal family members that I guess are friends with her. She had the same first name and looks pretty much the same, with just a different last name. The more I looked at her page, however, I saw that she had gotten remarried not long after she left my dad and had basically started a new family. She has kids ranging in age from 2-10 years old. My husband told me to leave it alone, but I was so angry and I just couldn’t handle it, so I ended up finding out her husband’s FB and messaged him, saying that his wife had 5 other kids that she had abandoned, did he know that? My mom ended up messaging me, pissed, saying I had made her husband mad because he didn’t know. To me, that’s not my problem. You can’t just run off and neglect my responsibilities. However, my brothers and husband think I was the asshole. AITA?
191	2	So a friend of mine (not super close, but definitely a friend) is getting married. Though we are friends I would not have been surprised if I wasn’t invited for space reasons, no hard feelings or anything.   Then I got a invited to my friends bridal shower. It was kinda obvious I was a late invite, but whatever, I went and had a great time.   While I was there I heard from other people that most of the people there had already gotten their save the dates. From the little wedding etiquette I know, if you are invited to the bridal shower then you are invited to the wedding, but I still have not heard anything. I don’t want to put my friend in a tight spot (her mom is really sick and they are rushing the wedding because of that). I just want to know what the situation is.  Would I be the asshole if I sent her a text or email saying something along the lines of “Hey, I don’t want to put any pressure on you at all, but am I invited to your wedding?”
103	1	I live in a building where the breaker box is at the entrance of my building. My door is on one side of the breaker box, my neighbor's door on the other. My son was over (he's 10 and I see him on weekends because his mom has him during the week) and my neighbor (a man in his 40s) was blasting porn on his TV.  We were trying to play guitar together and then I just had it: I went to the breaker box and turned the power to his apartment off and then on again. This reset his WIFI and TV. There was no more loud porn after that.
658	1	So once I stopped growing I was at a happy 6 foot even, but that wasn't enough for me, I needed more. I would tell everyone I was 5'10". I noticed there was a large population of guys who claimed to be 6 foot but were just under the mark, so to really drive the point home. I'd argue that I'm under 6 foot and since they're shorter than me, they can't be 6 feet tall. Watching the panic in their eyes as they tried to defend their height was the highlight of my highschool experience.
570	3	Tifu by living in Florida and daring to use my bathroom.  This happened two minutes ago.  This morning I sat upon the toilet, innocently taking my morning dump and browsing reddit (of course) when suddenly and out of nowhere the biggest palmetto bug you ever did see landed on my shoulder and ran down my chest, like a great dark harbinger of terror. It then promptly disappeared (from whence it came??) And I don't know where it went.  I've lived here a long time and I've had my run ins with bugs, but this was a whole other level of no. The time that a palmetto bug dive bombed me in the middle of the night for taking out it's friend doesn't compare. The time that I foolishly reached my arm into a bag of cat food and had five to fifty roaches scuttling up my arm doesn't compare. The time that I found a half dollar sized garden spider on my belly doesn't compare.  *cries in Floridian   Posted on mobile, so please excuse formatting.   Tl;dr: Took the shortest shit of my life thanks to a rogue roach.
858	1	As the title says, my Grandma has been a vocal opponent to my relationship with a woman who doesn't look like me since day 1. She insists that we're setting ourselves up for failure, and our children for identity crises. She refuses to [acknowledge her by name and status as my fianceé](https://i.imgur.com/J96fLd2.jpg), and purposely ignores her at family gatherings.   I'm Afro-Latino (Puerto Rican/African-American) and my fianceé is European (German/Italian). The Grandma giving us grief is on my African-American side.   A couple of months ago at my father's retirement ceremony, she made a disparaging comment to one of my Puerto Rican aunts about my cousin who had recently gotten engaged to a man in Nigeria (she's a PhD that travels the world 24/7/365). She said, "Aren't you worried about her dating a Nigerian? Aren't they dirty...AIDS and stuff?" My aunt did the right thing and gave her a piece of her mind for having the audacity to say some outlandish shit like that, but this is just an example of the type of person she is.  I don't want her at my wedding, because I know she will be disrespectful to my fianceé's family, who are the greatest in-laws a guy could ask for. My SO wants to invite Grandma because she feels as if excluding her will just give her more ammunition to hate her. I'm torn.   **TL;DR: Grandma disapproves of my interracial engagement, I need advice on whether to invite her to the wedding.**  Edit: Thank you all for the advice in support of and against inviting her. I plan on talking to my "friend" tonight and coming to a conclusion. I'll post an update as soon as I can.
427	1	It really irks me when people park like idiots outside of the lines or in more than one parking spot. When I see it and I have gum on me, I'll chew it and stick it under their driver's side door handle so they'll end up grabbing it and I don't feel bad at all.
962	3	AITB for drinking pepsi?  So I was out for a walk yesterday with a friend and he asked if he could put his unopened pepsi in my bag.  When the walk was over, we all went home and the pepsi was still in my bag. I texted him I still have his pepsi. He didn’t respond, he just looked at the message.  Fast forward today, i was tempted and drank the pepsi. I texted him how much the pepsi was. He didn’t give me a price and just asked if I drank it which I said yes.  After many tries asking him the price, he just didn’t reply. I looked online for the price of it and went for the most expensive price. Sent him the money and he’s still being funny with me.  AITB for drinking his pepsi?
297	1	We are both college students and have been dating for nearly 3 years. When summer rolls around we both go back to our hometown (same location), and live with our parents to save some extra money. When we are at school we normally end up staying together anywhere from 3-5 nights together. I am generally an independent individual and I enjoy my alone time quite often, but when it comes to sleeping I sleep way better and comfortably when she is with me. Holding onto the pillow reminds me of her being there and when I do it I can tell I sleep far better than when I don't.
471	2	I went to Marshall’s with my boyfriend today and picked up [this collection of Bite lipsticks](https://i.imgur.com/ooWyU9M.jpg). It was on clearance for $60.00 and had a security tag on it because the store is located in a city where theft is high and it retailed for close to $200.   It was one of two left in the store and the other one was ripped into with some lipsticks missing. I dug through the second shelf in clearance and found the only other one left in perfect condition way in the back of the shelf, completely out of view to anyone not willing to dig through a bunch of thrown around, damaged items.   While at the register, the cashier is having a conversation with the other cashier next to her and my boyfriend playfully says “she changed her mind about the makeup” to the cashier about 3 times until I tell him she’s not paying attention. He then says “watch her forget to scan it.”  She removes the security tag, puts the item on the counter, continues her conversation with the other cashier then puts the item in the bag and tells me the total. With this item scanned, our total should’ve been over $100 but it was less than $50.00. I figured she would’ve realized she forgot to scan something at that point but then we paid and she gave us our change. I then figured she would realize she didn’t scan it once she hands us the bag but she just said have a good day!   I thanked her and walked out.   I stole by omission and I’m trying to feel bad but I fully intended to pay and if the cashier was doing her job correctly, I would’ve paid. I could’ve said something... but who really passes up free?
991	2	I was at a small party last week at a house of an acquaintance. I've seen her a couple times but am not really close to her. I went with my friend who is really good friends with the host. Now there was one guy at the party who we'll call X. X is also just an acquaintance to me, but good friends with the host.   Now we were just talking and having fun when someone asked X how Y (his wife) was, since he knows her too. Another dude at the party who I'm friends with asked who that is so I told him about her. X is married, and has an absolutely gorgeous wife. Like 10/10. I ve met her about twice and she is really smart and you can talk to her about literally anything, she's the epitome of feminine.  When I told him about her everyone was just staring at me, X then broke the silence and started another subject but I felt pretty cut off from that moment. I'm bisexual but engaged.  My friend who brought me there scolded me and said I embarrassed him by Thirsting over Xs wife. I got mad and told him that I'm allowed to find people attractive, it was a compliment and IM ENGAGED. Our friendship has been kind of tense since.   My other friend tells me to apologize but I don't think I did anything wrong. I feel like shit though. Did I cross a line or should I stand my ground? I personally find all this a bit silly
225	3	I got a speeding ticket in September and I missed my court date and haven’t paid my fine. I didn’t have the money to pay the fine so I was just going to wait until I could pay to pay it. I didn’t realize I had to pay before the court date. The court date was over a month ago and now I have a bench warrant for failure to appear and my license is suspended. I’m a pizza delivery guy. I have to drive or I won’t have the money to pay the fine. All it takes is one cop to pull me over and I go to jail. My anxiety is through the roof. I just have to make it till Tuesday then I’ll have enough money to deal with this. I’m ready to face the consequences of my actions. It sucks being poor.
694	2	Husand is in 4th year of Med school and 2 days a week he does clinicals at a community based care clinic and has to leave before 5AM. Usually he thinks he's doing me a favor by leaving the house quietly but I'm a big fat emotional pregnant mess and I miss him. So last night after he was asleep, I unlpugged his phone, turned it on and locked it and then hid all the charging cables.   He had to wake me up to find them and I got my kiss goodbye. He kept saying how sorry he was and that he swore he plugged his phone in but I said nothing. I'm evil at heart and I will strike again.
237	3	I work in a themepark and was on a ride with a coworker yesterday. We take safety very seriously and its drilled into us how to act safely in different circumstances. My coworker and I trained together and have been here for about a month.   Yesterday, we had a little kid run into the working parts of the ride. The ride wasnt moving, but we're suppose to press the emergency stop as soon as someone crosses that line.  The kid went way past the line into the machinery.  I was just on assist with the guests and tried to call the little boy back. My coworker was behind the console and was doing the same. I yelled to her to turn the ride off but she didnt hear (english is her second language).  Everyone was fine, but it was scary and i asked her to tell a manager.  She debated it but didn't. I kept asking and today at the end of my shift I went and told them.  I just felt like something to tell them. We've been drilled to report all incidences including near misses.   When I told them, I didnt mention my coworker, just what happened. Then they asked if any emergency precautions were done and if she was near the console. I answered honestly.  After I left I realized I had essentially reported and dobbed on a coworker. I sent her a text telling her I did and that I was sorry.  I dont think she will get in serious trouble but I really regret basically turning her in.   Do I deserve the guilt? Am I  an asshole?
354	3	I’ve been living in this house for the past 11 years. In my bedroom there’s a ceiling fan that I always have on to try and make my room colder. My room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and I never understood why.  Flash forward to today when I’m talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. I immediately realized my fuck up. When I got home I took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. I hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. I’ve been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. Every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.  TLDR: My ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years
239	3	My friends were having a party on campus but they didn't invite me. When I asked them about going they said I wouldn't talk to anyone and will be that one weird kid at the party. All that was true but it hurt hearing it from them. Since they had the party on university property I called campus police and told them about the party. Apparently, they had to been bored that night and went to the party to break it up. My friends were under 21 so they got in alot of trouble. I still feel bad to this day:(
567	3	Obligatory this didn’t happen today but last night:  With all of this coronavirus panic around, my anxiety has been at an all-time high and I’ve been looking for ways to reduce it. A friend of mine sent me a video on YouTube that is supposed to control your breathing through guided meditation and I thought I’d give it a try. Well yesterday after my family and I watched a movie, I announced I was “going to my room to masturbate and then go to bed”. I meant to say meditate but for some reason this came out. The worst part is I didn’t even realize my slip of words. They all looked at me disgusted and confused and I responded, “what? I need something to help me sleep.” Then what I actually said hit me. I spent the next few minutes trying to convince my whole family what I actually meant to say but even this morning the atmosphere is still super awkward. So much for reducing my anxiety.   TL;DR: Told my family I was going to “masturbate and go to bed instead” of “meditate and go to bed.”
992	1	So a little bit of background. I'm in my mid teens and a school student. A year ago I asked out a girl in my Science class and she said no. She never said why but a couple of friends of hers said it was because my teeth were not straight. I'm not talking wonky or anything, just gapped apart. I was upset but got over it after a month or so. That was when I got braces.  A few months ago before the pandemic got serious, I no longer needed my braces, my teeth were all lined up nicely together.   She asked me out when she saw my teeth all lined up and I asked her "I thought you weren't into me?" she said she was into me mostly but didn't find me attractive because of my teeth. She said she didn't want to be seen with me with my teeth when most the other guys had nice teeth. I told her I'm sorry and she seems nice but I am no longer interested. She was angry and stormed off in frustration, muttering that I was a shallow dick.  Her friends called me shallow, but I didn't want to date someone who liked to point out such tiny flaws. AITB?
449	3	My employer holds an all-hands meeting once a month. It's mostly overview material—metrics, performance, shout-outs... things like that. There's also close to two hundred people on these calls and, like me, most just listen in while the execs talk news and numbers.  Today, instead of listening in, I decided to read.  I've recently begun The Lord of the Rings—something I've been meaning to read for years—and have also begun reading aloud to both work on my annunciation/speed of speaking and, since I've been isolated during this pandemic, selfishly need to hear my own voice. So, once the meeting began, I sat down to read. I muted my computer speakers but not my mic and, well, everyone heard.  The worst part is that it was a Tom Bombadil section and he was singing nonsensical rhymes and songs. I've sweat through my shirt, and every email I've gotten in the past hour, I'm like, "This is it. This is how I lose my job in a pandemic: by reading The Lord of the Rings."  I'm so embarrassed. Please laugh at me, then tell me it's not a big deal.  TL;DR: I read The Lord of the Rings aloud during a company-wide Zoom call and I'm really fucking embarrassed.
996	1	My girlfriend was over at my apartment finishing some school work, I was cleaning up mopping, dusting, laundry etc (my Sunday routine) so I ordered us some lunch to be delivered. I was getting ready to take the trash out, literally pulled the strings and tied it to be able to have handled to take it out when the door knocks foods here.     Guy takes a minute to get all the food out, and we're making small talk when I ask "hey man did you take the elevator up here?" He says yeah and points the direction, I ask "did you by chance see the door labeled trash chute?" He says yeah it's right next to the elevator. I ask "probably a weird request but if I give you $5 you mind dropping this trash in the chute on your way down?" He says no problem so I hand him the $5 I had, and the handles of the trash bag and tell him thanks.    Girlfriend says I shouldn't have asked him to do that since it's not his job he was here to deliver our food, and he shouldn't be treated like a servant.   My argument is, I thought I asked nicely just a weird request, and his job with me was done when he gave us the food (I tipped online 20%) and that if I was walking around and someone offered me money to take their trash I would too.    So was I in the wrong?
228	3	Tomorrow I'll be turning 32.  As we were waking up this morning she asked me if I was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. I responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but I was looking forward to it nonetheless.  She looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. I thought she was just trying to make sense of what I had said. Instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that I ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. I didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget.   It took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. Unfortunately for her I've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.  TL ; DR  Made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. Oops.
541	3	This TIFU happened this morning. It's a nice quick one for you all, and left me feeling grossed out, embarrassed and bewildered - so naturally I figured I'd share it with you all.   When I got my cat from the shelter they said he wasn't affectionate, which is the furthest from true it could possibly be - he's actually a little TOO affectionate at times. Especially at breakfast time. Personal space is no longer a feeling I am familiar with.   This morning, he comes and does that boop thing by rubbing his face on my face - or so I thought.  In my groggy state, my first instinct was to kiss his face, 'cause it's a real cute, real kissable face.   I opened my eyes and saw his face a few inches away facing the other direction and frowned in confusion, then everything faded to slow motion as my frown then turned to a wide eyed stare of alarm, as I looked up and saw his puckered button perched right next to my face.   I died a little inside.   TLDR; in my tired state, I mistakenly kissed my cats asshole.  Edit: as per your request, here is the cat tax - this is my derpy rescue prince Hamlet:  http://imgur.com/gallery/7rmCEtk
982	2	Maybe this is more suited for aita, I don't know. I'm extremely introverted and need alone time, but a lot of my friends are fairly socially dependant. A lot of the time I tell my friends I'm going to bed when I'm not so that I can have a few hours without thinking of much.  Recently some of my friends have been going through reasonably tough times. I've been emotionally drained and haven't felt able to help them, so this excuse has been partially used to get away from that. I feel really guilty about this, but I try to convince myself that I do need this time to just... Exist in my own space and not worry about others. Is my guilt founded in reality? AITB?
744	3	When I was a kid I used to live alone with my mother, she always cooked more than was necessary at lunch so she don't need to cook again for dinner. Food usually was enough even for the next day lunch. I hated this, in my mind, there was no need for that. She was just lazy. I threw out the food so she had to cook a new one, this last for a month or so, obviously she realized what I was doing but never said a word, she just took the "hint" and cooked less.    Looking back, she was so fucking busy. Single mother having to take care of a child and work at the same time. Honestly, this is not something I cared that much until last week when she died, everything came back. All the shit I've done in the past that made our life difficult.
433	1	At my boxing gym I used to just sit down all the time and not do any actual workouts. But lately I’ve been finding myself able to train more and harder cause I just pretend I’m a protagonist or something. When doing speedbags or anything I pretend it’s a training montage. When I’m punching the bag I scream “Muda” in my head and I pretend I’m in an epic anime battle in the ring.  This is probably super lame and dumb and not even a good confession.
222	3	A little backstory, but 3 1/2 years ago I had bariatric surgery. Since then I cannot eat certain foods, my appetite has decreased significantly, and when I try to reheat certain foods the texture hurts my stomach and I get sick.  So on Saturday I went on a date with a guy I met off a dating app. We had talked for a while prior to meeting and I had even told him about my surgery and all the different things about it—including my appetite. So naturally during dinner, I didn’t eat all of my food.   He asked me if I wanted a to go box for my leftover fries, and I said no, that unfortunately reheating them would change the texture, and that I’d get sick. He seemed very annoyed about that, and made comments how if he’d known I wouldn’t eat them all and be so wasteful that he would’ve taken me somewhere with smaller portions.   I just smiled and asked if he’d like to take them home for himself, and he just rolled his eyes, snatched a few fries off my plate, and then signaled for the check. I felt bad and offered to pay for myself, but he declined and I haven’t heard from him since.  So now I’m wondering if I’m the wrong and if should have just taken them home to throw away later?  Edit: spelling
703	3	Yes I know I’m a dick. This was 7 years ago when I was 13 if that excuses my actions. This girl had a huge crush on me for 3 years. I figured I would give her a chance. I prioritized playing my Nintendo 64 than to reply to her texts. I got annoyed after she tried to reach me for about a week so I faked my death by having my friend tell her I jumped off an overpass and onto the highway. Needless to say, she was devastated. Once she found out I lied, I was pretty much dead to her and all of her friends. On the bright side we’re best friends today.
391	1	A few months ago I lended someone $500 with the intention of getting it back later that week when he got paid(he worked with me). Well, before we got paid I transferred to another location and pretty soon after he quit the job and the inevitable happened. He ignored my texts and calls. So one day I see his car in public and I took the GPS tracker from my car keys and stuck it to his car. I checked the location when he left and found out where he lived then found out where his new job was. Ended up showing up to his house and workplace every few days and eventually got my money.
903	3	Obligatory this wasn't today... More of a YIFU (...with my WIFU)  So my wife and I have been doing Hello Fresh, and I've been getting some really good practice cooking. It's super awesome.  Then, today happened.  It all started when I cracked open the bag. I poured (which I never do) the contents of the bag out on the counter, and the tiny mayonnaise jar falls on the ground and the bottom shatters.  "That's one way to open it," I thought. I picked it up and set it on the counter for later.  Time passes, I have seared the fish for our tacos, peeled the carrots for our slaw, and it's time to add the mayonnaise to the slaw. I turn the jar over and start shaking out all the mayo I can into this slaw. Vigorously.  Fast forward again... I've pulled out the fish and cut it up for the tacos; started adding fish, slaw, and sour cream to the tortillas; toss a lime on each plate and serve it to my beautiful wife.  I stepped away for a moment to grab some things to work with after we're done eating, and when I come back, my wife says, "Everything tastes really good, but there's this really sandy stuff in it." We proceeded to have a full conversation about what could possibly be causing that. I added sugar to the slaw, maybe the fish was a little charred, maybe we got a weird batch of tortillas.  No. No. No.  Then my wife pulls something out of her mouth. "It's really gritty!"  It was the glass.  We ate glass.  Tl;dr - Broke a jar of mayo, made fish and glass tacos.
10	1	Basically my mom's getting Married this year, she calls me to let me know there's some good news and that she's decided on a date, it's on my 21st birthday, she makes it sound like it's a good thing and i should be delighted to be celebrating my bday that way, in a tux, at an event i don't want to be at, that i can't drink at, and i can potentially invited "one" friend to lol  I tell her it's not okay she didn't ask me before hand because i might have already had plans to do something with all my friends and it's already hard enough getting them all together she reassures me that there's supposedly no other day they can do it and it has to be that day, so i tell her i guess i won't be there and she tells me I'd basically be a bad son if i didn't but how is her actions not completely narcissistic and selfish? So am i being the asshole if i don't go? The worse part is this isn't a one time thing every year after this i have to share my birthday with her anniversary   Edit: i forgot to add that this isn't like a huge wedding or anything not even traditional, she decided she was getting married two weeks ago and last week she picked the date, she wants to basically just make a party and get married there... On my birthday lol there's no church or anything
555	2	My brother (I'll call him Bro.) had this great idea for a company. Bro had no money, and honestly is lazy...but he's creative. I fronted half the startup money from my savings where I was saving to buy a house. Our father (I'll call him Dad) invested the other half with the idea that the company would pay him back within 5 years.  Fast forward 2 years, and the business is struggling. Mainly because we had to hire someone else to work because my brother didn't do anything, just sat at a desk and goofed around on the internet. Company was about to go under and when I told him that, he told me he'd sell me his half for $10,000. I take him up on it because honestly, I can save more than that by not paying him a salary for doing nothing.  Now, 5 years later, My company made the first $1,000,000 annual net profit, and I now have 5 employees, and have long since paid Dad back with interest. When I told Dad about the milestone, he told Bro, who had moved to Colarado with some friends with the money I'd given him for his half. (They moved there because marijuana was legal.)  He called me saying that half of the company should be his because it was his idea. I reminded him that he sold me his half, and that it was a success only because I put everything I had into it to make it a success, and I didn't owe him anything, and couldn't even afford to hire him since he never actually did any work (which is true. Margins are slim, especially right now).   Bro called Dad, and Dad is agreeing with him, and asked me to make him a partner. I refused, and now they're both mad at me. AITA?
666	2	The son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. Now, I have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.  Up until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!  I felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.  AITA?
27	2	I work in a very popular bakery. My jobs include serving customers by packaging what they want into boxes, stocking the showcase with pastries, cakes, cookies, etc, and occasionally helping in the kitchen.  Like any other bakery that does everything by hand, it's not easy to make everything a uniform shape and size for each product. When a customer comes in who is very obese or overweight, I low-key dig around for the smallest of the item that they want, such as the smallest cookies, fritter or donut. In my head I'm thinking, "they don't need this, they're sick and could use a little less calories. They shouldn't be in here, I'll help them out by giving them a little less". When really it isn't my responsibility and if they want something sweet that may not be very good for their already bad condition..then whatever I shouldn't hinder something that's going to make them very happy.  I can't say that I will likely stop doing it after confessing..I just still feel like if I don't try and do the little thing to help them, who will?
23	3	This literally happened 5 minutes ago. Throw away cause I don't want my friends to know.  So basically I bought some shampoo and I left it on the kitchen table. The way my flat was designed, is that there is an extremely large window positioned next to the front door. This window faces the kitchen table.  So I hopped into the shower intending to wash my hair, forgetting my shampoo. Realising my mistake, I get out of the shower and walked down the hallway. I was completely naked as nobody in my flat was home and I thought it would be an in an out operation. As I reached for the shampoo from the table, I heard a knock. Trick or Treaters. I turned my head and saw three kids, wide eyes in complete horror, gazing at my body in all its glory.  TL;DR I forgot it was Halloween and so I scarred three kids for the rest of their lives.
32	2	TIFU by saving my reddit log in to the computer at my work. I forgot to deselect the box that remembers my log in information and now my co-worker and anyone who uses the work computer has access to my reddit account and can do whatever they want. In fact, I don't even know I've FU yet. My co-worker is hoping that I discover that I FU when I receive replies to this post. Reddit, please let me know I've FU and give my coworker recommendations of how to increase the consequences of staying logged in.  TL;DR: I forgot to log out of my reddit and now my co-worker can do what ever they want, like say the true user of this account has a small penis. But it's coming from me so you know it's credible, and that I, u/MisterWhisler_ am not the slightest bit hung.
326	1	**[No Regrets]**  The title says it all. School barely started and the little shit wouldn't stop harassing my son. Son got fed up one day and beat the shit out of him spontaneously. Though everyone around us is looking at him in disapproval (funny how they avoid the cause of this in the first place), his mother and I approve of him standing up for himself.
924	3	On mobile, English not my first lg, etc.   This is a double FU, to be fair.  I (23F) depend on my physical ability quite a bit. I go everywhere by bicycle, I am a long distance runner and I teach dance and fitness as a secondary job.  Rewind six weeks. On the way to university (bike, of course) I flew off it with incredible grace and broke my ankle. So much for running, dancing, cycling, everything. Doc put a cast on me and said, no less than two months.   Today. It has been six weeks, I have been living peacefully, recovery going great, I am very able to move around and do most things, excited to get my cast off soon enough.  One thing has been very hard, though, and that is taking out the trash. I live on the second floor and carrying the bag with the crutches just demands another hand. Most of you probably suspect where this is going. Please, do laugh.   Well, luckily, as I stand at the top of the stairs, my neighbor is coming outside. Need a hand? - he asks, and I say the dumbest thing in my life: no thanks, I'll be fine.   You know how cartoon characters only fall when they look down? Yes, well, that was probably what my neighbor saw next, as I descend graciously, crutches rattling, trash scattering all over the stairs.   Flash forward to the hospital. Yes, I broke the ankle again. I also broke the bone above it and two ribs.  You are allowed to laugh. I can't, it hurts.  TL;DR don't take out the trash if your bones are broken
105	1	***** I deleted the part when I mentioned what app I use. This is NOT an advertisement for it and I have NO affiliation for that app. *****  Some background - I (21F) have an app that tracks my periods, it gives me all the info you can probably imagine that an app like that does.   My friend (21F) asked me for a recommendation for an app like that, because tracking them by hand was getting annoying for her.   I showed her what I use and she asked, “what are those hearts for?”  Me: “Oh, I mark those down for when I have sex”   She told me that it’s weird I track those things. In my defense, I told her that it helps me not freak out about potential pregnancy scares and it’s not hurting anyone. Once again if anything, it helps me.   Her: “It weird that you remember the times you sleep with [the guy] and he would also be confused.”  Me: “I mean I’m not going to tell him! Why are you being so weird about this?”  I was just trying to help her with her period since she asked me. My friend then said that I need to tell the guy and I see no reason for that. It’s not like we finish and I pull up my phone to click “got laid today.”  AITA?  EDIT: wow! I didn’t expect to blow up as it did! :D and TY for the awards.   *EDIT 2: I deleted the part when I mentioned what app I use. This is NOT an advertisement for it and I have NO affiliation for this app. THE CONFLICT was my friend wanted me to tell the guy that I’m marking when we sleep together and I do not see the point.
606	1	Background: Earlier this morning, I caught my twelve year old daughter looking at vibrators on Amazon. Anyway, She didn't notice that I was standing behind her because she had her AirPods in listening to music, so I had time to look over her shoulder and see what she was doing. When I finally realized what she was looking at, I slammed the MacBook shut. So I took her MacBook away from her and grounded her for a month.  About twenty minutes later, my wife told me that she ungrounded her then told me give the MacBook back. She was standing right next to her when she said it. They both had their arms crossed. I sat there for a while in silence, dumbfounded by what my wife was doing, and then I refused to give it back. My wife and I argued about it for about an hour and then eventually she just gave our daughter the MacBook.  Neither one of them are speaking to me. I don't really want to speak to either of them either. I will sleep on the couch in the living room tonight. My wife completely punked me out in front of my own child and now it's going to be impossible to discipline her. Am I the asshole here?
235	2	After she told me that she cheated on me I moved out for about a month. I was utterly disgusted by the thought of her and I wanted to get back at her. During this period I had sex with her younger sister. I didn't end up telling my wife because we ultimately ended up getting back together and trying to work it out. I moved back into the house in October of 2016 so a bit more than a year ago. My wife told me today that her sister (the one that I had sex with) had fallen on hard times and was going to be moving in with us for a little while. I haven't seen her at all since I fucked her. I have no idea what I'm supposed to say to her.
997	1	When I got my cat, he was a kitten and very snuggly/needy, which was adorable. Now he’s 2 and seems to believe it’s no longer “cool” to hang out with daddy. He ignores me all day, comes out of his cat castle twice a day to eat and use the bathroom but otherwise either stays in the cat castle or wanders the apartment ignoring me.  I would NEVER return him, but I didn’t get a cat just to be ignored and never interact with it. So lately, I’ve been doing things to make him want to spend time with me.  Sometimes I walk into the room he’s in, say “omg hi!!!” And then I run to a ficus plant or something and start giving it attention to make him jealous. On the rare occasion that he does come over to me, I’ll pretend not to see him and just turn on the TV. In the middle of the night when he doesn’t want to sleep in my bed sometimes I’ll sleep in his bed just to mess with him and then when he comes over, pretend to “sleepwalk” back to my bed holding a can of beans or something as if it were my cat.  My friends say this is wrong, but I still feed and take care of him. I just refuse to play his games, I mean why have a cat if you’re never going to pet it or be with it? Also my tactic appears to be working, but does it make me the asshole?
739	3	My friend was spending the night on my couch and we both had fallen asleep at one point on the couch.  I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw my friend laying there and I softly grazed her leg and leaned over and smelled her.  Now I feel really guilty for it cause it was an invasion of her privacy to a degree. I mean, who wants to be smelled? I guess I wouldn’t mind being smelled, BUT IT DOESN’T MEAN I CAN JUST GO AROUND SNIFFING OTHER PEOPLE. JEEZ.  And the social implications it could’ve had upon me, if she had seen me. What if she did see me, and she’s keeping it to herself like I’m keeping this to myself and millions of strangers on the internet
273	2	One of my cousins, Peter just had a baby with his girlfriend a few days ago. Peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited from their mom. They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they’ll be great parents. I then asked Peter “did she get your blue eyes?” (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn’t visible) Peter and his girlfriend’s tone completely changed and his girlfriend said “Jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. It’s fucking weird” I was pretty taken aback by her reaction. I didn’t mean anything by it I was just curious. I thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn’t mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.  I told my mom what happened and she said that Peter’s girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting her baby but that I didn’t say anything wrong. However my sister said I was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since Peter’s girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican). This didn’t make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad. My eyes are brown! I was just curious! AITA here?
457	2	I got hurt badly in the military and spent a few years in a wheelchair- an expensive ultra light custom chair. The chair has a seat pad that you can remove and unzip. I gave since gotten better and dont need the wheelchair 80% of the time. I di need a chair at places like airports where there's a lot of walking. But at airports I generally use the airports chair so I don't have to bring mine.   I went to a state with legal weed last week. I brought my wheelchair purely for this plan. I got 58 grams of weed, unzipped my wheelchair pad and put the weed inside the pad. Then went through TSA. I know they never really check the chair, and used that to my advantage.    I'm glad I have my weed, but I feel mildly guilty for using my disabilities like that.
713	1	Throwaway account for obvious reasons...  As the title says I got a Mechanical engineering degree by hacking most of my college professors accounts.   It was really easy using a usb keylogger, I only hacked the professors that were really bad at explaining stuff and did not deserve to even teach. From time to time I would help fellow students, but they never knew how I got the tests, they just thought that I got them from other students that have already taken the tests.  Got into their email because they would send their tests to be printed by a printing department and I would intercept them.   Because of my high GPA I was accepted into a Masters Program, but I didnt hacked anyone while doing Masters.   I got my PE license and now I earn around $100K+.   Dont blame me, I used to be a homeless student living in school and I felt like abandoning college and just ending my life, but It ended up working out and now I'm a professional engineer.
3	3	When I was a kid (11 at the oldest) my parents took me and my siblings out of school. When I asked them why they did it, they said it was because we were moving overseas and I was to study once we got there.   I believed them and basically just lazed around waiting to move most of my teen years. Whenever I asked my father he'd say that moving takes a while, and when I brought up school, he said not to worry about it because we're all smart, school is easy, school is overrated etc, &amp; I believed him.  Well, now I'm 16, with no education, no social skills(or skills in general), no discipline, &amp; no passions. I can't even remember most of my life.  Whenever we meet one of my mothers friends she says that we're home-schooled because we move around a lot. (we don't) It feels really shameful having to lie about your own education, &amp; my mother once admitted she was ashamed of us, too.  So now I'm trying to self-study so I could hopefully catch up to my age group at least, but each time I try I get really stressed and start crying. I can't even get the basics down. I feel like I've wasted my life so far, &amp; that I might never be able to be an independent, self-sufficient adult. I only have two years left until I'm considered one. I just want to escape my family (parents, specifically.) &amp; live a fulfilling life but it's really stressful all-around in my family. (father's a gaslighting pervert &amp; our mother's manipulative)  (Sorry for rambling, I just needed some place to vent.)  Edit: Thanks for being so supportive, everyone! But it's ~1:30 a.m. here &amp; I'm pretty tired, so I'm gonna go. I'll try to update if/when I manage to get my life together :)
786	3	My parents were away for the weekend and my brother was out with mates so I had the house to myself and decided to invite some friends around for a bit of a party. After a couple of drinks, we got a bit tipsy and started sharing our naughty fantasies. I revealed that I always wanted to play “Flash the pizza guy” and they convinced me to do it right then and there.   We ordered the pizza and I stripped naked. The app said the pizza would take roughly 45 minutes but there was a knock on the door 10 minutes early. I dashed over to answer it. As I opened the door, I was hit with a momentary bout of shyness and looked down to the ground. I quickly got over it and looked up. “Wow! You’re early—“  My brother and his friends were standing in the doorway, their eyes widened. I froze and tried to say something but nothing came out. Suddenly, a wave of embarrassment hit me and I abruptly shut the door. Shit! They were home early.  TL;DR I tried to play “Flash the pizza guy” but ended up flashing my brother and his friends by mistake.
781	2	When I was in kindergarten I wanted to see what would happen if I opened the emergency window on the school bus. So one day we were on our way to school and I was sitting in one of the seats near the lever and thought heres my chance. So I pull it up which to my surprise opened the huge ass window and set off a loud ass alarm throughout the bus. Then the bus supervisor lady came to yell at me and the friend I was sitting beside so I immediately blamed it on the girl sitting in the seat in front of me who was super quiet and never really spoke to anyone including the teachers  This happened like 17 years ago and I still feel bad about it. I took advantage of the girl who didnt talk and the adults just believed me :(
623	3	This happened about a week ago. It still gives me shivers.        Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.        I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.  A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,    "What is your most prized possession?"    I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.  I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.  So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,  "uh... ^(dong schlong)"  "I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well."  "... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)"  "Dong schlong. Thank you, sir."  I was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.  I've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.
444	1	One of my closest friends names her spotify playlists with specific names. One of her playlists is called 'sad lady hours,' and everytime i see her actively listening to it I shoot her a (hopefully) inconspicuous text asking what she is up to, that I love her, etc etc. I hope she never notices the pattern.
400	1	I’m the single father to two daughters, 18 &amp; 13, raising them alone. My youngest has been trying to get up the nerve to ask out a boy she has a crush on and we’ve all been super supportive. Last week, she invited him to go on a group date type thing and he declined. By my daughter’s admission, he was very nice about it and said “I just don’t like you like that, I wanna stay friends”.  My daughter was understandably upset and was down for most of the weekend. My eldest and I were doing a lot to cheer her up. One thing my eldest kept saying, however, was that “he’s an idiot! He doesn’t know what he’s missing!” I’ve always hated that POV on both ends. I heard it often growing up, whether it was me being rejected or a friend. To me it creates entitlement. No one has to go out with you. You’re allowed to turn someone down for no reason. I also don’t want my daughters thinking they should just say yes to anyone who asks to spare their emotions.  So, I ended up saying “I understand why (youngest) is upset. But I don’t think he’s an idiot. He’s a nice guy who just wants to be friends. Let’s not vilify that.” My oldest got mad and said I wasn’t being helpful, I was making it worse, etc. I said if my youngest had turned someone down, how would we feel about their family calling her an idiot? My eldest got even more pissed and took my youngest shopping for retail therapy.  My youngest didn’t seem mad when I said it but when she came back, she was and said that I was defending the guy vs comforting her. It’s been an icy few days in our house. AITA?
856	1	As the title says on January 28th I'm going to become a dad and I'm freaking out. This is easily the strangest feeling I've ever felt. I'm so excited and have dreamed about being a dad for a long time while at the same time I feel like Forrest Gump when he finds out he has a kid and thinks he did something wrong. I'm 25 and she is 23. I didn't think it would be this early but there's no going back now. She thought I was going to be mad and tell her to get an abortion, but no way! This is my first kid and he/she is going to get every chance in life I never had. I'm terrified of the future because I have no idea what I'm doing and everyone always told me the joke that being a parent doesn't come with instructions. But I'm also pumped to find out the gender, watch the baby grow, and start making all the parent memories that I'm sure my parents have of me. HOLY SHIT IM GOING TO BE A DAD!   I also feel like there's so much to do! I need to baby proof, get their room ready, get clothes, furniture, read dad books, and prepare myself mentally for my fiancé and her crazy pregnant moods. Wow I'm overwhelmed and excited. Sorry I know this isn't really the typical confession but I needed to tell someone since we haven't announced yet.
915	1	Whenever anyone lets me borrow a key, usually to their house in order to petsit, the first thing I do is go to Walmart and make a copy of that key for personal use after they ask for it back.   I never break into houses and steal anything, other than food or maybe alcohol, but I love the feeling of being able to effortlessly enter a place I know I don’t belong without anyone’s knowledge.   I have keys to multiple people’s houses and a couple of buildings/garages from my old job.
30	3	This happened Saturday night into Sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. Also no throwaway because whatever.   We have a 12 yr old son.   Saturday night after he went to bed, husband and I decided to get a little sexy time in. After quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the “toy” box. Husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (He was putting new batteries in them, etc). He comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. We wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says “what is that on the table?!” ...I immediately realized the FU. Husband did not so he asks “what is it?”  Son: a purple banana (ps he’s 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room.  Cue immediate shame/laughter. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me.   Side note. We did not use that particular “purple banana” that night-thank god.   After we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says “what do you want for breakfast?”  Son says “I lost my appetite”   I’m still dying inside. I’m sure son is too.  TL;DR left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won’t ever be the same.
500	1	Needless to say my fun was short-lived, the car lost a wheel not far from home while grossly overloaded with friends. Sold the bumper for $50 and the rest to a scrap dealer for another $100 so I actually made money on it.
97	2	To make a long story short my father died when I was very young. He was murdered and had a few properties back in our home country. When he died my grandmother claimed she was next of kin, she stole the inheritance of my sister's and myself. My mother didn't go to court because at the time she didn't think it was worth sending her late husband's mother to prison for fraud.  When I was 14 I finally asked my mom why I don't know my father side of the family? I know my father had many brothers and sisters and they all had kids, some not far from where we lived. I didn't know who they were or why we never interacted with them. My mother told me what my grandmother had done. She also informed me that my aunts and uncles didn't interact with us because they hoped we would forget about them. What was my father's properties had become their familial properties. Their jobs and livelihood in the home country relied on working the various farm lands my dad had bought. My grandmother, when she dies, will leave the properties to my various aunts and uncles.  They stole from me when I was a child. Now I'm older, I've convinced my sisters to retain a lawyer with me and see if we can do anything to regain my father's property. Our inheritance. I'll be seeing if I can sue to regain what was lost. I'm going to try my best to make my grandmothers last days on Earth spent in court rooms, hopefully she'll even sit in jail for fraud.   I've been looking forward to this since I was 14. Maybe I'll lose. Maybe I'll win. Won't know until I try.
215	1	I'm 17 and I still live with my parents. My father insists that I cook for our family. My father also gets grossed out very easily. He won't eat the food if someone touched it with their fingers, hell, he won't touch food with his own fingers. Anyways, I hate him for the reasons that I am not allowed to talk about because my post will be removed.  Everytime I cook something for him I like to spit in it and stir it. Whether that's coffee or soup. Once I even emptied my nose in his food and he didn't notice. I still do it lol. I've never spit in anyone else's food tho, just his
808	3	6 years at my company. View myself as a problem solver and my desire is to roll the dice on high-risk, high-reward roles to continue climbing that Corp ladder.    Current location was a smoldering dumpster fire when I accepted it 2 years ago. No longer the reputation or the work environment. Now it is an enjoyable workplace - staff is happier, customers are happier, everything going well....I am finally on autopilot after retraining and grinding it out.    My dream location is the kiss of death. Never seen a person in my role make it over a year. The running joke has been “that is where you go to end your career”. Well I applied, was offered the opening, and accepted the position Monday.    My thought was no kids, no house, no problem...I get canned I’ll survive right....wrong! Get home and find a surprise in the microwave. Wife then tells me she’s pregnant.    Currently freaking out as I know the risk I accepted and I am trying to downplay how bad this place is to the wife. I do not want to alarm her. Cannot determine if this will motivate me more or make me panic more...   Exciting times for sure. Looking forward to dad life but holy hell what have I done.    TL:DR TIFU by accepting a risky position on the premise I have no dependents and before the ink even dried my wife tells me we have our first child on the way.
389	2	I got my first missionary at my apartment door today. They were a father and daughter. They were passing out flyers.   I was polite when I answered the door. They said hello and passed me a pamphlet saying "WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?" I looked inside, saw the mention of God and returned it.   I said, "I'm pagan, sorry but I'm not interested."   He said goodbye, looked a little annoyed. His daughter looked embarrassed/hurt. When I closed the door I heard him say "asshole."   I don't think I am the asshole, but I wonder what the proper thing to do is. I don't want to just take stuff people give me just because they believe something. I would like to be polite but firm.
668	3	This was my one and only time I ever had to do this, or that there was ever a full blown fist fight in my house. Also, obligatory this isn’t recent.   My oldest son, who was at the time 15, was getting his ass kicked by my oldest daughter who was at the time 17. She was absolutely beating the tar out of him. Knowing her and her level of self control, he probably was really asking for it.   I worked security, and I’ve worked security most of my life. I’ve seen just about every type of fight you can imagine. Bar fight, gang fight, school fight...    I assumed using some of those security skills would be put to good use. I put my daughter in a Full Nelson and rotate her away from the fight. What I didn’t do is talk, she doesn’t know if it’s me or another one of her brothers that has her in that full Nelson.   She contorted her shoulder forward and elbow in a way where she escaped the Full Nelson and elbowed me in the nose and hit me in the solar plexus while she was at it.   I fell back, and when she looked back she gave the “Oh shit” look. My son started cackling, and I was bleeding from the back of my nose into my throat. My nose wasn’t broken, but that in combination with the solar plexus hurt so bad, probably the top 10 pains I’ve ever felt, and occasionally still have nosebleeds since then   Tl;dr: Don’t put your double jointed daughter in a full nelson, or you might have a bad day.
484	3	This happened about a year and a half ago when I was in school, but I was just reminded of it today. I was sitting on the bleachers before school and my crush was sitting in the row in front of me. I was talking to my friend on snapchat and for some reason decided I should take a picture of my crush considering I didn't have any. I tried to take the picture as discreetly as possible but right after the guy behind me yelled to my crush that I was taking pictures of him. My crush just turned around and stared at me with a confused and kind of concerned look on his face. My excuse was that I was sending streaks and he just happened to be in the picture but I don't think he bought it and to make matters even worse the guy behind me said it so loud that everyone sitting around us could hear so now they all thought I was some kind of creep.  TLDR: I tried to take a picture of my crush and got exposed by a rando behind me.
461	1	 So today I came up with an evil plan to use my Google Home to make the kids be good. I found that you can get the Home to say anything you need using the custom Shortcuts settings from the home app. So I spent a little time perfecting a role play between Google and myself.  Trigger: "Hey Google, Are any of my children on the bad boys and girls list?"  Response: "I have just checked with Santa and yes, both Laura and Joel appear on the bb and g list this year."  After a couple of seconds of shock and confusion. Laura was screaming and Joel slowly sank to the floor bawling in disbelief. It took 5 minutes to convince them that I had played a trick and yes, I was bad dad.  Feel free to try it yourself if you hate your children. The action is 'repeat after me blah blah blah'  TL;DR kids will believe anything Google tells them. Don't use this against them.  Edit: for those asking how? Home App &gt; settings &gt; shortcuts &gt; https://imgur.com/gallery/BpcJN  Edit2: BB and G list is a reference to popular children's Christmas book. Aunty Claus by Elise Primavera.
780	2	Last night i misjudged the quality of a dirt road and got my car stuck, luckily this guy pulled up and tried to help but ended up sliding his truck into my car putting a dent about the size of a head into the fender, eventually he called his buds to bring their bulldozer down and help us out, eventually after ~2 hours we got out. I really appreciated the help but still wanted his insurance (which made him look a little upset) because its a relatively new car. Am I the asshole?
508	1	I love strawberries. I love them so much that I planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.  Lately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because there was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.  I caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard.   I just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.
121	3	Went to a stag party this evening.  Nothing crazy, mainly just drinks with buddies and catching up with people I haven’t seen since Covid has hit.    Ended up playing a cash game Texas hold-em at the end of the event with about 10 other guys, $100-$300 buy-in.  About 2 hours in, i’ve doubled up, but i’m mentally and physically exhausted. Buddy offer’s me a couple bumps of blow to wake me up. (I used to have a somewhat problem with the stuff, nothing life/career threatening). I accept, couple bumps to help keep me awake and focused on the game. It works.  I triple up, end up cashing out at about 3x what i bought in for, donate $50 to the groom and head out.  As arranged my girlfriend picks me up.  She noticed nothing unusual, dropped another friend back at his home and we made our way back to our place.  I, for the first relationship ever, have been trying to be completely straight-forth and honest, don’t need lies weighing me down. Told her about how i did a couple of bumps, no biggie (didn’t buy, don’t want more). She goes silent and just tells me shes not sure who i am anymore and she’ll think about it when i’m sober in the morning. Brings me to current, sitting on the couch well she sleeps in the bedroom contemplating our relationship.  TL/DR I did drugs, tried to be honest to S/O and am now in jeopardy of being single. Don’t do drugs… or at-least don’t go sharing that you did.
262	3	So... I live in an apartment complex and I have a bike. To protect my bike from getting stolen I put it in the garage. One day I noticed that the lamps that turn on when it detects motion is always on. I always check around but nothing.    Fastforward today, I see a dead cat at the road near my house (probably hit by a car) I go to the garage and what do I see a little kitten calling his mom. Of course I was not going to leave it here (probably it would have Lived more if I hadnt) so I took it home gave him a name gave him his own box and I fed him with a baby bottle. I played with him ALL DAY. He was so cute and all. I have to wake up early so I usualy sleep around 10. The little kitten didnt want to get out of my hands but ı was able to  put him on his box bed. Then ı go to my bed and sleep. I just woke up to fınd the little guy crushed under me. I panicked I checked if he was still alive.... No he wasnt... After crying for about an hour and cursing at myself I took his body inside his box and closed the lid. So here I am 4am sitting in the kitchen  half crying and feeling  like shit I cant sleep. I dont know what to do
65	3	For those of you who don't know, a Menstural cup is a soft &amp; flexible medical grade silicone cup that you can leave in for up to 12hrs to collect the period blood and pour out. As you can imagine, a full cup has a fair amount of blood. This is important for later.  This morning at 5am, I felt the need to go to the toilet. I noticed that a little blood had spilled out so I knew it was over time to empty my cup. This usually doesn't happen to me, but I guess overnight I had more blood than usual.  Groggy at 5am with the lights off, I take my cup out and dump it into the toilet. It was messy, and I finally discovered that I had an accident with how much blood came out. I chucked my cup in the sink next to me ready to clean everything up, but at this moment, my boyfriend peeks into the bathroom to see if I'm okay and what I'm doing awake.  From his perspective, he just sees blood all over my hands and in the sink. The lights were off and he just can see me from the flash on my phone. It looked like a horror scene.  He freaked out and fainted at the door. Me, being concerned without thought, jumped up to aid my boyfriend who had just collapsed on the floor without a second thought.  I then instantly realised I had blood all over my hands, and now all over him and the floor. He wakes up a moment later, freaking out not knowing why there is blood everywhere.   I explained it to him and was left with a shocked boyfriend and a literal bloody mess I had to clean up at 5am.  TL;DR I emptied my period cup in the dark at 5am and my boyfriend thought the blood on my hands was from some horror injury and fainted.
783	2	So I (43M) have a son (10M), everyday I take him outside to a park, or just on our front lawn so he can get some outdoors time rather than sit in front of a screen all day.  There is this kid (probably like 13-14) who comes by our house on his way home from the park, and for whatever reason he loves to feint throw/kick a ball at my son to make him flinch. At first, I thought it was him just being like playful or something idk, but as time went on i realized he was just doing it to be a jerk.  I would always watch him from my window so I'd see this. I'd usually come out and look through the door and he would leave.  Eventually my son got used to it, so when the kid feinted a throw or a kick at him, he just continued playing by himself in the yard and ignored it.  One day I was watching from my window, and I see him just straight up throw the ball at him, I think he intentionally missed, but my son flinched and I heard him say "pussy".  I came out, picked up his ball on the lawn and drop kicked it as far as I could over some fence and went back inside.  He started tearing up and went searching for his ball over the fence.  I havent seen him since, when I told my wife about this she called me a child.  Yeah I guess it was a bit wrong but idk. AITA?
822	2	I'm 17f, going to art college in September and I'm really excited for it because I'll be able to start building a portfolio easier and it'll be a stepping stone into getting a tattoo apprenticeship.   My dad (not my sisters dad) got me a bunch of Copic markers in 2019, I didn't use them much until last year but now, when I run out of something, usually black or white or red, I just buy them individually because they're not cheap. I love them and take care of them quite well.   I went to my boyfriend's family mobile home last week from Thursday to Sunday and I didn't lock my door so my mom could put washing on my radiator if needed, but I did ask her to lock it when my sister was over, she's 6, autistic, quite large and highly destructive so I lock my door even if I'm in my room when she's over for the weekend.   My mom ended up misplacing my key, so she couldn't lock the door and my sister got into my room and destroyed my markers, I have 3 left that work but she somehow managed to ruin the majority of them as well as some drawings and a sketch I've been working on a while, she also got at my walls, my white bedsheets and somehow the cat.   I'm beyond upset, when I asked my mom and my sisters dad about being compensated for these or at least being bought another set of markers of any kind, they said no, I shouldn't have been so irresponsible with them. I reminded my mom she was the one who lost my key and its her fault they were ruined, she called me an asshole and she hasn't spoken to me since. AM I THE ASSHOLE
868	1	So a very close personal friend of mine's girlfriend just got busted cheating. She had been texting a guy a couple states over for months, telling him she loved him, wanted to be with him, etc. All while hiding it from my friend, who we will call Jim.  When forced to confess to Jim because she had been caught, girlfriend instead lied to try and lighten the severity of her actions, to the point where we just said fuck it, and sent Jim the proof/whole story ourselves.  Despite a long, difficult relationship of contempt that led up to this, Jim and Girlfriend both don't know how to be alone, and use eachother to avoid that. As a result, Jim has more or less taken her back for this (not official yet, but they are keeping in touch heavily and spending time together every day).  However, my friends and I feel as though he forgave her much too easily, and we do not forgive her ourselves for what she did to our friend. As a result, despite Jim staying with her, the rest of us don't want to spend time with her anymore.  AITA? Should we forgive girlfriend just as easily as Jim, because it's his decision? Or is Jim being too naive? Jim has sent girlfriend the message that she can do this and get away with it, and with how much she lied even after being caught, I have no doubt this isn't the last of it.
583	1	Notice the quotation marks, since those are Sarah's (my girlfriend) words, not mine.  So, I'm a competitive swimmer, and recently some kids at my school have started a water polo team, and asked me to join. I said sure, since all my clubs (FBLA, Investing Club, DECA) ended a few weeks ago. It's not too serious as of now, and is more of just a fun thing, I guess. For example, a lot of guys are just wearing normal swim trunks, and a lot of girls are just wearing bikinis, even though that's not the official uniform.  And that's where the problem comes in. Sarah is a bit insecure of this, and doesn't like that I'm spending every day after school playing water polo with a bunch of fit, half-naked girls.   So she asked me to quit. I just said I'm not going to, for a few reasons:  1) Water polo is really fun   2) I need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.  3) Her demands are ridiculous and I don't think she should control what I can or can't do because of her jealousy. I don't tell her, for example, not to hang out with her guy friends. So I don't see why should be able to order me around.   I feel like both of us just can't see the other side's logic, so aita?
138	2	Sometimes when I'm putting my daughter to bed (an hour before my son goes to bed) I'll stay upstairs in her room for the hour even after she falls asleep. My husband and son don't get a lot of one on one time due to his job and the new baby. I can hear the laughter and all the fun they're having and I don't want to interrupt. Then when it's his bedtime I'll give him a kiss goodnight and tell my husband she was struggling to fall asleep.   Edit: wow, thank you kind stranger for the gold! Thank you all for your lovely comments 💜 I never expected this type of response! I just wanted to share my little secret with someone.
