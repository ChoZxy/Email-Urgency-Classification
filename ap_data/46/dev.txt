802	3	This happened last Tuesday. I was recovering from surgery and had a few days in the hospital. Luckily I had my phone with me and a 10 foot charge cord, so once I was conscious again I plugged my phone into the outlet next to the IV stand/vitals monitor and got to work catching up on some Netflix shows.  A while later the nurse walks in, asks how I’m doing, starts to check my vitals...and she gasps and turns deathly pale. She screams “Patrice!!!” at the top of her lungs, and another nurse comes running in. The first nurse (I don’t remember her name, sorry) explains to Patrice that there is a bunch of blood in my saline IV line and that I am not getting my fluids and she doesn’t know how this could happen!  Patrice realizes that the “IV line full of blood” is actually my charge cord, which happens to be dark red in color. Patrice told me very sternly that I am NOT ALLOWED to use the outlets meant for medical equipment, and then showed me where the outlets meant for personal use were located in the room. And the first nurse suggested that next time I have surgery, perhaps I would consider bringing a different color cord with me to the recovery room.  TL:DR used a red charge cord at the hospital and the nurse thought my saline IV had filled with blood.
793	1	My parents keep trying to get me to go to my sister's wedding where I am not really close with her and her fiancé was/is a nightmare. They are physically/verbally abusive to each other and they've even brought each other to court over fights when they break each other's things.   I'm about 8hr away from them but my only interaction is hearing mother scream at them over the phone at 3am when they (my parents) visit and they're staying with me.   They are mutually shitty to each other and I told my mother I'd go to my sister's next wedding. I just don't want to deal with the drama and headache for something I don't really support. I'm not close with her and I'll send her a card, but I'm really not keen on spending 1k just to fly there (wife and I).
859	3	I'm a telecommunications engineer and I have a little business dedicated to install network solutions in small businesses and corporate buildings.  I live in a 4th floor of an apartment complex and today I received a package containing like 10 antennas to install this week. When I call for the elevator, a teenage neighbor was already waiting and we engaged in a little small talk. I met this boy when he was little, but since I graduated college and started to work we haven't talked much, but I remembered his name is Emmanuel. Then he asked about my package and I was explaining him what do I do for a living and what are this antennas for.  Since all the conspiracy theories about radio frequency, I told a joke about the wifi saying "They will have a wifi so powerful, they will have cancer within a week". He just smiled and say nothing while we arrived to my floor and I said goodbye.  Then I remembered: my mom once told me that a nurse living in 7th floor was diagnosed cancer a few months ago and she has a teenage son. I wasn't sure that this boy was the same so I called her to ask the son's name. "I think his name is Emmanuel"...  tl;dr: I told a joke about cancer to the son of a cancer patient.
612	3	Theres a nice little corner in our union (a hub like building) on my college campus where I go to study inbetween classes, but more often, outright sleeping on the comfy chairs there and getting absolutely fuck all done, which was today's case.  Also, I get sleep paralysis very often since I enter REM sleep very quick. I'm so used to it by now and it usually only happens when I take long naps during the day. My solution is usually to either wait it out or act out like I'm "screaming" to make my body controllable again. I dunno, it works, even though I don't actually scream.  So I wake up from this scholarly nap, but I can't move or see, only hear other people talking and moving around. Suddenly, I hear one of them mention the time, "11:24"...**Shit, I have class in 6 minutes and it's nowhere near the union...**  Not waiting this shit out, I act out my usual silent battle cry of slumber, but what came out was a fully fledged "NYAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!", echoing through the entire building. I'm instantly woke up completely now, and I see a girl fling her coffee behind me to the floor, with a room full of people staring at me wondering what the fuck is going on. I bailed the hell out of there...   TL:DR Fell asleep in public, and dragonborn'd the shit out of a girl's coffee.  Update: Seeing my post explode this morning literally cured my hangover.
47	3	I feel fucking terrible. We are super tight this month because my father is quite sick and has to move in with us. Meaning he is flying 9000 miles to my husbands country to remain here for the rest of his life. We recently moved into our house and we have been trying to make it feel like a ‘home’. Unfortunately, it is left us with very little at the end of the month. Let me get more to the point now...  I’m so fucking desperate. We ran out of eggs days ago and finished all the cereal this morning. I’ve had to feed my family plain noodles for a few days. The only place that would deliver is an Italian restaurant over here. I’m starving (early pregnancy), my daughter is hungry, my son isn’t getting enough milk since I’m producing less due to not eating much and my husband is acting like he’s not hungry so I won’t worry.  I got us proper food using my grandmothers bank card...I tried to stay away from things that were more wants. We need vegetables and some form of protein for God’s sake.   I called her and basically threw myself on her mercy. I feel like a failure as a parent. She of course had no issue since she is quite well off. She knows that we all need to eat and would never hold it against me. It’s just the principle of the matter. I know it won’t be like this all the time. I just feel some serious shame over this.  I really needed to get this off of my chest. For those who may give me a little bit of tough love, believe me I already know. I’m trying to remedy the situation so it doesn’t happen again. Also, this country is different from mine so I am having a harder time navigating things. Thanks for reading.
883	3	Here's the standard, "this was quite some time ago" qualifier. I just thought it was funny and I should finally share on my cake day.  So I met this girl on Bumble and before I even picked her up I got into a fender bender and almost canceled the date. In retrospect I should have. Anyway, we go out and have a great time. She comes over to my place afterwards and one thing leads to another and well...you get the point...and so did she OW!   Anyway...so I'm kind of a lazy person in that as long as things are not broken I'll just leave them be. I'd been renting this place and for awhile there was this rotting ring around my toilet forming. I later found out it was a leak that was rotting the wood around it. The toilet would wobble sometimes when I sat on it, but I had a system (yes I'm terrible). Well anyway after we finish up she gets up to use the restroom. Now I'm in cloud 9 so I don't think about my flimsy toilet when she goes in there. Big mistake.   As I'm laying down the next thing I hear is a loud scream and, "help!" I go to the door and knock and then I enter and I see this girl, naked, on her knees holding up my toilet, water spilling everywhere looking mortified. She says, "It just tipped over. I dont know what happened." I'm trying real hard not to laugh as I help her balance it back upright. I explain what happened and she laughs it off a bit too, but then I take her home cause you know, she still has to go and...then I never saw her again. I dont know why :P I ended up having to call my landlord to fix it and I learned my lesson after that.   tl;dr- Didn't fix a wobbly toilet and my date knocked it over costing me future dates.
284	3	Over the course of the last week twin 7 year old sons started telling me about a creepy man who sat it the parking lot at school and stared at them.  This morning, I finally took the initiative and called the school.  They assured me that the situation would be handled.  Now, here's how stupid I apparently am: I've been doing electrical repairs on a facility near my sons' school, and each day I park my work van in the school parking lot to eat lunch and use the WiFi.  I wave to my sons as they go from one building to the building housing the cafeteria for lunch.    If you're realizing that I'm the "pervert" I reported, congratulations, you're officially sharper than me.  I didn't realize it until 3 police cars surrounded my work van.  As it turns out, between the work van they'd never seen me in, my hardhat, and my sunglasses, the boys never realized it was me.  After about a 30 minute conversation with the police and the principal, they decided I was a harmless moron and decided to let me go.  I was, however, asked not to park my van there for lunch anymore.  TL/DR: Called school over "pervert" watching my sons, turns out it was me the whole time. Was nearly arrested.
469	3	My girlfriend and I have lived together for a year. I usually don’t have time to go home during lunch so I eat at work, but yesterday I had an extra hour so I went home during my lunch. I was wearing my headphones and cooking. Suddenly I felt someone behind me. I spun around with my elbow out and while I was mid spin it dawned on me that my girlfriend eats lunch at home every day, but I realized too late and elbowed her in the face. Thankfully her nose isn’t broken but she has 2 black eyes.  The real kicker is that I was planning to propose this weekend and had everything set up, but now I need to postpone because I don’t want her to be reminded of the time I clocked her in the face every time we look at our proposal pictures.  Tl;dr went home for lunch, forgot my girlfriend would be home, elbowed her and gave her 2 shiners, now I have to postpone my proposal
977	1	So I just broke up with my boyfriend for multiple different reasons including communication and lack of romance in the relationship. Below are some examples of why I broke up with him. To clarify, I have spoken to him about these issues before and it doesn't seem to have changed.   Reasons for breaking up:  1) due to the fact that his family is another race, they speak their primary language which i don't understand. However, he doesn't bother translating during conversations either for me.    2) when my country went into lockdown, we couldn't see each other for a good 3 months, in which we only video called each other approximately 5 times  3) I've spoken to him about keeping the romance alive, I wasn't expecting any grand gestures and flowers or what, I'm just expecting maybe a small written letter or note mailed to me just to show he's interested in me or that he still loves me.  Generally it just seemed that maybe he wasn't interested in me anymore so I just broke it off. So people of r/AmItheButtface, AITB?
660	1	My ex husband (Paul) and I have three kids together. Since splitting we have both found new partners and he has had another child (Ollie) with his new partner (Becky). My children spend every other weekend at their dad's. My daughter is about to turn 13 shortly and it falls on Paul's weekend. Ollie and my daughter have a 11 year age gap and Ollie was born the day after my daughters birthday. We hoped that as the two children were born on different days that there would be no problems. The whole family made running jokes through Becky's pregnancy about her crossing her legs tightly for my daughter birthday as her due date was so close.   Paul and Becky have decided to have a birthday party for Ollie on my daughters birthday and also celebrate hers on the same day. My daughter was very unhappy that she will turn 13 and has to go to a toddlers party and asked to stay home that weekend and have a sleepover with her friends instead.   I have contacted Paul to see if this is OK and he had a go at me for messing with the plans.   AITA for expecting him to accept his 13 year old daughter wants her birthday to be about her? Ollie is so young he doesn't know the date so surely his party can be any other day?   Thanks for reading.
578	2	While my boyfriend and I were walking to drop me off at my yoga class we made plans to meet right after it (he said if he feels well). After yoga ended one of the girls in my class brought out cake so I told my boyfriend I'd be a little late and to not head out yet. He seemed alright with this. After a little bit I told him I'd be heading out soon. The girl brought out more stuff for us so it took us a bit longer. 20 minutes later he messages me to ask if I've headed out yet. I told him no and that I'd head out soon. About 30 minutes later it was over and I told him I headed out. He didn't respond or see the message so I walked 5 minutes to his place and sent him another one.  I told him I was there, and he asked what for because we didn't really confirm it. He told me he was tired and annoyed that I was over an hour late so he didn't feel well enough to go. We fought a bit, I told him to fuck off, and he's been ignoring that message for 30 minutes now.
303	2	This just happened an hour ago.    So, my insurance started requiring its customers to go in for annual checkups.  After going back and forth with my agent and figuring out what needed to be done, I set up an appointment.    The doctor goes over a few basic questions (medicines, current issues, treatment plans).  He then says, "Alright I just gotta give you a quick physical, and you can get out of here."  Now an important tidbit of information here: I have only ever heard the term "physical" be used as it pertains to athletics i.e. "turn your head and cough."  So he turns to read over the paperwork they sent him and grab his little flashlight and knee-knocker thingy.  Unbeknownst to this poor, innocent gentleman, I have unbuckled my belt, lowered my jeans to my knees, and am two seconds away from dropping trow.  Luckily, he turns around just in time to see me there, pants down with my hands on my boxers.  Eyes wide in shock and confusion, he simply asks "Why are you taking your clothes off?"  Dread creeping over me, I reply, "Didn't you say you needed to do a physical?"  He briefly explains what he's gonna do while I am quickly and embarrassingly pulling up my pants and then going "Sorry.  Oh my gosh I am so sorry.  Sorry I've only ever heard of athletic physicals."  I continued to apologize throughout the physical, but the fact that I couldn't stop laughing probably didn't help my case.  Tl;Dr - Thought doc wanted to touch my nuts; he respectfully declined.  (edited for spelling &amp; grammar)
828	3	So me and my friend have known each other since we were 5 years old (now we’re 17). So 2 years ago I was playing Minecraft on a survival server while my friend was offline, I was building a nether portal under the house and a zombie spawned from an unlit area, I took out my sword and started swinging, just as I started swinging, my friends dog jumped In front and got 1 shotted. I was panicking that my friend would find out. So I made a grave out in the front yard and had a sign that said “Here lies dodo after a brave fight with a skeleton” My friend came online and saw the sign, I get so guilty that I never told him it was me. And after 2 years he still thinks it was a Skeleton.
274	1	My wife is 24, I’m 26 and we have a 2 year old daughter and she is pregnant with our second.  She is Chinese, immigrated to here when she was 5. She can speak Mandarin fluently. She can also speak English and French fluently.  I am white and I can speak French (mother tongue) and English. She wants our daughter to learn Chinese, however, our daughter is already learning both French and English. I don’t think that learning Chinese would be very useful in a Western country, especially since we don’t live in a place with many Chinese people.  She is concerned that our children will not be “in touch” with their Chinese background. But she is not very in touch either and I think we should just let it go.  She says its unfair how our daughter is learning French but not Chinese. I say its because French is more useful around the world. She says Im being narrow minded.   AITA for wanting our children to not learn Chinese??
84	3	TIFU On Saturday I bought my wife a bouquet of lilies for our wedding anniversary, not knowing that lilies are extremely toxic to cats.  Well our cats chew on a couple leafs and I think nothing of it. They check out the flowers I get her every year, except I normally get her a bunch of roses.  My wife gets home and sees the lilies, instantly panicking (knowing our serial plant chewing cats must have already had a go at them) and goes into a frenzy calling an emergency vet and running to find the cats travel crates all the while trying to explain just how toxic lilies are to cats.  Our cats are doing fine now, but the whole ordeal ruined our anniversary plans and we spent the rest of the evening at the vet clinic getting them treated for lily poisoning.  Anyways, that’s how a bouquet of flowers ended up costing me $1k in vet bills. I hope others read this and spread the word on how dangerous these flowers are to your cats.  TL;DR I ruined my wedding anniversary by accidentally poisoning our cats
580	2	For the last year I’ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons.    About a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don’t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I’ve gone I’ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it’s been free.   I’m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?
230	1	[No Regrets]  I don't know how many there are, and I don't remember where they are hidden.   It started so small. It was a simple prank. There is a briefing on the bulletin board that has been hanging there from a thumb tack for as long as I've worked here. It's meant to be very important, but I have never seen anyone so much as glance at it. It's maybe ten pages, so it took it down, removed the staple, placed [this photograph](https://goo.gl/images/l7M6qT) between its pages, and put it back together again. To this day, no one has noticed.   So I decided to keep doing it. Every now and then, when it's slow or everyone is away at a conference, I'll hide another one. I know for sure that there is one behind the calendar, and another taped to the back of a bookcase. There's a few in the conference room, I'm sure, and in the copy room and kitchenette. I think there's at least one in the director's office, though, if there isn't, that will soon be remedied.   I plan to leave this job in a few months. I will tell no one when I leave, and I plan to hide many, many more before I go.
805	2	So some days I spend hours on my online game helping random people for no reason. I tell them that I have nothing better to do, when in reality I'm trying to make a friend because I don't have any irl. It's pathetic lol
585	1	A little backstory.... my boyfriends best friend is my best friends boyfriend. My best friend and I are Disney FANATICS. Like anything Disney we are obsessed with. We were raised like that since our parents love Disney too. For years I have said I want to spend my 21st birthday in Disney and that’s in August 2019. She and I both asked our boyfriends if they would come and we could have a great couples trip and they both said yes! However, we planned the trip on Monday and we’re SO excited but when we hit them with the price they didn’t want to spend the money which is fine! We both told them it was okay but to just know that we’re still going to go. (We both will drop anything and everything for them and it’s honestly not really reciprocated. We both decided recently that we’re not letting them hold us back so if we want to do something we’re going to do it and they’re not used to it.) long story short, they BOTH were not expecting us to still go if they said no. We booked the trip together Tuesday and they didn’t realize how serious we were now they’re both mad and my boyfriend is giving me a hard time saying I don’t care about traveling with him and blah blah blah. That’s not it! He said he didn’t want to go! I’ve wanted to spend my 21st there forever and I’m gonna do it. I shouldn’t be made the bad guy for wanting to live my life and be happy.
714	3	So this fuck up started over 4 years ago.  When I got out of the navy I landed a new good paying job. With this job they had direct deposit, so I got a new bank from the one I had in the military.  I set up the direct deposit to my main bank and I was thinking to myself "hey I'm going to get paid good I'll set up a direct deposit of $200 a month to my old bank and forget about it." I forgot about it.  Fast forward 4 and half years. Me and my wife are trying to get our house repaired and up to standards to sell. We got some bids to do the flooring and paint the house. The bids ce back between $8000 and $12000. We didnt know what we were going to do.  So I decided I can try to tackle the flooring by myself. While I was beating on the tile to get it up it occured to me "hey I put money in my old account we can use that.   I log in online and the account only had $5. That's not right let me refresh. $5. O no. Ok ok dont freak out. I'll call the bank and see what's up.  "No sir we dont have any transactions from you for about 5 years."  So I'm freaking out. I log onto the company site and see I have the routing number check. Account number wrong. FUCK.  so i gave a complete stranger $100 twice a month for 4 and a half years.   So if you are out there i hope you used it wisely.   TLDR: messed up my account number and gave someone else about $10000 over the course of 4 and half years.
740	1	I registered a company, bought all the take-away boxes from Amazon, signed up for a few delivery apps, made a few social media acounts and printed leaflets that I drop in mailboxes. I re-sell microwave meals...On some meals I add something to make them look better, like cheese. So far it’s at around £200 a day in revenue.   Nobody suspects a thing, soon someone will come for higene inspection, but I’ll pass that check without any problems. It’s not illegal to operate out of your own kitchen.  Should I feel bad? I feel kind of proud to be fair and free as a bird from the 9-5 life.
911	3	Hiiiiiiii! I'm Hazel and I fucked up pretty badly today.  Basically I got a call from work asking why am I skipping my very first shift, and I was super confused and I told them that I'm not scheduled for today. In which they replied that yes I am.  I pulled up my schedule, clicked "next week" and yeah,  sure enough. I'm scheduled for today.  For those wondering, this is posted on a Saturday. Apparently the store I work with, schedules their work weeks starting on Saturdays. So I never saw it. I have Sundays off so I thought I was ok.  The problem is. I chose this weekend to spend time with family, and I'm over 2 hours away from work so I absolutely cannot come in.  I feel so bad. This was my first non-training shift and I completely missed it. When I pulled up the schedule the other day, I assumed the week ended on Saturday, so I saw nothing (which was really Friday) and thought I was good.  WHO THE HELL SCHEDULES WITH SATURDAY AS THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS  So yeah I feel like shit because I've worked really hard to get this job and if I lose it because of something as stupid as this I don't know what I'm going to do.  TL;DR Basically I misread my schedule at my very first job and I'm scared I'm going to lose my job because of it.
118	3	I’ve been with him for roughly a month and I knew he spoke welsh fluently but I’ve never heard him, or anyone speak Welsh.   We are driving to his house and he’s on a call with one of his friends so I’m just sat on my phone, relaxing, enjoying the hills. Well, he suddenly starts speaking welsh and flinging his arms around, apparently having some sort of an argument. Ive never heard welsh before and tbh, it sounded more like lots of slurring.   I legitimately thought he was having a stroke so I grabbed the steering wheel, he did the exact same thing but in the opposite direction, he out strengthed me, we span around on the rode and came to a stop.    He was so confused as to why I randomly grabbed the wheel. I explained the situation and now his welsh family and friends are having a great laugh at my mono-language self.  TL;DR   Boyfriend randomly started speaking in welsh, I thought he was having a stroke, I grabbed the steering wheel and we span out
350	1	Hey there Reddit,  Every Friday my (18M) family likes to get together for a meal and I usually cook it. My brother, Cody 24M got himself a girlfriend, Kimberly 23F.   Cody told me the day before that Kimberly can't have much salt in her food. Alright, I asked to use his phone to confirm with her. She told me that was the only dietary restriction or allergen she has.   Here comes the dinner, and we had some spaghetti and meatballs and some stir fried veggies. She asked if the noodles had gluten, which I assumed they did. She then pushed the plate forward and pouted, not eating anything. She told Cody that she told me straight up she can't have gluten, and I must have deleted the message on his phone.  OK, no salt and gluten. The next dinners she suddenly is allergic and can't eat stuff that is inside of the food. Cody asked her when she can't eat these things and she just says that "I'm your girlfriend how do you not know?"  Last dinner she was now allergic to the light garlic in the grilled chicken and asparagus I made, claiming it makes her vision go blurry. Cody confronted her, telling her that she ate garlic knots and eggs in the morning with garlic in it. She then suddenly couldn't see and begged to go to the hospital, causing a scene.   My mom basically tore into me, how dare I send her to the hospital and the doctors said nothing was wrong.   I'm fine with editing a meal to follow one's restrictions, but it seems like she's pulling out different things she can't eat, even to Cody's surprise. She eats sandwich bread and other bread just fine, but refused to eat the spaghetti for her no-gluten restriction.  WIBTA for not cooking for her anymore?
719	2	Basically a friend told me he was on a dating site and I didn’t want to tell him that she told me as she was a good friend of his and I didn’t want to stir between them. So I created a fake account, talked to him. He told the catfish he was single, then as the catfish I told him I was actually a catfish, and that I knew who he was and I was going to tell his partner that he was on these sites. He begged the catfish not to tell me and swore he would delete his profile.   I told him that she had made contact with me and sent me screenshots, he was so apologetic. Went to counseling and never strayed again.  However the other day he told me he has a theory about who the catfish was, and it’s his friend who told me about the site in the first place. He told me he doesn’t trust her anymore and thinks it is her as he had came across her profile on there. It’s now 3 years later and it’s far too late to come clean so AITA?
151	1	Nothing too juicy just fun.  We had this vending machine in our common room, and my school stocked them pretty well. Not just the typical lays and pretzels. And all of my friends pretty much lived on my floor so we practically owned that room.  The machines were jank and would sometimes take your money, and the only way they would refund you is If you mailed in a written request, then received 4 quarters in the mail like a month or 4 later.   I joked about how we should just bust it open to get our money's worth, and that's when I noticed a small hole at the top of the machine, barely big enough for a headphone jack.   I get my friend to go to his room and get his drill. We have lookouts in the hall, one in the elevator, and go to work. I make the hole wide enough for a coat hanger, which I then fashioned into a hook. I used a dremel to sharpen the end enough that it would easily pierce bags If you got the leverage just right.   We taped the hook to the bottom of the machine and told maybe 8 guys about the trick and proceeded to eat snacks for free whenever we wanted, which as college freshman was damn near always.   The machines stole so much and my school management is such a shitshow they never did anything about it. I assumed they just counted revenue from all the machines in the building or something and didnt care enough to investigate.  Good times q
390	3	I may have accidentally committed a felony today by inadvertently exposing myself to a teenage boy.   I recently had a baby, and in an effort to maximize time, I often pump for breastmilk while I'm driving. Earlier today I had to pick up a Target drive-up order just as I was finishing my pumping session.  I pulled into the parking spot and clicked the "I'm here" button in the app, figuring I'd have a few minutes to get pumping wrapped up and put away. I shouldn't have underestimated Target's customer service.  Within 20 seconds a pubescent teen boy was staring at me through my drivers seat window, mere inches from my milk splattered, grotesque postpartum breasts (which could probably more accurately be described as bazoongas).   His face told an epic story only a seasoned author could conjure:    1. Confusion.    2. Skeptical confusion as he starred directly at my nipples being sucked into the transparent flanges like a profane cow   3. Horror   4. Massive embarrassment.     I have a feeling he will be conjuring this story to a therapist someday.  TL:DR: I didn't get my pumping session wrapped up soon enough and flashed a teenage Target employee with my milk producing bazoongas.
75	2	 Basically I went out with this girl(Missy) and we really clicked a lot. We had an awesome time on our first 4 dates. We had made plans to go get sushi on my birthday(her idea) since she never had it. Texted her before I left and she said "I'll meet you there soon". Que me sitting there alone on my B day eating alone.    She ended up becoming good friends with my buddys gf(unknown to me) and I ran into her at her birthday party at the bar and she tried to hug me. I just side stepped her and brushed right past her without acknowledging her the entire night. I even told my friend what she did and asked him to make sure he keeps her away from me.    Her and my buddys gf eventually confronted me, while wasted, asking why I'm being an asshole and won't even acknowledge Missy presence, ignore her and move seats if she sits down. After about 5 minutes of listening to them bitch &amp; insult me, I stood up and belted out a "Fuck off and fuck you both, this is the girl who ghosted me after 4 dates and left me sitting alone on my birthday after saying she'll be here soon!" and  I left with 3 of our friends.    Now my buddy, his gf, missy and a few other friends in our group think I acted irrational and ruined her bday party. They want me to apologize to them and Missy. As well as they want me to be friends with Missy as well because she's moving in with them in a few months.    TL;DR: Girl ghosted me on 5th date after saying on my way. Run into her at friends party and ignore her, Girl and friend rant and insult till I out girls shitty actions along with a hearty "fuck you" and left.
417	2	Hello redditors  Me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a "milestone" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.   So I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.  So she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..  AITA for this?
41	1	Hi there, I'm 21F  And my little brother is 16M.  For a few months now, he kept asking our parents for the PS5 of course they didn't agree, so I was willing to buy him one, since I have a job and enough money.  I made a deal with him, that he had to improve his grades, at the end of the school year his grades had just improved little and weren't  good at all, which would actually be a dealbreaker, but I still bought him The PS5.  That was 2 weeks ago.  3 days ago he was on the playstation with his friends.   It was an online game were people could join, so apparently a girl had joined the server, and I heard my brother say : Go back to the kitchen dishwasher.   So this morning I took his PS5 and sold it in a store and got like 90% of the original price. If he wants his PS5 back he can just buy it with his savings.  In the morning when he realized I had sold it,he got pissed and said it was just a joke. My parents also said that I overreacted, but I don't think so, since it's not the first time he did sexist jokes like that,he actually does it quite often. I'd say he deserves it. And plus he can still play on his old PS4  Btw my English isn't that good, It's not my native language.
725	1	I told my friend I lost my phone because I don’t want to hear about him talk about his girlfriend and his baby to be born every time we talk. The conversation never changes.
685	1	I always downvote anything where the answer is exceedingly obvious and the person is looking for validation. The posts are usually along the lines of:  “AITA for wanting to be his friend??”  “AITA for leaving my abusive boyfriend??”  “AITA for being upset when she insulted me??”  I only upvote posts if they could potentially spark a debate. Otherwise it’s no fun to me to use this sub. AITA? I’m sure they’re well meaning people, but...sometimes I have to roll my eyes at these kinds of posts lol
801	3	I went on a business trip to China two weeks ago and a client invited me to go on a trip to Xishuangbanna Tropical Forest. Long story short, we decided to camp there for several days and discuss business strategies to recruit some firms into our agency.   Cue night time. I decided to take short walk outside our  base camp, and I found what I thought was a white dead-nettle flower patch. I thought to myself: "well I be damned, this grows in China?" As a tea lover, I thought it would make great tea for the night so I went back and brewed some, drank some, and went to bed.  Cue morning. I woke up with puffy eyes, itchy patchy skin, and an inflamed throat. At that point I knew I fucked up. The face of my client was indescribable; a mix of disgust like I fucked his wife, horror like I drank his sake, and hilarity. I immediately showed him the remains of what was brewed and said that I picked what the locals called "white leopard bush" which when injested is poisonous.   With everything considered, he said in the quantities that I've used, you wouldn't experience very serious side-effects (i.e. death)   Proof NSFW: https://i.imgur.com/LKY5yXC.png  TLDR; brewed tea out of an unknown plant and got covered in very itchy and blistery rash.
594	1	My classmate recently made a tiktok and she showed a group of people at lunch time it. They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say "hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out" and in it she explains how she "rescued" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free.   I was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said "you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen" her friend says "well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her.   They say that I'm a bully and walk away. I later get called into the principal's office who told me I was expected to apologize, and I said no, I stand by what I said. Fuck ignorant people who destroy the environment. My parents were called over and I got sent home and my parents are pissed I refused to apologize. I might get suspended.
669	1	I'm working part-time in a shop, and it's okay. A job I suppose. I get on with people easy and I do my job well enough. The only thing that seems to really make someone's day is when I ask women (30s to 40s) for ID. If they say "I'm (insert age over 30)" I just tell them I have to if I think they are 25 or under. Seems to really make them smile.   I can't do much to make people smile, and I wanna let people know I can at least do this. [Light]
501	1	The past few months I’ve absolutely hated my job. I’ve asked multiple times to be moved to the back area (kitchen) but management have put everyone else in there but me. So tonight I changed my tune, and I gave almost every customer that was nice to me tonight at work free food or made their ice-cream/sundae/milkshake really freaking good, and I don’t regret it. Cameras picked up everything but I doubt they’d even watch it. I’m pretty high up there but I’m so sick of them not listening. We were understaffed as hell for a Tuesday night and I was doing four things at once but like a little manners goes a long way at Maccas. Pretty sure the most a customer walked away with was 2 six pack nuggets, 2 apple pies, 2 ten packs of bites, 2 cbd burgers, upsize on their fries and some sweet and sour sauce added onto their original order. It was the best shift I’ve had at that shit hole in a long, long time doing stuff completely against the rules. It makes me hope there’s a special place in hell reserved for abusive, asshole customers.
619	1	I work at a large retail chain, and we were purging the whole grocery section in the stockroom. This included getting rid of things that weren't sold there anymore, was expired, or otherwise unsellable. As long as it was still safe to eat, we donated it to a food bank.  So once I got to the top shelves of product, I would "accidentally" drop casepacks of food, crushing boxes so couldn't go out onto the salesfloor, and would have to be donated. If management knew, I'd definitely lose my job.
657	1	This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me. I laid on the horn and tried to block her from cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off.   Okay. I’m the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day.   I just can’t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn’t simply let this go.   AITA for this?
299	3	He says it's only a matter of time before someone leaks his name. He saw the post through an old friend of his who knew he had a micropenis and saw on his FB that he had just gotten married. He doesn't know who else the guy has told to link him to it. I feel like I am the asshole. He is crushed that I posted about him.   *update to original post: I confronted him last week about intentionally keeping this from me and he said he was sure I would leave him if I knew about the size prior to the wedding. And that he wanted to talk before the wedding but feared it being called off because of his micropenis and said if both families found out/gossiped about it he would be crushed. Which is basically what I did with the entire world via reddit, but he didn't know this until last night because I never told him that I posted on reddit when we talked.
766	2	If it makes a difference I'm male, they're both female, and we're all mid-20's. I'm a little drunk right now so sorry if I make some mistakes.   So basically I had feelings for Friend 1 for like a year and a half. Pretty sure she knew how I felt, but when I asked her if she wanted to try going on a second date (we'd been on one before) she said she just wanted to stay friends. I told her I'd need space but we could maybe be friends in the future.  The next day I asked out a mutual friend, who me and friend 1 met roughly six months ago. I've liked her for a while but I wanted to see how things went with friend 1 first. I like them pretty much equally. I knew mutual friend and friend 1 were friends, but I wasn't sure how close they were. But friend 1 wasn't interested in me, so I didn't think it would be an issue.  Now friend 1 is pissed, and I'm not sure about our mutual friend because she said she was "conflicted" (she thought me and friend 1 were dating, I told her we weren't) and I haven't seen her since.  [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/6icee) the text conversation I had with friend 1. The context is that I asked if we could meet up to talk. We work together but I told her I didn't want to be friends anymore and I just wanted to clear things up.  Did I fuck up or is my friend overreacting?
349	1	Title says it all. I was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. We had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every Saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. I was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. One day, she was up to her usual Saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much...  They were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. I quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. Ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn’t find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. He was having none of it stating it wasn’t the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. The woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. We never saw her again.
347	1	I (M) am in a 5 year relationship that slowly seems to be dying sporadically.   She went off to hang out with her friend last Friday for the whole evening then spent the evening Saturday with her friends dog after we've constantly communicated that I'd like to spend some meaningful time with her over the weekends since we both have weekends off.   This is the second weekend in a row she's spent with her friend and instead of laying in bed alone I decided "fuck it, I'm gonna have a good time by myself, go to concerts and dance a little." Well, that turned into clubbing by myself, and dancing by myself in a sea of beautiful costumed people.   I had a great fucking time, didn't grind on one girl, and busted all the moves I wanted.   We're taking moon walk, spinning around, and dropping it like it's hot, twerking on the bar, all the moves.   Slowly and surely getting into enjoying myself more and more. If she wants to show up, cool. Otherwise, I'm off to the dance floor and enjoying live music without your ass.
377	1	tldr at the bottom  17 years ago I passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn't care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, "it's your mom's for her glaucoma". Whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.  &amp;#x200B;  I was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can't remember what someone said but I replied with, "yeah, because mom has glaucoma" and my mom goes, "I don't have glaucoma" and I, incredulously, said "dad said you had glaucoma", in which my dad responds to with, "what the hell are you talking about, I never said that". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I'd been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.  &amp;#x200B;  tldr: I found my parent's weed stash when I was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, I believed them for almost 2 decades.
779	3	Ok. So my fuck up actually happened yesterday evening.  I was makiing some hamburgers to go on the barbecue. When I'm making burgers it's quite the process. So here I am, all my ingredients are out, I'm making my burgers. In go the onions, in goes the hot peppers.   Burgers go on the grill, so I start cleanup. The peppers I have are finely chopped peppers from my garden last year. When I'm putting them away I notice a piece of onion had fallen into the Tupperware with  my peppers and left a moist spot.   Here's my fuck up. I decide to toss the dried pepper flakes in *microwave* for 30 seconds to dry, while I put other stuff away. I look back with 7 seconds left on the timer and the microwave is **full** of *thick* smoke, and my peppers were on fire!. I opened the microwave, released this pepper bomb into my kitchen.   Within seconds I'm coughing uncontrollably and yelling at my fiancee to get the dogs out of the house. We couldn't go back in for over an hour and we both were coughing for about 15 minutes. It felt like I had sniffed peppers, and inhaled them. Like pepper burn... on your lungs..  Tl;Dr Burning hot peppers create harmful fumes. Do not microwave.
741	1	As the title says- In seventh grade, I excused myself from PE to go to the bathroom. While down there, I took the flip-phone of a girl who was bullying me from the locker room, and, without thinking about it, I broke it clean in half at the joint. Then, I just put it back in her shoe, put the bookbag that was on the shelf above on top of it as if it had fallen down, washed my hands, went back to class, and pretended to be shocked when she found it and flipped out.  She suspected foul play and tried to blame me for it (I had been the only one to go to the bathroom that day), but with my reputation of being quiet and mild-mannered (and being a hell of a teacher's pet), nobody, no teacher or student,  would believe her over me.  Sometimes, when I think about it even now that \~12 years have passed, I still feel vindicated. Now I know it was likely her parents who needed to pay for it, but with the kinda shit she used to pull, at the time I thought she deserved it in full.
810	2	It actually happened around a year ago before all the current lockdowns started. In my country brothels are legal, you can go choose any girl you want and have sex for money. About a year ago me ( male) and 2 other friends (both males) decided to meet up for a few beers and a few beers turned into binge drinking. After we got drunk we felt so horny and decided to go to the brothel for some sex. 3 of us took a girl and went into seperate rooms. After around 20 minutes I was done and went outside to see one my friend already waiting for me, we asked about the third friend and the brothel manager said that that guy paid extra to extend his time ( you pay for each 30 minutes). So we decided to sit down and wait for the other friend to finish. We sat down on the sofa, where there were around 20-30 girls sitting and waiting for their clients. We didnt realize that part of the brothel was only for escorts and clients usually sat in the other room. After a few minutes 3 guys walked in, all looked very high on something  they started check the girls, one of them looks at me and tells the manager "I want this one". Manager tried to explain that I was a client, not an escort but the guy didnt want to understand. There was a  full argument about this and the security had to come and took the guys outside.    TL;DR i sat on the wrong place and people thought that I was an escorts
923	1	I’m unsure if this is rude and/or ridiculous, so Reddit can be the judge.   My friend, L, very adamant about saving herself until marriage. (we are both 21F.) It wasn’t even just for her, she would shame and side eye people who weren’t married and sleeping together, even one of our mutual friends. She wholeheartedly believed that was a sin, as she was very religious.   However, she got boyfriend, and they ended up sleeping together, told me that herself. (Edit: she told me he took her virginity.) One thing led to another and they broke up amicably.   After that, we were hanging out and she went off on a tangent saying, “girls need to respect themselves and not sleep around, that’s what husbands are for.”  Me: “Does that make you one of those girls?”  L: “What are you talking about?”  Me: “I mean, you had sex.”  I explain that is doesn’t have to be shameful and she can just not do it again until she’s married if she pleases. She seemed to be in disbelief that she’s not a virgin anymore. She also seemed upset that I mentioned that to her.   I mean we’re 21, I hope she knows what sex is.   AITA for pointing this out?  EDIT: Oh wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up, haha. I do have one thing to say, when my friend says “sleeps around” also she believes any girl in a relationship that’s having sex is also sleeping around, because she is being unfaithful to her future husband. That was poor wording on my part, I was reusing her words, though. :)
275	3	So I guess this is a bit of a change from your normal TIFU posts but I felt like sharing anyways.  So this just happened like an hour ago. I’m sure you all have heard about the “revamping” of the FaceApp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.  Anyways, so I saw someone post a picture to their Instagram and that’s how I heard about it. I knew I had to download it and try it out...because why not?  So I download the app, take a picture and set the filter.   And OMG I’m totally old lol. It’s kinda crazy, and I’m not gonna lie...I look good as an old dude.  I decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. We start comparing pics and wonder if that’s how we will really look in the years to come.  Then a thought pops into my head...  Everyone tells me I look just like my dad, and if that’s true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! So I send it away!  ...Nope.  He isn’t excited, and he isn’t laughing. He said it freaks him out.  I asked him why, and assured him it’s just a harmless filter.  What he said next broke my heart.  “I know I’ll never see you that old.”  TL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck.
960	3	I'm 23 years old. I've been going to an office every week for over a year. There's always a guy with a nice beard in the reception area. He's good for conversation if you show up before your appointment, and I'm one of those people who always shows up at least 10 minutes before the appointment.   He mentioned being single a few months back (I was going through a breakup), and I was mildly flirty in response.  About a month ago, the office owner came up to us and said "Hey, it's his birthday, he's finally legal!". I laughed, but then asked if it was really his 18th birthday. He said yes, and I congratulated him. I asked, and it turns out he wasn't an employee, he was the owner's mentee.   Last week, the actual receptionist asked if he could "take him away from me just a minute" and said "he's all yours now" when they came back. I hadn't thought about it much before because it's not like I plan to do anything with the boy, but I have been reflecting since then, and feeling more and more like a creep. I've been showing up early and joking and talking and complimenting and being complimented by someone who was still a child when we met.  I feel like I should try to switch days I show up, or make an excuse to stop going, or at least show up late so there's less risk of talking. Whatever I do, I feel incredibly sleazy, but don't know who to talk to about this. Am I a buttface?
899	1	Apologies for bad English, I am from a country in the West, learnt my English from playing online games for 6 years. :p  So 2 days ago, my son unblocked me from Facebook and added me back as a friend. I was very surprised &amp; happy at the same time. He sent me a message which said "Hi. 🙂" we talked for a hour and he told me he can't speak with me through Facebook anymore and just to download Reddit and talk through there so his mother will not see the messages. He gave me his user name and told me how to speak to him through Reddit.  I created Reddit imediatly after I saw the message and we talked for hours every day. We talked about his dream career choice, his current life, my current life.  Also learnt that his mother told him not to speak to me under any reason.  I have never been so happy in my life. I finaly have someone who I can rest my shoulder on. During those 7 years that I haven't met my ex and my son all I have been doing is abandoning myself, drinking, and just watching lots of television every single day. My life was a nightmare. This is my little confession.  Again, apologies for my bad English.
171	3	Two months ago I made a post on r/roastme after I crashed my motorcycle just to try and cheer myself up a little bit. A day after I made the post a girl direct messaged me asking how I felt, we talked for awhile, eventually I gave her my phone number and we started talking everyday. To be honest I fell in love with her, we even started taking about marriage. After a couple weeks we made plans to see each other in Florida where she lives. I've never had any sort of relationship on the internet or anything long distance, so I foolishly rushed into getting a plane ticket with very little validation that she was a real person other than pictures.   Last night I landed here, as soon as my plane touched down I snapped back into reality realizing how absolutely insane I was being. Not only did I not have a hotel reservation I didn't even have my own flight back because she promised to get both of our flights back together.    When I arrived she completely stopped responding to my calls and texts leaving me stranded at the airport. I waited for her for 4 hours until I finally took an uber to a hotel at 2 in the morning.  I'm not really sure why someone would do this but holy shit do I feel stupid.   600 dollars, 8 days of leave and 1 broken heart later I think I finally learned a lesson on trusting random people on the internet.  TL;DR Fell in love with random girl on the internet with very little proof she was real, flew 650 miles on a 1-way flight to see her, she stopped talking to me as soon as I landed.
174	1	When I was 16 I smoked weed a lot and was a troubled teenager. I was at school one day and had a bunch of weed on me. Me and my friend were gonna go sneak out at lunch and smoke, and this other guy wanted to buy some from me. That morning I told one too many people I had weed because I was dumb and thought I was cool. So someone reported me. I got called down to the office and I knew I was going to get searched because they always searched me whenever I had to go down there. Also I stunk of weed because it wasn't in a smell proof container. So anyway on the way to the office I had the weed in my shoe, went into the bathroom, got it out, put it up my sleeve and slipped it in someone's locker that they'd left open on the way past. When i got to the office they smelled the weed but because I didn't have any on me they couldn't prove it so I got off with no punishment. The funniest thing is I picked it back up on the way to lunch and it was still there. I don't think their cameras ever worked..
137	1	I (25F) have two children, my son (4) and my daughter (2). Raising two children at a young age has been really difficult, however, I was able to graduate from college with a good degree and start a career that I am happy with. Despite this, the struggle of trying to juggle the responsibility of looking after my kids and focusing on my career is stressful to say the very least. My fiancé (26) also works full time, which only compounds the issue. Up until now, my parents have been watching my children on Saturday nights so me and my fiancé can have time to ourselves. My parents are retired.  I was recently offered a promotion at work. While I enjoy my new position, it involves me working more hours, which only makes my home life more difficult. I told my parents that I'd really appreciate it if they could watch my kids on Tuesday and Thursday nights as well, so as to alleviate my stress levels. However, they refused, saying that they're doing "more than enough" by looking after my kids on a Saturday night. We had an argument after this, where my parents threatened to stop watching my kids on Saturday night. This annoyed me, and I responded by saying that if they're going to put me in a compromising position, then they're not going to come to my wedding.  We haven't spoken since, and I've had to look after my kids on Saturday night, which has been stressful for both me and my fiancé. I feel as though that since they're retired, there's nothing wrong with asking them to pull their weight more and help me out with my kids. Am I missing something?  AITA?
87	1	Obligatory happened 3 hours ago.  The post that scared me: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l21s75/tifu_dismissing_bright_red_blood_in_my_stool_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  I ignored blood in my stool even after two rounds of hemroid compound creams didn't cure it I decided to just ignore it. Well I'm browsing reddit when I read the above post. I tell myself 'that's crazy better check it out'. Well I schedule an appointment with my doctor. Clean out my intestines and go in for my endoscopy.  The nurse is trying to get me to relax and telling me I probably have roids and don't stress. They wheel me in and put me under.  I wake up and I'm very uncomfy. My tush feels like someone cut it. Well the doctor comes in and tells me he removed a very large polyp. Either pre cancerous or is cancerous (sent it to get biopsied). And my butt is stapled on the inside with metal clamps. He also thanks me for actually coming in and told me that he was glad he caught it early enough.   So thank you u/HunterxhunterFan for encouraging me to go get my butthole checked with your post.  TL;DR: Read a TIFU post that finally got me to check if I have colon cancer. Found a very large polyp. I may also have Colon Cancer. Try to be healthy to reduce your risk.
42	1	When I was 14 I volunteered at a library to help shelf books. When I couldn't find the correct spot, I would cram the books behind the existing shelf and leave them there.
67	2	My high school experience sucked bad, I had a couple regular bullies including him that basically made me dread going there every single day. But that was 8 years ago and my life has improved dramatically. I don't think about the bullying or hold any grudges. I do understand how we all do stupid and possibly cruel shit as we're kids and that we can change for the better as we mature.  However when I got his message out of nowhere on social media, I got the idea in my head that this was all about him and he only messaged me to hear a "don't worry about it man, I forgive you." so that he could feel absolved and like a good person for reaching out. I felt like this was nothing more than him trying to use me to resolve his own internal crisis of conscience. It seemed characteristic of the kid I remember from back then and I found myself feeling pretty annoyed.  I messaged him back: "High school was a long time ago, but I had to deal with the consequences of being bullied on my own. I think you should deal with the consequences of being a bully on your own and leave me out of it." He read the message and did not reply.  Thinking it over today, I wonder if I acted too hastily, read too much into the intent of his message and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Or if I was just being really petty and should have just given the guy the pat on the back he wanted, recognizing that neither of us are the same person anymore.   I don't know, so I'll leave it to you guys to judge.
241	1	I have to take pills to control my eczema, which also runs in my family, just as alcoholism. I totally made up that I can't even drink a beer or a glass of wine or that I'll get some serious side effects. Works easier than explaining the whole situation and seems to work better against getting socially pressurized into drinking.
546	3	I had a stroke that resulted in brain damage. I now have to live with my mom (I’m 32! 🙁). I’m  a very private person and I really hate when she tells people things without my permission. I understand telling her coworkers and boss because she occasionally has to stay with me when my brain is bad. But other times she will just tell a cashier or something that I have brain damage. This makes me so uncomfortable because people have preset ideas about brain damage. I told her I don’t like it and she said “Well that way they’ll know why you’re walking weird.” Honestly I could not care less what they think of me and I prefer not to mention my brain damage unless it’s absolutely necessary. I don’t want pity or those “you poor thing” looks. I appreciate all my mom has done for me but this makes me so upset. AITA?  Sorry if this is worded wrong. My brain is acting up.
969	1	Sometimes I feel people forgot we are during a pandemic. Friend came over today to hang out in my backyard 6 feet away. She and I usually smoke together but because of covid we can’t share a vape device or pass a bong. She is usually broke, sometimes she will have weed on her but she usually smokes my stuff. I don’t mind because I buy ounces.   Today she is over, I am using my vape device. I don’t have anything special for her and neither of us know how to roll. She asks me to pass her my vape and I say “umm no, not during Covid” she said “I don’t have it. Don’t worry” “it’s not about that. Sorry I can’t share now” then she asks me if she can use my bong for a quick hit. I told her I gave away my bong and one hitter stuff since I switched to vaping. Then she gets mad I don’t have a pre roll for her saying she was looking forward to smoking up all week. I’m like ?? If she wanted weed she could’ve brought some. I’m not sharing my device with her, it’s unhygienic now even though I did it pre covid.   She was over at my house. I was a host and provided her with a charcuterie platter of meats and cheeses and olives and crackers. I guess she just wanted the weed. I was telling my husband and he says even though she was acting like a child, I was rude in vaping in front of her when she couldn’t have any.   Was I the B for essentially blowing smoke in her face?
548	1	In October 2011, my older brother (23) died by suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot wound. My family later discovered that he went without food for 34 days and only intermittently drank water. To commemorate him, my younger brother and I water fast for 34 days – from September 19th until the day of his death, October 23rd. This will be the fifth year that we have done it. Although I am not sure what this accomplishes, it somehow feels right to suffer like he did.  [No Regrets]
784	1	Every year they ask us what we/the kids want for Christmas. And every year we give them specific requests from the kids and every year they completely ignore the requests and send useless items. It’s gotten to the point where we just ask them not to send us anything because we travel instead of doing a big gift giving. Last year they insisted on a list from the kids. I told them that since we were doing a big trip to Disney World, Disney gift cards would be awesome as we can do something awesome with/for the girls. What did they send? Some left over fairground stuffed animals and a slushee maker.   Now before I sound ungrateful, we would truly be fine if they didn’t send anything....the issue is 1) when we ask the kids to make Christmas lists, it creates an expectation that they will receive something and 2) when the In Laws say that they will get xx gift, we don’t get it. If we knew they weren’t getting it, we’d have gotten it from the kids instead.   This is a several year long occurrence, on top of continuing to spell my oldest daughter’s name wrong...insisting we drive 12 hours to visit them with a toddler in tow...driving through our town for camping trips but calling us weeks later to mention that they happened to pass by our exit. Yet we live too far for a visit.   Am I the Asshole for not wanting to bother to indulge them with lists from the kids?
561	1	Hi, im 20 now but this happened when i was barely 16. I met this girl on hot or not who said she wanted to “ have her way w me” so i was like “ dope im gonna get some good strange for my first time.” I decided to meet up w her on a friday night. I waited for my parents to go to sleep then snuck out my window w/ my dads keys and stole his car to meet this girl i had never met irl. I call her on my parents house phone right before i sneak out to make sure she knows im coming over( they took my cell phone at night). So i get there and guess what? She not there -_-. I drive back to the McDonalds down the road from her place and call her using the phone number i had written on my handwritten google maps directions ( again had no cell). She tells me she will be home in 30 minutes so i wait it out. I go there around 1230 am and shes waiting for me out on the porch. I walk up and i was like “ oh shit, shes alot less attractive than in her pics ,  but im already here and went thru this much shit to get here so fuck it why not. We do the thang while on the floor and two days later i got ringworm on my ass cheek. I also neglected to tell her i was a virgin till i was done smashing. Havent told anyone except my close guy friends that story.
987	1	Sorry if the title is a bit confusing. Wasn't sure what to go with.  On with the elaboration.     Anyway, I[22f] live with my parents..i don't get along with my mother really all that well. I just don't. And that's a problem I need to work on. Which is fine. But she is very very easily offended. By how i talk, how i look, what i do with my time, how i behave in regards to our religoon(it's her religion. That i don't believe in and have 0 intentions of ever telling her that.), we do not get along. We clash constantly and have for years.    One of the biggest issues is that I *hate* being touched. I don't want to be hugged. I don't want anyone to be near me. It makes me uncomfortable. There are some.people I'll tolerate it from. And my.motjer isn't one of those people. And she can't seem to get it through her head that when i say i don't want to be touched I fucking mean *do not touch me* for any reason.  And i was doing something in the kitchen and she like "playfully" kicked my butt. For some reason. And i fucking lost it. Yelled that i didn't want to be around her and went to my room. And she did not apologize. She yelled at me and defended herself saying she was just playing around and that im an adult and should just play back. Like, I don't like being touched. I don't want to be touched. And no one respect that. So am i the buttface for throwing a fit over something kinda trivial?
99	1	The title says it all. When I asked around about adult education, and asked my parents opinion, they said it's a waste of time and money. They can be very... judgmental. They have no education and 'they turned out fine', that kind of thinking. I was very upset, but I really wanted to study psychology and help people. So I started a study without anyone knowing. In my country education is very affordable, so I didn't have financial problems. I failed a lot, and it wasn't easy, but after 7 long years I can finally say that I'm graduating. But I can't say it. Not yet. I'll tell them when I'm actually working, so I have solid proof it wasn't a waste. It's very hard, and I know they'll be upset, but I really don't need to be dragged down now I'm almost there. I see them every week, and I have lied to their faces for 7 years straight, another few months won't make it worse. I need to tell someone though, so here I am. I'm not completely sure if this belongs here, but I don't know where else to put it
971	2	So for context, there’s this girl who likes me, but I don’t. She asks me everyday to ‘reconsider’ and ‘think about it’. She came up to my locker and did the same thing today, but today was different. I told her ‘Can you just move on? I’m not interested.’ Then she said, ‘I’m never gonna move on, and I’m not giving up.’ Then I just snapped. ‘No means NO! Now will you just leave me ALONE!’ I yelled really loud and all her friends could hear. I walked away and shortly after, blocked her cell. My friends said I made the right decision, but I don’t know. Was I too hard on her? Should I apologize?
219	2	I was just admitted to hospital. I’m sharing a room with a woman who is enormous. I know full well that it’s wrong but I get anxious just thinking about the fact that I have to share a bathroom with her.   I’m fully aware that this poor woman has to share a bathroom with a wicked harpy lady (me) and that I’m ugly on the inside. But I feel so sick at the thought.   My doctor is on religious leave at the moment so I’ll ask for a transfer the day after tomorrow but - between now and then - I don’t actually know how I’m going to get my stupid brain around it.   And please. I know what a rubbish person I am. I just needed to get this off my chest.
440	3	This literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.  For context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go.   He realised that he has ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that I am, I offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland. He commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and I assured him that that wouldn't be the case as I use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. Cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come.   TL;DR Basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.
348	3	This really is a today fuck up, 8 minutes fresh.   I have really bad insomnia, so it’s not unusual for me to get out of bed, leaving my partner and our very dumb dog asleep. I just potter around the house, listen to music or watching something on tv until I feel able to sleep.  Tonight was one of those nights, after an hour of tossing and turning I moved to the lounge-room to watch whatever random shit Facebook had suggested. After about an hour and a half, the dog gets restless and wakes my partner up to go out.  That’s where the fuck up started, I’m standing in our fully lit lounge when my partner opened the bedroom door, our dog saw me and went APESHIT barking. So I did the first thing that came into my sleep deprived mind, I barked back. Which caused her to bark even louder, to which I STILL barked back. It wasn’t until my partner hissed ‘it’s 2:30am’ that I remembered the ‘vacant’ house beside us isn’t vacant anymore, but rather occupied by a family with two small children…who probably just woke up to me barking at the dog.  TLDR- dog got spooked by me at 2am, I probably woke tiny neighbour humans with our barking contest.
139	3	This happened in may just so we are clear  My area received several tornado warnings and people were advised to be cautious and prepare necessary items to ration e.g. batteries, flashlights, water, and other stuff.  I already did everything I needed so I thought of an incredibly dumb but interesting idea of throwing stuff that didn't work into the path of a  twister, considering it'll be someone else's problem by that point.  Enter EF1. I spotted a rope tornado moving easterly to my location so I grabbed my non-functional toaster and started to drive like a son-of-a-bitch i was. The sight was surreal as I approached that fucking vacuum of death, with debris flying like a motherfucker and wind howling like my granddad's loose farts. I quickly placed the toaster in its path and it took it. But what I didn't expect is to receive something back, and that was a fucking 2" nail speeding at me.   Like a bullet, that thing penetrated me harder than anything I've received, and to make matters worse it hit me just below my shoulder where I was previously operated on. Long story short, I had to explain to a doc and insurance company why I had a 2" nail in body.  edit: ok ok i get I'm stupid   tldr; i fucked up by dumping a toaster into a tornado, which resulted in me being penetrated by a flying 2" nail
577	2	As per usual, this didn't happen today. It happened 2 years ago and my boyfriend and I are no longer together so I can finally tell this story. Let's call him B.  Shortly after giving me a key to his house, I figured one day that I'd stop by on my way home to say hi to B. I let myself in and walked towards his bedroom, yelling out to make myself known. He couldn't hear me. He had his running gear on and music blasting into his ears. B was dancing and lip syncing in front of the mirror, trying to pump himself up for the long run ahead of him. I knew that he'd kill me if I recorded this, so I just stood there and enjoyed it while it lasted. B turned around to head out for his run, saw a figure of a person in the doorway, and let out a sustained high pitch scream while doing a silly dance with his feet before falling onto his stomach on the carpet. I felt guilty about invading his private time just after getting my key privileges, but I couldn't stop laughing when I was trying to apologize.  After B got back from his run and pounded the manliest protein shake you ever saw, I asked him why he dropped to the floor. He said it was to hide from the intruder. One would think that the initial scream of a frightened little girl would alert an intruder to one's presence, but who can say for sure?  TLDR: I walked into my boyfriend's house and watched him when he thought that he was alone. When he saw me, he freaked out and fell down.  Edit: I guess that I need to explain that B and I play around with gender roles. B can be as feminine or masculine as he wants and everyone should love him the same for it.
336	1	My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.   In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest.    My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?
941	3	Around the very beginning of the pandemic (&lt;100 cases in Canada, not in my province yet) our pantry was running slightly low on food. We have always had a big stocked pantry, it comprises three big shelves in my basement, two big “bookcase” sized shelves in the pantry, as well as spices and baking supplies in cupboards, and a large freezer also in my basement. We decided to go out grocery shopping around the time toilet paper started to be hoarded globally. We bought about 15 packs of frozen vegetables, a bag of rice, several packs of dried pasta, and some jarred things like beats and sundried tomatoes on top of our normal grocery run for fresh things. We also got five packs each of plant based burgers and “chicken”.  Both my mom and I are plant based, so vegetables, fake meats, and grains/legumes are almost all we eat. We already had beans and legumes, so we didn’t buy any more.  I thought this was reasonable at the time, given that we didn’t clear any shelves or bulk buy things that were in high demand, aside from the pasta. But now I’m starting to doubt that; I think my judgement was flawed and we bought more than we needed, and I’m worried that just because I only eat one thing, I’ve taken that one thing from others. AITB?
161	3	yup. as the title says, here is a little of context:  my SO (f26) is an ASMR artist, she is making videos for about 3 years already, her channel wasn’t doing great so she decided to open a new channel and get her subscribers to be there to give it a boost hoping that youtube algorithm picks up the channel and make the videos more viral.  so as a supporting partner i thought that it will be good to use all the browsers in my PC and watch all her videos in the new channel to give her the support and the motivation to do more , did that for a week and then she found out about it and started crying because she thought that people are not interested in her videos and as how much she spends time working on them every day, people just chose to not watching her channel and that made her really not motivated which resulted to the opposite of what i wanted to do and now she is thinking to quit her channel after all these years.  TL;DR : tried to motivate my SO who is an asmr artist on youtube by watching her videos in multiple browsers, backfired when she found out it was me and she is thinking to quit because “no one likes to watch my videos”
749	3	This happened a while ago but I cannot get over it. I was having a fun night and I got way more drunk than i wanted to. I blacked out. My friends left. I ended up driving somewhere. I barely even remember. Thank goodness I didn’t hurt myself or anyone else. I can’t even believe i did something like this. There is something terribly wrong with me to have done something like this. I hate myself for it.
289	3	So this didn’t happen today, technically it happened last week.   I am in physical therapy for a neurological disorder. The other day my physical therapist was teaching me a bunch of new exercises that I hadn’t tried before. At one point she handed me a rubber ball and said “four pounds.” So I assumed that I was supposed to pound the ball into the ground four times. Which I did. Or tried to, at least.  Turns out, the ball weighs four pounds. And if you smash it into the ground, it does not bounce, it’s fairly loud, and it does startle your physical therapist.  In my defense, brain fog is a huge problem for me and also I’m pretty stupid 🤷‍♀️  TLDR my physical therapist handed me a rubber ball and said “four pounds.” I assumed that meant I was supposed to pound it into the ground four times. Turns out 4lbs is how much it weighs
412	1	Alright, here we go. My stepbrother (20M) is kind of a jerk. His way of making a joke is to make digs at people and I don’t like it. He told off our sister(9F) for “acting like a dog” when she was playing, and made our brother (15M) feel insecure by saying that he “smelled like actual shit.” This was false, by the way.   I get that this doesn’t seem like enough, but something happened awhile back and changed the way I see him forever. For some background, everyone in my family is aware that I’ve made a conscious decision to avoid drinking. I don’t want to do it, period.   He came over one evening and I was in bed with a terrible migraine. He came into my room with a cup of something and told me to try it. I asked what it is, and he just told me to try it again. I told him that it smells weird and I don’t want to drink it, but he insisted. I asked if it had alcohol in it, and he said no. Realizing that he wasn’t going to leave, I finally caved and took a sip. It was disgusting, by the way. I said as much and he laughed at me, informing me that it actually WAS alcohol and that he “wanted to see if I could handle it.” I was absolutely disgusted and I ended up crying because I couldn’t believe he would do something like that to me.   Since then, I’ve avoided him every time he has visited. I didn’t tell him happy birthday, I don’t acknowledge him at all. My stepmom said that I can either talk to him about what happened or put it behind me, but I decided not to do either. I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t want to have to defend myself over something so obviously messed up.   AITA for avoiding him when I didn’t give him the chance to reconcile?
627	1	I HATE the middle. I book MONTHS in advance so I can have an aisle. I have bad knees and need to stretch them into the aisle every now and then, and I need to get up And walk every couple hours, even if just to the rest room.  Couple comes to me and is like, can you switch with my wife so we can sit together? If one was on the aisle I would have done it. But they both had middle seats. I was like, I’m sorry I really can’t sit in the middle for 4 hours.   It was an awkward flight.   When I told my wife later that day my wife says I was wrong. I don’t agree.
334	3	I receive ketamine infusions every few weeks as part of my medical care. Today I arrived to the doctor a bit early so was killing time on my phone, where I came across this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/2019/07/art-student-dick-pic-painting-tinder.html I read it, looked at a few other things, and then it was time for my treatment.  The dose of ketamine I receive is therapeutic, not recreational, but I definitely experience some of the side effects of the drug. Usually I see a lot of colors, fly through space tunnels, that kind of thing. It’s very relaxing. Not today. Today I saw dicks. Dicks everywhere. I flew through a tunnel of dicks. I twirled through a field of dicks. I looked through a kaleidoscope of dicks. It’s like every dick I’ve ever seen made an appearance.   TL; DR: Looked at a painting of 140 dicks before ketamine infusions; ended up looking at 140,000 psychedelic dicks for an hour.
891	3	The other day I was leaving work, and a coworker waved me goodbye saying to have a nice evening. I wanted to reply oh you too, but then I started to say "See you later," and I just ended up telling him to "Shoo." I haven't seen him since...   And because of my awkwardness I didn't stop to explain. I just ran out the door. And this is why I don't have work friends
909	2	I was broke and hungry so I decided to go to Little Caesar's for some $5 pizza, I went there and ordered my food, but for some reason she didn't make me pay up front and instead I would have to wait a few minutes since they'l were out of pizza at the moment. Ok, no big deal. As I was standing to the side, a busload of kids walked in and went straight to the cashier, and she started taking their orders while another worker someone set my pizza on the counter and told to have a great day, so I assumed he thought I already paid.  The cashier was completely focused on the busload of kids that came in, and wasn't paying any attention to me. I looked at the door which was wide open and then looked at her, and saw that she was completely focused on the long line of kids instead of me. Although I've never shoplifted in my life but I'd rather not wait 10 minutes for the line to finish, so I thought in my head "Fuck it, I'm gonna do it". And I fast walked out the door to my car with my pizza without paying.  For the next few days I was scared they would a surveillance pic of me to the local news station or something and saying that there was a warrant for my arrest. I guess they didn't realize they were missing a pizza or that the cashier forgot about me since I never got arrested or saw anything about it on the news. This was about a year ago but I still feel bad about it. I haven't been to that Little Caesar's ever since.
824	1	Am I the asshole who put Starburst Sweet Heat in the community candy-bowl at work? Yes, yes I am. You should pay more attention to what you put in your mouth &amp; not complain about free candy.
926	1	So I bought an $80 skincare product. When I used it, it was pretty disappointing and didn’t live up to its hype, nor did it do much to my skin. Unlike the US, the country I live in do not provide refunds for beauty products which have been opened or used, you can ONLY get your money back if you had an allergic reaction. My proof was my red rash and bumpy face after a laser hair removal. I took a photo of that and emailed customer service as ‘proof’. I got my $80 back in a shady way and do not regret it, nor do I feel bad about it.
979	1	My son will be 6 months old around Halloween time.  Wife wants to take him trick-or-treating and got him a cute little outfit. I said it's stupid to take a 6 month old TOT'g.  She wants to show him off to our neighbors that we never met.  He's a 6 month old baby, the only reason my wife wants to take him is to show him off and get candy for herself.  I think it's childish and trying to talk her out of it but she's calling me a buttface.  Am I the buttface?
682	3	This literally happened about 15 minutes ago. I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.  TL;DR Tried to save a baby's balloon from flying away but ended up punching a stranger in the face.
107	2	I am a new mom of a one-month old. He is me and my husbands first baby and the first grandbaby on my husband’s side.   We are from America and grew up in the deep south and are his family is very Southern™.  His sister and mom bought us a TON of baby clothes. I appreciate it, but a lot of their humor/style doesn’t translate over to what I want my son wearing. For instance we have a camo onesie with orange trim. I put that on him sometimes and it’s cute, but not something I’d pick.  However, there are some other ones I do not approve of at all. Some examples of the clothes:  A onesie with a gun and the words “Proof my Daddy Doesn’t shoot blanks”.  “I was just supposed to be a backrub!”  “Little shit making big shits!”  “Dad’s a real mother f’er!”  “Dads, Lock up your daughters.”  And of course the classic “Boobie Inspector.”  These are just my least favorite, there’s more though.  Are these funny? To some people maybe. But I find comments on my sex life with my husband to be weird. Also, I don’t want my baby wearing curse words. Call me a prude if you must. My husband also doesn’t want to put him in these clothes.  That being said I feel bad they bought so many clothes for him that we won’t be using. They’re not bad people and I know they had to have spent a lot. I don’t know if I should return the clothes to them (no receipt, they were bought online I think) so they can regift them or get their money back, or if I should just put them in a corner of the dresser and hope they never notice he never wears a majority of their gifts. Wibta if I gave them their gifts back?
505	3	I was staying at this hotel during a family vacation and I ate a bad chicken wrap. My family went to go for a walk so I dipped and hauled ass to the bathroom in the lobby. The second I went in, I knew there was no holding back. I just released it all, thinking I was alone. It sounded like an elephant blowing its nose and echoed throughout the room. A voice next to me went, “goddamn” and another one laughed. It was humiliating. Then, after my business, I went to flush the toilet, and that’s when the mess (pun intended) all started. After I pressed the button, the water rose but kept rising. I painfully watched it creep to the top hoping it would stop, but it just kept going. I watched as a mixture of my shit and toilet water spilled over the edges, pouring onto the floor. The water kept going and pretty soon the people beside me were going, “What the hell is that??!” and were frantically panicking. At this point I knew that it would start flooding the room, so I had to make a dash for it. I ran out the stall. My cheeks burned as I dashed outside the lobby area, but not before seeing the “Out of Order” sign taped to the washroom stall door. To this day, no one knew it was me.  TL;DR I had diarrhea and used an Out of Order toilet, flooding the washroom with my shit.
199	2	Everybody thinks i’ve been working non stop because i look so focussed but in reality i’ve gone through over 10 subreddits in the past 5 hours.
967	3	Last week I sat a Chemistry exam at school. It was difficult, but I managed to score a 93. My classmates, however, didn't. Nearly everyone failed, and there were several scores below 30. I believed that the reason for that was the way the exam was structured, with too many exercises and too little time to solve them.  Today I talked to the Chemistry teacher in class and she asserted that she had done the right thing and 'as long as one person passed, the exam was structured properly'. She ticked my arguments off as excuses, and I took to the Chemistry students group chat (without the teacher) to complain and express my disagreement with her statements. I said how she can't compare literal gifted children to the rest of the class, that another class had had a time advantage (and, therefore, higher scores), that other teachers managed to make hard but passable exams, and it wasn't normal for even the smartest students to fail. I also mentioned how stress impairs ability to solve problems quickly.  Everyone became enraged, saying how I could complain when I had a 93 and they had a fail. I explained that I wasn't complaining about my grade, but about the exam as a whole. Some people mentioned that I was being selfish, and that it was pointless to discuss it in the group chat and not with the teacher. They also urged me to stop.  Be brutally honest, please. AITB?
978	1	Background info: I'm Canadian and lived in England for a few years where I met my English partner.  I never watched rugby that closely before until I had lived in England. When I started watching rugby closely the team that stood out to me for their discipline, amazing offloads, fantastic overall game play, and haka which reinforces the significance of Maori culture, was New Zealand.  As Canada's team sucks the team I support full time is New Zealand and then any other time I support England out of loyalty to my partner. I've always been very supportive, watching matches, learning the players names, and contributing what I can to game discussion.  Now that New Zealand and England are going to play each other my partner has called me a "glory supporter" and has gotten annoyed at me for supporting New Zealand for "no reason" . My argument is that I had no team to support to begin with and my overall impression of them caused me to absolutely love them as a team. He is saying that if we watch New Zealand play England and I cheer for New Zealand scoring a try that he will be really hurt.  AITB in this situation?
588	1	So I have been texting a girl for a few days. Not in a romantic sense, just for fun— she’s interesting to talk to since she’s so different than me in every aspect— political beliefs, religious beliefs, etc— even tho we had very similar upbringings.   She’s also very obsessed with JFK for whatever reason. Maybe because he’s hot.   Anyways, the other day, she sent me a video about ‘remembering your past lives’. I was pretty skeptical, but I had the idea of pranking her by pretending to do it and describing memories that would make her believe I was JFK. So I pretended to be resistant at first (so she wouldn’t be suspicious) but finally agreed to watch the video. Then I did some research on JKF besides the obvious (president, got shot, stuff like that).  I then went and told her I had memories of being at Harvard, in the Navy, in Hollywood and DC, and my last memory was in a car. I was trying to be subtle.   She picked up what I was putting down and now literally thinks I’m the reincarnation of her favorite president. It’s honestly hilarious.
832	2	I had never seen marijuana before and grew up very sheltered. I was in my freshman year of high school and probably had only heard of weed a few weeks earlier. I thought the kid was my friend, we had known each other since grade 2. To make this story even worse, he told me it was going to be $80. So I went home and stole money out of my moms purse to pay him. He ended up “selling” me a small bag of stuff, and I had never seen a picture of weed online so I was just like ok. I went home and tried rolling a joint with computer paper (ugh this story is humiliating) and tried smoking it. I didn’t know what I should have been expecting, I was super naive. But going to school the next day and being made fun of was not what I was expecting. Fast forward to now: I’ve lived in two legal states, have had a Medical Marijuana card, have grown twice, and have smoked hella real weed since then. But that was a shitty way to start off my journey with marijuana. Fuck that kid at my school.
102	1	Last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat.  I had 3 washers going at once. Now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. When I pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. I didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. So the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. About half hour goes by and washer 1&amp;2  are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. Now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 I decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. About 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said I broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. She took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. She asked for my name and phone number so I wrote down "Trevor Lahey" and some random collection of 10 digits. Those of you who watch Trailer Park Boys will understand. So as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. He couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until I had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. He still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc I didn't tell the attendant about the washer. So anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. Lol fuck off
356	1	My sister real mad @ me. Idk if I (23M) did things wrong or not. My daughter’s turning 7 next week. I always get the day off on her birthday so we can do something just dad/daughter. We have parties sometimes but we always find time for it to be only me and her. This year I got enough money for us to go to Disneyland and I already have that day off so we can go. My sis wants me to bring my niece (11) because their birthdays are just a day apart. My niece is really spoiled though (think of Angelica from the Rugrats). Love her but I don’t like her attitude. She throws tantrums for everything and thing is my sister gives her whatever she wants. My main problem is she bullies my daughter sometimes because she hates that my daughter’s birthday is a day before hers. I’ve had to tell her stuff since my sister won’t.   My sister’s offering money to pay for the ticket and buy my niece whatever she wants. But I just don’t want my daughter to have to deal with her taking over her day. I’m working a lot and this would be a whole day we get to spend together. My daughter looks forward to it. After I told her no she’s treating me like I’m being an asshole. And maybe this could be what helps them get along. Now she’s telling me my niece is upset we’re going to Disneyland without her. Not sure why she told her tbh. I get her birthday is right after but I just want my daughter’s birthday to be with my daughter only. AITA?
206	2	I’ll try to keep this short...I’ve been married to my wife for over a year now, have a stepson (14m) and a biological daughter (9f). When we married, my wife and I agreed that I would sell my house and move into hers because there’s more living space. Stepson already had his own room, so my daughter got the extra bedroom, which is smaller than his. It was fine at first, but my daughter has a lot of stuff and soon it became too small cramped for her. Stepson also only lives with us part time (5 days with us, 9 days with bio dad) and has a huge room at his dad’s. My daughter lives with us full time so this is her only room.   It seemed to me that the logical thing would be for my daughter to have the larger room since she has more stuff, and spends all of her time here. Wife was hesitant at first and felt like my stepson would be upset and feel like he’s being pushed aside, but I convinced her that my daughter needed the space more so she ultimately agreed. We ended up switching rooms this week, freshly painted them and my wife did some shopping for stepson’s new room so he’d feel special. He came home from his dad’s and we surprised him with his new room. He reacted ok, thanked us for the new stuff and didn’t seem upset at first. But now he’s been moping and has been cold to all of us. Wife is now regretting our choice and upset at me for convincing her that it would be fine.   AITA?
388	1	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Me(32) and my girlfriend(29) are living together for a year and going out for two. I make about 1.5 times the amount she makes and split all our bills including rent 60-40.  She has a huge student loan in low six digits. So here's the incident. Yesterday, she came up to me and asked why I was not helping pay off her student loan.I asked her whether she wants me to help plan her budget or is she expecting me to help pay of her loan. she said it was the  latter. I told her I am not willing to join finances as long as we are not married. But she retorted that I have more than enough in my savings and it's unfair that I am not helping her pay off her student loan. So, I asked her if she was expecting me to take my savings and completely pay off her loan. She nodded and I started laughing uncontrollably. She got upset and has informed most of her friends and they have been calling me an asshole as I am not helping her. I would have been fine if she had asked if she could reduce her share of the bills, but for her to suggest this I don't know how else to react. She has been giving me the silent treatment since. So reddit AITA.
704	2	This weekend I got invited for dinner at my colleague's place. My colleague has a super cute dog so naturally the first thing I did after getting there was spending some time petting and playing with the dog. When it came time to eat, I asked my colleague if I can use the washroom to wash my hands. He looked at me suspiciously and asked if that's because I touched his dog. I said I would have washed my hands even if I didn't pet the dog. He made a snide remark about how his dog is cleaner than most humans. I let it pass but I feel like I hurt his feelings by making him think his dog is dirty. AITA here?
522	1	Not interested in having a relationship or hook ups at the minute (just focusing my efforts on other stuff for now) but I still use Tinder to see what kind of women in my area find me attractive.
638	3	So about a year ago it was a really beautiful day and I \[F18\] decided to walk to the park that was just outside of my neighborhood. There was a playground and right next to/attached to it was a large baseball field and there were a bunch of kids playing on the playground and I wanted some peace so I went to sit in the field. I was laying in the sun and I was uncomfortable so I laid on my stomach with my headphones in and I fell asleep. I don't know how long I was asleep but I awoke to two police officers standing above me, and my first thought was "oh no It must be after hours and I'm trespassing" but I asked them if I wasn't allowed to be there and they looked at me a little incredulously and said no I could be there. At this point I'm confused but I notice their police cruisers and I hear the distant sound of sirens and then it clicks, someone called the cops because they thought I was dead. When I asked them they started laughing and said that a woman called about a person face down in a field assuming it was a drug related incident and I was incredibly embarrassed and they were still laughing about how mortified I was that they had to come all this way just because I fell asleep. They said it would make for a good story at the station, and they went on their way.  TL;DR: Fell asleep in the park, someone called the police because they thought I was dead, they thought it was hilarious.
176	1	So back when I was ten my dad asked me if I wanted to make 20$. I accepted.  The catch I had to shit on our neighbors door step. It was clear my dad had beef with this woman.  She woke in the morning and tried to blame our Chihuahua.  My dad yelled at her saying that the  shit was bigger then our dog.  Impossible. The point is I don’t feel bad. Forever daddy’s girl.
472	1	So my last name is Doe. It hasn't affected my life much apart from occasionally being called "Dodo" while growing up or friends spelling it "D'Oh" as a joke, and I'm generally pretty neutral about it.  My wife is six months pregnant and wants to name our future son after her grandfather, who died of cancer in September. His name was John.   I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe "John Doe" is his real name.   My wife thinks I'm being an asshole for vetoing a name with a strong family connection and says I'm exaggerating the issues he would face. AITA?
827	1	Back in high school I used to work the con session stand. In my school the booth was a little folding table where I would sell water, pop and chips.   To anyone that was a visiting team I would charge $.25-.50 more on the items they wanted to buy, and I would keep it.   I ended up making somewhere around $3,000 doing this for my high school career, and no one ever found out because I didn’t charge anyone from the home team the same amount.
223	3	Mandatory this happened a few weeks ago.   I was alone at my dad's in the evening and he'd just gotten these fancy new, very very sharp Japanese knives. He specifically told me not to touch them because they were sharp. I think I may be selectively deaf.  At around 11pm I decided to go upstairs and watch some YouTube videos in bed. But I suddenly heard a sound from upstairs. My brain went into full fight-mode, as in ANY SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT WILL BE TREATED AS DANGER. My imagination completely took over and I grabbed the largest fucking Japanese knife I could find.   I was the definition of stealth. I was danger. That burglar would never see me coming. I tip-toed up the stairs, holding the knive in an upwards position. My brain was convinced the burglar was in the bathroom (because where else would he be?) so I repositioned the knife for attack-mode.   Well, that was a mistake. You know, apparently those Japanese knives are not meant to be lightly thrown in the air and then caught like a spear. I dropped the knife after feeling it slide through my flesh like butter and searched for the lights, subsequently running into the doorframe. I cleaned up the blood in my bubble of shame. I was definitely the worst ninja ever.  I now have a scar on my palm of which I will never tell the story to anyone I know. I am 21 years old. I have now retired from nightly knife-wielding.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR I have a vivid imagination and thought there was a burglar in my bathroom. I am very stupid. I should not touch knives.
605	3	I was supposed to graduate with my Masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. The only problem was that I told them all that my graduation was on Sunday because I actually thought it was on Sunday. People booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over America.   This morning I wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my Instagram stories to see everyone in robes. My official school account also was posting about people graduating today. So I went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out I missed graduation. I'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. I don't even know what I'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to "see me walk". I MISSED MY OWN GRADUATION!!   TL;DR: Thought I was graduating on Sunday but the graduation was today.
39	2	 So last Thursday night I saw everyone tagging their step dads in the Budweiser commercial. Without watching it, I sent it to my stepdad. About an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if I’m hinting at something. My step dad is like I know you had intent. I’m like HUH??? OMG IN THE COMMERCIAL THE ADULT CHILDREN ARE ASKING THEIR STEPDADS TO ADOPT THEM. So he starts crying, thinking I want this. Now I can’t tell him that I didn’t mean to. Friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. Etc etc. all I can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. But I can never say anything about it being an accident. So like now I’m being adopted and changing my name.   Tl/dr sent a fathers day commercial to my stepdad who is adopting me now
833	3	This happened a few weeks ago.  My ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, "Dad! Kick me!"  So I did.  Hear me out, please. The kick was a 3/10 on firmness. Not gentle, but not painful. He's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, I feel like I need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. I also want him to "lose some battles", and to learn to "roll with the punches".   Anyway... I performed a front kick whilst making the Bruce Lee Noise. I trust that you know the one.   My son recoiled. He looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. He didn't cry,, but it was close.  He blurted out "I said KISS Me!!!"  Oops!    TLDR; I misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him.
9	1	At the beginning of the semester we were assigned a paper to be completed in groups of 8. Of course, my group procrastinated and the due date was coming up. As we met to talk about the paper, everyone griped about how they didn't have time due to extracurricular commitments, other exams, etc.   Upon looking at the rubric,  I noticed that it was seamlessly easy to complete given a few hours of honest work. Only involved some community database searching and typing into paragraph format. I made an offer that if everyone payed me $30 each I would do the entire paper, originally as a joke. Everyone proclaimed "wait, really?!" and said that if I was serious, they would pay up. Well.. I ended up making over $200 for a group paper that took me only about 3 hours to complete. Best profit I've made to date. Oh, and we got an A on the paper.
134	3	So we have this thing at work, which I'm sure is common in many workplaces, where when a life event happens that warrants a department wide greeting card (retirement, birth of child, death of family member, etc) to be delivered to an individual the card is put in a manilla envelope with a list of all the employees in the department and a description of what the card is for.  The idea is to sign the card, cross your name off, and hand it to another person on the list whos name isn't yet crossed off.    So a few minutes ago, a coworker pops in and hands me the envelop.  Me, being wrapped up in my work, opened the envelope and saw that it was a "Sympathy" card.  I quickly signed it with a cheap cookie-cutter response, "Sorry for your loss ~ Breakfastbeerz" crossed my name off, stuffed it in the envelope, and read who was next.  Fortunately, the walk wasn't far as my office neighbor's name was still available.  I popped my head in his office and told him, "Here's another card to sign", and walked out.  About 30 seconds later, my neighbor comes into my office holding the envelope, with a really sour look on his face, and drops it on my desk, "I don't think you intended to give this to me", he walked out.  I opened the card and finally got around to reading it.  Low and behold, the card was for him.  His mother had passed away a few days ago and I just gave him his own sympathy card and asked him to sign it.  I feel like such an ass.  TL;DR Quickly signed a sympathy card without reading it.  Gave it to a coworker to sign, it was a sympathy card for his own mother whom had just passed away.
259	3	This is my 4 year old’s first school year and he is in Pre-K. He hates school so far and says it’s boring so I tell him that if he wakes up and goes to school without fighting me he can stay home two days out of the week. During the week I remind him about our deal when he is misbehaving. So he thinks I let him skip school because he’s well behaved. I’m going to tell him, I feel bad now because I’m lying to him to get him to do things.
579	3	When I was 12, my middle school bus was in the school parking lot waiting for the bell to ring so we could get off. During this wait period, my body silently expelled a cloud of pure methane. Before my burning ass even recovered, the six rows of kids in front of me had already accused Henry of my anal aberration. Middle schoolers are cruel, and despite his denials, Henry had become the scapegoat.  Then, the bus driver made an announcement, "You guys can't get off yet but I'm opening the door so we can get some fresh air in here." Laughter ensued, and at that point, Henry died. From then, he was the kid who farted so bad the bus driver opened the doors and windows.  I didn't see Henry after that day. At first I thought he switched bus routes, but eventually I found that he had transferred to a private middle school, and eventually high school.  Seven years later and I haven't shared this with anyone. Sometimes though, a scent passes my olfactory bulb that racks me with guilt and reminds me of my fallen savior.  Godspeed Henry, I hope the past is all just farts in the wind now.
935	3	Many of you would be aware Australia has some of the worst internet in the world, it is so bad that I have 2 connections at home, 1 for downloading, watching Netflix etc which has unlimited downloads and I run only over Ethernet. The other I use exclusively for online gaming when my partner is using the main line, it is a 4G wireless connection that costs $55 a month and gives me 15GB in downloads (more than enough to play online) I am usually very careful about which connection I am using on the Xbox (Ethernet or wireless) but I had been playing on PC all day which is only connected by Ethernet so when I changed over to Xbox and started browsing the store it slipped my mind that it was still connected to the wireless 4G modem (you can see where this is going) I decided to buy Titanfall 2 (68GB) because it is ridiculously cheap in the current sale and then I went to bed. I woke up this morning to discover my 4G modem had downloaded 74.8GB this month. My ISP charges $10 for every 1GB I go over my plan. TL;DR I bought Titanfall 2 for $500 dollars.
163	3	My son threw a snowball at me and I instinctively blocked it with my daughter. The look of betrayal on her snow covered face has haunted my dreams for years
770	1	I completely forgot about this until I saw another user's post on forging their way through physics.  This was nearly twenty years ago. I had a doctor's note from when I had chicken pox the year before and, having a computer, scanner, and some knowledge of Photoshop, decided it was time to stop going to school so damn much!  I shopped out all of the written details and dates, replaced the doctor's office number with my cell number, and printed out a stack of notes. When I felt like having a few days off, I'd fill in the pertinent information and fax it over. I'd pretend to drive to school, wait for my parents to go to work, and go right back home.  Not once was it ever questioned. They never called to verify. I missed nearly 60 days my last year of high school. I regret nothing, high school in Idaho was largely a waste of my time.
318	1	My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems she to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.  &amp;#x200B;  Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.   &amp;#x200B;  My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?
79	3	I work at a small diner in a popular tourist destination as a line cook and went into work today, a day we’re closed, to get some prep work done for the weekend (things get busy really quickly in the morning and I wanted everything to be ready when we open tomorrow). The staff is small and pretty tight-knit, so my boss didn’t have an issue with leaving me alone to do prep while she ran errands and took care of things for the business, so I was by myself and decided to hook my phone up to the stereo system. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, so I blasted my metal playlist in the diner while I got to work on my prep list. Occasionally, someone would stop and look into the diner as they walked past and I just went about my work and thought “come on guys, it clearly says we’re closed on the door” without giving it any more thought. It was only when a yuppie-tourist type family walked past and the mom shot me a death-glare through the window while a Cannibal Corpse song was on that it hit me: the stereo was hooked up to the outside speakers, set up for the patio seating. I had been blasting metal onto the busy downtown street for the past two hours and confusing the hell out of passerby’s. I quickly shut it off and my boss thought it was hilarious when I told her, but I can only feel sorry for the irreparable damage that I caused to that poor yuppie-child’s innocence.   TL;DR: blasted metal at work by myself without realizing that the stereo was hooked up to the outdoor speakers. Disrupted tourists for hours.
834	1	The other night, my friend drunkenly took a bike sitting by someone's apartment unlocked.   Today, I told him that he should return it and it wasn't right to steal someone's bike like that, especially considering it was a nice bike  Another friend said "dude chill the fuck out. You're not his dad. He can do what he wants"  My friend still returned the bike, but I think that my friend getting mad at me was unjustified. I've always been known as the type of people that doesn't compromise in my beliefs, and sometimes that rubs people the wrong way. But in this case I don't feel I did anything wrong.
314	2	Technically not today but I only just realised I’ve been doing this today, so it sort of counts.  Okay so I’ve worn glasses my whole life. High prescription because my eyes just don’t seem to want to do the thing eyes do on their own. And recently they’ve been doing a new shitty thing — I’ve been seeing double 24/7 (basically binocular vision dysfunction). But my optometrist keeps cancelling on me because my country is still in pandemic lockdown, so I just sort of have to live with double vision for a while.  Anyway, I’ve been going on my government suggested daily exercise by just taking walks around my neighbourhood since the beginning of the pandemic. And I’ve continued this despite my vision problems because I live with others and I’d go insane otherwise.  And as of lately my double vision has been messing with my depth perception (crossing roads, walking past people) so whenever I need to see clearly, I’ll just quickly shut one eye and open it again when I figure out where a person/object is.   Today I did this when passing by a father and his daughter riding bikes, so I quickly shut and opened my eye while looking at him, so I could move aside for them. But as he passed he gave me (18f) a strange look. And that was when it hit me that I’ve been winking at almost every total stranger I’ve passed in my neighbourhood for the last month. So if anyone needs me I’ll just be hiding in my house for the rest of this pandemic.  tl;dr - I’ve been winking at people for a month because my optometrist is ghosting me.
49	3	   My fiance and I have been eating Keto for the last 3 months. She recently bought these "butter bombs" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. I saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because I hadn't used one yet.  I proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. I threw it in the blender and glugged it down. I thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. It didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.  Smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as I'm watching TV, "Hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?" SMH. My fat ass thought it was food. I suppose I should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 Stars, would eat again.  &amp;#x200B;   TL;DR I ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto "fat bomb" because I'm a fat ass.
218	2	I sat next to one of the "smart girls" in class. For some reason, she wrote extremely loud with her mechanical pencil. Whenever we had a test, I would sit and listen, question by question, hearing the different distinctive swoops she made with her pencil. Looking back on it now, I'm not proud of it. Especially because, ironically, it was an ethics class.  For a little more detail: Cut = straight line Swish = curved line  A = Cut-Cut, Cut B = Cut, Swish-Swish C = Swish D = Cut, Swish
129	3	So this actually happened about a week and a half ago. Some pre knowledge. I dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. So the other day I was really hungry and wanted some Panda Express Orange chicken. I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like “alright sounds good brother see you in a bit”.  A couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. So naturally I got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, “ummm you’re not my girlfriend,” quickly I looked up and realized “oh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I’m thinking to myself “oh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door. Quickly I apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house.   TL;DR I got in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car thinking that it was my friend. Then when I got out I hit her with the door.
306	1	I broke up with my girlfriend (both 20 years old) after experiencing some uncomfortable situations with her and her older brother(22).   First red flag was that they cuddle every time they watch tv together even if I’m there. And it’s not just him putting his arm around her it’s more than that. She puts her leg over his lap and hugs him while his arm is around her and his hand is holding on to her leg.   First time I saw that I was confused and felt awkward about it but didn’t think much of it until it kept happening.   Fast forward a couple months and we’re in bed together at her place sleeping. When I wake up she’s gone? I go looking for her around the house and see her brothers door cracked open. I peak inside to see if he was awake so I could ask him if he knew where she was. I then see her in bed with him and she’s in her underwear from last night as he’s playing with her hair.   I didn’t talk to her about it I just definitely felt so weird and distant after that. What really made me break up with her was this final thing.  Her brother was showing me pictures of their family vacation on his phone and as he’s going quickly through the pictures I see one with what’s very visibly my girlfriend naked laying on a hotel bed.  So at this point I’m like what the actual fuck is going on. I broke things off with her without saying much besides “this isn’t working” and she’s been blowing up my phone the past week trying to get me back.   AITA For assuming something is going on between them without any proof or conversation?
61	1	This happened about a year ago. I went to an art museum with a guy I was dating back then and I found a wallet left on a seat. Instead of giving the wallet to the security or something, I put it in my pocket and took it with me afterwards. There was no cash inside, just credit cards and an ID. I figured using the credit card is sure to get me caught so I didn't. Once I got home, I shoved the wallet in back of a drawer and forgot about it till I saw this subreddit.   I think I'm gonna drop the wallet in the mailbox next time I go out. Better late than never.
921	2	I need to get this out of my chest . As the title said, i had sexual relationships with males and females for money for an entire year when I was 20 to pay my rent and my thyroïde operation . It was not something i enjoyed but i had no other income except for  my part time job in a shitty restaurant, and didn't have time for an other job because i was a student at the time .  I graduated two months ago psychology major .
647	1	My parents divorced when I was 3, dad remarried when I was 9. He died when I was 19. After his death his wife, stepdaughter and I didn't really keep in touch with each other. That was more my choice than theirs. I was never particularly close to them and had spent more time with my mom than my dad while they were married (because of the distance he lived from us). And when he was gone, I didn't see a point in staying in touch. My grandparents continued to keep in contact with them though and even told them when I got engaged, and then when I sent invites out last week. After they got upset about not being invited both them and my grandparents started giving me crap for it (my grandparents gave my former stepsister my number and she gave it to her mom). I heard everything from, they're still family to it's a slap in the face when people ask why they aren't there. After 7 years of no contact I wasn't expecting this. My grandparents expressed real disappointment in me though which is why I came here. With everyone pissed at me and thinking of me as the asshole I had to ask.  So tell me reddit, AITA?
846	2	I raised my stepdaughter since she was 3yo. I absolutely love her. I can't have children, so I consider her my daughter. I married my husband after her mother passed away. She's 16 now.  Last week she told me that she wanted to get her boyfriend's name tattooed. I asked her if he was asking her to do it and she told me that she had to do something to prove her love to him.  I calmly explained that she doesn't have to prove anything and I told her that if the relationship doesn't last forever, she might regret it later. Thats it. She started yelling and told me that I'm not her mother and she didn't need my permission.   She told me that she hated me and my husband should've never married me. This went on for some days. I and my husband tried to explain to her but she refused to talk to me.  Finally, yesterday, when she told me that she hated me, I told her that I hated her too. She then started crying. I felt really bad but I was really vexed. My husband thinks I shouldn't have said that. AITA?
329	2	So my cousin is **not** allowed on discord, and I know this. sometimes I'll text him to see if he's on, so we can play, or such. in this case, I have his mom listed as "David's mom" and I have him listed as "David" you can already tell where this is going. I texted his mom, (who i thought was him, without looking, because I was in a rush) "hey, are you on discord? if so we can play some Rainbow..." and I get a text saying "what, Anthony? this is his mom!" and I immediately knew what was happening.  a few hours later I get a text from David saying "I'm going to drive to your house in 15 minuets" he came over and we argued for like a really long time, and almost fought. then he showed me that his mom proceeded to SMASH his phone.  so basically I lead to my cousin's phone being smashed  TL;DR  I got my cousin in trouble and I almost had to fight him. over discord. wow.
590	3	I'm the middle child and one day I just got fed up because I felt like nobody would take my side. My parents favored my siblings most of the time so I took the little black bottle at the back of the cupboard (which I thought was poison because it was small and black. I know, I'm stupid.) and fucking poured it all over the mushroom soup for dinner. I was smirking all throughout dinner waiting for them to start choking. Turns out it was just vanilla extract.
692	3	A few weeks ago, I came out as bisexual to my mother. Of course, this took her by surprise, but she told me that she still loves me. I told her because I figured she would handle it well, but she has since become a nervous wreck. She is a devout, but loving Christian, and she tells me to avoid my urges out of fear of me burning in Hell. These past few weeks have been rough on her. She has been losing sleep, her ability to keep up with work has worsened, and she seems to be eating less. However, just now, I was going to bed when I noticed her sitting up in her bed crying her eyes out. She cant take it anymore. I had to sit there with her for 20 minutes while she told me that she thinks that she has failed with me. I'm not ashamed of my sexuality, but I cant help but feel like shit over this. I know I shouldnt feel bad for being honest and open with my mom, but I cant help but feel like I've massively fucked up.
405	3	She was the person closest to me (I'm the oldest of three and her only son)...she passed nearly 2 years ago. She went way too early (62) and rather unexpectedly. I guess I just really miss my mom...  EDIT:  You all are just awesome!  Thank you so much for all the comments, DM's, etc.  Internet hugs to all of you!
963	1	This friend, "J" and I are friends through work. We clock in at the same time every day, and we go to a group huddle the same time every day. Today, nobody told her it was time to clock in, and in 45 minutes, we were all at the huddle without her. She was pissed that she wasn't notified of at least one of these and said something to the effect of "I see I'm invisible to you guys."  I didn't say anything, as I'm terrible with confrontation. After huddle, everyone but J went on with work. She took a breather and then went home. My other coworker asked if I could console her since we're friends, and J didn't want to talk to her about it.  I understand that J is sensitive, and I don't doubt that this really hurt her, but on the other hand, it's nobody's job to tell her when things are happening. We've both been at this job for over nine months. I was a little miffed that she just blew off her work because of this, but then again, how badly do you have to be hurt to go home?   I'd probably be the only one she would open up to, but I didn't, since I was working (though checking on her wouldn't make me in trouble) and I thought she was being ridiculous.
665	3	My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that "fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.  &amp;#x200B;  I noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?
537	1	Ok so i'm working a summer job at a bank, I do administrative stuff and generally help out wherever I can. So after my shift was over today i'm walking out of the bank and my coworker rushes up to me to ask me to make photo-copies of a big stack of documents, I normally would have said yes but i'd had a long day and I was just on my way out. Knowing full well that the photocopies would have taken me an extra 10 to 15 minutes to do after my shift is done. I don't get paid overtime and from a legal standpoint in my country my employer can't force me to work past my normal 9 to 5 without paying me overtime. At this point i'm just tired and wanted to go home. I initially said no and she gave me a harsh look kind of like 'are you fucking kidding me?' so I took the documents and went to the photo-copier. I did however mutter under my breath "well now i'm going to miss my train" and she heard it. She came up to me and took them out of my hands and said that we're not going to get into a fight over this. At this point I was like 'alright' and just left and went home. Am I the asshole reddit ?
229	3	I suspected nothing. The peppermint tin was empty. My items were covered in plastic. I thought I was safe.   Until, I felt a a strange tingling down below. I was on a call, so I tried to ignore it, but the feeling grew.   And this is how I learned that you should NOT store tampons in an empty Altoids  "Curiously Strong!"  peppermint tin.   I just got out of a long bath. It did not help. I have tingles where I should NOT be tingling. HELP!   This is not the same as using Dr Bronner's peppermint soap, peppermint is not meant to be  used inside.   On a positive note, I smell very fresh and minty clean!   Please learn from my mistake!   ---- [for curious people, some tampons are in a clear wrapper that isn't as perfectly sealed]  [pic] (https://i.imgur.com/JGOCal7.jpg)  ---- TL:DR I stored my tampons in a peppermint container and now my lady parts are tingly on the INSIDE!
462	1	I smoke meth and use adderall daily, I smoke weed/wax, use Percocet, Xanax, kolonopin, acid, coke, shrooms, oxy, really anything. I usually have all sorts of different drugs in my possession at all times.  I appear completely normal, square even.  No one has a clue about my using, even my best friends. People at work call me the “innocent” one. I hate when people boast and brag about their drug use so I keep quiet and don’t chime into conversation about it.  Im even in a vigorous college program and no one suspects a thing.
529	3	I was going through a really hard time. While drunk I decided to see how lucky I really was at life. Well that’s what I was thinking when I did it. I broke into a house in the subdivision next door. I made sure no one was home. I knew I wasn’t gonna steal anything or let anyone see me. I didn’t want items. I wasn’t poor or anything for some reason I just wanted to for some reason. I opened the back door to the house and walked into the kitchen. I looked around for a sec and then walked to living room. I looked around and then spotted what was clearly a urn. I realized what I was doing. “This is someone’s house. I’m inside of someone’s home.” I left out the same window and left. No cops, no one found out, no one ever will. I don’t know why I did it. It’s not like it was a cool thing to brag about to my friends. It was shitty.
712	3	In year 8 food tech we had to make a unique pasta dish. I decided to do bare minimum and make a vegetarian dish. Literally just spag Bol with quorn. Homemade sauce. So we make the meals and cook them and then we have tasting. I put mine in the vegetarian section.  Everyone is trying it and enjoying it, one girl who is an actual vegetarian has seconds because ‘it’s delicious’  Feeling dead proud of my self. Go home and tell my dad... Awkward silence. He forgot to get quorn and just put minced beef in a Pyrex dish for me.  TL;DR - Gave a vegetarian minced beef thinking it was quorn and they loved it.
646	3	When I was 6 or so, I was at a pet store. I saw one of those glass fish tank pebbles just laying around, so I took it with me. The guilt was eating me alive.  In the Netherlands, we've got a yearly "marble season" in primary schools. One boy, Martin, had a so-called grandpa marble, one of the biggest ones out there. He saw my fishtank marble and started yelling that that was a super rare half marble. I just went with it and said "Sure, I've been saving for this one for ages, but we can trade it."  He gave me his grandpa marble in exchange for a stolen fishtank marble. I lost it in a game the next week, so I wasn't able to give it back.  Martin B., if you read this, 7 y/o me apologises
226	3	Obligatory ignore formatting as i’m typing this on my phone.   Some context: it was my friends birthday and we were playing COD online and smoking (all through zoom ofc because covid). This goes on for a few hours and by the end i’m super baked and tired. I go to bed put my arm under my gf and try going to sleep.   20 mins and nothing. By this point my arm is starting to hurt so I try to carefully remove my arm from under her head. I’m about halfway there when she starts moving. Now she has class early in the morning so I don’t want to wake her up because of my shenanigans and in my excessively baked state I yank my arm from under her in an attempt to gain freedom before she wakes up.   This is where the downfall begun. My wristband got stuck in her ear piercing and ripped it out and she immediately woke up with the loudest scariest scream i’ve heard in my 24 years of being alive.   Our roommate heard her and immediately rushed to our room. We wrapped her damaged ear in some wrapping gauze and rushed her to the ER.   She is safe now but holy shit. Sorry for the incoherent explanation. Typing this from the parking lot of the hospital.   tl;dr- tried removing arm from under gf while sleeping. ended up almost removing her ear instead.
558	3	This happened about 10 minutes ago. I'm still regretting my decisions and sense of humor.   So my hubs usually likes to sleep in the buff since he gets pretty warm at night, even with the AC cranked or windows open.  This gives me a pretty decent target for sneaky raspberries.   (For those of you who don't know, a raspberry is when you take a deep breath in and press your mouth agaist someone's bare body part and blow out hard making a rude noise and basically extreme tickling them in that area for about one second.)  These are 99% harmless and we get eachother every so often, just to be an ass for fun. Except this time. We were laying in bed and I was cuddling on his chest, and thought 'man, this would be hilarious!' and I caught his ribs, just under the armpit, and as he finched, a flying back elbow comes in contact with my lower jaw. All of a sudden, I'm both laughing at the situation and crying in pain from taking a direct hit to my face. He's apologizing and laughing, I'm apologizing and laugh/crying, and now I have an ice pack on my face and wondering how I can cover bruising with makeup.    TL;DR i thought it would be funny to give my husband a raspberry and got a flying elbow to the jaw  UPDATE: I woke up with lots of pain, but less bruising than I thought. We went for a sushi lunch and it hurts to chew, but I'll suffer for a good meal!
831	3	So yesterday was Valentine's day and I've been seeing a girl who used to wrestle when she was younger. I was a wrestler for 10 years and we both knew this. So we get drunk last night and start messing around on the couch. We're just using moves on each other and I'm winning with ease.   We do this for a while and it's all fun and games until she says "I bet I can beat you from the standing position." We are both pretty trashed at this point so we stand up in her living room and start facing off. We tie up with each other and instinct kicks in so I sprawl and slam her head into the hardwood floor. I spin around behind her and then I realize she isn't moving.  At this point I realize that I fucked up badly. She was out for like 10 seconds. She comes to and she has a huge black and blue knot over her eye brow. I'm feeling like a gigantic piece of shit and after a couple of seconds she laughs and says it's okay.   So the TL;DR here is that I got trashed on wine with a girl. We wrestled. I knocked her TF out on a hardwood floor. Now she has a lump like a pachycephalosaurus on her head.
695	3	So this was actually last Wednesday to be clear. I work at a tire shop. About two months ago a customer came in after her vehicle was finished and asked me if I would take some weed brownies if she brought them over. I said well yes of course ! I even told my boss and he just laughed it off. Fast forward to last Wednesday I'm sitting on a stack of rims eating my Korean BBQ for lunch. She walks in with a bag of brownies sliced into small square cubes. I divide them amongst my two coworkers evenly and I eat one piece (she advised one piece would be plenty.) the smart guy I am. I waited bout 15 minutes and said jeez these are weak ! So I ate about 4 more pieces. Two hours later I might as well be a vegetable. Can't even speak a full sentence. Got hit in the head with the hood of a balancing machine so hard that I literally went to the bathroom mirror to make sure I didn't have a huge dent on my scalp. Could barely do any work and grew more paranoid by the minute. Could not wait to go home. Also at the end of the day I as having a smoke with my manager and I told him I ate the brownies at lunch. He was pretty mad, but I figure I'd tell him because my eyes were as red as the devils dick.   TL;DR I underestimate the power of weed edibles at work, almost lost my head and my job. Sorry if this was a boring story it was entertaining IRL and I thought it would read better
519	1	[No Regrets] I quit my old job and started a new one about three weeks ago; doubled my income, 9-5, Monday-Friday, flexible schedule (if I want to work 40 hours in 3 days, I can), two weeks of vacation, great benefits... the works. It's not a difficult job, more tedious than anything-- basically an administrator to the CEO and executives who run a bunch of high and low class restaurants.    My main responsibilities are to compile data from all of their businesses, gather bills, meetings, send them to the appropriate people and fill out any forms. It took about four days to figure out, and one to write the program. I get paid to sit around watching Netflix all day. The only "real" thing I do is double check the quality of work, and set up meetings/interviews.     I'm the only one in the office every day.      I pay for college out of pocket.      I'mma ride this gravy train to the very last stop, y'all.
722	1	My BIL (28) came to spend a week with my husband and I. He came in on Tuesday and left last Monday.   On Sunday he told us what time his train left and I agreed to take him to the station since my husband had to leave for work prior to him leaving. His train left at 7:00AM and I told my BIL to be ready to go by 6:45AM since I too had to be at work that morning. He said he would be ready and it wouldn’t be a problem.   On Monday morning I wake up early so I can shower and get ready for work and my BIL is just waking up. No big deal, we still have a half hour before we have to leave. At 6:30AM I ask him if he will be ready by 6:45 and he said yes. At 6:45 he literally gets into the shower, so I texted my husband and told him that BIL is just now showering and getting ready and that we had to leave so I can go to work.   At 7:00AM BIL was still in the shower. I texted my husband and said I had to go or else I would be late for work. I got on my Uber app and calculated how much it would cost for him to be taken to the station from our house and left cash, including enough for a tip. I also left a note and apologized that I couldn’t take him but said that the cash was for an Uber.   When my husband found out he flipped. He told me that it was rude to do that and I should have waited. I explained that I had a 45 minute commute to work and if I had waited I would have been late. My husband thinks that I should have just sucked it up and went in late but I disagreed and said that it wasn’t fair to me to have to burn my leave time because his brother couldn’t be bothered to get ready to leave like we agreed.   AITA for not taking him to the station and leaving uber money?
972	2	For some backstory: I've been dating this guy for six months now. There was a point where we tried becoming an official couple. But, due to his mental health problems (depression, basically), we decided to stop. But, we still go out and everything as if he was my bf. We walk hand in hand, kiss, listen to each other's problems, just like any other couple.  So, here's the thing.  Last night he told me he can't get into a serious relationship because he feels like he isn't prepared. He feels too immature. And he also mentioned he feels attracted by other people.  Then he explained himself. He feels sexually attracted to other people. But he is emotionally attracted only to me. So I told him "Hey look, it's normal to feel like that".  He proceeded to say that, even though I am very important for him, he wanted to go and have sex with other people. And, after that, get into a serious relationship with me.  "If I go and kiss some other guy, would you get upset?", I asked him.  "I don't know".  I know he would, so I replied: "I think you would. That's why I don't do it. Because I don't wanna hurt you. I think you should balance your priorities."  He didn't reply.  But then I started to think: it is supposed that we are not in a serious relationship. This is screwing up the whole point of not being an official couple, right? Am I the buttface for telling him not to go and see other people because that would make me upset?
165	2	In March, I moved back to my parents house after they became concerned about my appearance and behaviour. I have been trying to get sober for over a year now, and have for the most part, found myself stuck in a relapse/recovery loop. My parents put in firm boundaries and since then, my movement has been heavily restricted, and for the most part, I have been supervised at home.   Around mid April, I relapsed and have been using daily since then. My parents and friends don’t know that I am actively using, truly believing that I have made significant progress. Over the past month, they have repeatedly commented on how proud they are, and how much I have changed. My parents have said that they have never experienced me in a more positive and proactive space, and recently, they have started to trust me again.   I am feeling unbelievably ashamed and guilty, knowing that I am lying to them. I have been trying to “make it up to them” in other ways, but I know that it’s not enough, and no matter what I do, my behaviour is not negated. They are blissfully ignorant.   I am required to submit to a weekly drug test, and should I test positive I could be sent to mandatory inpatient treatment by the court. I haven’t been asked to do a test in about a month, having faked the previous test results. I know that this is not sustainable long term, and that at some point, the truth will come out.   I know that I need to change, and I want to get into recovery. But getting clean means that I lose something that I know soothes me. The serenity I feel is artificial and temporary, I know. But still, being numb is better than how I feel when I’m sober.
737	1	I used to work at this restaurant and the management there was just awful and the GM was just very verbally abusive. She always would complain about everything and one thing specifically was how there would be 1 or 2 customers a week who would order food and then never show up, she ended up letting the servers and hosts eat the food. So it gave me an idea.  One day she said something that really pissed me off, so I called my job and ordered a bunch of food under a different name and then that “customer” would never show up. It made her livid and it gave me the bold idea of doing that whenever I want a lunch. I started to do it an hour or so before my break and I would order whatever I felt like eating that day and when they’d call and cancel I’d ask a supervisor if I could have the food and they’d say sure.  I did this for the entire 3 years that I worked there 2 times a week, sometimes even 3. I didn’t ever get caught , and I’ve even had a coworker help me by being the one to answer the phone. It was kinda funny and that place was awful, so I kinda deserved it.
37	2	My parents got divorced when I was 6 years old and they had equal 50-50 custody of me and my older sister until each of us turned 18. My dad has remarried pretty quickly and my mom has a few boyfriends who came and went over the years, nothing too crazy and was single most of the time.  What made me mad was that from time to time my mom (F59) makes comments about how she raised my sister and I as a single parent. I disagree and tell her that she raised us half of the time while the other half we were raised by our dad (M58). She then says that he didn’t do much and that we were raised by a single mom who did everything for us.  She even has my sister in the same mindset that because she was *single*, she was a single parent. AITA for saying that she’s using the “single parent” label incorrectly?
150	3	TL;DR at the end. This isn't a super bad fu or anything, but I just thought I'd share it here.  For a bit of backstory, I'm very into maths, it's my main subject and I specialise pretty heavily in it, and today I'd already been doing maths for 7 hours at the time of this conversation, 6 hours learning and doing questions, 1 hour because I tutor maths after school as well, so just bear in mind that I was already exhausted at this point lmao.  So today me and this girl were having a conversation and she knows I'm obsessed with maths so she give me an equation to solve, so I did and the solution was i &lt; 3u.  So obviously me being me, I replied with "i &lt; 3u", to which she responded to "Do you not get it?" and so obviously being a normal person I was like "Does I refer to the complex number i, since you never specified otherwise?"  And she's like "No... You're meant to say i &lt;3 u", but I'm honestly being so extremely slow today so I said "But why would I space out 3 and u when they're multiplied and not space out the less than and the 3?"  Took me a while to finally understand but now I feel really dumb.  TL;DR - A girl sent me a &lt;3 and I thought it just meant less than 3.
407	3	No, isn't a joke. This happened less than 2 hours ago.  So you might be wondering, how in the fuck did I manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? Why on earth would I do it? Well, let me tell you. Here I am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic formulas, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend HOW to count it. My teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. She starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.  I sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking "Should I? Nahh" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! Maybe. But not the teacher.  So I get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and I shit you not, I cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. As soon as I'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking HOWLING, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.  I'm feeling all slick and shit thinking "That was definitely worth it", but then it fucking dawns on me. **The parent-teacher conference is today, in less than 3 hours. AND I HAVE TO GO TO IT TOO.**  &amp;#x200B;  *Yeah, I'm fucked. Please pray for me*  &amp;#x200B;  **TL:DR** \- I tried to be funny by cripwalking out of my maths class when my teacher offered us to leave the classroom and the parent-teacher conference starts in less than 3 hours now. RIP me
19	1	[Light]  My girlfriend works Saturdays. I don't. I commiserate with her and tell her how much I wish we could be together, but I'm secretly delighted because it's the only time of the week that we're guaranteed to be apart.   Between 8 &amp; 6 on a saturday I can drink some rum and eat junk without having to share, binge my tv and podcasts I've missed hanging out with her all week, and play the PlayStation games I get so little time with now. By the time her shift ends and its nearly time for her to come round, I'm almost put out because I get into such a nice groove. She's talking about switching jobs so she doesnt have to work saturdays anymore; I'll be gutted.  I do love her etc yadda yadda but goddamn do I love my free-time Saturdays.
231	1	My girlfriend started going to therapy for anxiety and such. I usually ask what they talked about when we talk about our days, and she told me she told her therapist about the ins and outs of our relationship, including sex and intimacy. I asked her not to do that anymore because that should be private, and she accused me of interfering with her progress. AITA for this request?
22	2	My wife and I are vegetarians, much to my in-laws vocal annoyance. Last year, we visited her family for Thanksgiving, and to their credit they made sure there were enough vegetarian side dishes that we could fill out plates with more than just mashed potatoes.   On that same trip, my wife's mom invited themselves to our place for Thanksgiving this year. "I think it's your turn to host us." I said that sounded like fun. "But," she said, "You'll be cooking us a turkey." I sort of laughed and said, well, no. It became an **issue**. We argued. I said that we would make such a wonderful dinner and they would have such a nice time that they wouldn't even miss the turkey. She said that we were being selfish.   Now that Thanksgiving is approaching, I feel pressure to just make the damn turkey so it doesn't come up. But I feel as though if we're hosting them and preparing the food (and only have one oven!), we shouldn't be obligated to spend half a day cooking something to which we have a moral objection and will not eat ourselves.   But maybe I should just let it go, be a good host, and give them what they expect on the holiday.   Am I the asshole?
443	3	So I was born in a Asian American household. My mom was born and raised in Korea. Back in grade school, the mornings were always chaotic so my mom used to pack me Korean meals for breakfast so I could eat it at the bus stop before school. These meals usually consisted of very pungent smelling korean food. Which I personally loved, however, I was often teased for eating such an unfamiliar type of cuisine. So once I walked out the door, I used to THROW away my moms homemade breakfasts in the outside trash can. Now looking back, I am on my own, a struggling college student who has a very tight grocery budget, and I feel so awful for what I did. Now knowing that there are so many hungry people in this world, and that my mom cooked every single meal for me and my siblings with love.
621	1	We moved outta the house because my mother in law keeps on showing up uninvited. Now she's visited us for a week and she's all up in our face all the time. My wife and I don't have time for each other anymore. None at all tbh.  So earlier today, she was in our basement trying to look for her old button up shirt (don't ask why she thought it was in the basement of OUR house, miles away from hers). She asked if I could join her down there in case she needs a hand. So I did. Helped and all. My wife was about to leave for work so I went up to lock the front door. My mother in law slammed the basement door on me for "not wanting" to help her. The door got stuck.  I'm now in the living room watching TV. She's asking to be let out, I think I'll let her stay there for awhile. She not senile, she's just about 50 years old, she can manage for awhile.
985	2	This is an obvious NAH situation, which is why I'm posting it here.  My cousin recently got married. My parents stayed at my house, and we drove to the ceremony together. I brought a small designer purse that matched my dress with my phone and license in it.  At the reception, I learned that it was a cash bar. Family members and family friends payed for all of my drinks. I had to go across the room to ask for my dad's credit card so I could get a drink to go with my dinner.  Having a cash bar at your wedding is of course allowed. However, neither the paper invitation nor the wedding website mentioned a cash bar. In previous invitations, it has normally said something like, "Reception with cash bar to follow." I would have brought credit cards or cash if that had been indicated.  When I mentioned to another cousin my annoyance with the situation, she said that he was young and probably didn't want to spend a lot of money. I told her I understood that; I just hadn't realized I would be expected to pay for my drinks.  AITB for assuming it was an open bar and being miffed that it wasn't?
523	3	 So today i went out to drink with a friend and two of his female friends, which had never drunk before. One of them drank way too much and we had to call her mother to pick her up and she absolutely lost it, because her daughter was half unconscious  Now i feel really guilty that she drank too much and i am really sorry about this incident.  I hope this can calm my guilt a bit down.   Also, in my country it is legal to drink with 16.
748	2	AITA - my boyfriend and I were just talking and I mentioned I don't think I want to tell our families when I go into labour. A few reason.   1. I don't want them waiting around at the hospital... it could take ages!! 2. I don't want them wanting to come in straight after 3. I want the time with just the 3 of us and for it to be relaxed without the pressure of knowing our families are waiting to come meet her.  I know those reasons are all similar and just feed off one another but I just would feel uncomfortable with them waiting around if I'm not ready for people to come in. My partner wants them there though and thinks I'm being selfish.  I just feel like depending on the time e.g. I gave birth in the morning they can wait until the night or if I gave birth at night they can wait until the next morning to meet the baby.  I don't know. He got very annoyed about my opinion and didn't want to talk about it anymore... so no resolution on our end.
260	2	I'm a bad person for confessing this, I know. But I need to get it out. This guy terrorised me every day as a kid, he broke my glasses and beat me up more times than I can count, he use to follow me back to my aunt's house and wait outside with a club like stick, to beat me with. He died on new years day, the day before my birthday, from a drug overdose. Everyone is upset about it and are calling him their hero, there was a massive funeral for him, the football team showed up and there was an article about it in the local newspaper. And all I could think was "karma finally got him, of all the years he terrorised me he's not going to anymore". I'm expecting a lot of hate for this, like I said I know I'm a bad person for this but I had to get it out.
112	2	So I'm graduating and I was getting gifts from all my various family members. My dad gave me this piece of wood that he had cut from a beaver chewed log. He had written congratulations on graduating on it and some other stuff with pen. He said it was very meaningful to him because he was on a spiritual journey when he made it. I tried to keep a happy face but I was a bit crushed. I still haven't gotten my Christmas present he promised me and his birthday present was just an egg carton, some soil, and some seeds. I don't wanna sound ungrateful. When he saw my face, he was crushed. So I pretended the reason I wasn't happy looking was because my eyes were burning. Am I the asshole for not being grateful?
265	2	My girlfriend and I originally planned to do Thanksgiving at my parents house and Christmas at hers. When Thanksgiving came around her family went in to meltdown mode, calling her a traitor, threatening to take things from her or kick her out (she's in grad school) if she came to my holiday. They said it was "inappropriate to go to your SO's holiday if you aren't married."   Flash forward to today. I work nights, and work tonight and worked last night. She still wants me to come see her (about an hour drive each direction) today. I would like to go but feel awkward (due to Thanksgiving situation) plus it really cuts into my time for sleeping.   On the other hand my roommate's family has invited me to their house for dinner since I can't go to my own home. They live about 15 minutes from where I live.  Will I be the asshole for telling my girlfriend I don't want to go to her house today? And will I be an asshole for going to my roommates?  Late edit: She wants me to come after they eat dinner so I'm not "going to the holiday" officially. I feel like this is crazy. Lmk.
193	1	Throwaway account for obvious reasons  I work at a large but ridiculously understaffed animal daycare, for people who are super intent on breaking every labor law in the book.   Cutting paychecks? Yup. Making people work an illegal amount of hours? Yup. Having their son work all of the time-and-a-half shifts? Yup.   I had asked for time off a month in advance, and assumed they’d seen my email. Apparently not (even though they responded to another email of mine 10 minutes later). I’ve missed my family as I live far away from home, and I was really looking forward to family time.   Not only did they not give me time off, *they made me, along with everyone else, work the day after our coworker was found dead, made a bunch of people skip the funeral, and then went to see his family despite him hating both of them and not wanting them there.* Real genuinely evil shit.  They’re also filthy rich. Filthy fucking rich. They bought a TV “for the office” (aka their family) and have kept it around in an animal-frequented room for months (beats the fuck out of me as to why they’d do that). It’s enormous, expensive, and completely useless in it’s current state.  I was wandering around pulling an overnight shift, when I decided I was fed up. That’s when it hit me.  *The TV is in a room with me and a bunch of animals that frequently piss on things.*  So I did what any normal person would do; I peed on their fucking television. They’re not on reddit, and there’s no way they’ll be able to tell if an animal or dog did it.  I pissed on their TV.  I pissed on their fucking TV and I have no regrets.
432	1	Before I met my wife I lived in an apartment on my own and I just had a couch, a desk, a bed, a TV and a couple of framed portraits; that's about it. We got married last year and after that we moved in together. Since then she has been putting pillows and rugs everywhere. She buys these weird clocks, trinkets and figurines and puts them all around the house. It is a little annoying when I get home from work and have to to scuffle through the entry so that my bag doesn't knock stuff off cabinets and stuff like that but all in all I actually really like it. I pretend that I don't but it does feel a lot nicer and more comfortable just being at home. I still like the simple apartment that I used to have but our home does feel a lot more... well, homely.  [Light]
352	3	So my son moved back in with me because of the pandemic (he had to take a pay cut.) This isn't really an issue because we get along great and I raised him alone. I also have a big enough house that he he has more of his own space. I'm 43, he's 24.  My basement is a makeshift boxing gym. I have some free weights, punching bags, and boxing gloves, among other things. So when my son moved back in we both decided this could be a fun way to stay in shape and bond. We practice a few times a week.  Yesterday, we were sparring (no holds barred but we were wearing boxing headgear) and I guess I didn't wrap my glove tightly enough, because it fell off and I didn't notice and neither did my son.   So I go to punch, he gives me this deer-in-the-headlights look, like OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and then I punched him, bare knuckled, in the face, without holding back.  He has a broken nose. I have two broken fingers.  TL;DR: Absolutely lit my son's shit up with a full-strength punch and now we're both out of commission for a few weeks. Also, I bought new boxing gloves. And duct tape. I still feel bad but he isn't upset, and we've been laughing telling other people the story.
396	2	Okay, here me out.  My friend group always gets together and pools in money to get the person who's birthday it is a big gift that they've been wanting, but can't afford.   My birthday came and went and nothing came. Not even as much as a "Happy Birthday" card from any of  them.  I know its something trivial to bitch about but they said because I make more money than most of them combined, that I shouldn't expect to have the "poorer" people in the group put money towards a gift for the "rich guy" of the group.
320	2	A few years ago my daughter begged for an American Girl Doll. They are crazy expensive plus all the extra clothes and accessories and I just couldn’t afford it. She was also 5 and probably wouldn’t take care of it. I bought her a “fake” one at Target. The My Generation Doll. I told her that it was an American Girl Doll and since she didn’t read(at the time) she didn’t know it was a fake one. She loved the doll and she still refers to it as an American Girl. She was invited to a birthday tea party and its theme is “American Girl” and it says to bring your doll. She’s 8 now and she’s probably going to discover her “American Girl” is a fake. I now feel like an asshole for lying to her.
25	3	My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. At some point early in our relationship he told me that the reason he and his ex broke up is because she cheated on him with one of his friends. He was with his ex for three (four?) years. He was still hurt over it when I met him and it was pretty difficult for me to convince him to actually be intimate with me because he was afraid of getting hurt again. I had no idea who the guy was and I never thought to ask.  Fast forward to about three weeks ago and my boyfriend tells me that this guy got hired at his work. Yesterday he came home with a bloody nose/lip because they apparently got into a fight after work. I don't know exactly what happened because he refuses to talk to me about it but I looked at his facebook and the other guy is being tagged in posts by some of his friends. So I look at the guy's profile and it's the guy that I lost my virginity to in college. We only knew each other for about two weeks in which time he told me that it was love at first sight, convinced me to have sex with him and then cut me off. I didn't tell him that I was a virgin at the time because I didn't want him to think I was inexperienced. It was really traumatic for me because he literally just used me for sex and that's it. I don't even know if he'd remember me.  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell my boyfriend or not. I'm hoping that after their boss finds out about what happened he'll get fired and we won't ever hear from him again.  [Conflicted]
117	2	So basically I work a job that requires me to wear tactical boots. Ive been working this job for over a year and a half and I had a pair that has a zipper on the inside of the boot which was super convenient. Recently those boots bit the dust so I purchased a new pair that requires me to actually tie them. Yesterday I had a bit of a mishap when I went to untie them when I got home from a 12 hour shift. I went to untie the triple knotted lace and somehow it got even more tight. I tried for several minutes to release the knot but it would not budge. After about 15 minutes of trying (no joke. 15 minutes) I had to swollow my pride and call my mother to the front of the house where she had to untie the knot herself. At the moment I felt that I was useless. But looking back I know that every once and a while I know you just need your mother.  Edit: This post has only been up for about twenty minutes or so but I've gotten a few replies already. Most of the replies are in regards to me not being embarrassed. It's not that I'm embarrassed it's the fact that where I am at right now in my life I think I'm subconsciously trying to push myself away because I know in a year or less I'm going to be moving out. And maybe I don't want it to hurt as much? So I push away and think I don't need her when In fact I, and I'm sure lots of you, will always need a mother in their lives.
486	1	I have anxiety and it makes it hard to sleep. There is a website called Earthcam.com that plays live feeds from different places in the world but my favorite is Bourbon street in New Orleans. People are constantly on camera drinking, dancing and singing karaoke. I have seen fights break out, men trying to pick up women and failing, and women trying to pick up men and failing.I have seen success stories and many people making out. I know its pathetic but I don’t get out much. I feel like part of something when I watch, It’s kind of like I get to be a part of peoples lives, even if its for a little bit.
509	1	When I was fresh out of high school I worked as a server at a local Pizza Hut. Being that I was technically a "tipped" employee my base wage was $3 and some change.   Unfortunately for me, some nights I would only walk out with 10 to 20 dollars in my pocket. Although my overhead was low and I didnt really have bills, that wasnt enough money for me. After a while of scraping by I came up with a plan - a plan that netted me more money than my managers were making.  I did this by working the carry out window and adding coupons to the customer's bill without them knowing.   So let's say somebody ordered two large pizzas and breadsticks and their total was $37.50. I would add a coupon that would bring the total down to $20.71. They would pay me with exact change or in this instance, $40.00.   I would then calculate the change in my head and give them what they thought was due to them. At the end of the night as I was counting my drawer I would take out all of the money I had "saved" the customers. Luckily the store was old and didn't have cameras.   Over the course of a night I could easily make over $100, on busy nights closer to 2 or 3. After a while all coupons used were required to be stapled to receipts so I would cut out the coupons from the stack in the back of the office and use those.  I ended up quitting and told a co-worker of the same trick, netting him decent money in my absence and in turn he would give me free weed.
330	2	[Conflicted] Sorry for formatting. On Mobile.  Well. I've gotten myself in really deep shit and need to talk about it.  Two years ago I found out one of my Childhoodfriends is addicted to heroin. We lost contact after elementary. Saw a Girl my age on the Sidewalk , obviously homeless. And recognised the Birthmark or whatever you call it in English on her cheek.  After I sat down we talked for a Long time. To make it short her Life was hell and she ended up doing heroin with 16.   Arround one year ago she wanted to get sober. So me and some mutual friends gave her a place to sleep and withdrawl. Skyrim is surprisingly effective when it comes to distracting someone. After one month she went to work. Some time later she had a place for herself. Untill old "friends" of her contacted her again and teased her with free drugs. Yes. People are apperently assholes. So we decided to do something against it. Over the next few weeks we begann collecting information on most dealers in our area. Everybody who knew her and who sells more then weed. Followed them home and made Hidden videos of their deals. Eventually we made clear that if they ever sell to her again everything will be made Public.  Maybe 4 months ago one of thoose "friends"called again and asked if she wanted anything. We did what we promised, he is now in Jail for possesion of Heroin with intend to distribute amongst other things. And I feel Conflicted as hell about it. I probably ruined his life for her safety.
892	3	So this actually happened today, like 2  hours ago.  Ive been in a relationship for about 18 months now. And we have had kind of a dry spell when it comes to the hanky panky time. A little over a  month to be exact. Finally things have started to be less stressful in our lives. We both have jobs again, and money is flowing in.  So to celeberate our first pay checks this week, I decided to cook a romantic candle lit dinner for us. Everything was going great. We started cuddling on the couch watching her favorite rom-com, and the foreplay starts. YES! Dry spell is gonna be over!  So we get up and head to the bed, things start to get really hot and steamy. She goes to find a condom and I get the music playing. So I find a good playlist on my phone and press play. Only issue is I still had shuffle selected from my work out earlier today...  Things are going smooth as butter, the deed is being done and everyone was having a pleasent time. Then the [Mii Channel theme](https://youtu.be/E9s1ltPGQOo) started playing....  I tried my hardest to ignore it, my Girlfriend started to snicker. And before I knew it my head started to bob to the beat of the music. At that point she bursts out laughing and the beast with two backs was no more.   TL;DR: Was having sex, mii channel theme started playing, no more sex.  PS: Gonna give it another shot here soon. Shuffle is for sure off.
466	1	The other day I caught her on the 5th page of google with one of my usernames on it. She pretty much confessed to it as well as stated how she found some "awful shit" on me.  Turns out there was an explicit site where someone happened to make the same account name as I do on a few other sites. But regardless I'm currently pretty pissed at her for stalking my usernames and (she admitted to it) my email named as well.  Am I the asshole for seriously holding this against her?
302	3	This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, but when I was younger in my early teens, I was 14, I did some really stupid shit. I came from a poor family, not that that's any excuse, and I had greed. I wanted nice things, mostly online games, so I found a forum where people posted credit card numbers and the corresponding info. I used it to buy some games, but then due to it being illegitimate, my account was shutdown. This was a period of a few weeks I did this before my account was shut down, but that was my wake up call. This was a period of a few weeks.  &amp;#x200B;  The biggest problem was I didn't really think what I did through, or how it would impact others. I just thought free stuff for me, and that was that. I didn't realize the other person impacted could be ruined by what I did. This happened about 5 years ago now, and for the first year after, all I could think about was what a terrible person I was. Not to minimize what I did, but I used it as a learning experience, which has made me more empathetic to others, more mindful of what my actions can do to someone else.  &amp;#x200B;  I just needed to get this off of my conscience. I hope that in someway that experience has made me a better person, despite how bad what I did was. I've never told anyone this and I don't think I ever will. But I think what I did went beyond being "just a dumb kid" that's why I needed to get it off my chest.
920	2	I manage a store and one of my customers started emailing me about wanting his 16 year old daughter to get a job here. I sent him an application and told him to have her send it back to me. He sent it back to me a day later. And he has emailed me two or three times in the past 10 days to check on it. I've yet to even speak to or see his daughter.   I honestly have absolutely 0 interest in meeting with this girl because I have a stack of applications filled out by fully functioning adults who applied on their own accord rather than with Daddy's direction. I'm going to interview her solely because I don't want to upset an annoyingly persistent yet well-paying customer, but I've already made up my mind that I'm not hiring her.  Am I the asshole?
664	3	When I was in 4th grade I saw my mom (who was married to my dad) kiss a family friend (also married with kids who went to my school) passionately on the lips at a small house party. I wasn’t too phased by it at the time. I already knew there was something going on between them and as a 4th grader I didn’t really understand what cheating was, or that it was a really big deal in marriages.  I ended up telling my group of friends about it on the playground and I named names. They knew the man as well. They were a very well known, well-loved family.   That night my one friend tells her mom what I said and the next day my mom gets a call asking if it was true. When my mom came into my bedroom to ask me what I had said on the playground, and if I had used the word “affair” (I had) I totally panicked, I could tell from the tone of her voice, the seriousness of it, that I had done something really really bad. I vividly remember the dread I felt about this. I was already afraid of my mother’s anger and rages over small things and this was the worst thing I had ever done. So I lied and said that I hadn’t said anything. That night I remember the massive knot in my stomach from fear and I thought to myself that I wish I didn’t have to wake up the next morning. I was a wreck for weeks. My mom asked me three times if I was sure I was telling the truth, and I said yes all three times.  I learned, after confessing the truth to my mom over 5 years later, in high school, that apparently everyone had believed my story and thought that my friend, the other girl, was just making up stories. I feel so bad to this day when I think of it.
280	3	We have a bidet next to the toilet that can spray cold and hot water. Usually it takes a while to heat up so I can turn it on hot full blast and it's safe.   I was running a bath while on the toilet and had no clue that the tap water for the bath being hot meant that the bidet water was super hot instantly. I done my usual thing and turned the bidet on full blast, full heat to clean myself thinking it would heat up slowly like it normally does but I could not have been more wrong.  Suddenly I felt a intense pain as scolding hot water directly shot directly at my chocolate starfish. The bidet is pretty low down so even thought I reacted as fast as I could I probably got sprayed for around 1.5 seconds while leant forward and stood up! I'm a man in my mid 20's and I consider myself to tolerate pain pretty well but I let out a the highest pitch scream from the shock and pain and almost started to cry!   As I type this I can still feel a intense burning / stinging pain even after turning the bidet to as cold as it can go and cooling the area for probably close to 20 minutes. I have been afraid to sit down since the incident and instead been laying on my side or stomach. I'm honestly terrified for work tomorrow because I sit at a desk all day. I have not been to the toilet since this happen but next time I need to wipe I hope if there is a God they have mercy on me.   TLDR: Turns out my bidet shoots hot water instantly instead of heating up slowly if you've had any hot tap in the bathroom running. I done my usual thing and turned the water on full power full heat and pretty much gave myself a hot water enima
673	1	This might be the most cursed thing to ever happen to me.  So after reading the original TIFU and the one after where people lose their shit upon learning about Bob Ross’ death, I thought it would be a great idea to tell my grandpa about these two stories to make him laugh.  Luckily, he had known about his death already, and he started busting out laughing. But then as I got up to tell grandma, he stopped dead in his tracks and sternly told me NEVER to tell grandma that story.  Visibly concerned, I asked him why not. He then went on to confess how many times he’s cheated on his wife, using the excuse that he’d been “hanging out” with Bob Ross for painting lessons, only problem is that he’d been dead for about 2 years the last time he pulled this on her.   Let’s just day I see my grandpops in an entirely different light now. He did compensate me with $50, but I definitely deserve a lot more for that kind of mental scarring.  TL;DR: told my grandpa a reddit story, found out he’s a dirty cheater. Came out $50 richer, would not do it again.  Edit: people are saying they would like to tell their close ones about these stories. To that I say, more power to you. I just hope you don’t ruin someone’s day, or your own. Be sure to tell us what happens.
862	1	I told this story to my girlfriend and she insists that I was the asshole.   I was at a redbox and had already ordered my disk so I just needed to swipe my card and pick up the game. When I got there, there was a woman shopping rather leisurely on the kiosk and taking her time. Shortly after I got in line a woman came in line behind me so now there was a woman taking her sweet time with no regard for the people behind her, me, and another woman.   The woman took about 4 minutes to finally make a purchase. When she finished, the woman behind me asks “Is it ok if I get in front of you? I just have a return? And holds up her disk to show me that she just needed to return an item.”   I respond, “no, I’ll just go ahead and go”. And did not let her cut in front of me. I got my disk in under 25 seconds and walked off.   My girlfriend insist that I should have let the woman in front of me because she had no way of knowing that I was going to be so quick. But I say, while it would have been very polite to let her in front of me, it’s not wrong to stay in line, and I also add, why is her time more valuable than mine that she gets to cut in line?
950	1	So I have a friend who just wants me and his other friend to get on. Problem being that we met before and we hate each other. I made this well known, as did she, that we have no intention of getting on. (She thinks I stole her bf which i didnt, we were and still remain friends. She hoped I would get beaten. Seemed pretty self explanatory of why we hate each other)   My 'friend' didn't seem to understand that neither of us were willing to be friends and instead, without either of us knowing, put us into a group chat together.   Obviously, things went south QUICKLY and we both ended up fully blocking each other. Afterwards, I told my 'friend' that if thats the kind of shit he wants to pull he can f*** off and be friends with just her. I wasn't gunna be around him.   Now I have him telling me I'm a horrible friend and saying he just wants us to get on, that I shouldn't be treating him like that. He doesnt seem to think hes done anything wrong.  He thinks im overreacting to something that can be 'solved' if I just apologise for what I did. (Not her btw for being jealous of a friend or wishing me harm, but me for being a friend) I think he needs to start listening to people when they show clear hatred to others and not try to force something.  Tl:DR - friend tries to push me and a girl I hate to be friends, gets unfriended and tries to make it out like I should apologise to both of them.
800	3	I'm a new nurse and am making mistakes. The culture at my work is to really put people through the ringer and scrutinize mistakes. So... I'm just always on edge.  So the other week I was trying to draw blood on a person. I took the needle out because I couldn't hit their vein, and they started bleeding a lot. So I fumbled to get some gauze and I felt the needle stick my wrist.  The patient didn't notice and I calmly left to freak out in the restroom. I saw that the needle stuck me through my glove and I was bleeding. I never reported it. I hope I don't catch anything.
164	1	I have two grandchildren. One is seven and the other is five. The seven year old is the child of my daughter and I do have more access to her, but despite what my son's girlfriend accuses me of, i do not have a favorite. The seven year old does beauty pageants. They are completely her choice, but she saw pictures from her mother and I doing them and begged to be in them. She also rides horses. Combined this is very expensive and I pay for it all. I've offered and I am happy to do so.  My son's girlfriend is morally opposed to pageants and afraid of horses. Her daughter has asked to do what her cousin does but isn't allowed to. She does tee ball and music lessons, which I also pay for but they are significantly cheaper than what the seven year old does. The other day my son's girlfriend brought up this "favoritism" I said it isn't favoritism, because I pay for two activities for both of them. She said it is going to give her daughter a "complex" so I need to even the money off and put the rest in a savings account. My husband and I laughed because that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and she stormed out of the house. My son actually said I should post this because he is conflicted (afraid of her). So am I the asshole?
172	3	So this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.    Recently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I'd go along.   So anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says "first rule of chess, whites go first."   I think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition.   So I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I'm met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching.   I then realize my error "oooh you meant the pieces" I murmur.  The teacher nods.   Now everyone thinks I'm a massive racist.  TL : DR whites go first in chess refers to the pieces and not the people playing
72	3	God I hate myself. Planning on paying it back lump-sum as a gift, but the fact that I just straight-out wasted it sucks. It could be worse I suppose. Also about $600 of steam games that I haven't played them back for.   Guilt is a bitch. A resolvable bitch.
298	2	I was vegan when we started living together but I gave up since then and I started stealing anything I can get my hands on. They never suspect me because they think I wouldn't eat those items.  Never been even close to being caught.   I always make sure to cook when nobody is home or to hide packaging and wrappers in my trash.  It's more about the fact that I can do it without consequences that makes me do it. Nobody complained about missing food items more that a couple of times so I dont think I am that much of a nuisance.
851	1	Happened a couple of hours ago.   I’ve been playing this game I stumbled across recently.  You know the ones, free, highly addictive, but jam packed full of advertising.   Anyhows, I thought I was an absolute champion when I scored 34 earlier today. The first thing I thought of was boasting to my boy when he came home from pre school since he likes the game too. I was all in his face like “I’m the Game King”.    I figured my 5 year old had no chance of beating my score as the highest I’d seen him get was a measly 21 - and he fluked it, so I told him I’d give him $100 (Australian) if he could beat my score.   Never underestimate the power of a huge financial incentive. I heard uncontrollable laughter about 15 minutes later. Sure enough the little guy had cracked my high score. 38.   Parents of Reddit will understand you can’t go back on your word with children. His piggy bank just got $100 fatter and I’ve had to put up with “I’m pretty good aren’t I Dad?!”  :)  TL;DR Got cocky, told my boy I’d give him a $100 if he beat my high score. He did. Never underestimate children and the power of a financial incentive.    Edit: understandably my original post was removed by mod. Made some small changes so it didn’t appear that I was an advertising genius.
190	1	This one is short, and I kind of got some backlash after telling my story to some friends.  So I was watching scary movies at my house last night and handing out candy as is tradition. Well my doorbell rings, I grab my box of candy, and open the door to greet the trick or treaters. As soon as the door opens a kid reaches into my house (not gonna lie, it was only about a foot into my house but I still didn't appreciate it) and tries to dig his dirty little hands inside my box of candy. The kid was trying to take multiple full sized candy bars so I pull the box away and say "Woah buddy, wait for me to toss the candy in your bag." His mom standing behind him says "Are you being serious? he was just getting some candy!" and I said "Yes I am serious, and it's my job to hand out the candy" and then the lady immediately starts to bitch me out, and I cut her off with "oh, fuck off lady" and close the door, of course giving no candy to the kid. My roommate heard the whole exchange and thought it was humorous, but other friends thought I was an ass for not giving the kid candy and then cussing at his mom.   Was I the asshole?
640	3	My wife and I drove separately to church on Sunday but left together in my car, intending to pick up hers later in the day. Fast forward to tonight (Wednesday) and we still had not made it back to pick up the second car.  So finally tonight I call an Uber when the kids are asleep and sure enough the car is not in the parking lot. I Uber back home and call the local police department, they had no record of it being towed so I report the vehicle as stolen. They send two officers to my house to get my statement, I'm stressing about insurance coverage and feeling shitty for not just getting it sooner.  It's 11:30 and I'm getting into bed, and I make some comment to my wife about how they had the parking lot locked up... her: "I parked on the street, not in the lot".  So I fucked up by not confirming where the car had been parked or walking the 50 steps to check the street before getting the police involved. Sorry for wasting your time officer Ortiz!  So I just took an Uber back to the church and the car is right where she left it. I called the police department again to tell them my mistake and they made it very clear that I should not get in the car because it is still in their system as stolen. I'm currently sitting outside at 1am waiting for a call from the officer to give me the go ahead to drive home.  TL;DR: didn't know where my wife parked the car, reported it as stolen.
113	1	It’s become a habit at this point to look for basically any fruit trees that are close enough that I can swipe once they are ripe. At this point I’ve probably made an entire map in my head of where all the best fruit trees are in my town.   Every morning I swipe a fruit for the walk to school and constantly exploring new areas for more. If I see a good lemon you sure bet Im jumping the fence for it, I’m literally a human fruit fly with no regrets
847	2	My wife and her entire nuclear family are on a trip to Europe for 11 days. Spouses and kids were *specifically* not invited (or allowed to come, even if we wanted to pay for ourselves). The notion of the trip originally made me pretty upset, and everyone I’ve talked to about it so far agrees that it’s a weird concept to go on a family trip like this (as adults) without spouses. AITA?
256	2	A couple of days ago my son got admitted to a Children's Hospital. Yesterday one of his doctors came in with two medical students, she introduced herself but the med students did not. While I was talking with the doctor the med students went to my son, who was sleeping in his crib, and started to examine him. Obviously this woke him up but at first I was just gonna go with it and keep my mouth shut. Then, still without saying a single word to me, they started to take his diaper off. I told the doctor to excuse me for a second and told the med students that they needed to leave the room immediately. One of them asked me why and I told them that they hadn't introduced themselves to me in any way, had never received my permission to touch my child(let alone take his diaper off), and therefore were not welcome in his room. The doctor was upset but I don't know if it was directed at me or the med students. Am I the asshole or was the way they presented themselves less than ideal?
288	1	My roommate and I (both 20f) don’t know each other that well. We have mutual friends who both knew we needed roommates at the beginning of the year, so set us up. We’re not in the apartment at the same time very often, so I wouldn’t say we’re friends, but we don’t dislike each other.   At the beginning of last week, my roommate told me she was going to go back to her hometown (about 2 hours away) because her dad was sick and she wanted to be with her family. I said okay, see you when you’re back, the usual. That night, I invited my boyfriend over and we ended up getting a bit drunk, which resulted in him puking red wine all over my bed. It was like 3am at this point, and I was tipsy, so I dragged him over to my roommates bed and we both fell asleep.   The next morning my boyfriend went home, but I was hungover and didn’t want to wash my sheets yet, so I just stayed in my roommates bed. I ended up sleeping and staying in my roommates bed for the rest of the week.   She came back to the apartment on Monday whilst I was out shopping, and I came back to her questioning as to why there was a phone charger on her bed. I told her that I’d been sleeping in her bed because of the red wine puke, expecting her to just find it amusing, but she was absolutely disgusted and called me a slob because I didn’t wash my sheets. She then demanded I change her sheets because my boyfriend and I had both slept in them and I refused saying they were hers so she should clean them. She’s now saying that I crossed a line and that she’s going to start looking for a new roommate. AITA?
774	1	Early last year, one of my college "best friends" told me that she was getting engaged before she told anyone else knew because she wanted to hire my mom as her wedding planner. A couple of days later, she got engaged and told all of our friends that my mom (a professional wedding planner) would plan her wedding, all good until that point. After a couple of meetings with my mom, Lucy (fictional name of my friend) stopped responding to my mom, and I noticed by a WhatsApp group that she hired all my mom's vendors directly without even telling us - she chose June 2021 as her wedding date. I let that one go because I didn't want to ruin her wedding.   Last November, I also got engaged and chose September 2021 as my wedding date to give our friends some time between the two weddings, especially because mine is out of town. Later on, I found AGAIN BY A GROUP that she had postponed her wedding to the day after mine! Of course, I was furious and I had no problem letting her know that time. She finally contacted me and explained that she had no money for the wedding in June and the day after my wedding was the only available date this whole year in her venue - again, that my mom showed to her (without a contract just because she was my friend).   To be honest, I don't buy it. But now I'm the asshole in our friend's group because I uninvited her and was "rude" to her and "it was not her fault because she has no job". I still feel like she is not the kind of person you call your friend and does not give me the energy I want to have on my wedding day.   AITA for this?
773	2	So I’ve been delivering for dash dash on the side for a few weeks now. Today I had a typical order from a local sushi joint. I saw the order for a fellow named Tom...funny thing the second half of the order is EXACTLY TO THE TEE what my gf ALWAYS gets. Two dragon rolls extra Siracha on the side and a large Ice Tee. She is very particular! She also has a co-worker named Tom she has mentioned AND she said she spent the night up in Denver with her sister last night for a girls night. Hmmmmmm....Picked up the order and was on my way. Pulled up to a waaaaaay nice apartments knocked on the door and a very handsome fellow named Tom answered. Handed him the food and heard a familiar voice say “Make sure there’s  Siracha!” It was my now ex gf in a T-Shirt and panties. I said nothing she said nothing... door closed and well now I’m single! And onto me next Dash better make that money if I’m going to be back on Tinder. TLDR delivered a Door Dash to my now ex gf while she was cheating on me with her coworker. Tall Handsome man with a nice ass apartment.
15	1	Today I was sitting at a local redlight I know all too well when BAM! What do I see? A poor, unsuspecting grasshopper staring back at me from the other side of the glass. I shoot him a quick flick clicking the windshield in the process but it only ends in a throbbing fingernail. Grasshopper unphased.  Time for plan B. As the light turns green, I survey the surroundings and giddily determine that the coast is clear, passionately pushing the pedal plum into the floorboard, revving my V4 for all she’s worth, VROOOM! 10mph...15mph....my new buddy isn’t budging. As several more seconds pass and 20 turns into 25..30..35..40! Oh Crap. Blue lights. I stoically pull over, glaring at the grasshopper one last time while awaiting my fate. He smirks back with those squinty little eyes.  Uh, yes sir, I do know it’s a 25 MPH school zone. Why was I speeding? Well, tbh I was seeing how fast I could go before that grasshopper would slide off. Cop follows my gaze to the grasshopper... Looks back at me. Back at the smirking grasshopper. 4 seconds of suspenseful anticipation pass and as I’m frantically trying to come up with a better excuse, the officer interrupts my thoughts by dying with laughter. I nervously chuckle back and gratefully press onward with my business.  TL;DR Got pulled over because a grasshopper made me do it. Wouldn’t leave no matter how fast I went
464	3	I think I'm embarrassed by the fact that I sounded (and looked) like an old woman beating off a purse thief while trying to defend my home.     Whereas I should have grabbed my sword and swash buckled this guy into submission  until the cops arrived.. I actually screamed like a little girl and flailed my arms out the window like a weirdo until the guy ran away..     I don't know if this is a win or a fail. Lol
18	3	I was washing the dishes, when I dropped a very sharp knife which I normally use for cutting my favorite foods. For a split second, I thought it was no big deal, because I could pick it up, but then I felt THE WORST pain I have ever felt in my entire life.  The pain was in my foot, and when I looked down, I saw the knife was stuck in my foot. Not deep, but about a centimeter in. It still hurt as hell.  I had to pull the knife out, which resulted in even more pain. I put a bandaid on it, and continued washing. But I had to go to bed earlier due to the unbearable pain.  When I woke up, there was a small blood puddle by my injured foot, but it felt better. I switched the Band-Aid with a new one, and got up. It was still a little painful, but like I said, it was way better than the pain that I have had experienced the day before.  TLDR: Dropped knife on my foot while dish washing, it got stuck. Ended up ruining yesterday and today.
86	1	My mom (50F) and I (22F) are not close. When my stepdad died, she got his name tattooed on her body. Recently, she decided to get her children's initials tattooed on her, as well.  The issue is that my entire life (and well documented over a decade) I have wanted to change my name. When my mom was pregnant, the doctor told her I was a boy.  I was supposed to be named after my father. His name (as an example) is X-Y Last Name. They chose X-W Last Name, so the first half of my first name was supposed to be the same. When I was born and turned out to be a girl, they panicked and gave me a shitty name. Essentially, my name is Jessica Simpson Nguyen.   My other siblings have beautiful/appropriate cultural names. I'm the only one who got a name after an American celebrity. What's worse is that I don't even like this celebrity, AND the celebrity goes by a stage name. My parents have always joked about how they only gave me that name because the hospital tv was playing something with her in it when they were trying to pick a name.  My passport expired this year, so I started the process of changing my name to something I personally like. After I already shelled out for it, my sister informed me that my mom got a tattoo of our names.   My mom's side of the family is mad and want me to "take back" the name change paperwork, but I honestly don't want to. Their argument is that my mom got a permanent tattoo that features that name and that I should just tell people I want to go by my chosen name (which is another English name but less abhorrent to me)  AITA?
73	2	So she came in to visit me while I was working and ate lunch, but I went in the back for a moment and when I came out she was gone. She hadn’t paid or anything. My boss was mad at me because of it and I ended up paying for the meal. When I called her on it she acted like I was the dick for being mad. I got super pissed and stopped talking to her for a while. Now it’s been like 4 months and I’m still pretty mad but I feel like maybe I should be over it by now.
690	3	This happened about 4 years ago.  I wanted some grilled cheese.  I recalled seeing a life hack with this photo: https://imgur.com/gallery/Yg4iP  I happily turned my toaster on its side, popped in the bread with the cheese and went to the bathroom.  1 minute later I hear my mother yell "What's burning!?" followed instantly by our smoke alarm going off.  I rush back into the kitchen only to find in my horror that the toaster is on fire.  My mother rushes in, gasps and says "What the hell did you do!"  At this point I'm fumbling trying to figure out what to say and what to do about my fiery toaster.  "I JUST WANTED SOME GRILLED CHEESE IM SORRY"  She quickly filled up a bowl of water and I unplugged it from the power. She then poured it over and out it went.  It's a bit fuzzy, but I 'think' at least one of those slices wasn't wet or burnt. I believe I ate it as she threw the toaster outside.  Nothing else was damaged except for the counter. There was a burnt spot in it which I still see when I go to visit my family every month.  TL;DR : I tried to make grilled cheese by putting my toaster on its side. It caught on fire and burnt the counter.
34	3	Today I was working at Bizarro at Six Flags Great Adventure in NJ as a loader and height-checker. I was height checking the next group of people and I found a girl in a red shirt that wasn’t tall enough. I told her mother that her daughter wasn’t tall enough to ride and that her daughter had to wait at the exit. As I was checking restraints, I noticed the girl again and checked her seat. I noticed that it was snug against her body and assumed that it was tight enough that she wouldn’t fall out. I then continued checking the rest of the train and gave the all clear to the operator to send the train. A few minutes later her train flew into the final brake run and into the Transfer Block. When it did I heard a high pitched, feminine scream. As the train entered the station, I saw that the girl was fine. A few minutes later I get called down to the office and I had a talk with my operations supervisor and had to fill out a witness report. I was put on disciplinary suspension and was escorted out of the park. I am currently writing this as I’m waiting for a cab.   TL;DR: Let a kid on a rollercoaster who was too short to ride and am currently suspended from work.  Edit1: I should probably include some information about myself. I am a 17 year old male who has been working at Six Flags Great Adventure for just under a year. (Started in late August 2020)
994	2	AITA for not wanting to care for my boyfriend?  Me (23 F) and my boyfriend (24 M) have been together for a few months, but yesterday when I came to his apartment, he was acting very childish. I told him to knock it off and he burst into tears. I got pissed off so I left. I went back earlier today, and he said that he age regresses as a coping mechanism (for those who don’t know, its basically where someone mentally regresses to a younger age to cope with trauma). He then asked me if I would be okay with taking care of him while he was in this mental state. Apparently, it happens multiple times a week. I might have considered saying yes, however, I am an elementary school teacher and I frequently babysit my niece and nephew. He was basically my only escape from children, and I don’t even think I’d be comfortable treating him like a child while still being in a relationship. Our relationship has been pretty casual, and I don’t think he’d be too upset if I broke up with him, but I’d still feel terrible.  ***I’m very stressed at the moment and I used the wrong tense at the end, I did break up with him.
