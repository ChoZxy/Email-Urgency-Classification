kiB6ByG9PYQLHmGpg5SGZw	casual	This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?  Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.  You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge.   If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often.   Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded.   This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...
q9WaFYhlOZCrfXJQTG5t_Q	casual	"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good.   I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.   Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.   Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review."
Q5ZD7ZAs96NAVblFDV476g	casual	Let the attack of the Blue Hairs begin! You simply cannot eat here without being shoulder checked by retiree's from Sun City West & Sun City Grand. They must get to the scrambled eggs before you do, because YOU may take all of them. The food - yeah, it's basically OK for a buffet. The selection is pretty good, the food is hot, and some of it is even tasty. The tables are jammed in to make more room for the elderly and to maximize profits. And it is your typical buffet decor. Did I mention that the old farts are like professional hockey players when they get near a buffet? It is like in a room full of food suddenly becoming afraid that you won't get what you want to eat. It is ABSURD! Go if you must, but bring some attitude and some shoulder pads. Watch out for old farts. Wear an Obama shirt, that should really get em pissed at ya.
OEQMqI-duBA1gbBFzi7BPw	fine	Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasa's, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings. Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb). Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains. Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, 2 types of cheesecake, and 2 types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note. There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however, that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. I'm sure we'll be back for special occasions.
pwpl-rxwNRQdgqFz_-qMPg	casual	I dig this place. I have only ever eaten here for lunch, but I have been here a kabillion times, and I love it. The only 2 negatives are the parking and the SEMI-cash-only situation. Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25! A lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay. I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think they're a little gruff. Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub. The best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had. The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth. Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice. It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy. It's served with uber-fresh basil as well. There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy. Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10. (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!) The other key choice is the pizza. I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza. I am suprised to say that it's really great! The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy. My advice is to try it. Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch. Carpool. Bring cash. Smell the air when you walk in. Order the pizza. Make plans to go back and try the Italiano. ;)
T4XMgqYiEsALBW_st6diUg	casual	"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me.   When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice.   I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that.   I don't visit Golden Spoon as often as I'd like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime I'm in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!"
s26P-jeVUH9TjnTPQttPag	casual	I've been visiting, and thinking, and visiting again, and thinking, and finally, after a long deliberation, I am ready to issue a verdict.   Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage.   Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen.   If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability.   Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you!   Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been.   Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.

This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.  Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as ""hard rock"" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well.   Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters."

It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)   This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though.

IGrp61aiyR-PtL581brrcg	fast	"I like Blu Burger.  If you're a burger lover and like to have it ""your way,"" this is a great choice for you.  There's a lot of competition in the ""gourmet burger"" market these days.  Delux is the Phoenix original and I'm a big fan.  Stax (in Old Town) is also very good.  I mention these others because, while I like Blu Burger, I wouldn't drive from Old Town all the way up to N. Scottsdale for it....I'd just go to Stax.  And, vice versa.  Blu Burger holds its own and does a great job, but not enough that I'm going to drive all the way across town for their ""take"" on a custom hamburger.  If you've got a group, Blu Burger is good choice for variety.  They have veggie, turkey, and salmon burgers, in addition to salads and sandwiches (egg salad, anyone?).  So, unless your friends are incredibly finicky, there should be something to please everyone.  I also applaud the fact that onion rings and sweet potato fries are available as sides.  All in all, Blu Burgers is 4-stars all the way.  Yummy food.  Friendly service.  They do the gourmet burger thing well and you'll walk away full and happy."
_1QQZuf4zZOyFCvXc0o6Vg	casual	"After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself.   It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!  After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.  Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.  Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!  The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.  The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.  Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.  I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.  I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.  I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review."
RowLTh09IOdyeZP-7BlMFw	fine	This is not that great of a place. It's very upscale but the folks behind the sushi bar don't really seem to know what they are doing. It took forever to get a beer and a sake here. The worst part was the sashimi yellowtail. It looked like it was purple on the edges. If you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll, it will be safeway quality but nothing too special. This place is more about atmosphere and where to eat if you have a glittery scottsdale shirt you need to show off.
un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg	fast	Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nick's used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Burger Battle and thought it was really good.  The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious.  Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'll be back soon.
SF43rzRcmrHxaFNN3Pacjg	fine	"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough? :)"

I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out! I finally caught up with them at Local Fest. Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy! First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal! Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes. I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato. I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: "" Oh, my gosh this is really good!"" Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza! The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine. I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!) Yeah, I'd eat it daily! It's that good!"
N_6bV3c3JagKW7sD3X9ldA	casual	Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.   They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.   What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.  Never, EVER again.

The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didn't bring our bikes. So awesome. Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken.   Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.
zMa6YoEekpABg1HZnnTZdg	casual	"My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience.   Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!  I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice.   The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered.   My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff.   I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved.   Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong.   The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours.   I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.  The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either.   To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.  This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered.   Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience."

(pics of new sign, and old sign by dumpster) Formerly known as Daily Buffet,  http://www.yelp.com/biz/daily-buffet-phoenix#hrid:3-lmRTZ9YDgPxf6I2WGfHA  they offer an extensive menu.  Whatever investment they're making in this new branding, their menu certainly looks impressive.(pic)  Their buffet is quite well-stocked for it's small size. Whether you prefer Chinese or Spanish fried rice, they have it.  Have a few picky kids that can't decide between Honey Sesame chicken and Cheese Enchiladas?  They've got you covered.  The Mexican buffet table offers rice, beans, enchiladas, taquitos, and other rotating entrees such as marinated pork ribs or a scrumptious chicken mole, if you're lucky that day. The Chinese area includes lots of chicken and pork options, noodles, egg foo young, etc  --  standard americhino fare.  The pork ribs were very good, if a little chewy, and the sweet & sour pork was done in the style I prefer: Instead of breaded, dry peices that you put your own sauce on, or soupy watery liquid with floating veggies and meat, this had mostly meat, maybe a few carrot and onion peices, with a crispy outside covered in thick, gooey, sticky sauce, that itself got a little crispy.  (it almost starts to remind me of a candy apple when it gets like this, which I'm sure the taste buds love, but the teeth hate!)  All is prepared well, hot, not too salty or greasy, and well replenished. Discard Pile is usually present, but also usually small. There were some hand-breaded onion rings that were super thick!  This thing was the size of a small donut in my hand! (pic) They have a perfectly crisped outside, with an inside akin to a hushpuppy or donut.  Mmmm, ""donionuts""....  The salad bar area left a little to be desired, and there wasn't really a salsa to dip my taquitos in.  I made a nice little concoction of ketchup, pico de gallo, and sriracha sauce which suited the task way better than I could have ever thought. Jello squares are the only real dessert option, but if you haven't stuffed yourself full of this yummy indulgent food by that point, you really don't belong in a boofay now, do you?"
L7pERyEB70Vo_sb4T5dLrQ	casual	It's hard to rate this place because you never know what you're going to get. At it's best, I'd give it a clean five star rating. But, at its worst, the service is slow, and the bizarro factor knocks it down to 2 or 3 stars. What has the ability to take this place up a notch is karaoke. It draws a diverse crowd of headbangers to rappers to punks to cowboys, which is where the bizarro element comes in. Sometimes the mesh is weird and amazing in the David Bowie meets Trent Reznor way, other times its odd and off-putting. I'd say scope it out on a given night, and if you don't immediately get a good vibe, roll across the street to The Coach House and grab a cheap pitcher and come up with a new plan for your evening.

Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty ""the water is right there"" rather than real service. Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders. Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome. Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area."
bS2iENq-r03NA7HcON3ujg	casual	After reading all the raves about the green chili mac & cheese it was a must have - and then immediate regret. The green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty. Yuck. Mac & cheese is by definition...cheesy and smooth. Not this. Horrible. The good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot BBQ was pretty darn good. All in all when I want good BBQ my choice would be Honey Bears first. But if I'm hard up and just gotta have some BBQ, I would consider Andrew's again.
L-uPZxooP_ziXCtRrWi8Pw	fast	I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again.   The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.

IpqgfODLFPww-6TxCk-LJQ	fast	"Despite it's name (which gave me moment for pause when deciding if I wanted to check it out), Xtreme Bean is a hip coffee house with a college feel (they even have a ""study room"" with quasi-cubicles that is ironically placed in what used to be a bank vault). Further, for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses, THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI :-D  The ""coffee flavored coffee"" and tropical ice tea are good (I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks, so you'd have to check those out yourself) and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced (compared to corporate coffee).  As of this post, there is ragtime piano on Monday nights as well as performers on the weekends.  They have a drive-through window.  Oh yeah, they don't appear to have updated their website in quite some time... most importantly, their hours of operation. The website says they are open 24-hours on the weekend... but I *think* they are closing at 1am in the summer.  EDIT: Go for the pumpkin muffins... they are most excellent.  EDIT 2: Due to the recent rise in popularity of this coffeehouse, I can no longer get my beloved muffins as they all sell out long before I arrive at night. *tear* Oh yeah... and all the employees probably think I'm that crazy muffin guy. *shrugs*  EDIT 3: I'm officially downgrading my review from a 4 to a 3 as it's now difficult to get a table indoors and I have no interest in sitting in the smoker's lounge which is their patio area. *sigh*"
qz4ZOcv-840UjfCEYI4qZg	casual	If you love pickles you'll love Old Town whiskey. We've been here twice so far, and both times, we've been very pleased. So far, I've only tried their pickled beets and pickled cherry tomatoes, but both were absolutely fantastic. The Cherry Tomatoes were so sweet and sour, they paired perfectly with the ricotta, olive tapenade and Crustini they were served with. This place is a gold mine if you're a whiskey drinker, my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best he'd had. I can't wait to get a taste of their Veggie burger, but I haven't gone hungry enough yet... Next time for sure! We went for Happy Hour this past Friday, and they had a lovely Agave Fizz cocktail on special, very refreshing. Their Happy hour is progressive, meaning that everything is $5 from 5-6, $6 from 6-7, and it runs every day.
Oz1w_3Ck8lalmtxPcQMOIA	fast	Was out on a date yesterday, and we had worked up an appitite. We were on the light rail, and decided to stop off on Mill to find food. Walked down mill for a second, and found silvermine subs. SCORE! I had never been here before but I liked it. Its not the fanciest place. Simple location, good food, decent prices. They seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs, with different side items and combo meals. I got the King Bullion, and it was tasty! I went with the small sub (5 inches) a large pop and some chips. Food was up in no time flat. Seems to be a college kid hang out, especially considering the location. Would return in a heartbeat. Tasty, reasonably priced, and right off the light rail on Mill.
uPDTnuR-sOi47blHH943lg	fine	I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family!   I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!
MqnlCLq3b34Lq1Y7j7NY_Q	fast	I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb!   They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!  The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is.   The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like.   The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
nLpV9fo8xml-QHOKyOje2A	casual	The food was ok. Waitress forgot my guacamole. Wait staff continually bumped into our table. Great wine list. Nice decor. I may or may not try again. Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
vxPPpj5jJKO8DtapF5S-NQ	casual	we come here once every two months for date night.  the serivce is generally slow because these are students, but everyone is super nice and tries their best . luckily every issue we've had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff (speaking up, looking at you in the eyes) -- the food is always excellent  generally they don't always offer everything on the menu but it's generallty the cod or sole.   the filet is always fantastic.  desserts are yummy. really everything is good.  the price cannot be beat $15 for a 5 course meal.  don't expect to get a last minute reservation,  it's generally for a few weeks out.  we like this place and happily tell others about it every chance we get.

VTyfRdPJS3AVZOWDXIAhyQ	casual	"I was so disappointed. After drooling over these pictures and rave reviews for weeks I finally drove the ten miles to get my fantasy pizza. Imagine my surprise when they handed me this tiny box weighing almost nothing. I actually asked the waitress if she gave me the right order. Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said ""Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'."" That explains ALOT! Gee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price. Sauce is kinda raw, undertaste of wine and exactly two nickel sized slivers of garlic sausage per slice. Cheese is good quality. I see why the place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday. If your single or on a date and don't mind high prices go for it."
uflQ_lKBfS6WknNlm_HK8g	fast	Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
cQZcWeIDKEF-7nWU3gJMUw	casual	Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too.  The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?
ewZlgc22xN5NNQ1H7U6Y7g	casual	Oh good another Paradise Location for meeting up with friends after work. Clean neat and well manned , the worker bees seemed in real force, cleaning refilling and picking up plates. Nice to see. Food wasn't quite paradise but it was tasty and filling . I usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a Chicken wrap.Tasted like a chicken wrap. The peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too. I love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure . If you are meeting people with different time constraints , this can be very helpful.
2e1jzfiHFGCRpV66gYNVbA	casual	Thanks to Amy D. for also introducing me to this quaint joint.  The smell of home cooking lured me in, Great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too, along with the daily specials which I think is one of each (sandwich , salad, hot meal).  Sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear, I decided to try the Tuna since they don't put onions in it ,Hallelujah!(see pics)  You know what it was pretty tasty, I even ate all my chips and the pickle! My only complaint was the bread was a tad dry, but hey it happens.  Tucked into a commercial business park I never would have found this on my own, but I have fantasized about going back next time I'm in the area, Maybe Amy D. will take me out to lunch again :)

xIdyiVoX5woL8iKHYKoiWw	casual	"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.  When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!  The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.   If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."
UI8iKvzhGn2qZCGIqtQqrQ	fine	Love fondue? If so you've probably already tried one Melting Pot or another. I've been to my share, but this was my first time to this one just tonight. They've only been open two weeks - and they are off to a GOOD start! We had great service - very helpful and attentive, but not up in your face and of course, I love the food. Yeah, so it is obviously a chain and some people don't like it for that reason, but I think as far as chains go they do a nice job and the food and presentation is quality.  Sure, it isn't cheap...but it's not that kind of place. It's the kind of place you go when you are not in a rush and expect to pay more for the whole experience. It's a good place to go and linger over the food and conversation.   We usually get : cheese - tonight we tried the special one, but I typically recommend the Wisconsin Trio, house salads or whatever the special salad is, the vegetarian entree, the extra veggies they give you and a dessert - tonight we did the S'mores.   It was all tasty as usual, the service was really excellent and the atmosphere at this location is nice and quiet. It's in a random little strip mall-like place so not too many people know about it yet.
zpKmFI47BWUT-dUlTDSVug	fine	"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more. The food is that good. This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction. While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy! A new place to try! It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside. I ordered dinner for two, to go. The menu was awesome. I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves. It made it difficult to choose something. Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco. They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show. So much flavor. I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight. The salsa bar is endless. I really stocked up. I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious. They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus! As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did! I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah. There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing. All the paintings are great, love the artist."
4AKcmN--0hbF0kX9pg8scg	fine	Tucked away on a side street off a main drag, we found Mosaic. Surprisingly fancy and expensive, with an elegant feel, almost like it's your parents kind of dining experience.  Loved the different options for the tasting menus. Focus on seafood and meats. My husband loved the 'What the Foie??' appetizer which had excellent presentation. My sea scallop appetizer had a monstrous scallop that could have easily fed a family of four.  Feeling fishy that night, my better half's halibut was surprisingly salty with a heavy sauce. My steak was good, but nothing special..in fact I was disappointed I'd gotten it. Extensive wine selection, Dutch cheese plate and chocolate hazelnut custard for dessert.   Overall, a pleasurable meal with wonferul service and presentation, but for the price, they could really up the quality of the food. We had a dinner elsewhere a few nights later for the same cost that was much tastier from a food perspective.
apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ	casual	Concept is great.  Stores are cool, but expensive.  Lunch was a bummer!  Ordered chicken salad sandwich and the tiny sandwich on a great roll with the tiniest amount of chicken salad was disappointing.  For that money I expected at least a regular sized sandwich.  Glad we tried it, but won't eat there again.
PmPOuRvuN3CoNOi1nBj_TQ	casual	Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference. I took my wife and kids for lunch. We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make. The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese. The meat was definately cooked with love. Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties. They sell bottles of it as well. I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth. I also noticed they do catering. I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ. I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona. Thanks for making good food Grady. We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.
_pw-OnDpCe9XM0rDVvTUMg	casual	"Agree with everyone on here, this is some really good food.  Very laid back un-asuming place inside another strip mall on Bell Road.  Ah what treasures lie hidden in a strip mall....  We were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order right away, I ordered, well I don't quite remember the name,  but it was steak pieces with french fries and onions, and rice.  I was fooled by the mild salsa that came with the chips and said, ""hey can you make my dish spicy?""  The server said no problem, and while the dish was very fresh, my mouth was on fire, and I touched  my eye and it was like pepper spray or something.  I love hot food, I can eat Los Dos Molinos Abogado ribs for example with little problem, but this stuff kicked my butt!!  It had little red peppers in it that I have never experienced before. HOT!!  I kept remembering Deb's review:""....this is not Mexican food...."".  No kidding, next time I will get it milder.  My eye burns still.....  Wife got a milder flat pan steak dish with lentils and rice.  She praised its freshness.  We also split a red beef tamale (they were only like $2) so it was just a sample but decent.  They only have 6 tables in there!  And they had to change their name due to copyright infringement from a restaurant  in Texas according to the young man.  Either way, we will be back for sure.  Good stuff!!  Something tells me there is more burn to come, perhaps tomorrow if you know what I mean?  Beware!  They can really spice it up if you ask them too.  I met my match at Mi Comida....  Fresh ingredients, nice people, and a nice change from Mexican food.  Recommended!  Don't touch your eyes if you touched those little red pepper things, that is for sure!!"
MY0_6BAzQCu4sqXqwNEFfg	casual	Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity. Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment. Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that. Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect). I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh. So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there. Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.
dewq6aevfoNFvJBqM7PG5A	fine	Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!    Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!
sAwxt4I4gTiL-08nyarJbg	casual	Great Southwestern restaurant. The food is incredible, especially the stacked enchiladas. Normally I do not eat heavy foods, but this was way too good to pass up. The chips and salsa were very tasty as well. Service was very friendly and timely. The interior is pedestrian at best, but still a pleasant environment.
yle6HnTE7Ah9Omglor22bA	casual	I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.   Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.  Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!
N_TlJCR5AkZhmrCDqbm2tQ	casual	I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable.   When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you).
qrLqx4oBeR2gNDE873bUHw	fast	I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For 2 cheese pizza's ummm not so cheap. They only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!
ttLtsY1S2Angj6hvEdzwDQ	fast	I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.
fMqEPInEm9Fl5h8oJWPEjA	casual	"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.  You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."
rwQIBAM_kHtVl1Ks8Flexw	fast	The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location.  However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy.
LzSF8rvlsxqF-0qcHU7ikA	casual	I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?
pM96dn6jrJg2V7Aj0trPCg	casual	Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!
pQAIM21Yw4eNdbha2Rxkcg	casual	I used to frequent the Lost Leaf almost daily starting the day they opened, unfortunately I cannot say the same anymore. I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.  Thanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.
Tmzzn7JyCoMgeb-IYRNlGQ	casual	"Fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional, unmemorable lunch. Nothing is gross. Nothing is exceptional. Everything is just, well, there. I've tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches (chicken, steak, veggie, etc.) and they were all ok. Not a big fan of their tortillas, though.  If you work anywhere near there, then I'd say go ahead. It's a safe bet for lunch. You won't puke or curse the world. But is it a joint where I'm saying, ""Dude, you GOTTA try this place out""? Nah. You've had better fajitas elsewhere...  3 Stars."
d3MxUXS1b6U2P_gGuCO1-A	casual	Yummy pancakes made from special house batter were perfectly golden, light/airy & spongy in texture, and had a subtle maple flavor even without the addition of their syrup.  Pancakes are their flagship breakfast entree, though you can choose from the many other items including omelettes, french toast, or the common 2-egg with sides combos.  This place has a local owner with a family member as the chef named Dean that is admired by most patrons.  Oh, and he's the one who makes the delicious pancakes of course.  Atmosphere is clean, sterile, and almost like an old hospital cafeteria from decades ago (notice the operating room blue colored booths).    Patrons are almost exclusively senior citizens and the feel is relaxed, comfortable, and really is a throwback to casual breakfast spots were in the past.  Location is on the north side of Peoria just before 99th ave., not far west of the 101.  It's an older strip mall with ample parking, but down't be thrown off by the modest exterior (restaurant is to the far right when you enter the lot).  I really like this place because of the overall vibe, friendly service, and pancakes.  It's also a nice getaway from Millennials.
PmZ3Ft4aOGpzhpPnF21loA	casual	After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!   I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!   Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite
Qd0fyF-wB_1bQwSB34ggkw	casual	I am one step closer to completing my goal. I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die. After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of. We decided to come here because we had never been to this one. We arrived and were seated right away. Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us. We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers. A few minutes later we got our salad. It was really good. Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons. It was a good starter. A few minutes after that, our pizza came out. If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different. I really liked the white with roasted red peppers. Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza. It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza. Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.
RtwOc-n_RkiUuDGaNfCsNw	casual	"I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go.  THE GOOD:  * Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish.  * Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere * Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.  THE BAD: * Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why. * A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids * Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait. * Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes. * Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh? * Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.  THE UGLY: * Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF?   So, in the end, here's the equation:  1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.  Bah."
xsSnuGCCJD4OgWnOZ0zB4A	casual	"It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...  Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...  Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...  I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu! Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the ""food"" review.  Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni!  Saba...not bad... Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting Toro.....couldn't even bite through it A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that.. When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.  My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll. Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..  Drinks: Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.  Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms  All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...  Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!"
0ROrgaauL7hmivzyd34iKA	fast	"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.  The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-("
YRJKTPc7Tkz1cbjGHmOHuw	fine	This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.  I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.  I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.  Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.  We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.
iBYvoQ4lj35DYL24fYcmGQ	casual	"I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out). I've been making the rounds to various area Arby's using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and today's the last day!) I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did. This is a clean, efficient operation. The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel. There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area. Great atmosphere for this kind of place. The service was quick and friendly. I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying ""yes, sir"" the whole time. ""richard"" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly. Bad on Arby's for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety). btw BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger kicks butt."
KTF-E3NfkJy2wiwcgOPyVQ	casual	I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.  Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.  Also, the potato salad is fantastic!
h53YuCiIDfEFSJCQpk8v1g	casual	"Let's put it this way... I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza. I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10. So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket. The good? The garlic topping is delicious. The employees were friendly. They were generous with their toppings. The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough. If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese. It will probably be a lot better! The just okay? The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry. The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other. This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers. Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin. My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was). I am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because I can see that it would be ""better"" without the Daiya cheese that I chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella."
VFjeCLwVMguUNWH-DeOgyw	fast	It has been several months but I hadn't lost the formula (80/10/10 - veggies, meat, noodles). Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper. Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim. Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce. Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled. Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple. Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade. Then chow down... My formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YC's by Mike T and/or Erik T. Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line. Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark.
LTG4CxnXElBi7R7vZUbeHw	fast	I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.   I can't wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.   Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!
bzDs0u8I-z231QVdIQWkrA	casual	"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: ""No Brio review, I'm shocked!""   I didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average.   My cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here.   Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!  Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready.   Food-  -carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it.  -Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff.  -tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.  So yeah, that's that."

xWcTt1L4vQC_QkPfPBVlCw	casual	What a sandwich! Not a lot of frills, and the sides are underwhelming, but if you just want a really good toasted sandwich for lunch...Sticklers will hit the spot.   And it's downright cheap!  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars, is because the service was a little course, and the place was REALLY busy without a lot of seating space. Plus, it's only open 'till 4 PM! And not at all on weekends! DOWNTOWN RESTARANTS THAT ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH ON WEEKDAYS DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!!!!!!  Come to think of it, the fact that I was willing to give it 4 stars despite all that is a testament to how awesome their sandwiches are., because there aren't many other good things to say about it.
MwaFQkJxzqg8G5_hTip99A	casual	This place was just 'eh' to me! I was just whelmed, not over or under! The service at the bar leaves little to be desired! I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people. We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again! The food was ok! The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with. I had the meatloaf, which was good. The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor. My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful. There is not much on the wine list either. I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar. I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy.
opikDGSxDcfZwYWbk7dKtw	casual	The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there. Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out. As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food... The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back. Good: Cheap Drinks !!!! Bad: You may be stabbed!!!
uQyrVlJS4nh2Y3C0fCy3fw	fast	It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).    MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day.
lhRUPA28pRIN1MnllN-o9g	casual	I used the drive thru early one morning on my way to work. I ordered a breve latte. It came as expected and was very good. A little pricey but I'm cheap. I hope this place stays in business. It's nice to have a neighborhood coffee shop that's not a chain. The drive thru option is great too.
MMMHmbfq3nxUQREU4hKOKg	fast	Obs, a great location in the quaint Gold Spot next to the soon-to-be Pita Jungle. I really like what they did with the space. The vintage elementary school chairs bring me back to the days of learning cursive and pasting cotton balls on paper to create a snowman. Lots of natural light, too! The coffee is spot on, and they have pastries as well. -1 star for not having a punch card. They need to get on that!
UVBPF4oYrb0QfgW_DMbLPg	casual	Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.   I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.   What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food.   I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.   It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.
JVmPxs-yN5VR1l4_-7MZww	fast	"I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.  Over a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.  We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.  I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.  I didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream ""can you PLEASE turn that down?!"" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.  Anyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.  So i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6"" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!  The cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.  I sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.  Choosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.  When we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done."

c2WLZLpvNG2VLOfjjqKrkw	casual	"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent ""manhood"" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.  There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".  He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.  The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!  At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.  Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.  So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!  I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!  I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!  We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!  Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!  The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""  I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.  I like to ""fit in"".  The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.  I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).  I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!  I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"

Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more.   Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine.   I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.  The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame.   If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share.   The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious.   While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face."
V2isTBBfO0NgLzXO9oq1Mg	casual	Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo. That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious. I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg	casual	This review is specifically for my experience at Trader Vic's last night (a Saturday night) for Happy Hour (4pm - 7pm). My wife and I and two friends had a great time! We spent the Happy Hour in their outdoor bar area - so cool - which is slightly shaded and very calming. The apps were tasty, especially for their low, low prices, and my wife really liked her vodka cocktail on special. They didn't have any beers on special, but I had a draft Stella anyway. Neither of us cared much for the fried calamari, but it wasn't bad, just not our style. Everything else - the edamame, mini-burger, and sweet potato fries - was awesome. Oh, and speaking of awesome, so was the service. The waitress was friendly and helpful, and the bussers were very attentive! We will be back for Saturday's Happy Hour again soon.
0QrA-Klgp1R-GzUr6uJS7Q	fine	It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal. Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.
O4jXtRnS_R9SyM7ckMhFmg	fast	Very good coffee! I get my iced Americano here with room for cream. The coffee is so much better than the Starbucks down the street, but not as convenient...shamefully to say, there's no drive-through. When you have a vehicle full of kids which one would you pick? So, I come here solo right before I wander around the little shops. A must try!
bcBMAa0UQpNLFvvdZ4dxtQ	casual	This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?  So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert.   Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.
pa_Ft6pLLWo-w_iopBsu0g	casual	"Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found ""The Place"" How convieeeeent.. I read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot. I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane. We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min. Not too bad. The menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous. I couldn't wait. Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens. I thought I'd love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives? The second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy.. Damn were they good. I got an order of those along with a huge pancake. Here's what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked. Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it, yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. that's their pancakes. Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast. Ive been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked."
UVEnZjATEGkKLFdzV_dTvA	casual	Some colleagues invited me for lunch the other day and decided to pick this place. It was my first visit. After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the California Wrap (Spinach, Tomatoes, Avocado, Feta Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing, Tomato Basil Tortilla, $8.95) with a side of Cole Slaw & Iced Tea. I took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!! The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too! What a great combo! The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow. We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check. Maybe we caught him on a bad day? Because I enjoyed my meal so much, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Return Factor - 92%
e8Eke5v8pXw-PuRCu2uPjg	fine	Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine.   This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.
dcd3C1gWv-vVdQ9XYV8Ubw	fine	If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare.   Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI.   Experiences with the order could be as follows:  Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza.  Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked.  Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables.  Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert.   Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.
vTDJ_ZbxUw1MUOPPG9esOw	fine	I really enjoy this place for a relaxing dinner.  They really know how to do a great salad and it's defiantly a plus when it's half off bottles of wine night.
VY_tvNUCCXGXQeSvJl757Q	fast	This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos. The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb! I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco. The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however, would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items! I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon. I advise you to do the same!
sbD4f8aOsXZ6PJYh1kN4Ag	casual	"Maybe closer to 3.5 but I am rounding up because I'm not opposed to being won over by ""smart"" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, ""you look so young, you must get that often."" Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I don't get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied.   The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didn't feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I don't know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment.   The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better).   While the waitress didn't attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive."
L-bpJXpA5875dLb7A4wh6A	casual	"I am definitely quite shocked at some of these reviews. I disagree with the lack of flavor, and the tasteless dishes some reviewers experienced while eating here. I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to browse ""Yelp"" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu, ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling food in hand. When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least 5 times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! In my opinion they beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!! It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me. Speaking of which I think I'll order some now :o)"
hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g	casual	"Good food, nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings. I haven't been here in a long time, as in when the fries didn't come with the burgers (you had to order them as a side item). However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus.   Service has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having ""Fine Burgers"" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint."
y9cQ0DBC0qFNgkpTXHzokA	fine	"Wow. I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review. I just placed my order, 30 minutes after sitting down.  11:35 - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks. So far so good.  11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8, but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch, all hell broke loose.  11:41 - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables. ""You can't sit in there. We don't have a server in there."" Screw it, we picked up our drinks and moved in. If they can serve us at that table, they can serve us one table over in this other room.  11:45 - We asked to see the manager.  11:50 - ""We can get you drinks in here, but not food. We have to wait for a table to open up out there. Then we can serve you.""  11:52 - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves. We still haven't spoken to a manager...  11:55 - ""We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen."" (Hmm.. If you didn't want to ""overwhelm"" the kitchen, maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)  12:05 - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room. I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.  12:32 - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room. Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.  You suck, Floridino's."
QNo69O4cy6a3HGb6RrGWzA	casual	I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.
cqIHyZ3Q0D4vBi-vb4mi-g	fine	Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.  I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER.   I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.  I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.  When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!  The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.  We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.  But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.  Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.  For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.  Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good)   It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.  Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through.   The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)  THUMBS WAY UP!!!
MHy50GRrcXxMORpF_-kNCA	fast	AWESOME!!! I love this place! I am from Seattle and I've been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here. Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home. I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one. No fuss, no frills. Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes. Food was delicious!!! Definitely go here!
xdwPHc25l7_roZ9Kfea13w	casual	3 kids and myself.. 14 bucks.. gotta love a Tuesday kids eat free. While I still had to buy two adults to get two kids free... totally worth it.   The place was clean, service excellent.   The pizza was looking pretty bad when we goth there but after eating some ok salad, the fresh ones rolled out and were great.   Garlic cheese bread type Pep, ham and jalapeno Chicken wing  They were all great.   Cinnamon Roll for dessert...yummy!  Really if you have not been here for a few years come back with an open attitude and a hunger to pack in some pizza, chicken, mashed taters, spaghetti, salad, dessert and of course pizza...any kind you want, they will try to make it.
LxE7D6uigL3vLaasPU7Ewg	fast	I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area. The food quality is high and consistant. The prices are downright CHEAP. I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos. The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
zff_uz9k60UwNi3etN39uQ	casual	We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!
QMIR_VeLPSOp-d730i5mJA	fine	We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra. Caviar is served with mini toasts, minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it. What a treat. As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet. Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!
XAaXT0e70-USVYVKcnljsg	fast	I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
YDpzUg_np9KkG0702jACwg	fine	"It's not hard to find a steakhouse in Scottsdale.  Modern Steak's schtick is that it is... well, ""modern"" in the sense that it's not in a dark oak-filled room with overstuffed booths.  Unfortunately, however, ""modern"" also means that it's in a mall.  Ugh.  Pretty efficient (if not brusque) service, with decent enough food.  I had the salmon w/ maple and bacon glaze.  It's a bit of a bizarre combo -- I'm not sure the salmon quite holds up under such a sweet glaze, but you can't complain too much anytime bacon is involved :)"
qXNDOT15YefmozPnrbZJGg	casual	I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry.
Uty42E_VZV_iGMYiY_WB5w	fast	Tweet tweet. I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did. This company really knows how to treat their 'followers'. I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced. I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough. There hasn't been one time that I've visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order. I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food's ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods. As for salads, If you can take the 'heat' I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad. The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette. You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite. If you haven't already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, I'm 100% sure you are crazy. #BRAVO (hashtagging seems appropriate here).
xCXSaqlKvclhWBczA4fqkA	casual	I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.  I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days.  I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.  So how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!  I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.  The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.  I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!  I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!
MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw	fine	Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back! We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle! Delicious! I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous! Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing. I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time! Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle. Best hand made pastas anywhere. Perfect! Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles! So right...so full! I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey! We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go! What a perfect Italian dinner paradise! We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner. Best in the valley.
4meJyPOhuAKzywUJTmu2hw	casual	The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.  Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.
LxNehlnStQY_rxEwiPof_g	fine	"I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool ""sceney"" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like ""Cougar"" and ""30k millionaire"". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didn't impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutra's failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite.   I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be ""scene""!"
106JT5p8e8Chtd0CZpcARw	fast	I love guerrero's! I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic. It's a husband and wife team that runs it. The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated). Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border. I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!
5VMajxduxfLPSyQkVFKESg	casual	"HA HAHAHAHAHA!  ""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness. now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto. opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.  the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).  i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.  anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave."
3GAPcBG8SowgrpS6UHlDeQ	casual	I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.
_BhzcKojv1gjdRINe3Gkig	fine	Definitely a place where the reputation precedes the actual experience.  It's like it's trying to be Binkley's, and it's not even in the same ballpark.  We were there on a THU night, and the place was dead.  Still, it seemed to take 30 minutes between courses.  Which is fine, if you have some bread or amuse bouche between.  Which you don't at Posh.  So, you eat your tasting portion in 4 minutes, then you sit there for another 26.  By the time the 3rd course came of our 5th course meal at hour one and a half, we were all tired, bored, and no longer hungry.  We ended up asking our last course to be wrapped, as we were that turned off.  What really disturbed me on the food, however, was the foie gras.  An extra $15 supplement - which is fine, as I think it's always worth it for great foie gras.  We were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras, in a fruit coulis, and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side.  It looked amazing.  And was, if I stopped at eye appeal.  Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  I'm not talking room temp, I'm talking refrigerator cold.  If you are a foie gras fan, then you know this is like eating a square of lard.  It was impalitable.  Imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate, because this is what cold foie gras tastes like.    I like the surprise aspect of the courses, and I like the fact you can tell them what you like and don't like to start, but ultimately, I see now why it's best to know exactly what you're getting in advance.    It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.  The dining experience starts when you're wowed by a menu, and sit in anticipation of what you've ordered.  When you have no expectations, it's hard to get excited.  By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, you're not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.  I had to ask my server to repeat every course I was served at least twice - lol.  Perhaps if I hadn't been spoiled by Binkley's, that has an expansive menu that changes daily, and you pick from 4-7 courses BUT you are given about 6-8 amuse bouche (and bread which is served French style with choices) between courses, I suppose I would have been more impressed with Posh.  But not by much...
VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg	casual	On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!  PS GET THERE EARLY!!
miuWgBMwg_6RzI_BvUfjnQ	casual	Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.  I wanna be with you night and day....  Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.  With pool. With dives. With football. With beer. With diversity. With the random atrium. With the jukebox. With life.  How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on? Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar.   The End.
XqrgB_gIXDQQ2NLukgqD3w	fine	I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.  First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.  Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.  Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.  Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.     Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here. No value  Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak. My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.  Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.  Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!
yPpPJyAF8pciHnhTF-C38w	fast	"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.  I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.  That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.  Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!  It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.  If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."
1uFIjxwBRi8vGqc6vpNO9w	fine	Newly opened Mexican restaurant tucked away in the Dobson and Germann area. I would give the place 5 stars for decor, the owner has taken such great effort to make the restaurant look like old Mexico on the inside. The food was good but not great. I did relish on the tomatillo salsa brought with the red salsa and chips. The portions were pretty big, no room for dessert and had to request togo boxes. Ordered: Seafood Tacos (great with excellent presentation) Tia's Plato de Carne Asada: Tres Carnes - beef, pork and chicken (huge) Tia Rosa Burro (huge) I will definitely return and review, but overall I did like this place.
Snp5LyDO9NeQiuFPOlkavw	casual	"Referring to Mickey's as a ""dive bar"" is like referring to Princeton as a ""secondary school"". Its a lazily, flaccid description for a bar with a fist-full of moxie. Their Bloody Marys alone feature a fucking brawny-assed, gigantic totem pole of man-meat. Well, not ""man meat"", but meat-fit-for-a-man. You get the point. Look, the main point is that no ""dive bar"" is gonna be serving yo ass peppers and salami in a $5 tomato Slurpee. People often mistake ""kitsch"" as ""obsolete"" and these these are the type of people who would use the word ""psych!"", and grease their side-hair back after swindling you into a fake low-five. And i would like to agree with their lowly opinions of Mickey's, but then, I wouldn't want to be wrong also. If you've ever been to Welcome to the Johnson's in the Lower East Side, and moreover, enjoyed yourself there, then Mickey's is your Arizona equivalent. Think of it as, Welcome to the Merriweather's. Scottsdale name, New York kitsch. So, their bar service is kinda tough, but once there, they have a kickass selection of brews both ironic and sincere. You want an Old Style followed by a Boddington's? Where else but Mickey's? Their kitchen is open late, which, for the love of all that is holy, is impossible to find in this three-bedroom-two-bath-house of a town. Even better, their food is goooood. I mean, heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am. No, it ain't Capital Grille, get over it, but their wings, fries, chix tenders, et all hit the f'ing spot when you've had too many Jamisons (or Jager/Patron shots for the resident middle schoolers). They just recently seemed to have remodeled their patio, which looks really great, but lost most of its charm. Still, space to move and a decent spot to smoke outside beats a macrame couch, or whatever, every day of the week. Anyway. I like this place. They lose a star for making me pay $3 for a pretty tame DJ and for hosting Ohio State functions. Fuck em. Go Horns."
qPfX87VuYeBMgM2B0Zr1hQ	casual	It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit.   For a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable.
lKQ5hnkSQ-XP80jNCH46nQ	fast	"I have to laugh at the person that stated the service was bad. I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service.   I order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions (I did try them with the onions and honestly, I liked the taste of the burger better without)  I like their crispy onion rings, they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring... but they are crispy and not greasy. Try them, you'll understand what I am saying better :)  The fun item I always get ""to go""??? Their coffee flavored milk shake. It's light, it has nice flavor and is a little bit of heaven.  PS: Parking is not like it was with ""My Florist"" there are many more available spaces now, which is totally awesome."
TQhP4vCMjvX527YMxPfuUA	casual	Wow, what a blast from the past! I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out! When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp. Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well! The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli). The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried. They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad. The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from. There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados. I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired. The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own. The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result. The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy. The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar. There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from. The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar. There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce). There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter. The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings. It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor. Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed. One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!
OdD1GuGNQ64ssJmMJ_D9RQ	casual	Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
xLCbkTYQaP-nij6mEfaw7A	casual	Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence.   Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume.   There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.
e8kRfAKXM_1qj9LMgp0s2w	fast	Well this is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The wife and I visited this establishment last Sunday after church. There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!

XWvht_1ZLdK7EHJ3jo4q0g	fast	I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! It's a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while.
IK8ID-Dq7LZsPppx4sKLhg	casual	Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right.   If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.    I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.    Where are all the other reviews?
6_nvD0eUrr6oN8djmJtaQQ	casual	I went for lunch on a weekend recently. Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.  The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be. It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland. The sauce is probably watered down. It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.  The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.  I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times, I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)
rRSrENv9j_rLnehMlQEukQ	casual	I recommend this to everyone. I have never had a bad meal here. Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.
V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg	casual	"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place. Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find. can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem."" As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste. Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go. So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one. Don't forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps. Happy breakfast, Kevin PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens."
s7BZ4tD3q62-OTSYp7Djdw	casual	Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses.   You dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like.   Come for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa.   During happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!

OVZaWBKy7VBT_ikOrDt6dw	casual	"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).   I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"". That describes these pancakes perfectly.   Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.   This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a ""Jacket Required"" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.   The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!!   The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).   All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.   I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."
6apEKjkj5j1W1sS1dSwWyA	fast	It was a hot day with great bbq!  With the Yelp discount, admission was reasonable ($6) compared to the original $12 price, and there were a good number of bbq stands to try.  Samples consisted mainly of pulled pork with bbq sauce, although a few stands did sell items such as hot links, rib tip, and brisket samples.  I would have liked to see more stands that sold plates of food rather than samples, for those with a bigger appetite.  Towards the back there were also some stands that had food and home items for sale (e.g., Cutco knives, clothing, salsa, etc.).  It would also have been nice to see more items for sale that were bbq related (aprons, grills, tongs, etc.).  All in all, I'm glad I went!
JUlwoai_WikznIEQ7XCENA	casual	Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .

The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!
6oRAC4uyJCsJl1X0WZpVSA	fine	So excited to have another Royal back in my life! I worked in downtown Phoenix before, and I was sad to see Royal leave back in the day. I never made it to Royal at the Market - sadly I reverted back to corporate America coffee after Royal left downtown.   Luckily, Biltmore Fashion Park has been really pushing the opening of this coffee bar at the Red Door spa. After waiting for it to open, I finally went down there today. Sure, they are just opening, so there's some kinks. Today they didn't have a ton of syrup selections, including my favorite almond rocca. However, they're getting them all in very soon! AND they offer almond milk - how awesome! They've got three benches inside too. Although it's pretty small, and awkwardly has an elevator leading up to the Red Door spa, I think it's a pretty cool space. Can't wait till they get up and running and bring some decent coffee to the Biltmore. Great hours too - open early!   ***If you've never had Royal before, please go try it.*** I think their lattes have a very unique flavor, something I haven't found in any other coffee joint. I can't believe I didn't drive to the Market location before this - but now I have something closer!  Some tips - park by the Capital Grill and the big red door (duh). Luckily they have a Royal at the Biltmore sign on the window, or else I might have missed it. It'd be awesome to nab a 20 minute spot outside Mojo Yogurt too. They have a token validation machine, so don't be afraid to park in the token lot!
rhxBsu0k_BddgjOP9MYdeA	casual	"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago.   Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better."
NBwPgX7L2D-EZedgo3A-pw	fast	OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals. He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is. The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier. I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there... Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!
69c7z9ySnlqV87tITDGENA	fast	This place used to be really good, but it just is not the same. The price is now the same as a sit down Mexican restaurant with real plates, and the food is microwaved and served like a fast food place. The things that are deep fried are greasy, and the things that are microwaved are tough. The prices just don't fit anymore, and that might be the location, and landlord problems. I miss the old day's  There is no way Maria Munoz would ever consider the way the food is made today. The food, while it is still good, is over priced and microwaved. Real sad, and the amount of people going there is in decline.
2BSF6wu1V3KfyFJf1DQ3DQ	casual	I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick. I have to say they have the most comfortable seats! I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft. The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it. My girlfriend got french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good) which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really really good. It was tangy salty and sweet. The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked? The waitress was super accomodating, and nice. Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all. The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine. My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg? She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu. Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.
eONS7DP6U9BV3lkqGAUbOg	fast	The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since... Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.
rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA	fine	"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes. The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon. Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress. She made our first visit absolutely fun. My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good. In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it. The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari. As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it."" The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate. We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly. She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time. However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask. There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite. His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
-XlBQrxN_ZB3MZKxLBeAjA	fine	It was a Sunday morning & Mimi's was PACKED! We walked in, gave the hostess our name & told the wait wouldn't be too long considering it was just the two of us. The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families.   Following the hostess to our table, I couldn't help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes.   The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J.   The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge.   For those of you who want healthier options, don't you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well.   All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience @ this Mimi's location & will definitely return if I'm ever back in Phoenix.
cNGI_5GbfNFbZBMQZ-s-UQ	fine	This review is for the bar ONLY!   First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next!  Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.  I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.  I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*
zfY68t7nVihCwiCsCgM6cw	casual	I enjoy some burros because it's a good cross between fast food and sit down Mexican food.  The taste is always fresh, and good - the service is fast and friendly, even with a packed house.  It satisfies my Mexican fix and does not leave me regretting life afterwords .... (like Filbertos does)  I have only had this location, but have gone back numerous times and will continue to hit this place up and work my way through the menu ... I had the beef taco and been enchilada today ... see pictures ... you will want.
fESObRt-YtkgeNS_TUBhlw	casual	"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is ""cursed"". The turnover for businesses at this location is high. But I think Oink is going to make it! They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries. Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee. Love to see that! The menu is decent. I'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in. The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didn't realize this until after we finished eating! So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"
Nj6ITW0Zhl7LpovGIH6SAg	fine	"Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership.   For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)  I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often."
TqVESkM8cDQdTC1LL3RUSg	fast	"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago. We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza. We have been here twice as of this writing. The second time around was ""Kids Eat Free"" night. That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal. I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area. For now let me tell you about NYPD..... The pizza is a winner! Nice crust, great topppings! They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage. The flavore is great too. My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it! I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh. So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and lasagne. I chose the lasagne and it was delish! Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!! The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne. And did I mention the bread......OMG!! The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!! I could have eaten ten of them!! They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!! Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!! Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!! I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!! Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned. Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal. On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart. She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list. And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too! This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters. The bar is tiny, probably seats 10. Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!! This will be somewhere we will frequent!! Thanks NYPD!!!"

It's a bit like a coffee joint, a place to sit, relax, and talk with friends. + The tea selection is AMAZING. I don't drink too much tea myself, but I know my friends like it. They have fresh tea in boxes and have a very large assortment. + You can do so much to your drink. Blend, ice, hot, boba. I like to get smoothies (they also put green tea in their smoothies) with boba. It's delicious. - Location. A place like this should NOT be sandwiched between stores in a crappy mall. It would be better in a shopping center, away from Tempe Marketplace. -/+ Food is alright. If you're looking for a snack, good, but if you're looking for a decent sands

h6jfMpTZpNduLG0wE2tbaw	casual	They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing. Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had. I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time. The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
ZG4oIFBRlXyaF5F9L3dzxg	fast	Restaurants that are open 24 hours play an important role for certain kinds of people - ones that work odd hours, people who like to eat at non-standard times of day, and, of course, people who are out late partying and want to put something in their stomach at 3 am. Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 24 hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through.   My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-5 different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts.   The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only 2 chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks.
3byBKds6zEJ6zCDh90bhVg	fine	We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor...   The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..   I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!
lUE101QlZgUuIl8OdIzITQ	fast	I used to frequent this place when it was Long Wong's. The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available. Since the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed. The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big). They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices. I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all. Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways. The burgers are so-so. Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good. I've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster. I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it. I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged. I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another. The owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work. However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes. I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected. That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.

I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass! Come on! Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts! Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in! Save the flops for the pub! Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!
6rijZ1qIjiq1Dgdy35iqxw	fast	"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.  This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.  Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.  On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.  Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too. I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when ."

As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.

And, that's not even counting my breakfast: $9 for a wedge of quiche and a salad (that I didn't want - I just wanted a piece of quiche).   I don't mind paying for good food (anyone who knows me knows food is pretty much WHAT I spend my money on... ) but I'm having huge buyer's remorse... over my meal! Something's not right with that.

I go for lunch every now and then and I've seen this place slowly pickup business.  It has that deli-sport restaurant feel, but the food brings it home.  I appreciate the usage of real plates instead of paper or styrofoam plates -- very environmental friendly!

I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!  So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.  I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!  You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!
tqDwpyCB53TiEIv915Tuww	fast	Wow! This newly opened little food shop in the Mekong Plaza is fantastic. Very authentic Hue Food. Although I'm not a Vietnamese, I have been to Hue in Vietnam and had their famous Bun Bo Hue. Must say that this store was very close to the authentic Bun Bo Hue. The pork hock and the other meat used was very tender, the noodle was perfect. The broth is lightly flavored so that you can use the Shrimp Paste for those who like it a bit more salty. The veggie was very generous.  The Banh Beo was another neat Hue snack. It's a very thin rice cake snack which is steamed. You dip it in Fish Sauce. It was very nice and moist.  Their menu is pretty limited as they only have about 6-7 items, but they are definitely featuring the best of hue to serve. Very impressed to see.  There was a good crowd too, so lot's of people have been dying for some nice Hue food.  Only thing to note is they were a bit disorganized the opening weekend as their register was not even working, and the service was a bit slow. I'm sure after a few weeks, this place will be running smoothly.

Originally, when it was called ""J Chew"" I fell in love with the place - it had a cool underground loungy charm. It was the best place to meet new and interesting folks. Now it is known as ""Old Town Tavern"" and has more of a generic sports pub theme that is dominated by TVs. The crowd is slightly older and the bartenders aren't as wild/fun... Not a great place to take a date any more. On the upside: The place is much cleaner now, has live music almost every night, and Tuesday movie-night has some serious potential. Check it out for yourself."

JEreQgso7MH_Io3DXGsEOw	casual	I work in the area and come here maybe once a month when I have a pho craving and need a place near work.  The decor is relaxing, and the music is pleasant.  I find service to be fast which is really important during lunch.  On one side, the prices are a little on the high side, and the pho is somewhat bland.  On the other side, a lot of my American coworkers won't go to a mom and pop pho house.  Pho Dalat is somewhere they would be okay with.  If you're on that side of town.. have a pho craving.. then Pho Dalat will definitely cure that.. but don't get expected to be wow'ed by the complex flavors of the broth
chFzObJSoxAbVlFfgk5JRg	fast	The food is fresh here. The quality and taste is consistent. The service is nice and polite even though a couple of the servers don't speak much English. The building is a trip -  the outside looks like a doublewide trailer on a foundation, but the inside has a homey Northeastern Mexico look. On the other hand, even though the guacamole was fresh, it's a little bright and lacks strong taste, and the red hot sauce is too watery(it's still got that kick). Overall, if you're not itchin over substandard guacamole and marginally inflated prices for the location then it's a great place to chow. I give it four stars because the food is good, fresh, fast and the service is friendly and quick.
xKV873WMxM0EJ7NTtu4Qhg	casual	It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.
3DCjixw25ebL2_sAvNUBUg	casual	"Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food. I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu.  From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean.  Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing) It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings.  My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P                   |                  |  /                  | /    . .~^(,&|/o.

LR9mX-3mh_PIEeG1A5zqxg	fast	This place has the best wraps I've ever had. The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.
kwo6AogUjIG1qk-doJdFeQ	fine	Dinner for four at the soft opening. The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night. Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly. The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation. Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing. ahhhh, sigh. I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else. This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs. Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.
r4AG1WXCRWkZKQctrcy9FA	fine	"FINALMENTE!!! Andiamo.... FOOD -------- Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle. Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is. The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen. As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. SERVICE ------------- Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. SETTING ------------- I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. EXTRA CRIB NOTES ----------------------------- * the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego. * It's great * Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip. * it's great * No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). * it's great * complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself. * it's great * It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for? * did I tell you it's great? ALL IN ALL --------------- An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2. And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)..."
ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q	fast	While we were finishing up at Forefathers, I checked my mobile Yelp app to see what else was in the area.  Zoyo popped up and the reviews were good so I asked my daughter if she wanted dessert.  Silly me, of course she said yes! It was a short drive to Zoyo.  I passed it the first time cause my GPS said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  We made a quick u-turn and there we were.    It was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  If I remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  I had Red Velvet and Banana.  YUM!  The Red Velvet was delish!  My daughter had RV and Cake Batter.  They had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  The young people (oh god I sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  There was pleanty of seating too.  Some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  There were also tables outside.  It was a Saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  Some stayed, some got theirs to go.  They also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  One was playing The Bee Movie and the other had Soccer.  Overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  I may even bump it up to 5 stars after I try more flavors.  Although if they always have Red Velvet......but then again it's good to try new things.  Thank you Zoyo!
cLojUtqkFpVIHFEvA_5Atw	fine	"Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker ""Modern Thai"" has become euphemism for ""Expensive Thai."" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce."
Tt6DYs0TyERWHWW5xiRL_A	casual	I drove by last night and noticed the sign and decided I needed to check it out. So I stopped by for a late lunch and was the only one in the place which made for some nice time to chat with the owner and her mother, who was the one whipping up the great food in the kitchen.   They've only been open since February and had relied on fliers and the painted signs on the windows to attract customers. While I was there, supremely enjoying the chicken curry roti, a few other people came in because they drove by and saw the sign.   I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or the curry for my roti, so I was given samples of both. I thought the jerk chicken was a little too hot for me, but the curry still was able to clear out my sinuses. Wow - slow burn! I was told they could tone down the heat upon request. I'm not sure I'd want to ruin the experience, though.   The menu looked interesting - goat curry, oxtail - along with the jerk and the curry options. I opted for the guava nectar to drink (so yummy!).   This is in my neighborhood so I'll definitely be back to try some more. The atmosphere was comfortable and I was encouraged to linger longer, but I needed to get on with my day. The food and the music piped in made me feel like I took a mini-vacation. Nice.
Kau5iJl6VR-TJ20YGrL7MQ	casual	"If you happen to get lost and wander by the gun show at the Coliseum, be sure to stop here. A little whole in the wall of a former Wendy's, this place rocks the steak taco world.  My favorite is the ""jaz"". Carne asada + cheese + peppers/onions = yum!!!  The barbacoa and chicken tacos are tasty, but I wouldn't say they'd knock you off your feet. Definitely go carne asada and defintely try this place."
KBG28p3lGX17hOPoHhq5PQ	casual	Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...  Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.    In the ghetto?  Check Has sweet tea?  Check Has no-nonsense, quick service?  Check Ridiculously long wait?  Check Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check  I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.  If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
fPExBO1aXA5c4uwlHFyx2Q	casual	Live music, plenty of beer on tap, and a very happening place.  This place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs.    I enjoyed some beers on tap, but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger.  Very good burger, fresh tasting and the bacon and cheddar hit the spot.  The fries are good, which I normally do not eat at all.    Nothing like enjoying a nite out with friends.  Live music, great food, and plenty of drinks and beers on tap to enjoy.  We all had a great time out.  Service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there.  Great atmosphere here.
LkVnmNpOPrThbsj_vKKz_g	fine	Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.  I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.  In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.  Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)
mTjHcl-pkNO4iOKY8rVHPw	casual	If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great. Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint. The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.
supigcPNO9IKo6olaTNV-g	fast	I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day.   I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied.   The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.   The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.
jEkaxdgLxUCf4jtUnCPVWg	casual	So I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.
towWd9z7YuGHdAezQtrkTQ	fast	I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town. I have no idea why people go to Subway. Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it. Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for. The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working. $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better! They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.
vnRwp-LUrxMdJC9je4q9Fw	casual	Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.  first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them, try them here, yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck, because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!  seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch! plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps. the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria. on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!
xm8F51qKjx0cfdOSukTDng	casual	I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.)  I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.  First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.  Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.  We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.   I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair.
PJEJS5rNMRrIBVQDuU9qoA	casual	"Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times. First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub. The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time). The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up). The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV. Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc. Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives. The wings, very good, I would get them again. Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me. The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings. It was pretty horrible honestly. The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option. Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza. I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options. p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal) Cheers!"
n_YHTTG0QIjZ3055wReefQ	casual	Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am). Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday! I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi. Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks, Drinks...drinks. They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well. 1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.
