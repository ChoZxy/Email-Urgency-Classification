uYLbsoytUFMK-mJyQZ6GvQ	fine	When dining out, I am a big fan of steak, and great service...Fleming's offers plenty of both.    Having dined at Fleming's on more than one occasion, I can confidently say that they know how to cook a steak to your requested temperature.  At these prices, this should go without saying, but plenty of chophouses still don't meet this criteria.  All side dishes are a la carte, and on the large side, so I'd recommend sharing.  The potatoes and vegetables are always great dishes.  Mixed drinks are poured well, and not priced too crazy, relative to the entrees.  My staple, a Jack & Coke, was $7.50...I've paid more.  The wine list is extensive if you so choose.  Service was excellent, if a bit methodical...could be a bit more personal.  Four stars instead of five, because everything is just done well...nothing stands out as above and beyond, especially at this price point.
uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ	fast	Very pleased with this World Market. The prices are good for the wine glasses I've bought there (good selection too!). The wine is good everyday wine, and priced reasonably. The help is always friendly and courteous, and the food section---(well, I've been there at least 6 times, and I always seen to find something new in the food section!). The only reason I give it four stars instead of five, is the parking arrangement and it is not easy to get into its' parking lot.... I think the prices here ae better than Pier One....By far!
xNfGoC9CW33GjSPLcfbwUg	fine	"I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.    We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a ""Keg sized"" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value.   Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!"
QniH_NAABATeAx45mQ4ESQ	casual	Unlike Cassandra, I love kids and brought 4 of my own to Joe's. We all loved it. Fresh tasty food, great outdoor seating and lost of room for the kids to play with all of those dogs etc. The ahi tuna was cooked right and the slaw on it was amazing. The french fries might be the best I have ever had. The Chocolate shake was good but a little too rich for my taste. My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far. The pluses obviously are the tasty fresh food and of course plenty of room for kids to play and bother Cassandra.
iDoigI3605ixHl_qHly3Tg	casual	This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it. This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the Cadillac marg. Tablemates had other dishes they raved about. Noteworthy notes: I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why. It looks awesome. The margaritas are sufficiently stiff. They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places. The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time. If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride.
yRga-WpyfZRz8Es4OpyMhA	fine	"Back in town and back to our favorite hotel in the area. Right across from North Mountain preserve, where we love to hike in the morning, or a 10 minute drive over to the Squaw Peak area.  Love the ""falls"" pool area - but if you like quiet, there are other pools - we just enjoy the music and the cocktail service. Different Pointe of View is supposed to be an awesome restaurant at the top of the resort with amazing views, but we usually opt for local, regional restaurants... Via Delosantos, Aunt Chiladas, Mi Patio are some of our favorites.  Only reason for 4 stars this time is that I used Hilton Honors points for our room and I am a Diamond member.... not impressed with our location at all. We love being up high in the cliffs where you have a view, and this time we overlooked the top of a building. I was bummed... especially since we are return guests. (didn't complain, however...not my style).  Next time I will request a better view.  Have to say, however, that upon arrival, we were assigned a room with a group standing right outside on their balcony.... loud, smoking and arguing. We immediately called the front desk to ask to be moved and they arranged it right away, which was nice.  Every time we visit the same people are working in the pool area - and we always feel welcome. Excellent service and friendliness.  Can't wait to go back."
WYk91WPklqRWuk9z9DsPDw	fast	After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.    I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.
IF-BrFA4srTmLHk_fxOKkA	casual	What a find during my ongoing Vietnamese food trip - a Vietnamese restaurant which, unlike the others I've been to, is located in a charming converted little home rather than in a run down strip mall.  But the food is just as good or better, and with run-down-strip-mall-eatery prices. Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day.  One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is rice vermicelli with shrimp and pork or beef, and while their version is not as bold in flavor as Dong A's, it is definitely quite tasty. The courteous service complements the brevity of the wait between placing your order and receiving your food.
5vbBmHljaHVcQS4k6VxGVA	fine	"Needs a new name - now.    The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.    The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."
TTjdeeMfTw9s9vg4T1a3pw	casual	"What vegetarian goes to a place like Logan's Roadhouse? The kind that will sacrifice herself for the sake of her people because she drove all the way from San Diego to AZ at midnight and had no kind of sleep, but still managed to get there and say, ""Hey, I'm taking all you fools out to dinner, my treat, where do you want to go???""  And, they picked this place. Oh woe is me.   If you've been to Texas Roadhouse, then you've been to Logan's Roadhouse. I'm pretty sure it's the same damn place. Peanut shells on the floor, MEAT and potatoes galore, and loud people everywhere--Which is fine, because my people are very loud.   The overloaded mashed potatoes was a hit, I was pissed that they were out of onion petals, and our waitress seemed really confused. But, she was nice, so I can't really talk too much crap.   As long as everyone in my party had a good time, I'm happy."
P7wKlbSRsoRrfH3DFOY08A	fine	"It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so 5 star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice. I love the darkness of it, its all so exotic and relaxing there especially with all the coves and different areas to be seated. Apparently you have to put your name down if you want a table for certain as it seems to be packed anytime I have been there. We needed one more bar stool-we had no reservation and the waiter actually went ""out to the storage"" to get us one. Impressive!"

When Hubby asked me this morning if I wanted to ""taste the Rainbow"" for breakfast, I asked him to check on the Boba situation. It turns out that Rainbow listened, and they now will add Boba to any of their drinks. The woman behind the counter said you can call ahead so you don't have to wait. Hubby's vanilla and my strawberry frap that he brought home today were still ""just ok."" The donuts are still really good, and they finally have some stable hours, 4 am to 8 pm."
vwh496Ag4oRFgR6Dw3Hilg	fine	I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale.   Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.
tdcjXyFLMKAsvRhURNOkCg	fine	Okay...I have been going here for a while and I love the place and the food! I am surprise it hasn't had as many reviews as it should. The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint.. The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture! Its small but fitting... The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it.. Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:) Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but true! Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!
k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw	casual	Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here! Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat). Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite. Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz.  Excited to go back and try some more pizza!

I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything !  Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"
rr13jM6SUmfPPPGHHMHCgQ	fine	The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)
umdxfhSlk67yGEi8-S-bEg	fast	"I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.  We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much ""wrapper"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.  I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well."
PO2JBrCFcxd5ne-7ewDwdw	casual	Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if you're in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives.   I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world.   The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which for me is always a bad sign for what must be the cleanliness level of the kitchen.
-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A	fast	Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had. It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp. As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well. Why only 3 stars? OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat.
1crzPdwnlm2zHdQ2nP4n7w	casual	"This is a real find and I mean ""find"" because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around. The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty. The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing. My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week. Definitely worth the trip."
38G8LPiqECn_P6LQfUnfZA	fine	Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen.  It seems whenever I go in there their products don't work.  Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees don't seem to be knowledgeable about the products there.  I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.
mDrnZvSXMbMIGE0IX9mMqA	casual	I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix. After many disappointing meals, I found Desert Jade and haven't looked back. The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside (even a big fireplace) and the service is great. Each of our servers have been super friendly and attentive. The food is really good. It's not going to blow you away, but it's fresh, portions are just right and I've never left unsatisfied.   I really like the Kung Pao Chicken, the Mu Shu Pork, Spicy Chicken with Vegetables (lots of them), and my husband loooves the glazed walnut shrimp.  If you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets.
_TekkyyFeX_8MBepPIxuTg	casual	Came here last night with the girlies to satisfy our craving for Indian food.  We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.  We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.  Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.  We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.  When the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!  Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.  Overall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied.
0LCqaCnEGesFEhpa6qNauQ	casual	I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.  They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.  I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.   Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.  Chompies is the best!
o1GIYYZJjM6nM03fQs_uEQ	casual	"As my roomies put it:  ""Finally a Thai place in Mesa that I actually like.""  ""This tastes like my Mom's Thai restaurant in Utah.""  Three of my roomies and I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef, Red Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Koong, Spicy Chicken and 4 Thai Iced Teas. The curry was the right consistency, not watered down and too thick. And the best part was that it was just deeelish! What is great about this place is that the spices don't overpower the dish, and you can taste many different flavors with each bite.  This little place seats under 16 people max. It's a definite mom and pops store that makes tasty and very reasonable priced meals. We chatted how we wish we hit this place up sooner because its one of the best tasting ones in the Phoenix area."
cN6aBxe2mQvrQlzk26LyRQ	fine	Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..  We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.  We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish.   For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...  The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!
jgWAgT7LWPTf5wju9Q-kiw	casual	OK, I'm somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this. I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish. Positives: Price!!!! Wow, the prices are amazing. I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95). The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go). The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings) I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit). The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious! Negatives: My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.' All of the food was really rather greasy. The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty). I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food. Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck! The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache. Regardless, this place is worth a shot!
dipzJ5BExpm6BtJ91mXd4Q	casual	Excellent everything! The customer service was struggling a bit but well, they just opened so hopefully that'll improve.   The cookies are great. The grilled cheese was so so. Took awhile to get to us but it was slammed (but also, I was on a time limit).  The manager came over and offered us free dessert for our not 100% experience. She also shared with us what soups were vegetarian and were not.  I'm excited to go back. It's a great option for Downtown Phoenix!
hpx8xdRVb_bjgc9h2xY5Pw	casual	"Where do I begin?   Let's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall.  Let's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no ""crisp."" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.  Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.  Let's discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubby's carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The ""tortilla"" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.  As for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either.   Riding on reputation, are we?"
0qPmDwHa9NdvvIOgerR8HQ	casual	Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek.   The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!  I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.  The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!  The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly.   They also cater which is a big plus!
U_CvxSM9epIi8u5A0jOUVw	casual	"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.  ""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""  Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.  A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.  My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.  When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.  After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.  The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.  ""Is it good?"" I asked  Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good.""   Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).  About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.  The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!  The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.  I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.  And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).  Additional Notes:  - Cash Only.  - Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).  - There never seems to be any ""Lumpia!"" :-/"
uVbt9dOe6qJgBBI4_XsXRA	casual	I may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant.   We came here after my parents played a round of golf. With their round they got two free steak dinner, which they raved about... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free, which today can be just as exciting.   I ordered the Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Potato Fries, and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions, it was delicious! I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal.   There were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine. But they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem.   There was karaoke playing the night we were there, which was interesting, but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift.   So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round, stop by.
Pv1H9KIGZTDgSaCDuTUjdQ	fine	The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.  I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.  Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.
TuuENwzxOFdDLY_oKCbFZw	casual	Yet another disappointing sushi restaurant in the desert. My date and I went here for their late happy hour on a Friday night. I noticed it was hard for larger parties to get a table. There isn't much space between tables. I played it safe and ordered a plate of salmon nigiri. I noticed there wasn't a large selection of raw fish. We ordered the peach soju and the spicy tuna tempura off the happy hour menu. I thought I would be getting a peach soju that's of a thicker substance, but it ended up being soju mixed with some peach sweetener that killed the alcohol. Maybe it was my mistake of ordering soju at a sushi joint. The spicy tuna tempura was a spicy tempura roll deep fried in tempura batter and then sauces drizzled all over each piece that was cut. I couldn't taste any kind of kick from the roll. STAY AWAY from the happy hour rolls.   What i think might be helpful is describing what's in each roll, rather than listing all the rolls on a sheet of paper for you to choose and its quantity. I'm so used to going to sushi restaurants that give you free miso soup, salad, and gyoza. These tend to be the cheapest items on the menu to prepare. Giving these out might keep customers coming back.   I won't be back.
LRuIY8JFqadCSYLo242MGg	casual	As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite. The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house. Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant. The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent. I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food! It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy. I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted. The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people. We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week! It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls. I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession. I try to eat there as often as I can :)
R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g	fast	I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating. They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake. Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers. Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely. I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.
TQNDCD50mkXwySB_qXmrXA	casual	I eat lunch here sometimes. The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt. I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there. Besides, these chips are real. Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back. They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil. Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them. They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe. I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno. If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro. Try the ice tea. It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's.
XfQelffgasSjLr8DeyGqHw	casual	Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)
Vm9GQUptdZmBM9R7tZ9_Tg	casual	"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied.   To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively.   And your salads are severely overpriced   Won't go back unless I'm desperate."
_OYlq2UoKPQO_ElqhC3a8w	casual	"This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday ""meeting"".  Otherwise known as happy hour!  They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.  If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.   With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.  I will definitely try them out again."
_ISHH8x8Qe6IoVTQWegbpQ	fast	Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw	fast	Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I don't know.  I actually didn't go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm.  All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones I've had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . .  Okay--challenge accepted.  I'll let you know.
WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA	casual	"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close. Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place. I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok, beans tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables. Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster with all the appearance of being tasty yet bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at ""chefing"" as opposed to cooking I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe) for the first time out and if the beans/rice suck.. no return. Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures. It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating."
1qrrdRh4cgMW-dm5kVNmdA	fine	Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.   It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.  When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.  Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.
uzETXY35sIROqx6nnGuq-A	casual	Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.
3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ	fast	There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.  The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.  Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.  Pani Puri was OK Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs  Not worth the trip.
zp713qNhx8d9KCJJnrw1xA	casual	One of the spot my coworkers and I go to for lunch. We usually try to get there before 11am (weekdays) to beat the rush from all the Corporate places near the MetroCenter. The deli sandwiches are good. I usually stick to getting the Amy's turkey-O. If you plan on substituting a side, make sure you tell them because the cashiers don't normally ask and you'll be stuck with chips. The salad bar here is very decent for the price. Don't forget to get ice cream on the way out!
53YGfwmbW73JhFiemNeyzQ	fine	Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service!   Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!
zOJdahdaaLz7DpfdIucslg	fine	"I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!  It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.  How do you say, ""Damn that was good!"" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).  The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.  There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.  It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!"
p9vPvx795VrVfwYv1IXicg	casual	"I've been eating at this restaurant for years. When I started going here it was called the Japanese bowl and had different owners. The menu under the new owners is much larger than it used to be and now includes a nice variety of Korean delights. Every visit is friendly and welcoming and we were always treated as family. I used to go with my family on a regular basis and they always remembered my son and his favorite order. The sushi is some of the best in the valley and they have some varieties that I've never had anywhere else. The Korean menu is great and they have specialized ""bento"" boxes for lunch as well as full sized dishes for dinner. The portions are good and we never left hungry. This is one of my regular dining pleasures."
pOurc7UleAr_LxLhrx7iSw	casual	I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.    When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts??    The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.    The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.  I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing!   In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!
nWLPuXTP6cunw86V1rJMAQ	casual	Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.
kJFS_3WlP6TFdNUYt6V6FA	casual	I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'!   While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner.   In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out:   - The very friendly staff - It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses!  - Clean decor  - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see  - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside.   I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.   Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!
i-0DzAP50NT6fBsYl3Rqlg	casual	I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking? The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure. Here's my old review for reference: Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition. It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa. Salsa sucks. It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.
jGldmslgIegQNM5kvb851Q	fast	I am a hot dog lover.   For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.
sI-2c9HZ0RjZX1OU-5DW0A	casual	I could see myself giving the Tavern a single star or two, but let me explain. It has a front and back patio, complete with misters. There's a full bar with Blue Moon on tap. The large size costs $4 until 9, I think.   The reason for 4 stars is that they're dog friendly; a bouncer explained to me how the owner loves canines so you'll see them around often. It gets a bit crazy on weekends. So usually if there's a long line, I'll keep walking.
NIuaxYvM_-dzmgGXwPJ1Gw	casual	Went here because of the reviews on Yelp, very good. Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top. Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so I'll go back and try a few different things.
5U1ArcV-HXR5UlkdQx1a9A	fine	"The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.       Things you will need:  1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time.  2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice).  3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate.  4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives.  5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),       Here's our experience:       Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.       We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: ""Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!"" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. ""This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right"", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - ""The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites....""  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself.        We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the ""parasite"" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out.        This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food."
NLwjvGh628IcuGGPpqirNg	casual	I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to. We were a party of 10 our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot. The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices. I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables. Nothing fried. The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!! Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving. have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go.
tpIU_ZvIfCfCp36IgghlHQ	casual	How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location? I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos. I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday. The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it. I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything. The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful. Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine. They could double their prices and I would still come back! I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.
O02Z6r9mO3tORhD5ynWPeg	casual	When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal. With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place. My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything. My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious! I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned. And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event. The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful. I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!

Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition. If you didn't know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc. Who knew huh? Yeah, like you didn't know! The area where this event happens is not very big. Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) I'm not even going to bring up the Shaft! However, come early enough and maybe you'll get lucky. Some people to do the ""I'm saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying! Needless to say the scene is awesome!

5_tsOGJQDDl9iKOr8K79Rw	casual	Joe's is a Gilbert staple. They have the service down to a science so you can start your journey standing in the back of a line that is about a quarter mile long, and inside of 5 minutes you are sitting at a picnic table under the trees enjoying your grub.  I have been a fan since before I knew why it was important to find and keep places like this thriving.  Joe is cool, and a guy that people who want to succeed in independant business in Arizona should keep their eye on.   The food is quality, the location has been around forever, but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor (like a life size tractor) and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy.  The menu is simple and doesn't try to do too much. The staff is usually very pleasant as well.   My usual is that potato that is as big as my forearm stuffed to the gills with pulled pork, sour cream, chives, bbq sauce, butter, cheese.   and pickles on the side.   If you haven't been to Joe's, you should make it a point.
rFgSvsgo0BWnS03NFgI7Sg	casual	We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.
Iu8jmmDFcDSf5PCdor1dvg	fine	If you have dietary restrictions or are insanely health-conscious (like me), YOU MUST TRY NOURISH.  This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons.   First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.  The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.  p.s.  Thanks for the tour.

ncuj9qx4WjprfJfYJGdmtQ	casual	We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident.   Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good.   The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming.   At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals.   I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.
P1mtrjPrvZpxRDVTQQ_Zxw	casual	oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.  well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.  so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?  i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.  can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?
ZoQAOnEFnyHjSpomtfqesA	fine	Hella, hella pretentious and offering food not at a level to back that up, imo~ No complaints, but nothing worth coming back for.  Really bland tacos, bland beans with tacos, decent portions, nice martinis/cocktails. Lemon tart was lemony. Mushroom pizza was mushroomy.   Pretty stock Safe White Yuppie Food menu aimed at hitting every upper-class food trend on the map right now. Nothing gets people going like making them feel green AND worldly!  Good wait staff, hostess was not on the ball so much, it was a Thursday night near closing time and there were toddlers crawling on top of some tables on the patio and other such perils of family dining.   Not a place that I will go on my own or drag my husband to. I understand the appeal for some people, bless their hearts, but this place is just too boring to waste calories on.
4EeLblEpJc2VeBowa94YPQ	fast	Hmmm ... where to start.  Food was good, flavorful, no complaints; although for the price I did not think the portions were that great - but everything was tasty and everyone enjoyed their meals.  It's a big open place, with concrete floors and picnic table type environment.  Patio with misters and big open doors to the outside.  A good atmosphere for BBQ.  Someone mentioned the parking being marginal (very true - same as when this was a bar in it's prior life).  I think my biggest downside is how much I had to serve myself - go to the counter to order, pay, get to table, get drinks, get place settings (plastic utensils), for a beer have to go to the separate bar area, order, pay, return for more, etc. (can't order beer where you order food).  While I enjoyed the food, not sure how often I'll be back - would not want to be there when it was crowded and have to wait in lines repeatedly.
oQ5jjVF-LtRnGNC5SGZQ9g	casual	I was on my way into Sweet Republic just before Christmas when I spotted Painted Pretzel a few doors down. Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights. Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate. Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic. You name it. They were going to sell it. Well I was sorely disappointed. Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business. No soft pretzels, either. They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc. There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few. The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special. The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best. Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels. So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you. Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores. I was just hoping for a little more.
VAlzQ-qJsSoTcJTc_1Pd1Q	fine	"Tandoori Times Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1. Limited run. Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises. All Rights Reserved. Dateline 7 May 2009 Scottsdale, Arizona Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S. Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times. One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw. That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw. Wild stuff."" Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread. Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan."" The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki. This has not been confirmed as yet. In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate. The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp. It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."" This has not substantiated, however. Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy."" Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato. It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices. An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced. Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert. I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."""
X5j76x6F5RbbeqD6J51iqQ	casual	My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.
dUi5Lg1Ay3HwK0p_ZaXNYg	fast	"You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. (""It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!"")   My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks.   The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.  The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in."
RlE_p_2XcfwoJPMT3NOG8w	fast	There's no better way to find out about a new eatery than to receive a gift card to one you've never been to (or heard of, for that matter). This happened to me when I received a gift card to Paradise Bakery. Being new to Phoenix, of course I Yelp'd it to find one nearby. I located this on on the SWC of Bell Rd and 7th Street while up at Sam's Club.   Paradise Bakery has sandwiches, salads, soups, sides, and of course -- the bakery items! At this location, you can eat in or take out. I like the Turkey Bacon Bravo or the Turkey Cranberry with a side of their excellent mac 'n' cheese and a drink. Getting this combo also scores you a free cookie!   This location is in the shopping area with a huge Target and many other stores, so the parking is hit or miss, depending on the time of day/week. And PB's prices are just a bit steep for what they serve...good food, but still a bit pricey.

yeuy070bBkc4CD71M1VZIA	fast	Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Ray's Pizza in NY. I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.  The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!
2qbajPD8M7PJlWWaHSRR5Q	casual	I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.  The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation.   I am disappointed with them and will not be back.
vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA	casual	I am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to Spitfire Grill, the food and drinks are always good.  Our complaint about Spitfire is that the owner and staff is never very welcoming. My fiancee and I have been there 15+ times and there is never any recognition by the staff. The owner is always there and he has never introduced himself or thanked us for coming in again.  The servers have never said 'welcome back or good to see you again'. For a neighborhood restaurant I would think you would want to make your regular customers feel appreciated. We love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house, but we lean toward other, farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel. For example, last night we went to House of Tricks in Tempe. It was our 4th visit. When we walked in three of the employees greeted us and welcomed us back. The bartenders remembered what we drink and asked us about something we discussed last time we were there. Talk about feeling welcome! Spitfire has a lot to learn if they want to survive in a neighborhood lacation.
3l72FflaaeI0tWEAWN3-gQ	casual	China Garden is one of those places that I crave.  I use to live not far from here as I was going through high school and a few years after.  I now live in the surprise area but about every two months or so I go out of my way to China Garden for the yummy sesame chicken and teriyaki wings.  There sweet and sour pork is also something to be desired.    China Garden does Chinese food the way it was done in the late eighties and early nineties.  It's what I grew up knowing and came to love.  The sweet and sour pork has the wonderful breading and is left to soak in the sweet and sour sauce.    Chinese food by today's standards leaves me feeling bloated and disappointed so I pass it up more and more.   The only regret when I eat china garden is that it will be a while before I get to go back.  The egg drop soup is also some of the best in the valley.  You have to go try it.  I have been going here since 1994 and still love it.    P.S. they do take out and the portions are HUGE for the price
5y88Y-RbndE0QNwQMeScew	fine	"I like this store. It is not perfect, it is not a real farmer's market, but they have many things which other stores do not carry.   First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything) If you see 15 different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.  Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference.  Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by 5 corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...  Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $5 per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...  Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another.   Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.  Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag ""Mexico"". It is unfortunate that ""grown in Mexico"" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).  These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.  Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.  A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.  So, this Sprout store is not perfect, but I will continue visiting it every week and look forward to some  improvements in the future."
UWc8_M-ecCNLfrkIzwwRQA	casual	3 stars is being generous. Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews. It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot. We had a reservation for 7:30. Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready. Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering. After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in. Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge. Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room. Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not. Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty. For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus. Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade. Very much a disappointment. On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance. Would I return again? No.
lXEJZjvwgSM3i6-HWpPwDA	casual	"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief! Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations. If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe. It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy ""organic"" foods. I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving ""all-natural"" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy. People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean. I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious. I'm excited to try this place again."

wH_kpDuTE6ChDAp5AlMfJA	casual	This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldn't suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didn't even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce. I hope it was some sort of mistake... but who does that? Puts straight pizza sauce in a bowl with a spoon? I had been drinking all night and was starving and still couldn't eat it. That being said, the staff here was great and the service was really fast.
lK35BgpjOMXwchPzqYWomg	casual	The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.
_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ	casual	I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:  -it's cheap -it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups) -there is plenty to choose from on the menu -for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...  That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.  I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!  PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!
qrapwnls-3IMg-iaXhkQKw	casual	I found this place completely by accident and it was great! I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried! The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me. The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot! Love it! Can't wait to go this week! The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently. Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)

It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..  We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.    Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.   Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place."
-bd26a1QEEpqUZjBmtBUiQ	fast	Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls. The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive. The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck. Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else. Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it. Five stars. Places don't get much better.

When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one. I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout. The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice.  Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too. Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown.
pRmHreZcF7YmNEEPukfcFg	fine	"I know that all Melting Pot locations gets mixed reviews... usually the price turns people off. It is a little pricey, but it's all about the experience. Also, since it's a time-consuming experience, one tends to be there about twice as long as at a regular restaurant. So I don't really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing. My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location. The husband and I always order the ""Big Night Out,"" generally the ""Lobster Indulgence."" (We figure if we're going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.) Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesn't bother me as much. Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this: Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc. Yummy! I must say that your experience also really depends on your server. If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time. We've had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences. Also, check out each location's web site prior to making reservations. They sometimes offer really great deals or promos, especially on weekdays. This info might be helpful to those who feel like the regular price is over the top."
IKDPP8onhaxbM12drBWCKQ	fast	Again, I'm trying to mix things up again on my end, and since Gold Bar was packed with no seating, I decided to go elsewhere and get my internet and coffee on.  This place is a little out of the way for me, but they offer free wifi, have great hours and serve donuts!!!!!  Hooray for donuts!  The place is small.  Counter seating only and its limited.  Parking is adaquet, and considering its a Sunday afternoon, an open seat is always a sight to see.  Service here is fine, and their donut selection is decent considering how late in the day it is for these guys. I don't go to Dunkin Donuts often, but thier always there when I need them.  I love the free wifi too!  hooray!  The one downside to this whole thing??  ITS FREEZING IN HERE.  I feel like I'm in a morgue its so dam cold.    Anyways, I will be back!!
vvWx1pJvr3QuFb7IW4-KGw	casual	If only they had a place like Tryst Cafe back in California! The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast.  The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.  My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijing's yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didn't get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty.  Overall? Great choices, great venue, and good food.
rPp509oz4oFEdncoo7v_HA	casual	You have to come here for the pho. Hands down! My boyfriend lives right down the street, so whenever we're hungover, feeling sick, or need our pho fix, we always come here. Sure, we've been to the Noodles Ranch up the way, but we love going to the Saigon Bowl, it's so 'Mom&Pop.' There's almost always no one else there and it looks super out dated. But we don't mind. We understand that Noodles Ranch is pricier than here mainly due to the atmosphere. But it's absolutely perfect if you just want to come in, sit down, guzzle down your pho and drench the meats in sauces and leave on a happy, full stomach while knowing you paid less than $9 bucks. The portions are large, the veggie plate served with herbs, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and limes is pretty standard and of good quality and size. The timing was just fine (although I've ordered one of their chicken entrees before and waited just a few more minutes longer than ordering the pho) and well worth the satisfaction to follow. I've ordered just about every type of bowl of pho and have never been unhappy. Broth alone isn't anything too strong. It's light enough to have you finish the whole bowl. The meats are perfectly portioned for dipping in the sauces that are at each table and of course, the ending gulps are the most flavorful. I'll always be coming to this place so long as it's in business.
QQ-lSbz4ARm1MQA5z8-nAw	casual	NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!   I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's.  I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days.   the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk. sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in.
hnw-5xX7i4C1po5X9i686Q	casual	San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:  Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!  Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!  Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)  Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!
wNUea3IXZWD63bbOQaOH-g	fast	"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.  When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.  Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.  Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.  Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.  The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.   The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.  I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.   I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell."
f9WU18QfVnUSuYbkQx5iIw	casual	I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other. I felt it was necessary in this case. My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park. The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome. They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty. One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding. The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted. WOW! This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too. He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted. He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh. It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves. They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days. We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly. He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet. Amazing. Only in downtown do you meet people like that. This is a great Subway. Go here and skip the others.

slO8j375ae2_Pd6PuyBLNA	casual	They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!!  The dishes I had so far: Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.
P8YUA2bXP-wD3VOzWqKVyw	casual	Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?  You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!  Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.
41V_WrLzJErAkjAHbFrqsQ	fine	Wow, I am surprised at the last review.  I have found the food at Bada Boom Pasta Room to be excellent every time I have been there.  I am in love with Mr. Pink's Pasta. It has a delightful vodka sauce, and you can also add proscuitto wrapped shrimp as well. They have a fantastic martini selection a well, and the decor it hip and fun.  Did anyone say red velvet walls?  Great place!
oXKPSI-RUqOvmuSCh_DEQQ	casual	"After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. ""Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad."" I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. ""Not bad I thought."" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.  The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as ""the bag was just opened, it's not possible"" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered ""wow"" and stepped out of the line.  The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?"
VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ	fine	I really Love this place! I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things.   The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.  I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!  My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!
YgRCJtt7pGvwlb9Ktumeeg	casual	If I could give 4 stars for atmosphere and 3 stars for food I would.  With all the hype of getting a Margaritaville I guess was expecting a little more in the way of Margaritas and cheeseburgers. But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt.
jsblnIZnHUQGufwVb_yX6g	fast	"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy! Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F experience! After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing! And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right! I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in. The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window). The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"") The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!). Anyway... I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries). I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger! I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers. But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!) And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars."
wN_wAXWg8W94v04eqijy6g	casual	"Never. Again. *hork*   I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick!   A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2.   POSITIVE:   Our waitress was very friendly and chipper.   NEGATIVE:   But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky.   The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter...   1) we never got our edamame,   2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that...   3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore.   POSITIVE:   She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days.   NEGATIVE:   No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant.   Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud.   And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid...   POSITIVE:   For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last)."
YQKZafMWvIVXfLrM_QjQ1Q	fine	There's a lot to love about The Mission.  The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit!  The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?  The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor. ***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!  The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.  The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).    A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)  Lots of wonderful food still to try here.  I will be back very soon for brunch with mom!
iJPG0GPcIirjOMlmzZWxBQ	casual	Oh Yogurtland.....why can't I resist your calling? I had to run an errand and saw this location next to a Fedex Office...perfect! I dropped in and ordered: Double Cookies & Cream, Strawberry, and Cheesecake...topped with Peanuts, Captain Crunch, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for around $4.90. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=VcouxvxQ0Sl310XRxn9HOg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=8xzd9ms7YvNaEAvn1irgsQ It was of course awesome!

rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw	casual	Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here.   Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!
mxrXVZWc6PWk81gvOVNOUw	casual	This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
Y-5knOy4atrpy-TJU7gEfQ	fast	The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...  I won't be returning to this location.
ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg	fast	Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I don't care for.  There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before.  I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for.  Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure.
3XG4-xRNCHPQs2sAYa66pw	casual	This was stop numero uno on our group's light rail bar crawl.  None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.  Situated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.  I ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.  Pro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.  Anyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.  I would also like to do the brewery tour.
SsNGCAsXJpeUY3sS99XQpQ	casual	It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.  But service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service.   I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place.
wzP2yNpV5p04nh0injjymA	fast	Wanted some mexican that wasn't taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway.  I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. I'm happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character.
ZRrIwqIUMII1b2keMI8QRw	casual	"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side ""Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni"" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)"
Pj22z5yPSozm_8G1OuzDwg	casual	I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event. Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day. I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good. We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil. It was all so delicious! I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil. Again, it was very tasty! Everyone was very friendly and prompt. I will be back to Upper Crust!
V5QdxePG-pGPXVPHSLLM9A	casual	Great place for tapas! I really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons. 1 being that they change the menu constantly and 2 being that each item on the menu is always good. Some are better than others, but the worst thing on their menu is good.  I love going with 2 or 3 other people so we can order a variety of things and I can try new and different kinds of food. Sol Y Sombra is always a nice change of pace from other Scottsdale eateries.   Nice cocktail and wine list also.
d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw	fine	"Mmmmmmm butterrrrr.   I'm speaking specifically of the Edamame with truffle butter. We probably could have eaten a few orders of these.   Sugar cane pork. Ohhh yes. Falls of those teeny little bones right into my mouth. Very finger foody. Delicious.   Spicy ""Sirring"" Shrimp. Comes out sizzling and spicy and delicious. As the server mentioned, ""Sirring"" isn't a real word, but who cares!  These three were the stars of the five tapas that we chose. I cant really remember the other two, so they clearly weren't that great.   The atmosphere is cute, artsy and pretty comfortable. The music was a little low, so we could hear the conversations of the couples on either side of us pretty easily. Kinda awwwwkwaaaard.   I would for sure return."
5AsVHsqADuurv7NqG-RFLA	casual	I love an Irish pub, and I love me some Fibber Magee's. My trips are fewer now that I live out in East Hell (Queen Creek), but when I lived in Chandler @ Dobson & Warner, I visited much more often. I still love the feel of this place - the dark wood, the high round tables. I feel like I am back in Dublin.  I used to get the bangers & mash every time I visited, but the past few times my most recent time I went with fish & chips - one of my favorites. I didn't see the bangers on the menu this time, so it may have been changed. The full Irish Breakfast is exactly like I had back at the Tyrrellspass Castle Restaurant on my way to Galway, Ireland.  Wash it down with a Guinness or a Black & Tan. Sláinte!

I didn't really know what to expect. it met my expectation. the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping. the selection was impressive. and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing. spam, was it? some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise.
N9iPqBRI47bewLAeKBlkIg	fast	I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway. Why did i wait so long?! Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo. The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie. It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies. We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap. It is incredible. Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down. Very high-tech! The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it. Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful. This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!! This is where you want to go.
roTWGaU-RcJ06l8cjFw7xQ	casual	When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serrano's on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serrano's in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serrano's but it doesn't have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....I'm sorry :)
KCKq8rwYSaVFHP8w694TAQ	fine	"I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.  Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out. I had at least one of the following: Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up. Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also. Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt. Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho. Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top. Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!  Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.  Failing that, I rounded up!"
Mh04jeZN1kKfS_u3JU-I_w	casual	"Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door. It worked out perfectly! Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible! I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte! I did, and it was just as good as last time! The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome. Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit! Looking forward to the next time... Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the ""hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte. Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?!"
-wwJIaO7-diyEqxGwZKVuQ	casual	"The first thing to know about this Los Reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th St! It's a different menu here, for starters! I had my heart set on my usual, a ""Torta Norteña, & a 99 cent Ceviché. They don't have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a ""Mexican Torta"". (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.) Anyhow, here's how it was for me here today: * This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY! * My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot! Both were good. (They don't even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.) * I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy! No problemo. Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa! * My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS! It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion. All this was good too (& DID remind me of the other location). * Gripes? THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with. SO? ...I didn't care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything! :-))"

This 50's palace of pink serves up a number of ice cream dishes, including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes as well as build your own creations. The ice cream itself was underwhelming, I was expecting a homemade recipe, but was a little surprised when I saw tubs of Dreyers being brought into the front dining room. Given it's location in Old Town Scottsdale, a venerable dumping ground of knick knacks galore, Sugar Bowl was exactly what I expected in terms of decor and atmosphere, kitsch, kitsch and more kitsch.

NtRs2Xd64mRLe6jGUTXziw	casual	Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail. There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion. I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor. I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends! The bartender wasn't that great. He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really? When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep. They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke. I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu. They were pretty good actually. I can't wait to come back.
w8D3DAby1nVgU8a4s3z88w	casual	So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.  Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!  Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.  The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.  A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.    Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.
-3xbryp44xhpN4BohxXDdQ	casual	"Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!).   I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.  The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars.   So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service.   The waiter:  * noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star. * is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will. * When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.  Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous.   All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot.   And there you have it."
MLPUSpkbWAvr9gJOELKqmQ	casual	Beer is almost a 4, food is a 3, service was a 4.5. + Check in deal makes it a 5. Add that up and divide by the hungry fellow and you get a 4. I got a pretzel and an oatmeal stout pulled pork burger. Forget the pretzel, it's a essentially a utensil to enjoy their amazing sauces. Even if you don't like pretzels or the sauce, it makes for a great palate cleanser between beers. The burger was nothing spectacular. I don't know where the oatmeal stout in the sauce, but it might have been in there. Best part of the trip was getting a got a complete education beer mixology. WHAT PEOPLE MIX BEERS! I learned about the Stumbler and the Snake bite; ask and you shall receive. Sampler note: Make sure to bring another mouth to finish a sampler, unless you plan to taxi and walk home. Beer Recommendations: Lady friend who hates beer: Snake Bite Hop Head: Pale Complex Beer Drinker: Stumbler or MonkeyShine Pilsner. light and amazing wheat finish, I can drink this all day Blonde ok little citrus, Pilsner was better Pale. Light with dry bitter finish, not for average drinker Red. Simple hoppy red Brown. a bit darker crispy red Oatmeal. Not smooth enough for a dark oatmeal, surprisingly a bit hoppy Old Monkeyshines. Simply intriguing If you are looking for a clean cut safe beer place with decent food and some beer geeks, Nimbus is your place.
0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA	fine	My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum. Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go. I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype. Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes. As soon as we sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try. The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent. I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen. I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls. Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that. I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself. The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate. Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price. If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to. There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip.

The happy hours isn't bad, as it boasts some reasonable and fun appetizers along with $2.50 IPA drafts, among other options.  The service was decent, but not great, and the ambiance as a whole didn't seem to be worth the prices on the dinner menu.  At least, I can think of several better options.
oajNY_oTIMb7YZsor7Xonw	casual	We came to Half Moon Sports Grill to watch the UFC Fight. It's a nice big place, yet we had to get there early since it filled up quick.   The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which July's is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. That's almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking.   First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOA  Then, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names.

For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQ  After all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action.

1NZLxU5WvB5roPFzneAlLw	fine	"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest. I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated. The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing . I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree. When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side. Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap? I work in the food industry and the food was crap. Next, the entree. The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth. Explaining to me how delicious this special was. So I took his advice and ordered. When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?"" Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce. The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw. The funny thing was. The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all. I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap. The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again. I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre."

Strike 2: They have all the necessary items to make nachos, but when asked if they would make me nachos I got a very quick and blunt ""NO"". Strike 3: When forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat (the most EXPENSIVE ingredient) not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans, or guac, or extra cheese, they still charged full price! I don't want to eat meat and I sure don't want to pay for it.   And as far as the food, well, they got that part right, for a place that serves fine fast food, when you ask me how my meal was, my response would be ""Fine""."
o0snahBUg0DYC5PIM0bz3Q	casual	I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up.  Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup.   The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.  On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.  So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.   Finito.

As I walked in, I realized I've been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.  I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face).   I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.   Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."

rrWhi2TL0smrbihvavZxcg	casual	HUGE fan!  Love Poncho, the birthday strobe lights, the food and the service.   This is a go-to for my boyfriend and I when we're looking for sushi. More likely than not, we'll opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person.   With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here.
g6ygZTK9TTI3CsSTKUkPlw	fine	Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town.

JAfPOKUAYK2_lSRnyKBgpw	casual	I was in Mesa for a workshop over the weekend, and this was a convenient place to eat. I wasn't overly impressed. The food was ok, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I expected more from Mexican food in AZ.
RIRgqPezzlRVV4Y2G5TgoQ	casual	Been a patron since this eatery first opened. This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy. The food is that fabulous! My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf. My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup. The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich. The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour. Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.) Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour. :-) Happy Eats!

And for some strange reason, there aren't any Dunkin Donuts in Chandler or Gilbert (can someone explain this phenomena to me?).  I know, for donut purists out there, Dunkin Donuts is just another corporate chain.  But I happen to think their donuts and coffee are pretty tasty!  That said, Bosa Donuts is nice alternative.  It's a small shop with a good variety of freshly made donuts.  I especially liked the chocolate frosted cake donuts.  They were really good.  The coffee was ok, let's say... better than ""breakroom"" coffee.  Located just north of the Downtown Chandler area, Bosa Donuts has both walk-in and drive-thru service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
MRgTo4MA3f1MB_VL3IVh5g	casual	I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night. Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice. It is an older place with tons of charm. The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked. After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order. After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills. The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent. Everything I tried was top notch. Everything was freshly made and delicious Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around. Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. I would definitely return but hope the service is better.

I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds. They are that good! A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles. I don't know of another small place like this that does. Veddddy goood. Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol.

My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"". WOW! Sorry but I don't think I will be returning."
lk-6NXfpSgvNw7zm0xtUVw	casual	I found this place on Yelp, and went there for the lunch buffet. Having read the reviews, I had really high expectations of the place, but was sorely disappointed. Watery sambar and rasam, hard idlis, dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing, gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns, inattentive and too few waiters, and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion, Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely. Their a la carte menu items might be better, but I am not going back to find out!
t6EzCDJEqB0DVBq4XQv6Ow	casual	Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.  The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.  The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.  Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.
qVoWe3nVVkg5KSOmQpntIw	casual	I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive.   I had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor.   There aren't a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... I'd say this one is a very solid pick.
eJpr6Ks8pr4bmvDVPTN-Xg	casual	"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.    We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers.   Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.  The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be ""dipped"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too.   It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too...."

They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food.   We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. We're used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if we'll order from here again, unless we don't find our NY style place, but it was still good.

Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.  Say ""Nah"" Like the famous sunglasses kid, ""Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot.""  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  ""You sir, command that fish into this taco."").   Short list of amazing things to be had here: 1. Margaritas. 2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it? 3. The Chips and Salsa  4. Chicken Tacos.   5.  Ice Tea.  6. Pacifico"
YmhskhHArN4CHTG49kC_hQ	casual	"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
gMMAz-WbNpl_825lWbMnkw	casual	While my partner and I don't normally like chain restaurants Ling & Louie's is an exception. They're a small chain of only two restaurants they are franchising.   We both started with Miso soup which was okay. Then we moved on to Potstickers, on of our favorites. they were very good, but not outstanding. For our entree's I ordered Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and my partner ordered Meatball Sliders. The Chicken was VERY spicy, but also very good. I didn't have room to try the Meatball Sliders but here they were also very good. All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and the service was perfect.
m51fZnQueyj1q1Ra_yDQjQ	casual	"Bottom line: the new owners bring you better beef than Al's in Chicago. Yes-they really do. Italian food tastes better in Italy (usually). That meal on a dock in Sausalito is not the same even if you copy it exactly when you get home. Food is an experience that is altered by the location, mood, companions and results. So, being at Al's in Scottsdale is not the same as being in Chicago...that's obvious, so get over the fact that you're stuck in North Scottsdale, and not in the Windy City. But the new owner's seem to have this place clicking. The sandwich is awesome, and they work the floor to check on your experience. They care. I read a bad review about a hambuger here...are ya nuts? Al's...ditch the burger...who cares? and customer...what the heck brought you here for a burger? Sheeesh. I digress...again. I have always enjoyed a trip to Al's in Chicago. Portillo's, Johnny's, and don't even get me going on the Portillo's vs Al's debates, but even though Al's beef wasn't always the best quality, the combination of beef, grease, jardiniere, gravy (jus), spices, and peppers at Al's has always nailed it flavor-wise for my palate. When I worked in Phoenix, a trip to Luke's on Indian School every few months would deliver an OK time, but it didn't really satisfy my craving for great Italian beef. The first franchise for Al's at this location, brought those flavors I was craving, but messed up everything else about running a restaurant, and I still went back, and was sad to see them not make a go of it. Unfortunately, that left a flavor void, and I kept waiting for new Management to get open...and just before they did, I went on a very serious training and diet regime. My latest race results and training schedule gave me a little room for coming off the regime a little, and I decided today was my perfect cheat day...I mean Al's day. They really nailed it. My fries were wonderful (I was eating them while they were bringing me hot sauce)....crisp, slightly browned, gooey in the middle, loaded with flavor, without being over-salted. The beef was absolutely great, better meat than original Al's in Chicago, as good as Portillo's in meat quality, but with all those insanely fantastic flavors I remember from my best sandwiches at Al's. Definitely one of my best sandwiches so far in 2012...and I highly suggest the ""Wet, with a side of gravy"" method. Many may object, (oh, ye lazy masses) but, I think Al's tradition of fully-dipped sandwiches leaves you with a sodden mess, that takes the bread out of the sandwich equation. If you are indeed- lazy, well then the dipped style gives you more wet bread that has soaked up that insanely good flavor combination. So if you are lazy, and also-messy, get it dipped. But there is a better way- it just takes a little work and technique...so simple it's easily mastered by a hungry 7 year-old, but they can also fix a frozen iPhone, so.... The perfect compromise is to order the sandwich Wet, with a big side of gravy (no charge for that- thank god). You can pour large amounts of the jus into the end as you go (obviously held upright), pinching the sandwich down below your planned bite, so the jus doesn't just run through, but soaks the meat and that portion of the bread from the inside out. Lot's of the jus is what Al's beef needs to soak the meat and release that delicious flavor combination, absolutely soaking the bread too, but maintaining the sandwich integrity, while adding in a tiny little bread crunch on the outside. (As a caution: you can order the beef ""Dry"". My advice if that would be your choice: don't go here. This is not a sandwich that is designed to be eaten dry- the beef will be flavorless and without charm. A Roast Beef from a good deli will be awesome if that is what you are in the mood for) ""Wet, gravy on the side, sweet and hot peppers, cup of hot sauce."". Spice the gravy up with hot sauce to your taste, pinch that sandwich, and pour as you go. Freaking awesome sandwich, that blows away the local alternatives. And I'm perfectly happy with a spotless, new interior in North Scottsdale. I don't need Chicago memorabilia or grungy atmosphere to enhance my sandwich experience when the beef is this good. Bring a few good friends, order up a few beef, try a combo with sausages, share and compare, and start your own great dining tradition. Very cool to think that I won't be jamming a daily Italian beef into every Chicago trip just because I couldn't get them anywhere else. Gotta step up the training another notch so this can be a weekly lunch choice, because I am stuffed right now, and I still want more of that flavor!!"
KoJ4jNSmqYbmKqcoh-2dNA	casual	When I found out I was going to Scottsdale for a vacation, I signed up for Groupon and was excited to score a tequila tasting at Cien Agaves! Well, I didn't read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month. Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on. We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)
LnNQdWEbcYIbC6rjdFBpqw	fine	Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in. I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it. I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter. I don't get that. The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria. It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms. Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo. It's a must!... if you don't like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya. The combo of the two is a match made in heaven. They have great salads and their own special house dressing. Heads up on your ranch lovers. they do not have ranch dressing. As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet. Good food!
ZZP4c4epsE4j_SniQe6KnQ	fast	I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.  P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up.

It was awesome. Finally she said ""what planet are you from?""...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says ""Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy"".  LMAO!  Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our ""date night"". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!  Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.  Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?  We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds.   I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff."
IdnYOlL9aDfMu_S2kcaUkQ	casual	Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.  It's really not that hard.
Xobu8FzHN0KUm5Lw3swypA	fine	The food's been covered before so all this review will be is further social proof that this place does indeed rock.    I've missed good veal cannelloni for a while now , looks like I wont need to anymore:)    For once it's not the processed grey stuffing that has one texture throughout  surrounded by an inner tube ( Cough  famous chain)    Erin's  Pollo Piccata was excellent  and the accompanying pasta was perfect.  Sadly  they fed me too well since I was dying to try the tiramisu  but the afternoons plans didn't involve  refrigeration.  Lastly thanks to all that  saw the excellent reviews and kept piling them on it really makes a big difference on how likely we've been to try new places.
3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag	casual	I am really surprised by the previous reviews here. This has been at the airport for many years now.  There is a lot of other places for food, and this is one of the BEST! They have a huge menu, i think and you can even get breakfast. The prices have even gone down. You can get a full meal for under $6.00. That is a screaming deal at Sky Harbor airport. Hard to choose a favorite, but Chicken Delight is really good!! With red or green sause.   Their Salsa is excellent as well. We sometimes get it to go, when through with a trip for our journey home. Hey then you don't have to cook!
TnKMo7BnsbqFaeNL1GY3og	casual	This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph... Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta. I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasn't bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated. A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter. The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie.
WPSM_oTPceoSnwqQWfAsdg	fine	Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.  We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.  The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing. I definitely recommend this place!
U6oNWTxVTnuuCL0BPRZCSg	casual	Same as the others...   Clean, friendly and good.   I was able to order a chicken legs and mashed taters for one kid, coleslaw and frys for the other, 2 kids meals for the adults and no one complained. They are always more then happy to help you in anyway possible.

The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is ""lively"".  So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!"

You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go.   I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.
uU70AmVxV_OOgkumhUpu-g	casual	Happy Hour Review.  We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess I'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass.
oaakO-X7uOXNxqsxjDSKfg	fine	"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that. For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
pBBN3KhKTETvjeWg-MXJGA	casual	The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!
jdStuaC_1leN_DNGcQ0yEw	fine	"Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix?   Be entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?  Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?  Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you!   Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent.   For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting ""real Chinese"" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.  The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food.   They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.  Come here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum."
XYhVyCbzJCrYclR6J4LYSw	fine	"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.  We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.  However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.  Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient?   Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.  [* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]"

qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w	casual	I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice. The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross. The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross). The chicken wings were not that great either. The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall. I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.

Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that. So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound. So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon. Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.
lquFtAcCRSpNYAN1qlxWhA	casual	Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out. Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices. The coffee is great. Period. They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud. The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty. The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one. The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type. The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd. I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode. My only complaint is that they need to find a way to get a bike rack closer to the door. My only other complaint is that they could have more snacks available, I would love to dip something baked in their coffee.
x-QxnXWvV9m8FNAeIsnoFw	casual	Why go to some new place that tries to recreate the ambiance of an old fashioned ice cream parlor when you can just go to an actual old-fashioned ice cream parlor? Unlike newer parlors, Mary Coyle's doesn't try to be self-referentially hip or ironic, they just serve good ice cream without pretense. The thing is, they must be doing something right since they're popular with all age ranges and different groups of people. Plus, it seems like the high school kids working there are having a good time and actually glad to see you when you come in.

I'm used to saving more than a dollar at happy hour but, the apps ARE good. Our waitress CJ then explains in Thai to my wife and daughter a couple of the dishes. We order 7 entrees and they arrive in a timely fashion and were all quite tasty. Problem 1 The sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers, should have been at least 4x -10x as much. Problem 2. The rice which came with 2 of our entress was fine but, we ordered EXTRA rice and, that didn't show up until most of the main dishes were gone. Even after asking a second and third time, it took 4-5 minutes for them to scoop it out of the rice cooker and bring it, Not cool, guys. This is my third time here and it is ok but, 5 stars?--not.

Vx7-xbazum3dgo3Qj3i4pQ	fast	This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to. I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something. Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins. Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work. Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.
fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug	fine	One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service.   Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner.   The bar area is always DARK (how it should be).
IX5FfZL4P7WGOG-xwdD4wA	casual	Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.   I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.
fowXs9zAM0TQhSfSkPeVuw	fast	No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did. However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes, mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.

I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine. I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were- Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad pop with flavor. Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach. Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together. The service we had was phenomenal. The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!

I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead. Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me. I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was. Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.). And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside. How in the hell do they do it? I don't know, but I'm in love.

I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying ""okay"" and ""yes"" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say ""yes"" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying.   Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints.   As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies."

We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.  An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.  For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.  For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.  For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.  So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.
