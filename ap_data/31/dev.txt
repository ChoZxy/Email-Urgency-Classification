801	1	"I've had ramen from Japan to New York and places in between. The ramen was way too oily. Pretty gross, actually."
792	2	"Not as expected Room cleaning service not so good lots of dust. children diving & swimming in hot tub. Floats of all sizes allowed in pool, lots of kids splashing. No TV when it rains. Looked like free summer camp. Saw 2 women with 15 kids. I counted them twice. Loud disrespectful kids all over the place. Not a place to relax. The beds have the worst mattresses. 5 nights, room cleaned one time. Maid service comes late while we were back in room. Shuttle bus to Universal. We had to take a cab."
858	2	Very friendly employees. The make up artists are very talented. I've had a couple of them do my makeup. I also recommend trying their smoky eyes service. I like to go to Sephora during off hours when it's not too crowded in there. Obviously the no pressure concept is working for them. I also like to support small local stores as well but one of the nice things about this place is you can browse among a lot of different brands and not feel pressured about commissions. They'll make you samples. I also like to buy products here versus some other places because you get loyalty points for doing so.
611	2	"I've never taken to social media to review before now. The Salem, MA location has terrible customer service. I'm livid with my treatment. A few days ago, my order was over an hour late, arrived cold and the driver forgot the receipt. For my trouble, I was told that my next order would be free. I just phoned to take them up on that, and I was told there was no credit in their system for me. I am too failed by this location. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business. SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY! Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable. A free side order? Not good enough! I'm a disabled, housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today. I've never experienced such deplorable service from Domino's. I've been a loyal customer for over 20 years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts. I'll never do business with you again. I'm writing corporate as well. I don't taken being mistreated well. It's unacceptable!"
46	2	Bummer. I was very disappointed. So I finally stopped in for take out. I got the fried haddock sandwich with fries. The fries were frozen and greasy.. The haddock sandwich was not good. Tasted very fishy and frozen. I had such high hopes their take out would be good.
882	2	eat the COPPA. best thing ever. I usually get the mashed potato with gravy as my side and then my bf gets the Boss salad and we split the two plates between the two of us. The coppa is amazing but it's quite heavy so half the sandwich is perfect amount for any foodie person. Trust me. Service is solid. They do have a 5 drink max policy. If you go there often get the beer card so you could eventually get a mug.
283	2	Affordable prices and really good food!! What else can I ask more?? Even tho I saw one guy taking care of the tables (it was lunch time so it was kind of busy) he came often to ask if I wanted something else and how I was doing.. Service is rely good he even recommended a desert.. Going back for sure and bringing some friends!! I highly recommend this place.. Do yourself a favor and check it out.. I had Lomo saltado Btw..
468	2	"This place has fresh, authentic food. It's always very clean, and the people are really nice. If you live near them like I do, you'll see that they get daily shipments of fresh food, all of which go straight into proper storage. Also one time I forgot my debit card and they gave me a free burrito."
976	2	"I come here all the time as I live within minutes of this place.. and I love it. The monk who works here is very friendly and makes good suggestions for special treats to eat from the menu. I love that they make all the fake meats themselves, you can literally taste the difference! The salad rolls are super yummy. And definitely try the avocado smoothie- a tasty treat! I will mention that this is a very laid back restaurant and while the service isn't like a regular restaurant you will not compromise the quality of food. I will continue to go there for a quick snack/ lunch/ dinner forever!"
659	2	"Bought a deal online for 5 classes. I have been taking similar classes at a Lexington studio. Apparently, Jody owns both studios. These classes are amazing! They are challenging and go by quickly. My body has changed drastically, taking this type of pilates once a week for the past couple of months."
577	3	"I've had the pleasure of working with Mandy at a number of weddings and also being a part of the weddings & special events industry, I can see the difference between a quality planner and a hack in this saturated landscape. Mandy is absolutely of the former, with the rare quality of being on top of her game -- yet is always calm and collected. Never during the events I worked with her did I sense that she was overwhelmed and everything always went off smoothly and without a hitch! A Planner's vibe sets the tone for the rest of the vendors working an event and if I had a Planner like Mandy to work with every weekend, I'd jump on the opportunity."
302	3	Granted it was Friday but the wait to get drinks and food was unacceptable. We got seated quickly but even getting waitress to come by was difficult. Had two hungry kids waiting. Messed up drink order. And messed up food order. Staff may be overworked and our waitress in particular did not seem well versed in the menu. As far as food is concerned. Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices. Veggie-changa was too breadth and didn't have much flavor. Chips were ok. Margaritas were way too sweet. Would not go again.
827	3	"Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years. The plus is when one happens to magically choose the ""freshest"" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily. I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite. On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good. If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins, and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared. The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon. Our consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall. There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories."
273	3	"Apparently it's a requirement to have a TERRIBLE attitude to work here. Just moved in across the street and was excited to have a juice bar across so close! Went in the first day to be ""greeted"" by a young woman with the worst attitude ever. I felt like I was doing her a disservice by asking her to do her job. Went in the day after hoping she wouldn't be working because the food was quite good, only to find another young woman with an equally if not worse attitude working. Whoever owns or runs this establishment needs to find people who don't suck life out of the room to represent their business. I would rather pay someone to go and get me a smoothie than go in myself."
83	2	"Jacks is the place to be. The food is exceptional, I recommend the calzones! Or one of their funky pizza slice creations (hotdog pizza ect)! They have some good alcohol prices and a good atmosphere. During dinner it's always packed though so be prepared to sit out back!"
579	1	Great atmosphere and music! Food was awesome! Best Fish Tacos I've ever had! Jerk Chicken Pasta was even better!
229	3	I have mixed feelings about this place. First it's really cute and fun. I got excited about the cereal on the donuts since I haven't had Cap'n Crunch since I was 10. But a few things will probably keep me from going back. The server actually left out a donut I asked for and I had to check the box and make sure it was in there so that was kind of lame because she definitely charged me for it. The donuts themselves are very thick and yeasty so I could only make it through one before I felt very full. I like to have a variety of donuts and different flavors when I splurge on donuts and it just isn't possible here. I think I'll probably stick to other places that do the donuts themselves better and aren't just a spectacle.
804	2	"Passport services are on the 2nd floor. You can take the stairs just to the right of the main entrance to the International Office or take the elevator from inside. I arrived at 8:10am to have passport photos taken. I was out of there within 10 minutes with photos in hand. There were two families queued up for actual passport services. Since I just needed passport photos, the receptionist took the photo and processed my payment. There is a separate counter for processing passports and ESL services. Great experience!!"
584	2	"The Rosewood Chiropractic staff treated me kindly, and with care. It was difficult to schedule an appointment online (within a two week range) for a male massage therapist. However, the male that I was scheduled with was fantastic! He listened and worked on problem areas. I highly recommend this facility to anyone looking for a massage that exceeds expectations!"
713	1	These people are extremely cheap and didn't deliver what I ordered via Teleflora. Consider me an experienced buyer who only wants the best for the people I send flowers too & I will never order from here nor Teleflora again.
739	3	"Mattresses...we all need them, but it can really be a pain to shop for them; seems like the mattress business attracts some hucksters to it. Notice all those 50% sales at the mattress stores? Umm hmm. Anyhow, the old mattress had been caving in for quite a while and she finally started to share my opinion that it was time for as new one (I think when you have to climb out of the bed rather than off of it, it's past time). There is one specific brand/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. Rachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress. Everything done exactly the way it was agreed to. Perfect."
910	1	"What is a Chinese street sandwich? Delicious, that's what it is! Just picture a handmade flatbread wrapping device enclosed with a chicken so lightly fried you almost think it's calamari. Then add pickled peppers, greens and sauce. You now have the Chicken Po Boy in your hands. Eat and enjoy."
117	1	"Stopped in for lunch, was pleasantly surprised! We ordered garlic cheese bread, the pizza lovers flatbread and chicken piccata. All were very delicious. The service was great, the food was great, the music makes you feel like you are in Italy. We will be back for sure!"
349	2	"Note to the Yelp admin: this place actually closes at 4:55 pm, not 5 pm. Weird, I know, but I went to get an iced coffee on another hot Boston day and when I arrived at 4:55 I waited. I waited a few minutes before someone came over and told me it was closed. Still before 5 pm. Thankfully there's a Starbucks coming in soon across the street so we don't have to settle when we want an afternoon iced coffee."
718	3	"I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson. With Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process. Every single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful. On top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired."
150	1	Delicious shirini (sweets) and the best napoleans in the northeast!
389	1	Enjoyed a great lunch with colleagues this afternoon. The service was awesome as well as the food. I will definitely be back.
74	2	"Falafel wrap - falafel with greens, pickles, and hummus in a toasted wrap. I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good. But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. They are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out."
416	1	Always a delightful experience. Staff is attentive and helpful and the food excellent. We always look forward to eating at Gran Gusto when we're in Cambridge.
40	2	Had the worst experience there today when I tried to have a breakfast. The service was slow waited at least 30 min for my French toast and when it got there I pulled a long grosse hair out of it. I'm never going there again!
724	2	"The Cart in the middle of DTC has good Burritos. I get the fajita wrap which with my specifications entails: rice, cheese, guac, salsa, hot sauce, steak, grilled onions and peppers and sour cream. It is superb. Not cheap for a street vendor (Large is $6.50 plus a buck or so for guac), but very good."
684	2	"Stopped in here to try the new Gluten Free bun with a grilled chicken sandwich last Thursday. The GF bun was a little small and dry and tasted just okay. The bun did crumble apart as I ate my grilled chicken sandwich. This is somewhat typical of GF breads. My fries were lukewarm. The store was clean and service was quick and friendly, so I'll be back to try the GF bun again when I'm in the area."
800	1	"Hate to say this but they leave the food on the warmer over heated and soggy. It's not like there's a lot of people by 1:45pm but Christ people will be eating what they paid for! Yup that's what I had, a soggy string beans and broccoli. Yuck! Do a better job please!!!"
593	2	"After searching for reasonably priced/good quality nail places in the tri-cities, I am happy to have for Elegancy Nail! Seriously awesome service, relaxing atmosphere and fantastic pricing. A lot of nail places you feel rushed through, but Elegancy gives you a true 'spa' like experience. Furthermore, they gel colour polish manicure I did lasted 3 weeks! No chipping, no flaking."
668	2	"I went well out of my way to try the sushi here. Upon arriving, I quickly regretted it. The guy preparing sushi behind the counter was sniffing constantly. It was gross and made me concerned that someone sick was preparing my food. Against my better judgement, I ordered the pineapple roll. I was sadly disappointed. It had an unappetizing crunch to it, and it was small for the price. The girl behind the counter was friendly, but not enough to make up for the food or ambience of the place."
500	2	The staff is super friendly and drinks are usually cold and properly made and reasonably priced! Great beer selection and wonderful gals behind the bar!! Just what bee cave needs!!!
618	1	My friends and I were in town at Universal and wanted to skip the chain restaurants and Theme Park food...we decided to try this place out and were not disappointed. Authentic Mexican food and friendly homey environment. Will definitely be back our next trip to Orlando.
656	1	Awful service.. slow!.. couldn't get refills like asked.. feel we were ignored! Won't go back to this location.. Garlic butter fries were dry
298	2	I had the pan friend noodles with beef today for lunch. The noodles are made in house and are so delicious! $7.95 special for lunch and you get a huge bowl of noodles. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!
765	3	"I went here for a birthday, had one of my worst experiences at a restaurant, and joined Yelp just to write this review. I went with my girlfriend for dinner during mid-week and found the place doing decent, though not busy, so we were at least seated promptly. Everything went downhill from there. We started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. Do not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location)."
348	3	"I was going to leeba for over two years. I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice! Unfortunately second time I didn't get message til after I went to salon. I am so hurt and disappointed by how I was treated by Elie. And I was totally ripped off."
346	2	It is the most convenient store to my house. In spite of the inflated prices i still chose this establishment. The selection is decent but that does not make up for the over all cold demeanor of the staff. They are rarely helpful and make this establishment a piss poor contender in comparison to its competition.
376	2	"I love this damn place. It's hard not to feel like Norm from Cheers after you've been in a few times, between Joe, Suzanna, Potter and Corey your drink is in front of you before you have to order it (as long as you aren't one of those Taco Mac around the world types) and there's always a genuine ""how are ya"" behind it. The later it gets, the smokier it gets, and you'll never go home in a condition that allows you the privilege of smelling your own perfume/cologne, but in the summer months this can be a saving grace. No patio = less hipsters invading, just a bunch of neighborhood guys and gals out for a low key evening with a couple of pints. Did I mention I love this damn place?"
778	3	"This place has so much potential for a family adventure. Monster Trucks, Orange slushies, cheesy decorations galore. But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide. Part one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. Critique one, get a good guide for the trucks, The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun. This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. Critique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks. They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done! Critique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. Part two in the store: friendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day. We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade. Both were very good. But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere. The slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating. This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place with some attention to detail. I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review. That will keep this a half full review."
740	3	"OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom. First, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar / pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. Second, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. Third, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. fourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) The burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. Considering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable! finally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. All around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!! go Romer's!"
809	2	"Came to Wonder Spice with a friend who grew up going there. The two servers we had were very friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! They heard me talking about how I'd had a certain dish spicy somewhere else and offered to make my meal spicy. Big portions and a comfy atmosphere-great for lunch or dinner--reasonably priced as well."
922	1	Why can't burgerville get food hot?? New location in Tigard. This is like the one in Canby. Same cold food and seems like smaller burgers?? Anyone else? The place is clean and folks were nice. Lots of competitors close by.
274	2	"Absolutely overpriced for the value. I wanted to support a small business but we got absolutely ripped off. $668 to fix a leak in an outdoor, below-the-ground pipe. I don't think he understands the basics of business--a business thrives by adding value. And doing so repeatedly. Not by overcharging customers. I even tried to explain this to him but to avail. We will never use this business again."
959	3	"The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other ""teenager/young adult premium wear"" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great. The quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. Although their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail. As far as customer service/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for. We quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy! I also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between ""rise"", ""fit"", ""leg opening"", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house. Overall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about, and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want."
898	2	"This seems to be the sixth location in the area and is similar to the Roswell Rd location, but opened end of December 2013 and has a bit more space. It was brand new and clean (though a few things were still being added) and fairly empty, so the kids roamed around having a good time. They even had a dance party with a mascot for the 10-12 kids there at the time (I would have guessed they did this only for parties)."
170	1	Super fan of this spot in downtown! Came out for a lunch meeting and was surprised at how good it truly was. Ordered the Lamb Gyro platter with side of Hummus and Babaghanoush. Platter has a good portion of lamb on top of a small amount of rice... served with pita and pita chips. Great Lunch spot. My new fav Mediterranean food place in Orlando!
173	1	This place is good! You have to stop and try if your in Austin. I had the Raspberry white chocolate shake and a burger. Best burger place in Austin.
136	2	"What a quaint little authentic Argentinan restaurant. Located east of Downtown Austin, but close enough to downtown. They had delicious meat and spinach empandas. All types of Argentinan wines to choose from as well to encompass the flavors of South America. We ordered the pork tenderloin for dinner and the gnocchi. I LOVED the gnocchi! I thought it was so good! For dessert we had the chocolate creme brulee. It was delicious too!"
86	3	"This restaurant is delicious! I've had Ethiopian in DC (which is the best I've tried) but this place is a close runner up. The boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We first got the honey wine which was really sweet and syrupy. It reminded me of mead. Then we got the meat combo and everything was tender, delicious and flavorful. They certainly don't skip on the injera here. My favorite part about this place specifically is that they serve the food traditional style in colorful baskets! I've never seen that before and it made the experience that much better :)"
41	3	"I wanted this to be a great place, but I wasn't impressed. I went there for dinner on a Monday. I tried the pulled pork sandwich--it seemed like a sort of specialty. My husband had the burger. The buns left something to be desired. The fries were okay but a little cold. But at about $10 per entree for bar food, it wasn't as good as it should have been. Service was fine--they were overstaffed. I don't think I will be back anytime soon."
66	3	"So my roommate borrowed my clock radio and apparently left it set to this station. This meant I got to wake up to my normal 7 a.m. radio alarm hearing some god awful ""dude-bro""/man child apparently named ""Lunchbox"" YELLING literally at the top of his lungs. Gee, can you think of a more UNPLEASANT way to wake up at 7 a.m? I honestly think I would have rather woken up to a cheese grater across my face than listen to this frat-boy douche yelling like a 5 year old having a tantrum in the name of some morning show bit. Then one of the other hosts couldn't even identify a Bon Jovi song playing? Are you kidding me? Where the hell did they find these people and please wherever it was send them back and get them off the damn radio or any job where they are actually required to speak for that matter. As for me I have re-adjusted my radio dial to a different station and banned my roommate from ever borrowing my clock radio again!"
240	3	"I can't thank Michael enough for his amazing service! I just moved back to the area and need a new stylist. I came in with *orange* hair, trying to lift from years of boxed black (I know, I know) after having been told by more than one stylist that I had to settle. My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists don't have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver. I also requested a challenging cut, going from kind of long blah to an ""a line"" bob which is also amazing. I am *really* happy with the outstanding, attentive service that I received and I am happy to have a stylist whose work I really love!"
545	1	"Great value, lots of gluten free options and very nice staff."
968	2	"Good customer service, even on a busy day. Only reason I giving them 4 stars is because of a lack of inventory. I was there close to a hour trying to find the right pair of work boots. It was worth the time though. I had narrow my choices down to 2 models of what they had in my size-12. They found 1 of the models with a blemish. I didn't care since they are for work, and it was cosmetic. I walked out happy paying $65 for a pair of $200 boots. This is my 5th pair of Keen boots in 8 years. Great brand, but a little pricey. That is why I am stoked about my new boots."
547	3	"This was by far the worst timeshare experience! HORRIBLE customer service, we actually had some employees snap at us! We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn't sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for. Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day. The dryer didnt work. I complained & was told that it just doesnt work well.... after 2.5hrs our clothes were still wet! My fridge broke, they came & turned the setting to ""coldest"" & called it fixed! It BROKE, settings cease to be relevant. They didnt come back to repair or replace itn just let me wait. W had to have security let us into our room 1-3 times per day. Security snapped at us & insisted that we put it next to our phone which we did not. Nobody smiles, it must suck to work there? Waiting for security & maintenance & having damp clothes laying across everything to dry, then having to repack, move to a different condo then unpack AGAIN wasted a full day of our trip. One employee (Ana Delis) cut me off & went off on me when I told her the problems with my condo. She basically told me to tell it to someone else, she isn't responsible for our condo problems but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH RUDER!! This has been an absolute nightmare. I'd never own after knowing what kind of rude people they hire. Seriously... stay away from Westgate lakes orlando... the worst! I actually was in tears during our vacation because of Westgate employees & the condo."
783	2	"We came here immediately after getting off the plane from Los Angeles, and it was an ideal choice made by our friends. It was very un-LA and I loved it. The prices were so reasonable, we came during happy hour though, so that helped. I had the Mac n cheese of the day and a quesadilla (all off the happy hour menu, but you'd never guess flavor wise). The beer only cost 3 dollars! And it was a local microbrew that made me happy. Beer always makes me happy though. I've been told this place is best for breakfast, but I guess I'll have to wait till next time!"
560	3	"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in... The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home. Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross. Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian. Whatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant."
986	3	"I'm very familiar with Zen Cuisine considering I worked next door to the South Congress location and frequent the Guadalupe location as well, but this was the first time I ate at the Anderson Lane location. It was New Year's Day and we found ourselves wandering aimlessly around Austin very famished. Luckily good ol' Zen was open! So this location looks like it could be featured in a Dwell Magazine article. Kudos on the design! Love the modern wall art, hanging light fixtures and wooden beams. I felt properly hipster in there. Our food was good- like it normally is since they've done the menu makeover- but I don't know if it was because it was a holiday or what, but the staff kind of made me feel guilty for ordering sushi when their wasn't any made. Twice! If that is your trick to get me to tip more, you did an excellent job, sirs! Also, the cashier was playing around with his smartphone while it was somewhat busy. Call me old fashion, but wait until we can't see you texting so we don't quietly judge you!"
98	3	"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher. Decor works. You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint. Mission accomplished. I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.) My first issue was with the burnt ends. I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta. this place offered them so I came. They were sub par in my opinion. They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides. This is not the burnt ends I know and love. Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there. Other lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can. The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked. The good food: I really enjoyed the okra. I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal. However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter. Very different and very tasty. We ordered some wings and they were very good. They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy. However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough. The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it. On top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues. The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift. So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables. On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us. She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was. The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender. If I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again. Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great."
970	1	"Great place to have/host a happy hour. We always order from the ""bar food"" menu. The wings and burgers are great. Also, try a half order of the lobster nachos. There are usually good music acts as well on Friday or Saturday. Parking can be a problem, so get there early."
218	2	"This place is amazing. From the staff, to the food, and the decor. Went during lunch and the food options are amazing. The bakery goods look so delicious. Order the artichoke eggs Benedict. Every bite was worth it. The wait staff is great. Very helpful and friendly. Worth the stop."
439	2	Tasty grilled chicken sandwich similar to Chik fil-a. Fries were like PTerrys but less greasy. Croissant bites were overcooked and not very sweet. The best thing was the fresh lemonade and the Honey Dijon sauce was one of the best I've ever tasted. Great ice tea! Most places are pretty bad.
347	1	"Not as impressed as I thought I would be. The basic pancake order was so large, if I had eaten just half, would killed me. The service was good, but not the friendliest. Worth another visit when not so busy. 5 days ago...Saturday."
138	2	"Wow!!! Absolutely the BEST donuts I've EVER had!!! Tried old fashion glazed, Mexican hot chocolate (favorite!!!) & apple fritters...and no kidding...BEST EVER!!! Dense, moist & DEEEEE-lightful!!! A must if you're in the area!!! Yummmmmmm!!!"
576	1	So delicious! Came here with a friend after taking a pole dancing class nearby. Good quality espresso and the salmon toast was delicious! I'm definitely coming back :)
335	2	"I HAD ZERO CLUE!!! OMG!!! I could only fit in a 30 minute deep tissue. I walked in crooked, and walked out STRAIGHT as an arrow. The tiny little thing jumped on the table and used her knees to unravel my lower back and hips - GET OUT OF TOWN. I was skeptical, but walked out a believer."
940	1	"Don't get me wrong, I am all for elevating the stature of asian food to chic and trendy, but the food here was uneven. There were some hits, like the pork belly buns and papaya slaw. The tacos were also pretty good. But there were also some misses like the tea smoked ribs and chicken wings. My main objections to the ribs and wings were that they were very salty without being terribly savory. I think that this place could be even better if the owners tweaked parts of the menu."
160	1	My preferred Austin area restaurant. Quality food & servce. Great value. Consider spliting a meail to engae the Gumbo & dessert. Best in Austin. Check hours for lunch & dinner.
748	2	"My first Yelp experience was choosing movers and Precision Moving seemed like a great option. From the Yelp review, to the website to the actual move, Precision Moving provided the BEST moving experience my wife and I have ever had (at least 6-8 moves between us). Rudy, Gil and Jeff were professional, careful and efficient. Although I haven't used all the Boston companies, I would say Precision Moving strikes the balance between cost and quality. Easy 5-star recommendation."
288	1	"I think they opened one month ago (July 2014). Excellent Lebanese food at very reasonable prices. Not a fancy place, simple. If you want fancy, go to Al-Wadi, but you will pay double the price for food that you can get here. Easy to get to from Dedham and Rt. 1. Very good!"
411	3	"About a month after visiting Israel I got hit with a falafel craving and had the excuse to finally try this place out. I'm no culinary expert but the food is great for the value (seriously $5 falafel). I went on a Saturday night and it was busy but not crowded...interestingly enough they were playing some super-geeky dubstep which I was fine with but I'm not sure about everyone else, haha. Decor is modern, well-lit, place was clean and staff was friendly. Order was up in like 2 minutes, like, QSR fast. Plus I got a big spoonful of tzatziki sauce at no extra charge...mmmm. They also have some unique desserts like fruit tarts. A nice alternative on a Saturday night to the normal Norwood townie-infested bars! :)"
626	3	"Went here Monday with a Gilt city deal and ended up trying a whole lot more! The oysters and bottle of muscadet which was the deal were delightful. Next we ordered the plateau which was nothing short of magical and oustanding. The ceviche was on point, perfect level of acidity with sweet peppers and gorgeous fresh fish. Not a fan of the littleneck clams but that's just a personal preference, however, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, a classic and a goodie. The dressed lobster with loads of fresh herbs was heavenly and the char-grilled octopus with green chili's and blistered snow peas I could probably eat for the rest of my life. The octopus was so tender and rich and the peas and peppers added a necessary brightness that elevated the entire dish. The service was fantastic, very friendly, welcoming, quick and knowledgeable about the menu. No complaints about the automatically added 20% tip. If you don't like it, don't go out to eat! We would gladly return!"
333	1	Phenomenal German cuisine! Best German food in central Florida hands down. Try the German potato salad. You will not regret it.
890	1	"OMG! Sooooo good...but don't go here for chicken fingers.....fried shrimp...lobster sauce....although they're really good here this is authentic...HEALTHY for the most part and DEELISH Taiwanese food...been going regularly for about 7 years....the best sauces....around. Mmm MMM ....greens like Sprout Of Snow Peas.....or Spinach and Garlic.....or Chicken and Garlic.....sooo yummy. Hot Pots...many, many many more dishes I had never known...and learned by asking the friendly waitresses...what is he eating? Look around....see what others are eating and try....too many favorites to list here as I LOVE most of the dishes....go explore...enjoy!"
908	1	The food was great the service was horrible. Starts from the manager down. Horrible manner and hostess was so rude!
823	2	"Damn, I am so glad Henry's partner at Otto's told me to get the F- out when I asked why did my 10 dollar lunch turned into a 22 dollar lunch? So anyway I am still wanting some pizza, so I get on line and this place seems to fit the bill. So I order a small pizza and salad.. costs less than what I would have paid at Otto's.. HELLO.. and they brought it to my front door with a smile.. so good, I just wish that I had someone to share it with.. way too much for one..."
925	1	"Excellent service,food,atmosphere, This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Orlando but a bit pricey but still worth every penny. Reservations suggested if not U will wait for a long time. Food Quality- (out of 5 stars) 4 Atmosphere ( out of 5 stars) 5 Service ( out of 5 stars) 4"
978	2	"One if the best dining experiences we've ever had. The aroma, flavors and presentation took us back to the orient style cuisine. Staff was so professional and nice starting with our waiter Joe. Every single dish was explained to what it was and how it was cooked. Most of the fjord was prepared with locally grown products. We are making plans for our next visit."
681	2	So we decided to stop in to have a bite. And we made a wonderful discovery here. The Pizza was some of the BEST in town. Service was amazing and I think the waitress was named Mia? Location is E. Broad st. She was very sweet & keep us happy. Also we had drinks & more food & Desert YUM!!! We will be coming back for more and talked about trying the Lunch menu as well. Letting ppl know how great our 1st time was. Keep up the great work !!!
106	3	"So I tried calling multiple times because the parking deck says 30 min free while the website says 1 hour. Finally someone picks up but he was unable to answer my question to why the difference for prices. He proceeded to tell me to hang on and then hangs up. So I just go inside and the manager says they give us a voucher for the free hour. The waiter was not very attentive. He didn't check on us much. The service at the Johns Creek location is much better. However, I will say the drinks were great and very strong"
504	1	"Smaller place in the area. You may overlook it because it is on the side street. However, nice pub with great service. Be sure to try the fried Avacado... It was super yummy!"
198	3	"I LOVE THE WOLF. I have been living in Salem for four years and this place and 62 on the Wharf are my two favorites by FAR. I work in the restaurant scene in Boston and frequently dine at excellent places, but I keep coming back to the Wolf for my casual night out. Quest is MAGIC Howling Wolf Burrito - why do i EVER let myself get anything else??? ( because I want to try everything, that's why). It's just SO perfect. Try it. Just do it. You'll die. I also love the chorizo papusa appetizer. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. Service is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times (one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower-than-desired experience. After I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends."
966	1	"My favorite place for a quiet romantic dinner or gathering with friends. Excellent food, service and atmosphere."
977	1	"The food is great! One of my fav brunch spots in town. The service is always awesome, and the environment is welcoming. A great place to meet up with friends or have a nice date night!"
587	2	"I used this company to move from NW Portland to Vancouver. The two guys from Willamette Valley Moving did a great job. They were very efficient and quick. They basically started running the minute they pulled in to my driveway and didn't stop until the move was done. I had everything organized and packed up which helped with the efficiency. I had a simple move so the two hour minimum worked perfectly for me, and they certainly earned their tip!"
831	3	"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Been coming here for years. The moment you walk in and sit down you immediately feel like you're in someone's persian family home and ready to eat a home cooked persian meal. If you're more into the ""experience"" of dining out, you may be critical of this place, because they're not about glitz and glamour, they are about DAMN GOOD FOOD! The beef kebabs always come out scrumptious, the flat bread, the persian style lentils and rice, I'm not even kidding my mouth is watering just typing this out. It's also a very culturally interesting place to eat, because it's the only place where during any given lunch time, you can see Israelis, Arabs and Persians all eating in the same room feasting on the same delicious eatery. Now if only we could get the entire middle east to run like this resteraunt things will be great :) Been coming here for at least 7 years and won't stop for another 7+."
101	2	"Came here for a friends birthday and was impressed! The service was wonderful! Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the chef even came over and said hi. I ordered the duck, it was delicious, very flavorful! The only complaint I had was that it was just duck, no side. Although it was good it was a little weird to eat just duck for dinner."
355	2	This a great hidden gem in Kerrsdale That amazing speciality rolls and one of my favourite sushi places in town and ice tried alms or every place Must haves are Red and white tuna stack with quail egg on top Sesame crusted tuna steak House special sumo mono One thing like most Japanese run places in town the the service is slow - no idea why but Japanese run small sushi places the waitresses are so slow a But the food is worth coming here for sure and worth the absent minded Japanese waitresses m The chef here is one of the best sushi chefs in town A must place for any sushi lover
205	2	"Top notch service! Very attentive and anticipated all our needs. We had the recommended lava bread with babaganoush (to die for!) for an appetizer and then the recommended mixed platter for two for $35. We got a side of cucumber/garlic tzatziki and the savory iskander tomato sauce. Simply amazing and still leftovers! You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee (watch out for the 1/4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For the chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut baklava is delectable and rich. The best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic!"
387	2	"I actually love Whole Bowl. But whoever they are hiring now, both at this location and the one on Williams are racist racist racist. I've watched myself be charged for things I never was before, even watching others not be charged the same. Literally watched the quote unquote bowler give me less, noticeably. And when my sisters have patronized the NE location the service was despicable hesitabt and racist. Even found hair in the food.... given the service who knows if it was purposeful or not. Yuck. I will not be coming back... and this was a fave. Just appalled"
703	1	I ordered the avocado Margarita that they are famous for. I was not disappointed. It was super creamy and they add just the right amount of alcohol that creeps up on you! :) I also ordered the tamales- also were very delicious.
521	3	"Went here for my husbands holiday party a few nights ago, the inside is cute, funky and eclectic. Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. On to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. Second course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. Third course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part. We had creme brûlée, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! This place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit! Now let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!"
637	1	Went there this morning expecting good things. Terrible under-cooked food(twice we sent it back) not a good experience. We ordered Ham and got some space age meat like substance. Never again.
175	2	"This virtual ride takes you on a scenic and sensory tour of Canada. It's a beautiful place and I can't imagine the countless hours spent putting the videos together through real flight time. That being said it is absolutely not worth the money. Unless you can't make it anywhere else in Vancouver I would skip this and visit some of the actual land, air and sea tours around Vancouver. The ride last about 5 minutes (or less) it took more time to watch the intro video (called rise or uplift or something like that ) and the safety video. It was just an ok experience but I had an amazing time otherwise in Vancouver and the surrounding areas."
471	3	"Update: I looked at the slip I kept in my car and the gentleman I dealt with directly is named Austin Slagle. Read this entire post to understand this update. I usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. Okay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. They guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. Here's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. ""You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here."" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. Oh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon."
826	2	"This place got lots special flavor bbt~ Love the Oreo green tea cheesecake and they have a few selection of savoury dishes too (curry fish balls, teriyaki rice bowl etc... Also hot or cold tofu flower dessert :D Nice place for grab and go :) only thing is the wait is a bit long~ ordered 2 drinks on a Tuesday night at 10pm, waited 15 minutes and it's not packed busy tonight. Prepare yourself with a patient while waiting for your yummy sweets."
222	2	"we really enjoyed our tasty and cozy meal here. We ordered three small plates: yak momo, calamari and green beans. All were lovely, and there was quite a bit left over for two of us. I also especially appreciate the very reasonable glasses of wine to enjoy along with the food. Ambiance is cozy, quiet. A great date night and some tasty treats (for those not familiar with Himalayan food, there is a bit of something for everyone, curries and things that sounds like what you might find at Indian restaurants, to other things that are quiet apart). We didnt try the green papaya salad on the menu but that also sounded yummy"
604	1	Best lamb tips and BBQ sausage. Pizza is best around. It's a dive. But worth going to.
38	2	"best pizza on a busy street! my kids love it. i've been recommending to everyone who has a birthday party in that area to order from pizzapalooza and they are not disappointed. the pizza is thick, square and yummY! so many varieties, i love their pasta with meatball too! They also serve ice cream. This is a good value comfort food place for me and my family."
832	2	"Best fat burger in town ( there are many types fat/skinny/greasy/etc Hoppdoddy has the best Fat burger) cool ambiance, great idea ( sustainable eating) its not a new idea, but i like the way they make it easy to understand for those of us that don't usually partake. My personal favorite is the Greek burger, and the Hard Cherry Lime-aid with Gin or vodka... for dessert try the Salted Caramel shake... they also have the real sugar sodas... DEFINITELY GO THERE :)"
8	2	"I am definitely a fan of Sports Authority. This particular location has a good check in deal. We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience. The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for. We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories. The store was clean and well organized. They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between. Good spot to buy athletic merchandise."
133	1	"Nice music, excellent service, reasonable prices. The staff is super friendly and food is delicious and fairly priced. Potstickers and Mac and cheese were amazing. The bacon jam burger is my favorite. I love this place. You should go!"
258	2	Just the worst. Always takes several days to get your meds. Staff is not helpful. Tell you to request refills using the Walmart app and it NEVER works. Ugh. Wish this wasn't the closest pharmacy to where I live.
578	2	"This might be the best Chinese buffet in Austin Texas. Clean, friendly, with good food as long as you go during lunch or dinner hours (it gets pretty stale during off hours, but that seems to be an issue with most buffet places). Their sushi bar is out of this world with freshness and selection. I've been going here for years, and I'd say 80% of my trips have been very satisfactory, with my only so-so experiences being when I've gone during off hours. The dessert bar is okay, but they have a ton of fresh fruit and their apple crisp is very good."
934	2	"When Qdoba came to Huntington and replaced Stars (did anyone even go there?), it was pretty awesome. The food was fresh and delicious. But somewhere along the way, Qdoba lost it's way and things just aren't the same anymore. Most of the workers there seem incompetent. The food is continually getting more expensive, and the food isn't as fresh as it used to be. It is a bit pricey considering you can get a massive wrap over at Boloco that tastes better and is bigger for less. Qdoba does have some pretty good nachos, but in the Southern US you get these for free with your meal, which really sours the deal here. Qdoba is a place you can probably visit a couple of times a year and not feel too bad about it, but it's by no means great."
162	1	"I had so much fun walking up and down the aisle's of this store. There was so much variety of products and so many neat (and super cute) things for great prices. I ended up buying way more than I needed, but it was so worth the price and I can't wait to come back here!!!"
769	2	"First, I would like to shout out Tavrious! Their system assures amazing customer service, but Tavarious knew we were from out of town and worked with us!!! Tavarious is amazing. I came from DC and I'm a stickler for costumer service! All of the drinks were hand crafted and strong! The manager explained the entire system and business bc I was honestly confused why there is NOT one in DC, I even offered to invest in one... Yes, it was that amazing!!!! I recommend the duck taco or bowl & the pork belly!!! Again, amazing spot and my new ATL favorite!!"
317	2	"Stay at Drury Inn whenever I can. The place is spotless. I read the review about the maid service and all I can say is they weren't at any Drury I have ever stayed at. I judge hotels by their guest bathrooms. You know those by the dining room. You can eat off the floor in these. That's just a comment, I wouldn't eat off the floor, but they serve breakfast, dinner and drinks! Parking is free and the staff was wonderful. I really don't know what bad to say except... Here goes...NO USB ports in the rooms! A millennial nightmare. Course, I'm not a millennial, but those little plugs would top off an otherwise perfect experience. When you have an Iphone, an Iwatch and a Macbook, cords can begin to get you down.. Would it cause me to rate it one drop lower...not a chance."
78	3	"That was very gratifying! Sometimes, I just crave a really good burger and fries with a coke. PDX Sliders delivered without the guilt. Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying. My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta. I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her. The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche. Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne. I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her. It was so succulent! The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well. My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors. Love that their truffle fries are super crispy! I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area."
833	2	First of all- the Staff is amazing. Everyone is super nice and always cheery. I usually opt for the drive thu because in the morning I'm lazy and don't want to get out of my car. On the off chance I do go inside I feel like I'm waiting FOREVER for my order. I almost feel like the drive thru is faster. My advice is wait in the drive thru line- you'll get your drink faster.
313	2	"My husband is from Bolivia - and needless to say - he doesn't get very many opportunities to have the food he grew up on here in Boston. We've found a few places here and there ... a place in San Francisco (which has since closed down) and a good place in Miami - but we had pretty much given up hope around here. Enter (of all places...) Que Padre. When I first told him that it opened and that they had bolivian food he laughed because he thought I was kidding (""A Mexican place.... reallyy??).... But we went and met the owner and then downed a good 7-9 beef saltenas hot and fresh out of the oven. I'm no expert - but I think they're the best ones I've ever had... but the honey was so happy... and for that alone - we will be back many many more times. Perfect crust. So hot and juicy. A little hot sauce... and magic happens. :)"
48	1	It's a pleasure doing business with them. Very good service and hospitable staff.
217	2	"I mostly eat here at lunch, for the tremendous buffet. I don't have another benchmark for Tibetan cuisine so my raking is based on the comparison to the other lunch staple in Central Square: the ubiquitous Indian buffets. I admit to a fanatical love of cilantro and it is featured in many of the dishes. The dumplings are my fav(Tsel Momo, Langsha Momo), and I always start with those. I also like the noodle dishes(Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp(Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef(Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork(Phaksha Solo) and chicken(Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too. If you like nan try the breads."
128	2	"HOB Boston. What can i say. Though it is part of a chain, i really couldn't quite feel the typical HOB vibe. The food was average and uneventful. The semi private concert i attended was great and that raised the star level to 2. They could use some more people who enjoy working there. I couldn't feel the pride nor the funny bone that usually is part of the HOB team. I know there is room for improvement and i know the management has the costumers satisfaction as a priority. That is why i am sure that they will make it their mission to review all the constructive criticism and make the proper adjustments."
305	3	"We received terrible service when we ordered at Sweet Mamas today. We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said ""well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes."" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we're telling our whole company of over 4,000 employees to stay away from it!"
60	2	Amazing Service!!! Very professional & courteous staff!! The best way to deliver excellent customer service is by following up with your customers and keeping your word helping them. Tine Hopson and Stephen Cimino provided excellent customer service by following up with me all the time and keeping their word :) Thank you both of you being so awesome!!!
920	2	We really enjoyed this place! We each had a curry plate. I had the Tikka Masala and Lawrence had the Korma both with chicken. I got mine at 'medium' spice but I feel like I should've gotten the 'hot' instead. Other than that everything was delish! I suggest the Mango Lassi as well for you mango lovers out there. Our meal was less than 30$ and we also had an order of Naan bread as well. They also have the buffet option which is $9 per person. We left very satisfied with the service.
646	2	"Best in Boston is right! I love Le's. Cheap pho (around $7/bowl) and such a great, chill environment. Service is spot on and super accommodating.The best part is that the pho comes out ridiculously fast. The broth is SO yummy and gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy. Generous amount of tripe and meat! The #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl. If you have the appetite of a small bear like he does, I think coughing up an extra dollar for the extra big bowl is worth it."
845	1	"This is a cute little gem of a cafe. For the vegan in our party they had vegan French toast, tofu scramble, and vegan sausage, while I had a ham and caramelized onion omelet. Both were phenomenal leaving us both happy. The one downside was the smash browns, but everything else was so good we overlooked that..."
328	2	"Great quick service despite the fact that every table was full, some with large groups. Huge portions, so be prepared to eat! Really good food, good coffee. Hash browns are really crispy on top, just the way I like them."
589	3	I have been taking Pilates classes at Body Mechanics for the last two years. They have changed everything about my body. The level of care and quality of teaching is unparalleled. The staff and members are like a family and everyone is welcomed and encouraged. All of the teachers spend time with each student whether in an amazing individual session or in a class. You are always shown the correct position and given modifications if you need them. You can always find a class that fits your schedule and none will disappoint. I really encourage everyone to take advantage of the private sessions as it will change your life. You won't find a better Pilates studio in Portland.
691	3	"Over the years, I've had a burger here before and always thought it was good. Recently, I set up a corporate outing here with over 100 people. The appetizers were ok, but the entrees on the buffet were lousy. Just before the dessert went out, someone pointed out a cockroach walking on the plates to me, DISGUSTING. See picture. They also ""didn't receive"" our first check, then they charged over $10k on our credit card without authorization. We tried to sort this out, they told us to send another check and when they received it, they will credit our card. Well, they cashed the check over a month ago and still no refund to us. I will NEVER go here again and I will tell everyone I know not to as well."
404	3	"For starters, no Donnie....no Marky Mark, no Paul......not even Nacho or the Mom were anywhere to be found. OK, I didn't REALLY expect to see any of them......but I would have liked the bartender to be a little bit nicer though. She was obviously bothered that she had another customer - not that there were very many to begin with. Decent beer selection, and decent basic menu (as I expected). My burger was cooked the way I ordered it.......thing is, there was nothing special at all about it. A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper. The onion strings were good, but again - not great. The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste. So, that's that.......I'll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer. I've got a hell of a movie pitch for him!"
962	2	"The owner, Mr. Abercrombie, was very patient working with my changing schedule. Our carpet is light in color and has not been cleaned in 10 years and Genesis made our carpet look new! All of the black spots and stains were removed and the job could not have been better. Everyone was polite and professional."
664	3	"We made reservations over a week ago for a special occasion, we had heard negative comments but wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow. Dinner was very bland, no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat. After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else. Be smart and read the reviews, this place is just not worth your time or money."
536	3	"The bulk of the stars was because this is one of the few places in the area I've seen that will seat you before your entire party arrives. In my case, one person at a table of 7 - huge kudos for that & luckily my crew arrived within minutes of me sitting down. The food was just ok and the service was scarce. They didn't have enough staff and the poor server was hustling, he just rarely got around to us - a couple got up from the table to order drinks at the bar. I did love the chips & hot sauces and we ordered guacamole. The $9 price of the guac is steep for small serving but still was the most favorite & most flavorful part of my meal."
228	1	Best black 'n bleu cheese burger I ever did have! Cozy too!
461	2	"I have gone to Jaho many times. It is a great spot to stop for a vanilla chai latte. Also, to do some homework or just meet and chat with a friend. I'm not a huge fan of their bigger selection of foods. I like to stick to the smaller snacks when I go there. The renovation is an A+ it looks a lot more like a café I would go to. It is also in the heart of downtown so it is a easy walk for some fresh air"
528	2	"Delish! Stopped in on a random Sunday and so glad I did. Normally when eating healthy I have found making good choices while eating out can be hard. But here the options are endless and sound so good. I got the Bombay bowl which was so filling and my sister got the avocado crunch wrap which she said she loved. All in all customer service was fabulous, food was fresh and totally tasty."
711	2	"Always a profound experience. The JFK100 exhibition was extraordinary. It included the speech he was to give on November 22, 1963 in Dallas as well as a portrait painted posthumously over what was initially an image of his brother Senator Edward M Kennedy. The building itself is an outstanding example of architectural excellence."
645	1	Chill spot. Lax atmosphere. It gets smokey...
225	1	Great comfortable place for wings and a beer. Staff is super friendly and the whole place has a good vibe. All walks of life are welcomed here and fit in seamlessly. Wish this chain existed in Cincy.
557	3	"I'm confused at how this place has any stars. The food is not what we expected at all. It was dry tasteless and completely unappetizing. The I got two tacos, I cant even remember which ones, but one had this weird mayonnaise based sauce, the fish was hard, the cajun fries were very salty and came with some orange mayo like sauce, the kids chicken tenders were hard as rocks and looked like the once you can get in the frozen section at Walmart, the shrimp appetizer was hard as rocks and swimming in some runny sauce, just completely unedible. I mean when our little ones don't want to eat the food, we know its bad... The place was just disgusting, the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky. Yuck. We will never come back to thus place. We spent about $60 and left hungry. NEVER AGAIN"
830	3	"Have walked past this place for months meaning to try it. And, have absolutely no regrets about finally doing so today. On previous occasions it looked like it had just a few customers in there but today it was half full when I got in. My timing was perfect as within 5 mins of my arrival, the rest of the place filled up with a wide assortment of folk I ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious. Extremely flavourful and raise the roof off the top of your mouth, not blow it off, spicy. ! In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base. I was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't. Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. I am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample. I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable. The decor is beautiful in an understated way. Could not stop myself rubber necking to get a good look at how the casual yet classy ambiance had been accomplished with a subtle colour scheme and textures. Will definitely go back and was suitably impressed to take others with me"
694	2	"Super awkward experience at front counter. The female employee seemed to complain once asked to do dishes or something, saying ""This will be the SIXTH time, SIXTH!"" Then she made my drink. I was sort of weirded out that she was having this conversation while I was standing paying for my drink, but blew it off. Then I got my americano and it's so bad! Disappointing on all fronts compared to previous experiences. Maybe this employee was having an off day, but I just wanted a delicious espresso."
518	2	"I wish Menchie's had more flavors. There are roughly a dozen choices versus 30-40 at local ice cream shops. Their pineapple is my favorite but they just Introduced Keylime which is also excellent. The variety of toppings is their strength but their product is a little expensive. For two cups of yogurt we never escape for under $15. When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink. If he came here, he might tear off his hair piece in frustration. So unless you are a cost-conscious Scientologist, you will likely enjoy Menchie's."
721	2	"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant- we come here very often on the weekends! I love the enchiladas with beef and the Guacamole. The service is always fast and the staff is excellent. Side note: they are very family friendly, they always accommodate us and our baby in his car seat."
971	2	I had a gel manicure/pedicure and it was the most perfect thing I've ever had. They take the time to fix any smudges and make sure the polish isn't over the nail and don't rush at all. I'll definitely be back. Also try to upgrade to a deluxe pedicure it will be the most relaxing thing you ever experience:)
164	3	"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! I think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place. I tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage. I had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me. But the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet. This was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute. On a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. This place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!"
736	3	"After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving ""advice"", told me when I break in the new pads/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant. That's it, rant done."
36	3	"Just had Yalla for lunch today. I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on ""moving orders through the line."" It's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7. They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too."
149	2	This is a place to be in the morning while visiting Portland! Blue Star donuts have incredible sweets and savory delights to choose from. The donuts here are just mouth watering and glorious to look at while being in line because for one they are moist and not overall sweet for anyone who may be a sweet tooth. Great thing to know is that the lines aren't too long which you may have imaged and I have to say its not like Voodoo donuts and that's for sure.
406	2	"I ordered the immunity one. The juice tasted good overall, but I'm not stoked about the prices not displayed on the menu. 10.00 is a bit steep.It makes me feel that they know it's pricy and try to disguise it."
18	1	"Nothing special but good enough. I like another one much better in Dorchester, but hardly get to that area, so Le's is my goto place for Pho"
230	2	"Excellent view. Nice pub menu. The Cuban was excellent. You order at the bar and are given a buzzer to pick up your food. I like that they serve the food as it's ready, and do not wait for everything to be ready to call you up. The beer menu was extensive, but the tap water tasted funny. Stick with bottled water!"
21	1	"Best station to fill up around in my opinion. Attendants are super friendly. They also carry bio diesel! Been running this in my Dodge for couple years w/o any issues. With Safeway right on same corner, the rewards really make this a favorite gas stop. Thanks!"
442	1	"Aweful Aweful Aweful service!!!! . Rude hostess, she was dismissive and didn't care for our business so we went elsewhere. Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period.."
620	3	"Will never go back to any toys r us. I'm not sure how this this location is still in business. Every time I shop here I leave wishing I never walked in. The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf. I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store. This place suxs the life out of you!"
984	2	"These guys are great! We did two resizings - very quick no problems and great fit. I also worked with Phil on a custom piece using an old stone. He was so helpful, had great ideas on what we could do and picked out exceptional accent stones for the piece. Very easy to work with, great pricing and fantastic work. Highly recommended!"
522	3	"For a first time visit the Broadway near cambie location is a little something different. With a bar and separate fast food setup and feel, I found the Mexican ""day of the dead"" decor with pop 90's music to be oddly relaxing. My boyfriend had a beef taco for $4.50 and for me we mostly shared a pulled pork taco bowl salad for $9.50. My boyfriend found his choice underfilling while i found mine too filling for one. We chose to come here for food due to its proximity to where we were taking a class at shortly. Interesting place trying to be super trendy while still only really coming across as a cafeteria of sorts."
747	2	"Went in for lunch, we are vegetarian & British. We were limited to chips & we were fine with that. I ordered 4 portions of chips & got very delicious crisps. (Potato chips) we explained to the girl at the counter that we expected chips that come with fish, not fries. I guess we should have clarified but being in a fish n chip shop in a concentrated Brit tourist area I didn't think I needed to lol Anyways we paid for an additional 2 portions on ""fries"" & waited again. 2 more boxes came out with battered fries. Wasn't expecting that & although we just wanted plain old chip shop chips we did still enjoy. So I suggest trying the garlic & Parmesan POTATO CHIPS & hopefully the staff can learn to double check what people mean lol"
259	2	"We recently moved & started using their delivery service. Has been great!!! With two young kids (both under 3), it's just so much easier to have the clothes come to me. Everything comes back clean & ironed perfectly."
111	3	"We were seated immediately but unfortunately in the front booth in the bar. I am sure others may find this a good spot but we did not. It was so loud from the children in the waiting area, the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation (including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. The food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don't regularly go to the OG and don't expect too much, they didn't improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills. On all dishes there was very little sauce. The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed (red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce."
264	2	"We were so pleased with everything here. The reception was pleasant, and the drink list was appealing. Most importantly, the menu was appetizing and everything we got exceeded our expectations. The gouda appetizer was a revelation. The beef skewers appetizer and the lamb picadillo were both amazing! We can't wait to come back. The service was incredibly pleasant. If we hadn't been so full, we would have tried the dessert. I think this place was a winner, can't understand why it wasn't more crowded."
192	1	"Always look forward to getting my teeth cleaned, Jerri is a hoot!!!!!! the dental office is really starting to shape up. everyone is so pleasant to talk to. Dr. Daby you have something special going on at your practice!"
431	3	"I agree with a lot of what's already been written here. The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms. However, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her ""magic card"", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end. Overall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!"
351	1	"Consistently my favorite place in Vancouver for breakfast. The prices are great and the portions are intense. Always busy, but never the ridiculous waits you get for popular breakfast places in Portland."
395	1	Ordered from here yesterday and loved their chicken tikka masala! Definitely one of the best in the Boston area! delivery took about an hour which is pretty standard for most places in my area. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes!

And by horrible, I mean that it tasted powdered and the tapioca balls were completely tasteless and inedible. And by inedible, I mean that they weren't cooked properly and were gelatinous, borderline melting. I ordered a Sesame tea and my gf ordered a Thai iced tea. I see people ordering at the stand, and I just pity them, as I pitied myself for paying 6.50 for two gross teas that we immediately dumped in the trash when we turned the corner. Go to Boston Tea Stop instead. It's the same price but yummy."
24	3	"Almost desolate restaurant and dingy evironment. That's a star. Decieving lunch menu. (claimed dishes were 550 before 3 on Saturdays and was still charged $2 more) That's a star. Congealed beef soup. That's a star. Friend's dish didn't come for 30 minutes after I got mine and he didn't get the soup that came with it. That's a star. Asked for water 5 times and didn't get of until right before the bill came. That's a star. Welp, I seem to be out of stars! Whoopsie Daisy! I wanted to be more forgiving since the waitress was new but even the manager who stepped in for her was screwing up. And it doesn't excuse the mediocre food."
116	2	"All 5 of these stars are for my friend Bobby. He showed excellent customer service and executed his job flawlessly. He also seemed to be an honest guy. Not just jiffy lube, but the world needs more people like Bobby. Thanks for helping me out with my tires man"
485	3	"Hi Hat Public House was awesome! The pub opened up in our building not to long ago and we were very curious about the place. When we finally went, I was very impressed with the selection of craft beers. William, the bar manager, was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive! He recommended some great brews and also provided information about all of them. I was also impressed to learn that hi hat was the only place in austin where some beers could be found. My fiance is not much of a beer drinker, but was very happy to find a decent wine selection as well as domestics she could enjoy. We will definitely be going back, in fact we are leaving right now for live jazz (every sunday 2-4). CHEERS!"
508	3	"We picked a crowded Sunday to check out the aquarium. It had some great exhibits both inside and outside. I enjoyed the beluga whale exhibit you can view them from both the inside and outside. As well as the otter exhibit. The otter exhibit, those little guys like the attention and they are real cute. There was a frog exhibit inside that was interesting as well as informative. Some of them are going instinct, which is a good indication of change in the ecosystem. Interesting information on the north pole as well. All in all informative but try to avoid the weekends if you can as they are jam packed. We found using our credit card out at the kiosk outside was quicker for ingress than waiting in line to pay in person which we would have paid via credit card anyway so that just made the process quicker. Also, there is an aquarium employee outside by the kiosk on this particular weekend in case you have any difficulties. I loved the soda and water machines that took credit cards. Canada has it all over the US in that regard as anyone with a credit card can buy a soda and not worry about exact change or which currency you were carrying. I'd visit this place again."
329	2	"I'm giving this 5 stars based on the fact that they do what they do very well. They have a lean toward punk. Pop, grind, thrash, classic, etc... They have a very solid stock of the genre, and a VERY friendly and knowledgeable. Also the pricing hasn't seemed to all be eBay checked. They also seem to stock the recent releases from most noise, art, and indy genres. Mostly Midheaven/Revolver distro type stuff it seems. The reason why this place makes my list though is that there is a small section of used stock up the stairs; as I'm not really looking for punk records most of the time. The selection is random as hell, but updated frequently. I have found some GREAT used things here (Barton Smith 1 & 2, Tree People, Amon Duul, etc..). One of those spots that takes frequent stops to pay off, but it's got a great vibe to it. And I love to support these folks, as they seem like great folks."
891	1	"Didn't like the marquee sign out front, looked cheap and appeared to be a strip club or something. However, the food was good and the beer was great! Outdoor seating was comfortable! Service was great! Wings were descent, jalapeño bacon wrapped skewers were good!"
465	3	"A vendor brought Qdoba to a meeting in our conference room. I have a meeting in there later this afternoon and thought I'd call to find out when they were picking up their catering supplies. The guy said I'll call you back tomorrow and I told him I have a meeting this afternoon and just wanted to know when they were coming back for their items. He said ""hold on"" and that was 22 minutes ago. I still waiting on my headset, but although I can hear him talking to people in the background he won't get back on the phone with me. I am someone who frequently utilizes caterers for large functions at work. This lack of respect for a potential customer has lost them quite a bit of business since people were saying they liked their food and we should use them. I'll let everyone know that will not be the case. And I'll let other coordinators here know my experience so they don't make the mistake of using them either."
301	2	They are great ! They have everything you can think of. They always give the kids free hot dogs. They are well priced and I always get the family pack bundles. They not only have friendly workers they work hard to get everyone in and out with a smile and a speedy pace. On another note it smells AMAZING inside.
919	2	"Ok I agree with the other yelper...This place is over hyped.. I had the Roast Beef with mashed potatoes and green beans...Don't get me wrong the food is good..The roast was tender , mashed potatoes were good but they were not anything out of the ordinary.. Lacked seasoned flavor.... it taste like cafeteria food .I also had 2 rolls which were hard .I got an unsweetened iced tea & peach cobbler.. All came to total $11.86 which was over priced for this food. I would think the people praising this place also enjoy Piccadilly & SS cafeteria too because this place falls right in line with those spots....I should have went to Donnies Country Cooking which would have been less & they got baked chicken not all this fried stuff like this place has...so overall I will not come back here just because it was closer to my gym"
663	3	"There are not that many places where you can dig in with your hands and some tools of shellfish distruction around the city. Although this place is pricy, it brings back a piece of home where my family would sit around and pick at crab legs while we talked for hours. We've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out. Old Bay Crawfish: 1 1/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w/ old bay. served w/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good. I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish. Mixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w/ drawn butter. (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00. This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge. I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat. The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley. It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold. It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone. I've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day. Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to."
279	1	"Delish. The only downside is that it is downtown. ;) If I didn't hate to be around people so much, I'd definitely be back - regularly. Spot on chicken deliciousness. It (dare I say it?) may be better than Lucy's. (Shhh don't tell on me!)."
672	2	Got my tires swapped a few weeks ago a and they were very friendly and nice. Went shopping right after and noticed the tpms light went off and gave them a call and asked about it and they told me to swing by and that they would check it out. Even though they were busy they still were able to check on my car. Very satisfied! Thanks again!
861	3	"The first time I had a sandwich there it was pretty good, just good though! My boss picked us up lunch as there isn't' alot of eateries in this area. Well, I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. The girl that was making it had her hair in her face (not working around food appropriote. style) I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food. I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it's a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! PS: Wish I didn't have to click on a star...NO STARS"
949	2	"Super yummy food, but FYI some of it is on the sweet side. The catfish was perfect with just the right cornmeal to fish ratio. The Mac n cheese was good, so was the cole slaw (condiment for cole slaw was sweet but on the side so you could choose how much). The ribs and pulled pork sandwich were also really good - smoky and substantial with a thick, tangy, almost pineappley sauce. We will definitely be back for more - can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"
799	1	"This is my favorite bar in Austin, and I frequently use it to give people a sense of what Austin is all about. It's like the hippest backyard you've ever been to. It's very laid back, and a little bit out of the way. They have an Italian food truck in the back called Patrizi's that is developing a really good, and really well-deserved reputation. Now that they have a full bar, I can't imagine a better place to hang out and relax."
163	2	My first day. Had a hungry three year old. Ate in the lobby. They forgot our order. We waited over an hour. What a painful memory. This was right off the plane. Meal comped but that doesn't take it away. Hope that they aren't like this to others. Not like they were nasty or malicious. And the shuttle? Great but not great if you are leaving late. If you leave first thing in the morning it's good. Otherwise great hotel very well maintained.
171	3	"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased. I did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket."
71	2	"5 stars for the location, it's absolutely wonderful. I ordered the shamrock bubble tea, which was one of the best I've ever had. I am subtracting a star for service however. It was the barista that was so put out by waiting on us and then the 10-15 minutes it took to make the bubble tea... That's a bit long for a drink."
297	3	"I've gone in a couple of times over the past year for lunch, but I went in after 2pm and they have a very limited menu, which included nothing to my liking. I sat at the bar both times and the bartender gave me attitude when I complained that the menu was so limited. She wasn't friendly at all and actually only served me after I had to flag her down (even though there were only four people at the bar at the time - she was too busy doing prep work and playing on her phone). Coincidentally, it was the same bartender on both visits. By the way, I went in the second time because it was six months in between visits and I forgot that they only had a limited menu after 2pm. I should have remembered after the first visit, so the second visit was a mistake and only served to confirm my opinion of so-so food and lousy service."
850	3	"Nate, the owner, came out and looked at my house prior to the move, just to get an idea of what would be needed manpower-wise. I liked him from the get-go! Great guy, very personable. After meeting him, I knew I'd found a great company. I got a few estimates, and most are in the same price range. So just find a company you like, one that gets good reviews about the employees being friendly, taking care of the furniture, etc. WM Pro guys were all that. Got my 1400 sq ft house completely loaded and unloaded into the new house 45 minutes away from start to finish in 5 hours! I was truly impressed. I would gladly call them again for my next move."
189	2	Meh. Average Thai food at above average prices. The menu offers nothing new or creative. Just the standard Thai fare. Prices are easily 50-100% higher than better quality food from restaurants in Woburn and Lowell. Next time I will drive an extra 5 minutes.
639	2	"We ended up here as sort of a company ""after-party"". We had a great time. The outside ambiance was really nice (although pretty dusty/dirty). We had fun playing ping-pong and drinking. The bartender was really nice and she had beers cracked and drinks poured amazingly fast. Very cool place to sweat and drink."
112	1	"This place really hits the spot after a long day of shopping on Newbury st. I finally get to sit down after walking for hours, eat some good sushi , drink some good miso soup and re-energize for more shopping. Even though the sushi men at this place can be a little creepy, I love this place and it will forever be my lunch spot when i'm shopping in the area xo Alena"
846	2	"I miss Boston Tea Stop! My favorite stop for boba in Boston. A cute little place just off of Harvard Square. It's pretty small, so I don't usually stay, I just grab my boba to go. The bubble tea is great. I rarely stray from my standard black or green milk tea, but here I remember really like the rose petal? or rose-something tea with lychee jelly instead of tapioca balls. (sorry it's been so long since I've been there). And they also have mochi ice cream which is YUM. I always try to stop there on my (now very rare) visits back to Boston!"
255	1	"Enjoyed the food, just not so much the ordering style. Basically you order as if you are in a sushi joint. You check off what you'd like. But, there were quite a few options, more than I would like to see when I'm hungry. With that said, the food was good, the server was very nice and helpful (albeit very quite/low voice), and I would definitely go back!"
287	1	Did not enjoy this place at all. The Milky Sake wasn't good. The broth for the beef udon was very bland and the Miso soup was cold. The Japanese fried chicken was flavorful but that's about it.
773	2	"Tried this place for lunch today. It's not bad but nothing to get excited about. Interesting mix of choices, mostly Mediterranean themed. They have a nice display of their fresh salads and other choices. I had the Tabbouleh with gyro meat which was actually pretty good. The sauce needs more flavor. The staff was friendly and the location is convenient. Just a head's up, a lot of day laborers hang out in the parking area because of the Home Depot nearby."
772	3	"I was really disappointed to say the least. I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night. My boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night. Our waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. She later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad. Dinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. This place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things."
14	3	"This is a five-star restaurant if ever I have seen one! Maurice, one of the owners, met us at the front door, Daniel a seasoned waiter from Hawaii, took care of us and the food was over-the-top delicious. This is not just a restaurant, it is an experience! My son recommended this to us and we are glad that we took his advice. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the grouper with crab. Save room for dessert! We live in Tallahassee but the next time we are in Orlando it's back to Chatham's!"
463	1	"They staff was great and were really quick. I rented a 5x8 trailer and needed it a few hours early and it was no problem. I'm surprised by the low ratings because they got me in and out really quickly. If i need a trailer again, I will definitely use this location again!"
17	1	Great coffee and pastries. Baristas are excellent. All the other staff are sooooo lost and vacant.
85	3	"A few months back i went in for a toothache and ended up needing a root canal after diagnosis from Dr. Austria. the front desk then comes to me while I'm still in the chair stating it'll cost $1400 because ive reached the cap on my insurance. i told them i couldn't afford it, they then purpose a payment plan im thinking wow they really want to help me. Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the treatment. But after looking around more and after talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum. Bethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating ""we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal"" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! Before doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don't me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they'll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs."
72	3	"I come here to have my hair done by the amazing Elizabeth Eisenstein. She's here until March 2016. So get here while she's cheap!! Not only have I been very impressed with the quality of service I have received from Elizabeth, I am very happy with the instructors involvement to ensure perfection. I have curly hair which I am very particular about and the instructors have been very good at listening to my needs and my concerns as well as understanding how I prefer to style my hair. I am a fan of this place. I plan on coming back for facials with my mother next month."
689	1	What an awesome cool place!!!! Best grilled cheese ever. Had the crisp buffalo and my husband had the melt. It's whim delight and nostalgia on a plate... must come!!!
33	2	"This has not been a pleasant experience. According to our server, the restaurant is short on staff. This means our service has been frightfully slow. We have been here over an hour with receiving our food. Most of the food was good, except for the steak that was tough. This is a trendy place. Great spot to be seen. Food is just okay."
993	1	This was so interesting and fun. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about all of Boston's haunted history and we got to do a little paranormal investigating at the end of the night.
