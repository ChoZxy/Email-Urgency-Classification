564	3	"I've been coming to Modern Pilates off and on for 2 years. I'm back on again and really a fan of their new studio space, which they've been in since sometime last year (2011). Pilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach. They really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs. If anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess. The staff does a nice job with customer service as well, but sometimes last minute changes can be difficult. Overall, I have no problem recommending this place for anyone who's looking for a great Pilates workout!"
93	1	"Unbelievably rude hostess No respect to customers. Server, Dani was the only reason for us to stay... The level of unprofessionalism and unpleasant look that the two hostesses gave are just horrible. I have never experienced this low level of customer service..."
185	1	Excellent subs at a reasonable price. A huge variety too for those picky eaters that can't decide on what to settle for. Come with an empty stomach and enjoy a great turkey and ranch or one of their other 100 subs!
598	3	"I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief! There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA. During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card? Needles? What could express my gratitude? Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face. Speaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!! I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend. Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed. Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover. I could deal with looking ""different"" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore. I wanted to get better. Not having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed. Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience. This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits. I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was ""for real."" How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business? The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed). Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced. There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once. In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing. Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care. Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http://workingclassacupuncture.org/?id=7 At this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...! Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work. She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope. She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days. So, I did. I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time. I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment. I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers. Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast. Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over. Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often. It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful. The interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day. The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting. This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable. The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in. There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here. So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy. WCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work? YES. My face began improving from the first visit! I could feel immediate improvements! Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy. I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing. I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist. It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles. I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious. The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable. WCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care. I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit. It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis. This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!! I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues. Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets. But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare. And how lucky am I to have them close by!"
563	3	I just recently bought a 2017 Toyota Camry se and couldn't be more happy. The sales guy Mati was very professional and answered all my questions and was very nice. I traded in my 2014 Toyota Tacoma which had a salvaged title which I found out about two years later and they basically paid it off for me. Every other dealerships I went to didn't come close to what Beaverton Toyota offered me for Tacoma so I made right choice going back 2 days later. Got a brand new car and happy to get out of my salvaged Tacoma. Mati was Outstanding and would definetly recommend this place to anyone who wants to purchase a vehicle.
181	3	"Visiting Atlanta for a conference and I needed a bit of respite so I searched for my favorite comfort food, pho. I was happy to find this place less than a mile from the GWCC. I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory. The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference."
650	1	This cafe is typically my last resort when eating breakfast downtown. I like that they serve local organic food. The service is always great. Their food is always underwhelming. I've eaten here 5 times in the last year. It's consistent in the experience.
235	2	"Super cute retro-chic sewing shop! It has a small but compelling selection of patterns, fabric and notions. Shopkeeper was nice and laid back, offered us hot tea. I wish I lived in the South End so I could take sewing classes here!"
28	2	"This place is truly a hidden gem (literally hidden as you have to walk through a Chinese restaurant to get there). The place is small, cozy, and charming inside. And the food is better than what you might find in the north end. The service is great and the servers do a great job at pronouncing the specials to you like a true Italian! Make sure you make a reservation as it does book up rather quickly."
614	2	"I don't know a lot about bubble tea but I know I love what they are sellin' to be at Bubble World! The prices are quite decent for bubble tea and I am not addicted to the Milky Mango Ice Cream Slush! It's like a milkshake with a super sweet fruity flavor, drools! This location serves up food and apparently a lot of bad rap music. They have a decent amount of seating but it is almost always full, I find it too loud in there but it's perfect for grabbing a delicious beverage to go!"
469	3	Went to another dealership and had a horrible experience. We decided to head over to CarMax because of the large selection. Ended up working with Omar and the intimidating experience was surprisingly delightful. He was so patient and showed us 10+ cars in 40 degree weather! We were being picky . Found us the PERFECT car for our needs and we couldn't be happier. Thank you!
339	2	"I don't remember McCormick and Schmick's food to be extremely second-rate. The mussel, do not get, had no flavor and smelt fishy. That is not a good sign, mussels are suppose to smell fresh like the ocean...fishy means spoiled. What happened to the mushroom risotto? Why is it not on the menu anymore? I recalled that being delicious the last time I dined here years ago. The hassle of finding and paying to park was not worth it. I hardly noticed the view being distracted by the poor quality food."
627	1	Best sushi place. Been a regular for years. Highly recommend the Chicken Kaarage Bowl
805	2	"Ciao! Here on. Tuesday at 6pm. The staff, cuisine and ambience was wowza wowza! Greeted and seated immediately and couldn't have been more friendly. We ordered soups, dinners off the daily menus. I had the mushroom penne, side of meatballs. Hubby had the chicken cacittoria. All excellent. Biscotti' for dessert. $52 We will be back."
638	1	This place is the best kept secret! Do NOT try to do this at the Post Office. The people here are super helpful and I literally didn't even sit down. A huge thanks to the workers here. Everyone is friendly and they do it with a smile.
553	3	"I had a great experience at this pep boys and thought I would share. My brakes started grinding last week so I got it in there as fast as I could. This location is very convenient to where I work so I thought I would give them a try. When I came in, I was greeted by Lawrence who was very friendly and told me he would call me as soon as he had a chance to look at them. He called back around 30 min later to let me know both sets of brake pads needed to be replaced as well as the rotors on the back set. Lawrence was willing to send me photos and give me coupons to help with the price. I would definitely bring my car here again for repairs and ask specifically for Lawrence. I am glad I now have a go-to place that is also very convenient!"
551	1	The best corned beef hash I have ever had on the north shore. Fast and polite service.
1	2	"This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to. The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd / Route 30. 4 stars."
354	2	"I started going to Miyamoto after reading all the amazing praises from other viewers. It is all depending on what you order. I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi. If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17. I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same. In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing. Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs). They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado. Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice. I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there. Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent. So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant. I really wanted our relationships last a little longer."
896	1	"Typical beach all you can eat buffet. The lobster and crab legs are obviously the main attractions, and they should be! I'm not a crab leg or lobster connoisseur but they all tasted great to me. The other fish was all a bit over cooked, seemed like it had sat under the light for a long while. Some of the sides were good including the lobster ravioli and the crab cakes. Definitely try this place out if you are looking for a buffet in the Orlando area."
365	2	"I've given this place a couple of chances and it has always disappointed me. I found the spring rolls to be average, as well as the pho. The broth was okay, but I didn't find there to be a balance between the noodles and meat. The meat was another issue I had and is the reason I won't be returning. I love chicken pho - well when the meat is tender and juicy. Both times that I can recall ordering chicken pho here the meat was really dry and almost resembled the texture of beef jerky. Although my boyfriend likes this place I never want to return."
496	2	"Bummed. Tupelo was scheduled on the streetfoodfinder site to be at our work location from 6:30-9:30 and they were a no-show. When called, they said they were sorry, but that there was nothing they can do. They often leave early or run out of coffee when they do show. Hoping our employer can find a consistent replacement for Tupleo while the cafeteria is closed."
423	2	"Very professional and efficient. Federico, Alberto and Alejandro arrived right on time and started immediately. We had to make an extra stop OTP which went smoothly. No damages to where I moved into or out of or to my stuff. No hidden expenses, I ended up paying exactly what I thought I would be charged. Would definitely use this company again."
516	2	Great service. The place looked clean and tidy. I did not have to wait long for take out. I ordered the roast lamb and Kalamari dinner. The roast lamb was flavourful and tender. The Kalamari was done to perfection - very crispy and tender when I got it home. The container holding the Kalamari had a hole on top already to prevent it from getting soggy. It was more than enough for the 2 of us. We had leftovers for the next day.
856	2	I called to get a toilet unclogged. After 2 attempted the tech stated I would need a new toilet and he recommended the $1000 fix. He said in 2-3 days it would be clogged again. He charged us $227 and asked if he would get 5 stars for his service. What???? I called to complain about not having value meet the mark of the amount paid. Customer service called and said they would call back in 24 hrs. No one has ever called me back. Awful company!
567	3	"Never met a Cactus Club I didn't like! Have eaten here twice in the last week, both times because this location tends to be less crowded than the other Cacti in Vancouver, and I'm always sure to get a booth here. The service leaves little room for fault-finding, and the food is standard Cactus fare -- i.e., predictably good (but not outstanding -- i.e., exactly what one comes to Cactus for). The men's room is clean, spacious, and well appointed with couch and fireplace. Aaaaaand, the servers are good at, and seem to enjoy, their jobs, which makes all the difference in the dining experience. For anyone seeking a very satisfying dinner for two for under $100, Cactus is a great go-to option. Well deserved 5-stars."
583	3	"We ordered a lot of food, and every single the we ordered was good. I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. I would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for."
373	2	"I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and me. The fried chicken sandwich was pretty good. I enjoyed the chicken the most. It was just the right amount of crispiness. I liked the bun too, but I'm not sure about everything else in it. I ordered two of the regular fried and it ended up to be so much. Typically that would be a good thing...except it was probably one of the saltiest fries I have eaten. You have to drench it in ketchup."
492	1	"Yummmmy. I've been there twice and it's been delicious both times. We had the O-Ring Shorty for appetizer, Oh WOW!!!! I had the turkey burger and was phenomenal. My kids love the gourmet cheeseburger and arctic cod fish & chips."
57	2	We had lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and it was great. We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and both were uniquely delicious! The service was great and it was an overall fantastic experience. Will definitely be back.
436	3	"1. I would like to make it clear that I did not visit the office, so I am not commenting on the dentist's skills/care. 2. This comment is about the front-desk staff. I was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it. When I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, ""You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I don't know where, but you can go find it."" You don't know where?! Because you never told me/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for! So I said, ""When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment."" She said, ""Well, we do it two days before."" No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called. Then, they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment. Maybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentist's staff would not have turned away your customer."
210	1	I shall give 3.5 stars. The dining environment is great and you can tell how food is cooked by sitting on the bar seats. The food is nice but a little salty. Other is good.
574	2	"Great food. Recommend the grilled shrimp app, white bean soup, Brussels sprouts, risotto, and lamb. Great wine selection and interesting cocktail menu. Good service. Friendly hostess and server. Good wine presentation. Nice outdoor seating. The fire pits outside are fabulous and offer something different. Call ahead to reserve one. Upscale ambience."
796	2	"I come here for dinner with a bunch of friends every now and again. Beer list is good, fried pickles are tasty, and the staff is generally stellar. I've been happy with the grilled cheese and club sandwiches I've ordered. Once we came here and there was an embarrassing bro cover band, but I don't think that is a regular occcurance. Prices are good and this place adds a much needed casual but nice dining option to Malden."
531	2	"This has got the be the busiest Wawa in Orlando! Stopped on my way to work to get a bacon egg cheese croissant. i had to wait five minutes as they were cooking, The store on crowded as everyone was buying breakfast and/or lunch. My sandwich was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bacon was crispy and it was just GOOD when I bit into it. Love this breakfast sandwich. The coffee fresh, hot and just darn good! This place is like a DRUG and the addiction has begun!!!"
132	1	My friend and I came to Austin in July. We both needed a little pampering and boy did we get it! Wonderful spa and a great massage! I can't wait to go back and visit again!
828	3	"BEST BRUNCH EVER. we waited about an hour to be seated, it was super busy. And definitely worth the wait the restaurant is very compact with close tables, you get to know your neighbors very quickly. They have a coffee and waffle bar right in the front with unusual dipping sauces for the famous waffles. I had the milk chocolate lavender with a waffle a nice treat before brunch! My hubby and I ordered the salmon fume and paella. Both were delicious! The flavors dance on your tongue this place is at the top of our list EVERYTIME were in BC! Salmon fume: 5 Paella: 5 Waffle + milk choc lavender: 4"
524	2	"For a restaurant that calls itself 'number one' in spanish and the best cuban restaurant north of Miami; I was dissapointed. First, I have not known a cuban restaurant not to carry vaca frita. Second, mofongo is mainly puerto rican. Thirdly a cuban restaurant would call their pork lechon, not pernil. Btw, their 'pernil' sandwich was salty and dry. The appetizers were good, which saved them from a 2 star rating in my book. There are plenty other cuban selections in Orlando that offer a better and more authentic experience."
758	3	"About Skyview (from their website): ""Towering nearly 20 stories above Centennial Park, the SkyView Ferris wheel features 42 climate-controlled gondolas providing guest with breathtaking panoramic views of downtown Atlanta and the surrounding metropolitan area. Those looking for an even more enhanced experience will enjoy our VIP gondola boasting Ferrari leather seats, glass floor and a longer flight time. And, with its convenient location just steps from many of Atlanta's most popular attractions, SkyView Atlanta is the perfect compliment to your downtown adventure."" Took my ex on a date night of things that he loves. Skyview was something he had wanted to try out so I planned a visit during our night out. Adult tickets are $13.50 but they have military discount. And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets. Cool. There was a line, but we got on the ride quickly. I was afraid that the ride was gonna be really quick since it was near closing, but it actually seemed like we were on there for a good amount of time. It was beautiful seeing Atlanta all lit up from the sky, but I wish I could have seen it during daytime. Guess i will have to go back."
802	1	"It's close, it's not quick, but it's easy to get to and have lots of lunch and dinner options. Breakfast on the other hand had pretty limited options. It's a quick service food court. You really can't expect much."
392	2	"It's pretty much a staple of the Campus area - you want to see a movie at the Lennox? You go to Cup O Joe before or after. Service is always friendly, and sometimes the coffee is a bit ""meh"", but you generally get a good cup of whatever you want. (I actually really like the Elvis PB & Banana smoothie with a shot of espresso added). It's nicely arranged for sitting and talking at the tables or the long bar around the counter, and the patio has been the site of many a post-movie discussion. The wifi is a bit shaky - that seems true for almost every CoJ I've ever been to - but all things considered you get a pretty nice spot to chill out and relax a bit."
5	1	"This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis."
746	2	"Acquired by the very friendly and helpful new owner Tamie in May 2014, Med-Physique at 3 Graces now offers several new spa services, including Exlis, Botox, Juvederm, specialized peels, laser hair removal...as well as a variety of message styles to choose from and organic airbrush spray tanning...all in the newly remodeled spa facility. Although I loved my services provided at 3 Graces before, the space was indeed in need of a bit of a ""makeover"" itself. Great new facility and treatment options; however, I only visit for message or spray tans so I can't speak to quality of other services."
623	1	WTH ... I actually wanted to say 'F' instead of 'H' ... Service is decent and ya their menu is awful except for soups ..... It's overrated ...
854	1	I've come here for a couple years on Record Store Day and the service is always great.
675	2	"This place is for coffee geeks. Coffee was excellent. The selection of snacks/pastries was fairly limited, to a couple of scones and cookies, perhaps because we were there late in the day around 5. Non-coffee drink selection for kids seemed to be limited to hot cocoa. Nice small space though for sitting around having coffee."
275	2	"The Cottonwood is mediocre. I ordered the Twice Stuffed Chicken and my boyfriend got the Seafood Gunpowder. Both were just ok; things I could make at home. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was too pricey for a mediocre meal."
937	1	"AMAZING deal for quality, new boxes. More people need to know about this place! Bought four boxes today - 2 medium and 2 large - for under $7.00!! You can't beat that with a stick! Anyone buying directly from a U-haul is nuts w/ this place around! Totally impressed!"
361	1	"This place is fantastic. Everything I've tried is delicious, and it's all you can eat, brought to the table. Don't expect a menu - there isn't one. The owner is a little bizarre, but every time I bring someone new to this place, they're addicted."
591	3	"I can't knock the food, because it's pretty good albeit overpriced. The whole host/waiting/seating situation there is ridiculous! I get that you want the ""entire party"" to be there before seating would-be diners, but you don't need to be a complete a$$ about it. I had a party of 3, waiting on 2 more people, we knew we would have to wait to be seated but the host seemed like he would seat our partial party if we came back in a few minutes once the table was cleared. It was freezing and pouring that day and we didn't want to be one of the many annoying people that crowd the entry, so we hung out outside. About 10 minutes passed and our youngest diner (17) went into the door to see if we could possibly sit. As SOON as the kid went in through the door, the host freaked out and told him to go back outside. I thought that this was an extremely inappropriate way to talk to anyone. We were bringing in a party of 5 to drop at least $100 on breakfast. We left and got breakfast at Acme Cafe, and banned Medina in the process."
352	3	"The renovation is nice. The bar area has a nice ambiance, and the patio is massive. However, the service leaves something to be desired. My partner and I walked into the bar on a slow afternoon at the beginning of June. My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap (he was looking for a summer ale). The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, ""All the beers are listed there. Everything is seasonal."" Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond. Rude. The bartender continued to have an ""I could care less"" cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out. Alberta doesn't need this kind of douche-baggery. There are so many friendly bars to go to, I don't know that we'll be returning to ASP."
526	1	I'm really not a Jamaican food eater; however this food was banging. I ate it cold so I could imagine what it would taste like hot. I encourage all that can and will try Dat Fire Jerk Chicken.
414	2	"Finally got a chance to check this place out. Decided to check out the happy hour. I was very happy to hear they have both drink and food specials including a ladies night on Thursday. The food and wait staff was great, i tried the tuna flat bread. Everything seemed very fresh. I will definitely be back. I do see the trouble with noise on real busy nights, but i wasn't effected while on my visit."
237	3	"Okay, I'm going to get the bad out of the way first. I have never been to restaurant where the non-alcoholic beverages weren't listed. Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non-booze offerings were. Maybe if we'd shown up with a kid or stroller, we'd have gotten the non-alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. Now, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium-well in our group. I'd have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M&E's in town who do things more consistently."
892	1	"Still a good burger, but the experience has started to slide. Lot's of signs with rules, limitations, etc. No more smiling server greeting you in line to get a drink order."
552	1	Been here twice. Both times had amazing (5 star) food. The first time around I had some delicious sushi and the second time I had the stir-fry oxtopus that was out of this world! Service been average both times. Will totally be back for some more of the yummy food!
204	3	"Super fun bar with great beer and a lively atmosphere. I went on a Friday night with friends and saw multiple live music performances. We had to wait in line for a little while but the man at the front made it go by quicker by asking us trivia questions. There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn't have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I've had better. I really liked their 'bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch. Some things I didn't take advantage of was the chocolate bar, the arcade games, or the tasting room restaurant in the back, but definitely things I want to try next time I'm there!"
789	2	Wow seriously Starbucks! Get with it!! Not only was the drive thru lady extremely rude on April 1st at 12:00pm but my coffee was not even full! If I wanted a half a cup of coffee do you think I would come to Starbucks!? I will NOT be coming back to this location. If this was an April Fools joke some future advice... don't mess with someone's coffee! :/
12	3	"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever. The only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street."
232	2	"3 stars just because the food is good. Service is so slow, calling it fast food is misleading. 1st time: went to the restaurant to place an order - wait time 20 mins. 2nd time: placed an order online to save time. Got to the place in 20 mins as per the online order, the ORDER NEVER WENT through. Guess what - ANOTHER 20 mins to prepare the food. 40 MINS for Fast Food... Really!!???"
514	2	"I thought this was a great place for some strong BBQ. Fortunately we ordered a variety platter. I felt like there was good flavor and well cooked, but there was some wavering in the quality. You can't go wrong with the chicken or pulled pork! There was a smoke flavor that was inviting to start, but could be a bit overpowering. Our waitress was easygoing and attentive. My only complaints were that the only bread available was sliced white and the poor quality of the beef brisket."
172	2	"Really tasty and very fresh food. We ordered a salad, a gyro, hummus and baklava and everything was delicious and really fresh. Only subtracted one star because they need a water filter on their drinks. They all have a funky taste. I will def be back often and just buy the Mexican cokes to go with."
174	3	"Neil England is a true ""Ink God"". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment. He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. Let's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as ""a nightmare tattoo"". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist. A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as ""Naton"" of Dark wave Dermagraphics located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. I left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in. I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done, until Neil came along.... About Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo. I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy. The studio was clean, spacious, and all employees friendly. About Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options. He is a real artist. His work space was awesome. He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack. He has outlets to charge your cell phone, art everywhere, and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. The vibe in the studio is awesome, positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. Go with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary! Lastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!! I look forward to rebooking with Neil. Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED, do not rush him and do not miss your appointment. Empire tattoo is clean, friendly and professional. I have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it's the work of NEIL ENGLAND, that I wear with pride...thanks Neil...."
662	2	"Spectacular, one of a kind restaurant with an elegant, serene atmosphere. They have the best deals during September, as you can order the Magical Dining all you can eat option for about half off the original price. One of my favorite places for exquisitely made steak and simple but delicious desserts."
403	2	Great Cleaning service. They were able to come in on extremely short notice. I contacted them on Thursday and needed my house cleaned that weekend for a move in. They were able to come by Saturday and get the whole house done in a few hours. It was also a great job too!. I would recommend Steve for any cleaning jobs I have in the future and have him cleaning my condo as well!
592	3	"Is there an option for no stars? I am a university student (obviously) and I eat here quite often. I commute 1.5 hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch -- so Subway is always the best bet. Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It's actually quite perfect. The reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!? I would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, ""too late."" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their ""personalized sandwiches"" and you get the complete opposite. And they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper. Ayyyya."
607	2	"Great atmosphere. The staff is excellent and they have a deep knowledge of wine and food. It's a great place for special occasions and we saw several birthdays being celebrated. The food was good, but a few items were a bit bland for my taste. Be in no rush and bring several dollars, it isn't cheap nor would you expect it to be."
629	2	"Worth a visit just for the unparalleled view of Portland! $10/adult, you can do a self guided tour or have a guide. We didn't have much time so we went self-guided, the tidbits I overheard from a guide wee very interesting and added to the experience so I suggest doing a guided tour. Be sure to stop by the rose garden near here as well."
868	2	First time eating here. Coffee is 5 stars.. I had a Mocha and the hubby had an eggnog latte. We both ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito that comes with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were bland and dry. I ended up adding some salt and pepper to make them more edible. The burrito was just OK. Nothing spectacular about it. Would come again just for the coffee.
720	3	"No complaints on my side. This pub's 2 star review is undeserved and probably given by those who expect everything served on a silver platter. Understand that Texas industry abides by a different standard and you shouldn't expect fake smiles and an after meal foot massage from your server and you'll do fine here. Matthew and I started with a round of drinks: a corona and a bloody mary. Coronas will be coronas on good and bad days, but I was QUITE satisfied with my airport bloody. Strong, thick, & perfectly seasoned, it was just what I needed before catching a plane. We ordered some sweet potato fries, a plate of wings, and the potato soup. For the price we payed, we got plenty of food that was well prepared, and the kitchen didn't skip out on plenty of cheese and bacon on my soup. Our server, Tony, was dope. For a young guy, he took care of all ten tables in the pub real well. We're headed home, but if ever stuck in Austins airport again I wouldn't mind stopping in."
315	1	I moved to the Pearl about 2 months ago and I love living at the Louisa. I can walk to work and everywhere else I need to go. I didn't even bring a car up from Arizona. The concierge desk/doorman makes living and being on the go super convenient -- and Whole Foods is right next door.
44	2	"Kudos to AutoNation! We had an oil change done at another franchise and found our Toyota leaking oil the next day. We took it back to said business and they came up with all kinds of reasons that they weren't at fault. We brought the car to AutoNation, and in less than an hour we were shown that the first place used the wrong type of oil filter. Bravo! faced with the evidence the first place gave us the refund we requested. The indoor theater and popcorn are a nice touch too! :D"
480	2	"Once upon a time there was a tiny hole in the wall restaurant called Bonzai on the drag/ut-ish area that was awesome, but alas it was swallowed up by craptastic Diesel. Several years later, while cruising down Lamar, I spot a simliarly named restaurant and my groupie hopes and dreams were answered, seeing as how I'd rediscovered my beloved restaurant. Now, they could be totally unrelated, but don't rain on my parade. This place is a definite go to for delicious food. I've never had anything I didn't like, and the servers are always funny and chatty. If you're a fat kid at heart (like me) you'll enjoy their Bento boxes, which I lovingly refer to as a ""buffet in my lap."" Chicken Terriyaki is good, portion could be a bit bigger, perhaps they just cook with skinny chickens. The Sumo roll is melt in your mouth delicious, and the BF is a fan of the Katsu Don."
30	2	"3.5 stars! I got the avocado margarita and it was delicious! Customer service was OK, but they were busy. The food was better than expected and the meat wasn't overly salty. I will definitely return!!!"
750	3	"This was a pretty big disappointment. We paid extra to essentially stay in the park (what would be normal hours any other month) but with Halloween decorations. All the attractions had hour and a half waits. ""But you can purchase an express pass to bypass the lines!"" Sorry, I don't like the idea of paying the theme park to get to the front of the line. Universal has good attractions, but it's like playing a freemium game once inside. They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions. The scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though. It seemed most of the crowd was younger, too. We (30 year olds) felt a little too old for the event. The best part of this was that Diagon Alley was EMPTY. We rode Escape from Gringott's twice in a row with no wait. All the shops which are normally shoulder-to-shoulder during the day had plenty of space to enjoy. We were able to ride almost every ride in the park twice with no wait before the crowds swarmed back in. In short, worth it for the lack of crowds after 5 and before about 9, but lame Halloween gags targeted to teens and presented by teens."
501	2	"Food was par. Online dessert menu says they had a Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other. They sold me on it. Got there and was told menu online isn't updated, sorry. That was fine, until we had the most annoyed server in the place. Received the HARDEST eye roll of the night for bothering to ask for ketchup. Sorry, I tend to dip my fries in something. Pass"
379	2	"I really enjoy IKEA. You can make of it what you want. I usually only come if I know EXACTLY what I need. Otherwise I get completely overwhelmed. Do your research, prepare for crowds, and get a good deal. also, become a free member. There are lots of great perks, such as free coffee or tea and extra time for your kids in the play area (which according to my 6 year old niece and 8 year old nephew, is REALLY COOL.) lol."
905	3	"I wanted a classy experience with some friends on Saturday night and thought that Gypsy Kitchen would be a great place to try out. It's located in Buckhead and is upstairs at the shops of Buckhead. There is a parking garage located right beside it and there is an elevator that brings you right to the restaurant. Gypsy Kitchen is a Mediterranean and Spanish influenced restaurant that features many drinks and a wide range of tapas. Great place to grab some drinks and tapas! They have a rooftop as well. I loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. It felt classy, yet had this Spanish feel to it that made it relaxing. We were seating on the rooftop right away and enjoyed where we were seated. We were greeted by an amazing waiter, named Stanford, who made our experience even better. We ordered the Rose Sangrias, which were absolutely delicious, and for food, we ordered a plate of Patatas Bravas. They were pretty simple, yet they were pretty good. I honestly think that it was overpriced though. I wasn't completed impressed by that. Overall, great place to hang out with friends or have a date night with a romantic feel to it. However, it can be pretty overpriced."
860	1	Great tacos for a great price. And they have a gluten free menu - yay! The tacos you will want to eat again and again.
533	1	Good food and plenty of it. Wife loved her omelette. Good French toast and bacon. I asked for crispy hash browns and bacon and unlike most places they served me crispy hash browns and bacon.
167	2	"I'm less than impressed with Sweet. Like several others, I also found them a tad sweet for my taste, although not unbearably so. More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I've had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry. It was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry. I've never put a cupcake down before without finishing it, but for the first time I did. This is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting. These bakers could learn a lot from the cupcake shops in DC and New York."
797	2	"Small food court, but you come here for the beignets. Its not the best, and by far not NOLA, but its still a treat. I wish they had better coffee to go with the beignets. Food wise, its ok. Service could be better. Many of the workers have an attitude. Not sure if they really don't want to be working there, or, if that's the attitude of the ""south"" or New Awlins types. Whatever. Don't need to give me attitude when I'm confuseed what's considered a snack point or an entree! I'm a tourist with a food plan, not a local regular. 3 stars for the service, and perpahs the lack of selection for a food court. Riverside, just down the walkway, has more variety, but no beignets."
110	3	"I am in Atlanta on business, and one of my coworkers said he knows someone who owns an Italian joint, so this is where we ended up. I had no expectations whatsoever. Never heard of the place, never even been in the area before. Yes, the food was somewhat pricey. Everything we had was great. And for the decor, some say tacky, but this is part of what makes this place special. I stepped outside with my coffee to catch a quick smoke, and when I re-entered the restaurant, there was fog, colored lights, a variety of hats came off the walls onto children's heads,and some faster faced music was pumping. Again, this is what makes this restaurant unique. All in all, I liked this place. Has some character and if I visit the area again with a craving for Italian, I will try to revisit."
520	3	"Kate is a wonderful young woman to work with- professional, kind, and generous with her time. If the lighting changes just at the end of a shoot, she'll stick it out to help you get the perfect shot. Skip the studio style photos and go for natural light with Kate. In addition, she does wonderful editing and will work with whatever needs or aesthetic vision you might have in mind. Although she has done a large amount of musician headshots and family photos, she is great for fitness/yoga/pilates teachers and couples. Book her, stat!"
679	2	"Got my hair bleached and dyed for the first time here. I was really nervous at first because I had never bleached my hair before, but the staff were exceptionally helpful and explained all the pros and cons to allow me to make my choice. In the end, I still wanted to dye my hair pearl white. Note that I have black, Korean hair about as dark as it gets. I ended up bleaching my hair three times before dying it and it looks amazing! This was done 2 weeks ago and it surprisingly still looks super good. My hair doesn't feel damaged and I get complements for it all the time. Oh, and the cut? In my books, they are specialists when it comes to asymmetric cuts. I would highly recommend this hair studio and especially Han."
449	1	At first i was looking at this dish strange and it turned it to be delicious. Next time you are in the neighborhood try the Singapore Noodles and of course have the best California Rolls
88	1	Joey is the best and my cut grows out evenly and each day is like a new style. Highly recommend him!
383	3	"I am delighted to be the first to review the Wave. The Wave Restaurant opened in June 2008 in the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World. The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent. The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food. The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration. In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like. Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World. This place is a massive departure from what you would expect. No fries, no fried food. But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way. There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed. The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit. I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney. Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block. This place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay."
755	1	"Good food, fast service and friendly staff!! Pancakes fluffy and patty melt very tasty!!! Wendy is fabulous!!!"
690	1	Rigatone and Steak. That's all I have to say!!!! This place has some of the best food I've tasted in Boston!
794	2	"Got gel mani and opi pedi. The pedi was great! Loved it. However, the gel mani wasn't very pleasant -- the surfaces are uneven; got gel on my fingertips; top coat got on my index finger and a small part of my skin was burnt under the nail lamp... Hurt a lot (well, maybe it was because they were doing my mani and pedi at the same time, and the leg massage made my hands moved? )"
719	3	"Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard. My first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either. They have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location. Overall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports."
561	3	"I went there tonight for my second time. I just moved to Columbus within the last 4 months. The first time I went I ordered the Hoffbrau Schnitzel. It was really good. Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. I went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a ""must go"" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person) They did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that. Oh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!"
375	2	"""I overheard you are out of the roast beef, right?"" ""Yes, but we can still make another sandwich."" ""What do you have?"" ""Salami and cheese."" ""OK, sounds good, I'm easy to please."" ""Do you want mustard?"" ""No, but do you have mayo?"" ""Yes. Do you want any greens?"" ""Sure, give me some green stuff on it. And I need something cold to drink."" ""We have lemonade, iced coffee..."" ""I'll take Lala's Lavender Lemonade. Hold the alliteration."" Best damn lunch I've ever had from a cargo container."
177	3	"Great photo op if you ever find yourself in the city of Austin Texas. Upon googling things to visit in Austin, this spot always popped up which sparked my curiosity. Dont expect anything fancy though when you come. This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to. Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history. I was advised by the locals here that this place may no longer be here in the near future. Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments. I love that there are no frills here. If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt, climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves. Just do it, its worth it. I wish i did. But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie. I would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top. Hopefully its still there at that time."
680	2	"Really great pizza quality and toppings options. The crust is thin, light colored, and soft with dark, charred spots that tastes like it was baked in a very hot oven. The atmosphere is also really nice- our waitress was great as well. The reason for 4 stars, not 5, is because my salad wasn't too great. I just got the house salad and found it really oily and sweet. I also noticed other tables got bread to munch on before their food came, but we didn't get any"
424	1	I've eaten here more than a dozen times. The food is delicious and the service is great. I love the Lava Noodles and the Pad Thai.
413	2	"I love Octane, pretty much all their locations, but Grant Park is my favourite. I love the light filled room the relaxed atmosphere, the Coffee, the cocktails, the pastries and the people who work there. After 6 the no laptop rule on the bar is great as it gives some room to sit and drink great cocktails. Plus I hate to worry I am going to knock someone's books, laptop and ruin their whole life. I recommend the flat white, rooibos tea, and all the pastries!"
816	3	"First of all, to be frank, my friend's Power Pizza was served uncut. We were all very disappointed and astonished. Additionally, my other friend's Shrimp Fettuccine only had approximately five pieces of shrimp. Also, there was a paper table cover on the table but we were not supplied crayons for our pre-dinner rituals. Furthermore, my friend who is lactose intolerant received cheese on her Shrimp Fettucine. Finally, we asked for the check and received it about 6.9 minutes later. Overall, the experience was unforgettable and we made mems nonetheless. 10/10, would recommend. P.S. Beautiful toilets!"
761	1	Nice brunch spot. The berries and cream crepes was so good. I also tried the summer in italy which is french toast with fruits which was also pretty good. Ordered takeout this time but would definitely come back to dine in.
248	2	"This sushi -go-around is your typical ""franchise-like"" sushi joint. Not the best sushi by any means, however the variety of items at decent prices compensate for any lacking. I like their seaweed/salad rolls--a great way to get your daily veggie intake :). They also have three types of udon (chicken, beef, tofu) all are good, however these must be specially requested with either the Sushi chief or waiter/waitress. Bar is good, with a decent happy hour menu. Location is perfect! Right in the heart of many enjoyable locales (namely Powell's and other shopping places)."
491	1	No complaints but wasn't mind blowing. Staff was very polite and helpful. Would do 3.5 if I could
35	2	"This place has some of the BEST chinese take-out in Portland. Don't let the inside-a-bar vibe scare you away. WE LOVE HAPPY FORTUNE. Just thinking about it makes me want to go there right now. Plus.. they have great prices. Here's some of our favorites over the years: General Tso's (nice and spicy), the crab puffs, lo-mein. The service is great -- cheap drinks, while you're waiting, from plucky, yet-very-nice bartenders. Interesting people watching, but make sure to order from the bar-side of the place for that."
873	3	"I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall. I thought I would give it a try. Here's how the experience went: There were 2 people at the counter when I arrived. One person placed an order and said she would be back. She walked away. The other person was not making a purchase. There were 2 young men working behind the counter. The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him. Two more people lined up behind me. I asked if I could place an order. The ""front man"" moves to the back and the other guy comes and says ""Sure. Sorry, we're really busy."" I order cheeseburger fries. The former ""front man"" puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave/convection oven for about 40 seconds. He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard. He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes. I was conflicted about what to do with the fries. They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them! I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall. Please don't waste your money."
603	2	"First time here at D'lites. I had the chocolate pretzel ice cream and my daughter had the title cheesecake ice cream. They were both very good. Flavors weren't very distinguishable but tasty in their own right. It was really just as good as many other soft serve ice creams i have had and at only 50 calories a serving and no sugar, I was impressed. There was a fun toy ice cream stand for my daughter to play with and a chalk board wall with chalk for her to draw on. All in all a great no guilt treat, especially for the summertime. I'll be going back :)"
402	2	"Slides, Slides, Slides and the pool was heated! They have an arcade room and pizza hut right next to it. They even have a margaritaville! Room was spacious and parking was close to the room. Beds are ok. Only complaint would be that my room key didn't work the first day, I went to the front desk to change it and the next day it stopped working again. Other than that Great Experience! Coming back soon!"
517	2	"I ordered a large order from here via foodler for a work related program and they were timely with the delivery. The food was delicious and was enjoyed by everyone. I particularly enjoyed the palak paneer. A quick note about the portions: I ordered from the catering menu and the size large pan, though stated that it's for 10 people, can definitely feed 20! We had so much leftover. Will be ordering from here again in the future."
866	1	Total dump that survived off the back of a crap promotions group for years. The fat door guy is a rude asshole. I get that working the door on dirty is a shitty job but you don't have to take it out on others.
511	2	"Definitely sweet, and definitely rich, but also definitely the freshest donuts I've ever had. Our table got the Black Betty (blackberry, cream cheese, cinnamon, and honey) and Dirty Harry (donut holes with chocolate and coconut). I personally preferred the Betty because the fruit cut through the sugar, though the Harry makes for a better photoshoot with its little cauldron bowl. I don't know if I'm ready for donut burgers, but the desserts are an experience!"
903	1	"This place has great service, but I won't be returning for the food. It looks like if you are going for sushi, this place is probably great, however my husband and I went for a simple general tso's chicken and a beef meal. The quality of the beef and the chicken were pretty awful in my opinion and severely disappointing for the price. I won't be returning, but the staff was great. I am sure their sushi is their strong suit."
601	1	Food was okay. Nothing to brag about. Small portions. Won't go back there anytime soon.
290	2	I was having a problem with a plug receptacle I had just replaced tripping the breaker so I figured it's time to call the electrician. I called and the technician I spoke to actually helped me troubleshoot the problem over the phone and saved me a trip charge that would have taken him 5 minutes to do and saved me the 1 hour minimum. THANK YOU for being honest and not taking advantage of do it yourselfers!!!!
310	2	"I came here after a bruins game, loved it. Poutine is one of my all time favorite foods and this is the best I have had in Boston. They have a decent beer selection as well. Only complaint would have been the poutine could have used a little more gravy, was dry once I got to the bottom."
194	1	Meatloaf was very good ....I had a very good meal here. Staff was very friendly as well. Place was quiet and was very relaxing. Prices are fair. Something for everyone on the menu and breakfast all day. I'll be back.
686	2	"Tiny little bar, but I understand there is an upstairs that has never been open when I have been a patron. I typically frequent bars/restaurants on a Monday night, as I am a chef myself. Hands down, best chicken wings in Boston. Monday they are 25 cent wings, lucky for me it's the day I always go. Meaty and juicy with a handful of different flavors. Also, they have a a 7 dollar coors light pitcher. You tell me where else in Boston you can get that! I'm still looking. My only gripe is that the jukebox has been out of service for the past 6 months since I discovered this joint. All in all, it's a nice little bar nestled on cobblestone streets between TD Banknorth Arena and the Italian North End. Definately worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for a snack and some cheap beer."
849	1	Fun hibachi style. Long wait though even with a reservation. Food was excellent. Pricing a bit high. Would recommend if you're not in a hurry.
519	1	"Paid $32 for a complete wash, and was happy with the results. I typically go to a MooMoo or some other automatic wash, but this is MUCH better because the ""finishers"" (guys who wipe down the car) get all the spots the machines missed."
952	1	"Hmmm... I would have assigned a negative star, but the system doesn't allow you to... This place plain sucks... Upper case SUCKS... The food is no more than the average hot dog you get on a street, which is actually more tasteful... And better service... Service...? hmmm, what service...? Much left to be desired... This place is not at all what I had I mind when I think German village... My advice...? Go some place else...!"
512	2	"Dude, dude... dude! This place is awesome and by awesome, I mean totally surreal. A ghetto little gym in SE that fulfills it's functional and pragmatic purpose. You can go there and lift weights or run on a treadmill, but the real value lies in the totally old school atmosphere and the happiness such atmosphere affords. The walls are lined with old pictures of weight lifting dudes, the place is filled with regular joes in cut off sweat pants and the equipment is ancient."
728	3	"Cautionary tale: If you go to this establishment on a busy night, you may wait almost an hour and a half for your food--with no explanation, no contrition and no attempt at amelioration. That was our experience at Olivio. The food/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality/portion size. The bread/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long. The waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit. We understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating. I was here several years ago and now remember being underwhelmed at the food/value, now we have more reasons not to return."
969	2	"We have been here several days at Disney World and desperate for a good sit down dinner that wasn't over priced! This place is very well priced and is a very nice. The food was quickly made and very good! I had the spaghetti bolognese and thought it was great. My daughters had the kids spaghetti and cheese pizza and they were real adult versions, just smaller so it was also wonderful eats. We order a half craft of their table red wine. Also good. Definitely worth the visit and prices $10-13 entrees."
917	2	"Clean and nice interior, service was great but food is just ok. We ordered 2 appetizer, fish cake and crunchy wonton. Fish cake tasted like it's microwaved and the wonton is bland. For main we ordered pad Thai and shredded chicken. Probably the best pad Thai we've ever had. The shredded chicken is pretty spicy, if you love spicy food you should definitely give it a try. We also had the coconut ice cream, we probably had a big expectation because of the reviews but we think it's just tasted ok. Overall we had a good time experience but nothing really impressed us except for the pad Thai."
340	3	"For my 900th review - Damien S.' review brought this spot onto my radar several months ago, but I'm not from the neighborhood, so I bookmarked it for the future. The future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1/2 a mile away. Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over. Marvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order. When she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA. She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble. For herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw. The portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling. The rest of us shared two ¼ Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter / includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50. I liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned. The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well. Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home! We enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes. The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there. Good, but my preference was towards the chowder. Though we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job. They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils. 3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends. They are open daily, and close at 8pm."
760	1	"Was curious about this place since before it opened when I noticed the large ""DINER"" lettering atop the building. And finally after more than a few weeks I had the opportunity to walk over and have breakfast. And it was a great time. Friendly staff, Jenn was a sweetheart. Concise and modern ""diner"" menu, and the food was delicious!!!"
123	2	"Never in years of Legal Seafood dedication have I had a bad meal here, EVER. A crab roll comes on a buttered & grilled roll so light it's almost ethereal. Really it's an amazing roll and just amplifies the quality of the crabmeat. The salads are terrific but the best part might be the servers. Warm, attentive and helpful, just trust me- you'll eat here every chance you get!"
303	2	"Wine tastings have a lot of sweet white and reds. I wish they had more dry options but overall this place is awesome for drinks, apps, and full courses. I havent had dessert just yet but that just gives me another excuse to go back :)."
880	2	"My husband and I have eaten here quite often with our family for a special nite out and have gotten take out from here. Everything is always amazing!! I recommend the meatballs, eggplant rollatini, and veal parm. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is parking and wish seating was more comfortable as you feel to on top of other guests next to you. It is very cozy though and the service is wonderful!"
741	3	"Not enough service-13 minutes sometimes for another train to come Three words: Braintree/Ashmont split=Delays Very, very rude staff I.e.: WATCH THE DOORS! THE DOORS WILL BE CLOSING! WATCH THE DOORS! screeched at obnoxious volume, whereas service delays are made at a level no one can hear Have been called names by bus drivers in the good old days for being slow with putting in money and/or scanning my pass (and I always have them out ahead of time) Would gladly pay more if they addressed their problems, but it all goes to debt reduction But I do get reliably each day where I want to go and can read books while doing so"
644	1	"I went here some time back and did not find much 'resistance' to anything Establishment by the main guy here. In fact, I found the views about the US made 'drug war' in Colombia seemed almost to parallel that of the US government. It really was totally disappointing. The place definitely is not the center of any sort of rebellion/ political resistance that I could see."
190	2	"If you have driven past this place several times, you have missed a great opportunity for Costa Rican food those same several times. The food is good, fresh, and it feels homemade. Check it out, and make sure to try things that are from Costa Rica, not just your comfortable Mexican fare. Family-run, small location, super tasty."
102	3	"I've been to this location twice and couldn't be more disappointed. I looked through my provider list and saw this dermatologist listed so I called up for an appointment. When I arrived, I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney. Not the doctor, but the physician's assistant. Huh. Ok. Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor... Stephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. Took several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time). And it's not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay. I literally sat down, said nope no changes, and got a new prescription. Time to find a new dermatologist."
657	3	"These people are the best. I don't know anything about plumbing, and I had an unusual plumbing problem at work that had to be fixed asap. The guy was able to come up with a solution, and actually assembled the parts for me, so all I had to do at work was screw the whole assembly onto the pipe. Then he didn't even charge me for the adhesives or for his time. It was amazing. I'm definitely going back if I have any plumbing trouble in the future."
569	1	Thank you for the beautiful work on my daughter's nails. This was a special treat for her birthday! Now my husband wants to come in for a massage. Very clean salon and nice people.
857	1	"Awesome happy hour! Good selection of brews. Also, they have a Hawaiian melt that was to die for. Splurged a little and also got their truffle fries. Cleared the whole plate, and left 5 pounds heavier and happier :)"
426	3	"I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation. The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up. Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried. However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash. So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD. I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks. If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks. I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive. Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off! They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive. The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks. When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting. I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free! So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store. First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!. They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors. They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge. I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard! Data Saved! And it cost me 57 bucks!! If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery."
961	2	"Soup was too sweet, too much msg, and not hot enough to cook the rare beef. Spacious but dark. A bit pricier than other pho places. I think around $7-9/bowl. They only have small or large sizes, not medium."
296	2	"SiP is one of my favorite spots in Boulder. The owners are two of the friendliest people I've ever met and the service couldn't be better. It's a great spot to stop and have a coffee or drink with friends. The flatbread pizzas are fantastic as well! SiP has a fun, laid back atmosphere that is perfect for just about every occasion. I highly recommend to anyone nearby!"
470	2	I really like this place. I used to order delivery all the time and then they stopped delivery to my neighborhood. Food is fresh tasting and not as greasy as most Chinese.
990	2	"Nice modern-looking environment. Mellow music. Friendly service. Most importantly, great food. My friend had the combination fried rice. He loved it! I had the combination clay pot and it wasn't bad at all. I wish I had chosen my friend's seafood clay pot which looked amazing. You have to try out this place. Great eat for the late night munchies."
224	1	Jerk chicken didn't taste authentic. Chicken taco had bone in it. Restaurant is in food court of flea market so don't expect atmosphere.
693	1	"Delicious low key spot. Enjoyed sat brunch. Had hash with egg, black cod fishermans stew abd orrechiette- all tasty. Sangria was a little bitter and served withiut fruit. Friendly service and cute atmosphere. Single bathroom so plan to wait. Would like to try for dinner since lunch is brunch menu."
236	3	"I went to DryBar this past weekend to get my hair done for my 21st birthday. I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!"
353	3	"Brunch here has some really deliciously overwhelming and satisfying options. This is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people: - Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6) This is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread. - Sunrise Poutine ($15) I told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs. - Sunnyside Burger ($15) As if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese. - Southern Belle French Toast ($12) Another really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles. It's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff."
238	3	"Went to Haru with a bunch of old and new friends last night. it was part of my ""get me the f outta here"" regimen. By soaking myself in sushi goodness, I might forget that I have to pack still, have 10,000 emails that piled up during my 5 days of death by powerpoint. Anyway, the sushi here was tremendous. The edamame was HUGE but could have used a little more salt on the top and a little less on the bottom (suggesting that it sat f or a while?) but overall - the food here was fantastic. We had a big party, split the tables and the other side had food coming all night long. We opted for a bit more conservative approach, ordering a big tray of about 5 rolls (including the Bostonian[?] - which was FANTASTIC). There really wasn't anything there that wasn't really quite delicious. Try the Kiss of Fire - but I have to warn you, there's a fuse on that fire. It hits you about your third piece in... The service was great. We ran that poor girl's legs completely off. But again, order a Diet Coke and you'll get ""is Diet Pepsi ok?"". My typical response is, ""well, is paying in Chinese Yen ok?""... you get the idea. All in all, good friends, good times, good sushi. A solid 4."
566	2	"There are so few coffee shop options up north beside the typical Starbucks chains, so I was pretty stoked to find this place by stumbling across their groupon deal.They always seem to have a living social or groupon online! There's a limited amount of seating and plugs on the wall, but I haven't had any problems since I've only been here on a weekday. Great atmosphere to get some work done. My favorite is the iced chai so far since I have a sweet tooth with my drinks and their menu definitely has a lot more of those for me to try. It also helps they have food on their menus in case you want to work through lunch and stays all day."
991	2	Good food. I tried the sesame chicken with fried rice and the royal ginger roll. The roll was delicious. The chicken was good. Would have like more green beans to be mixed in and the sauce was a little too salty. But I enjoyed it and would get it again. The fried rice had little pieces of pineapple mixed In and that was great. It made it different from other places and gave it an added sweetness which I enjoyed. I also had the typhoon margarita and it was very good as well. It also had pineapple juice which gave it a different twist. The food took a little longer to come than I though it should (about 30 min.) but it was a Friday night and they were busy.
448	2	"I enjoyed the pho, but not the service. The servers were quite cold, snatching the menu away from our hands. It wasn't as if it was full of people waiting to be served. But the pho was good enough to ease my feelings, and it was served quite quickly as well. But then, when we were paying, the cashier was again very rude, snatching the money away and slamming it on the counter. We were quite startled and it left a bad aftertaste that erased the good mood. I'd recommend the place if you're just looking for decent pho for a cheap price, but if you want and overall pleasant experience, you might want to try somewhere else."
995	1	"Mojo crepes aka when it was ""blue sky"" back in the day. Solid place to boba and crepes and to hang out with friends. I like their original milk tea, however their tapioca balls are usually never cooked right only downfall. Sometimes undercooked and sometimes overcooked."
227	3	"""El Paso Style Food"" huh...when I first saw this place, I thought to myself, hmm, I am originally from El Paso and your telling me you make food like mama did back home? Well, this I have to see."" I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T he salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican's Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. I also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma's food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. When I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don't serve Chico's Tacos (El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat."
540	3	"I've frequented this location a few times over my older years, but not since getting involved more with Yelp. I've always been relatively pleased with Home Depots, in general. This time, I stopped by to see what shower heads they had to offer. Upon passing through the front doors, I was pleasantly greeted by a woman - power to the female fixer-uppers in this world!! I'm not one to search and search on my own for a product. My personal motto: If they work there, they should know their establishment."" The lady asked if there was anything she could help with, so I took advantage, and asked away. She pointed met the exact section and aisle. BAM! Get 'er done. Found the end cap, studied the selection, made a choice, and headed to the register."
981	2	"Lunch at 1:30. General Tso chicken had way too much breading. Hardly any chicken in many big pieces. Good sauce, though. Fried rice was bland too. They forgot the sour in the hot & sour soup. Expected much better from a ""fancy"" chinese restaurant. Boy, do I miss Golden Wok. Eggroll had a bunch of pepper, kinda wierd. Not worth the premium price. Had high hopes. Disappointed."
743	3	"I had been meaning to write a bad review of this place for a couple of months now. Looks like I'm too late, since they are closing at the end of the month. I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didn't have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26"" rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles). I've worked in a shop before, and customers are the lifeblood of the shop - bummer this guy didn't realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under."
432	2	"This place accommodated our party of 6 adults, 1 child, and 3 toddlers without incident (with advance reservations). CJ has a robust an diverse menu with reasonably priced entrees. CJ also has sports on TVs visible from the dining area without feeling like you are eating at a ""sports bar"". They accommodate children unlike any place we have dined by offering complimentary meals for toddlers. A pleasant dining experience!"
221	2	"Went here with my family and friends (4 adults 2 young children). The hostess and waiter were incredibly accommodating and kind to us. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious and fresh! We all had a special pesto linguini with seafood (lobster, jumbo shrimp, and scallops). It was out of this world! We will definitely be coming back many times!! Totally recommend if you are looking for great food, great atmosphere, and amazing service!"
702	2	"If you like overpriced furniture and pushy sales staff, this is the place to go! I don't, so took my business elsewhere. At least they did me a favor and let me know that they were scammers up front- among other things, every item I looked at was only going to be ""on sale"" for a few more days. Even the items that would be custom ordered. If you're that awful before they take your money, just imagine what they're going to be like after the sale."
390	2	"Words and yelp reviews can't describe the absolutely amazing atmosphere. There are books EVERYWHERE. I am a bookie but I believe anyone would enjoy a visit here( maybe not the claustrophobic ). Sadly the renowned basement section wasn't available for browsing but only for certain searches. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and somehow can recall their entire inventory. I personally recommend coming here to browse rather than looking for a certain novel but if you are, the staff can help! I'll be back here before long!"
902	1	We tried 3 dishes all 3 were good. Unfortunately instead of coke we got cherry coke. I'm curry there wasn't enough meat. Over all good experience
9	2	"I work in the Pru and this is the most affordable and tasty place in the food court. deals where a meal is $5-$7 and the chicken pesto is really good. I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good. Broccoli chicken is my favorite. Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from."
554	3	"As they say, you get what you pay for. It could be true for some of the luxurious purchases we've had. Some just ride on their name but truly their quality is awful. What made Tanner Goods stand out is they are local. They have excellent service and gives advice for people like me who needs advice in how to keep my denim well. Yes, besides leather goods they also sell clothes. A bit spendy than most generic stores that you might go like Macy's, Target, Fred Meyer but they all pale in comparison when you'll compare the details of merchandise they have. Sure, I could use a nice pencil. Mind you, they are cute but not for $10. But there are items like shirts, key fobs, coasters that are also well made and could fit your budget. This is the place if you're looking to give me a gift. Don't worry, I accept gifts for any occasion. I don't need to have a local and US made product all the time but when I can, I do it right. And this is the place for some of it."
665	1	The service we received was absolutely fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful for my 11yo daughter who is very picky.
26	3	"When we first arrived at the Coco Key, we were greeted by a number of staff members as we checked in, the process was slightly awkward because the staff appeared new or in training, which can happen from time to time. No harm no foul. The foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. After unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. Shortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. Long story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room. I did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. You're probably asking...""but did you die?"" I am very much alive. However, I am very doubtful that I will ever return to the coco key."
22	2	"Ordered the original tonkotsu base ramen and a char siu don for my 2 year old. Loved the soup base but especially loved the size of the bowl...unlike most ramen place, the size of the bowl reflected the quantity of the content in it. Totally looking forward to going back so I can customize my next bowl of ramen...will select thicker noodle for sure and perhaps add more ramen! Fabulous service and loved that they had a sign advising ppl to come in, write down name then wait outside, so not to clog the entrance/exit. Great ramen place, but won't go with a group larger than 4 ppl. Heads up, there was only one high chair."
31	3	"First time being here and I'm not going anywhere else for my truck needs from now on. Right when I feel like customer service is lacking in my day to day dealings, Miguel and the crew at Lambs turned all that around in a few minutes. These guys got me in late in the day after work, gave me great advice about my truck without trying to pitch anything, took care of my tire quickly and had me on my way. This place definitely stands out and I'm for sure coming back for an oil change, rotation, and whatever else I need in the future. Thanks guys I really appreciate it."
325	2	Tuesday morning was pretty cool went shopping with a friend there's not very many items of the same choice that you want so if you see something you want you better grab it you better buy it. especially if there's a markdown price or it's on sale. last week I got a killer deal on some glitter glue for our project I've been working on. Only paid 74 cents each and they were larger than normal size bottles
923	2	"This OSJL used to be just ok, and average. Once the Dedham store opened about 5 years ago, it was much better. Now FINALLY the good shipments of inventory and rather well organization have arrived to this location, right off Route 1 past the Dean Street traffic light. If in the area, stop by, otherwise go to the Dedham one. They are both great and equal."

If this store actually does accept your used clothes/purses (which is an obstacle in itself, unless you have the style of a 13 year old) they really don't offer a lot. I find that I get more pleasure out of donating my old clothes to a worthy cause. Also- if you do dare to try to sell something to them, give yourself an afternoon because they are highly unorganized and very slow."
605	1	"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, beautiful desserts. If you like Ethiopian food or want to try it, go here. :)"
234	1	Very profession insanely cheap compared to others I called and it didn't take very long. They actually wanted to help more than make money.
996	1	Divine ambiance. Red walls. Cold ones. Love music. There is no better place in the 'ville.
738	1	"Pretty good stuff. Had cold udon for the first time and it was awesome! Very small place, I been at UT for two years and I never saw this place on the drag. It is a must check out!!"
272	1	Got a medium birthday cake with vanilla ice cream and devoured it. Could've eaten a large it was so good. Tried Mango too and it was awesome. Reminds me of Jerry's in Memphis. Definitely going to come back here every time I visit Austin.
456	1	This was truly my best first best cuban-food experience. Their ropa vieja was wonderful!
712	2	"Animal Kingdom Lodge is a big beautiful hotel on the Disney property. The staff was all super friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable, and the view of giraffes, zebras, and other exotic wildlife cannot be beat. Jiko is maybe the best restaurant in disney world, and Boma had a great breakfast. While Victoria Falls was great to grab a drink at. The one problem I really have here is that it is a bit far from all the parks, except Animal Kingdom. I have stayed here twice and enjoyed it both time very much, but I think my wife and I will try a different resort on our next trip."
2	3	"I called WVM on the recommendation of a couple of friends who had used them in the past and thought they did a nice job. I'm a fan now, too. Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours. All of my (heavy) furniture arrived in perfect condition, and they took extra care not to scratch the wood floors in the process.I hope not to move again anytime soon, but next time I do, I'll be calling WVM."
785	2	"This is fantastic! We had cold lobster rolls and shrimp burgers at our server Amy's advice. She was spot on! The grilled octopus and fish dip as appetizers were worth the fuller belly than we planned! Again, Amy came through when we asked what to dip the homemade chips in. My hubby and her discussed what he liked and she actually went back and mixed her own dip of horseradish, Old Bay and mayo, and we basically dipped EVERYTHING in it! We could not be happier with Amy or our stop here!"
780	2	"I don't know what we would have done if we didn't find Kim to purchase our 1st home. We relocated from So. Cal, and she was with us through some tough situations and made it a cake walk throughout the entire process. She and Julie Davis are amazing. They are extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. We had tons of questions and concerns and they addressed everything in a timely manner. Thanks so much Kim & Julie for helping us find our beautiful home! - R & B"
622	2	"Michael and company are fantastic! All the beer is tasty and fair prices on everything. All the comments on here about the hours and dogs. It's a functioning brewery first and foremost run mainly by Michael and his wife so the hours reflect that. I know some want to tear it up into the wee hours, but this place is what it is a brewery. And the rules about dogs aren't the owners rules they are the states so if you have an issue with that take it up with your state legislature."
443	2	"Stayed here for the Labor Day weekend and was impressed. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable. The Japanese garden on the 6th floor was a pleasant touch. The pool temperature is DIVINE and the convenience of the poolside bar and snack offerings were delightful. Parking is expensive, but you can park across the street at the Embassy Suites for free . This location is in close proximity to the Lennox Square Mall, walking distance even. I recommend this location to anyone who'd like great service and luxury outside of midtown Atlanta."
399	1	"My favourite lunch place in the area. Big portions, good prices, and extremely friendly staff. This is where I was first introduced to Filipino food, and it made a good impression. The menu is huge, and a lot of the dishes are best shared so go with friends."
855	1	"The room was horrible and the customer service was worse. To top it off, my car was burglarized overnight and no one even offered to assist with calling the police. My advice would be to stay away from this hotel and area."
914	3	"They've changed their menu. They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now, and increased their prices. new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement. Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off. When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread. Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge. When you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here. Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, ""so, if you want to pay for it..."" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes. A lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good. There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates. The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting. They are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do. Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere."
29	2	"Am I crazy for giving anything MBTA-related four stars? Maybe. Rating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US. Simply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough. Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. Look, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it. So knowing all this, I'm still really quite happy with the red line."
499	2	They offer free use of computers Free printing Free wifi Free work space Dvd rentals for cheap. Free Recycling stickers Quiet place to get some work and printing done.
96	3	"My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving. The service was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross. I would never eat here again."
214	3	"Went there last night and was disappointed again! How hard is it to take and order and fill it? All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived. At least they didn't put it on the bill this time. I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM. Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs. And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent. Not a good showing last night. It will be a long time before we return, if we do return. Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service? That's a tough sell."
807	1	"Service wasn't great. Very slow prepping, and the food tasted very bland. Overall pretty disappointing experience. I wish they would have the regular menu at lunch. Maybe their regular pasta would taste better but I won't be back to wait another an hour to try"
388	1	"Super friendly service, easy place to bring the kids, very tasty coffee (americano was great) and the Diablo was awesome, best breakfast I've had in a long time! Highly recommend."
667	2	"I visited the Sam Adams brewery during a trip to Boston in September 2008. It was much more intimate than I expected, as it is one of the largest breweries in the US. It turns out that this is the original location, but more of an R&D facility currently. We had to wait around a bit for the next tour, but it wasn't too long. I was quite surprised to learn that Sam Adams was founded in 1984 (I would have guessed 1884, if those were my two options). The tastings were good and we even got to sample a couple of new brews they were testing. I haven't been to Harpoon, so I can't compare, but plan to check it out the next time I'm in Boston."
483	2	"The new vet is wonderful and the service remains top-notch. Unfortunately one of my cats had to be euthanized due to a combination of factors, and the staff really helped me come to a decision and go through the process (for both me and my kitty) as sympathetically as possible. I can't recommend them enough."
460	1	"After having breakfast at some of the top rated breakfast restaurants in Vancouve and being very disappointed, this was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and service."
779	2	"I have had dinner from El Potro 3 times since they have opened. One time we did take out and I have sat in there twice. Every time that we've gone there, we have had great service. The food is delicious too. I have not had their margarita, but I have heard good things. The decor is bright and appropriate for a mexican restaurant. I am excited to try their breakfast!"
507	3	"I usually wash my car when I go home to Houston but the few times I have needed to wash my car I have been going to this location. Even though I live in central Austin, I come all the way down to this side of town for this place. I like that this carwash is cheap, quick, does the job, and has free vacuums (actually, I love the free vacuums...). There are guys who scrub the tough spots that the machine wouldn't be able to get on its own before you enter the wash, which is nice. I normally get the cheapest or middle option, but I've gotten great service every time I've been here. The last time I was here they let me go through the machine twice because my car wasn't clean enough - thank you. Today when I visited again, the attendant by the pay station asked me when was the last time I treated myself to a $13 wash, to which I responded with silence and a half-grin, and Roland, the manager, gave me a complimentary $13 wash!! Shout out to Palms because I used that money to go towards my dinner tonight See you guys next time!"
120	1	"Worst food ever ... It was my wife's birthday and we were in Orlando celebrating by going to bunch of theme parks ... She is so fond of indo Chinese cuisine , so I really wanted to eat out ... Pulled out yelp and saw this place advertised so .... It was the most disappointing experiance .. That f'ing place does not even know what is indo Chinese , they even justified it is indo Chinese .... Pls avoid this place ....the server was an a'Hole who was suggesting all crap ..."
261	2	"I absolutely love this restaurant. I've been coming to Brasserie for a few years now, and have had the chance to visit for brunch, lunch and dinner (and have enjoyed several of their desserts as well!). When my family visit, especially if it's for a special occasion, this is our go-to place to celebrate. Their bloody mary's in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! All of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. Bon appetit!"
64	2	"certainly don't come here for the ambiance. it appears like it used to be a walk-up ice cream window in the front, which is semi-camouflaged with curtains. the service is okay - efficient, but not overly friendly or helpful. we mostly stick to the curries here, which are good. often filled with a lot of tufts students during the school year, probably b/c it is not so crowded and can accommodate larger groups. sometimes one of the employees (or their family members) are playing an electronic keyboard."
782	1	"We ordered the Miso soup and for entree, the U.N. and Chanel rolls. All of the items were excellent. Our drinks were also very good: The Mule, Apple Old Fashioned."
821	3	"Car tint was installed by Sunbusters. Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job. To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating. I'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me. I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews. I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think. Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time. If you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place."
867	3	"As we are on a driving trip between Arizona and Texas, and with our dietary restrictions of no dairy, no sugars and no grains of any kind, we search for restaurants where we can have some good protein and veggies. We picked the wrong one. We had four in our party, and one of them picked the steak (all full of fat and gristle), one picked a salad, and the greens were wilty, another picked chicken, which was super dry, and then the service was soooo slow. In this day in age, we recognize it's difficult to find good help, but when you tip 20%, and they make $25 per table, for example, you expect some decent level of service..not this time..we won't be back."
582	2	"My favorite pizza place in Portland. Great place to stop in for a slice. Crispy, thin crust with delicious ingredients. Also cool that the offer homemade sodas with unique flavors."
137	2	"Had a few delicious things here: Arroz con Camarones (Shrimp Rice), Tostones, Maduros, Bistec Merengue. Also the Queso y Salami Frito app was perfect. As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. A few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too. The drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity."
