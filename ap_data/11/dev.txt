529	PG-13	twilight A book with no literary value whatsoever. It's biggest fans tend to be [fangirls] who are in love with Edward because they think he's sexy (despite the fact that he is merely a word). ;; There's no character development at all, and the protaganist, Bella Swan, would die without Edward, which leaves some of us to believe that she may, in fact, be a zombie due to the fact that she probably died sometime before the story even took place (thanks to her knack for falling in front of cars and other bullshit). ;; This book is so bad that I actually couldn't stomach to read it. I read more of Jane Austen than I did of Twilight. And I hate Jane Austen. ;; Read this if you want to look like an idiot in front of someone who isn't.

407	R	crunk In 1995, Conan O'Brien and Andy Richter were scheming ways to get past the TV censors on Conan's late night talk show, and they settled on an all-purpose, suitable replacement for the infamous seven dirty swearwords that they couldn't say on TV: Crunk. The choice to use that word was definitely not random. Ice T just happened to be on the show that night, and he likely fed the word to them beforehand and certainly helped fuel its popularity during the telecast ('That was seriously crunked up, right there.'). But Ice never claimed to have come up with the word--he probably got it from Dirty South rappers, who had been using it for years as a euphemism for getting really crazy and fucked up on marijuana and alcohol (stoned and drunk. Chronic plus Drunk = Crunk). Or maybe crack and drunk. Or coke and drunk. Or maybe just being crazy and drunk. Whatever it is, it means getting really crazy and fucked up. And with Conan's introduction of the word to northern suburban audiences, Crunk came into its own as the recognized sound of the new generation of Dirty South Rap, prompting white college fratboys everywhere to wander around going 'WHHHUT!! OKAAY!! YEEEAAHHH!!' like annoying dipshits. and it's all thanks to Lil Jon, and by Lil Jon I mean Dave Chappelle.

117	R	high school High school is a failed experiment in preparing young people for the adult world. All high schools in the country were built around 1960 and were designed to hold about half as many students as they currently do. Nothing seems to work quite right in a high school building. The heaters only work during the summer and the air conditioning only works in the winter. The asbestos insulation has all fagged out and the building becomes an oven or a meat locker, depending on the time of year. The plumbing is usually a disaster in high school, with drinking fountains never working but toilets that never stop running. ;; High schools are usually poorly run by a team of out of touch assholes, also known as Principals, counselor, teachers, and ex-Marine drill sergeants (gym teachers). These people seem hell bent on destroying all hope for students through tedious testing, poorly planned projects, educational videos made during the Truman Administration, and text books that mention the Soviet Union on every page. ;; High school is also the place where the stress of growing up and the stress of fitting in join forces to destroy even the strongest among us. Most of High school is not spent learning but involves trying to find friends who aren't complete douche bags, trying hook up with people of the opposite sex unsuccessfully, combing your hair, buying cloths in the effort that someone will notice you, working out so you will not get your ass kicked everyday, trying desperately to get rid of the zits that have taken over your face, driving a car that a homeless person wouldn't piss in or riding on an over crowed bus while choking on diesel fumes, while people you don't know make fun of you worse then your friends do, and on top of all of that, you must act like nothing is wrong in your life.

If you take the mark out of supermarket, all you're left with is superet and that's pretty stupid cause why would you go out to the superet, it makes no sense. Mark means warlike, especially in bed if ya know what i mean. Its definitely the coolest word/name ever cause if you spell it frontwards and backwards, its different!!!
302	NC-17	hentai Hentai is animated pornography showcasing women who have better bodies than any real women (yet have weird hairstyles and hair-colours) and men with enormous penises. ;; Every character in a hentai has body features several times better than any real person. 13 year old boys with 12 inch erections. 8 year old school girls with breasts better than most 16 year olds. The thinner the woman, the bigger the breasts. ;; Female children in hentai don't always have breasts, but sometimes they do to add sexuality into the hentai. Children do not have spectacularly large breasts, but they can be nice ones. ;; As for women, their is no such thing as a flat-chested no-breasted woman - at least in professional hentai anyway. Their breasts are perfect and natural - not tainted by surgery with scars and abnormalness. They are perfect. Hentai is perfection. ;; As for elderly women, they do not exist. In hentai, they do not get naked. They are characters that are basically asexual to the hentai nature. Thank god. ;; Hentai can involve anything sexual. Lesbians, bisexuals, homosexuals, bondage, underwater, fairies, humans and animals, orgies, oral sex, [aural] sex, anal sex, naisal sex, S&M, slavery, dildos, strap-ons, anal toys and of course heterosexual vaginal sex. Hentai isn't always sexual penetration with a group or pair of people. It can be a woman/man/tranny posing or masturbating. It could be a group kissing or undressing or fondling each other. ;; Hentai has no limits. That is why it is so great. I have nothing against real pornography, I enjoy it also. But hentai is perfect. Normal pornography is not. Hentai is beautiful.

It is also a word that means to represent yourself/ the way you represent yourself, baggy clothes, shitty hats, small penis and basically a way to say your afraid to come out of the closet.
