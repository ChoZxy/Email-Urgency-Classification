te79ew	neutral	I have no idea how to love myself: I just am a little lost.  I\u2019m at a point where my self-love is at an all time low yet finding time to learn to love myself.  It\u2019s tough cause I probably do about 30 hours of school per week plus 20 hours of work.  When I do have free time it\u2019s hard because I want to put myself out there and try to date yet it\u2019s draining me.  I also want to find time to play sports and hang out with friends so I enjoy myself and have fun.  But I just am lost.  I\u2019m not sure if a relationship will make me happy or if until I find self happiness I should just take a break from dating.  Any advice?

t90p6q	hostile sexism	Women &amp; statues: Since March is apparently women\u2019s history month, today my female teacher showed a video about exactly that. In the video (which is just propaganda), a feminist argued that it makes no sense that men have more statues because women make up the majority of the population (with stats and all), so women should actually have more statues (because representation).\n\nAfterwards, my teacher asked for our thoughts on the video and I said that the feminist\u2019s argument was ridiculous because there being more women doesn\u2019t indicate anything. I explained that men probably have more statues because they\u2019ve significantly contributed to world progress than women. Than my teacher cut in saying that that\u2019s only because women have been suppressed under the patriarchy and that they\u2019ve equally contributed to society as men but they\u2019re just aren\u2019t acknowledged because misogyny. \n\nAm I wrong? Being too harsh?

You show that you are willing to deal with any ramifications that may occur from allowing another person to harm you as a result of you opening yourself up. \n\n**Showing vulnerability in these kind of situations is a sign of STRENGTH and is VERY attractive!**\n\nBe strong!

t3lcom	institutional sexism	I'd just like to share a snippet of a conversation I had with a male draft-appologist. &amp;#x200B; &gt; I am just trying to relate how this whole serving thing in order to have rights is skewed because men will never have to deal with it. "It" being pregnancy. "It". Is. Not. A. Fucking. Excuse. I know what their saying, believe it or not. We need women to perpetuate the human race, that's irrefutable, and that pregnancy itself is uncomfortable, causes cosmetic changes to the body, and has historically (but not since well before you were born) been a significant risk of injury or death. But acting like pregnancy and childbirth is in any way the equivalent to fighting and dying in a warzone tells me something vitally important about them; they are *war-virgins*. Only the profoundly entitled ignorant would compare a modern woman's ***choice*** to carry a pregnancy to term (only women have to right to abortion), give birth in a sterile medical facility designed for the purpose of managing neonatal/labor/birth/premature issues, staffed by people who spent 10 years going to school to assist in birth complications, with a first-world infrastructure to feed and shelter themselves, with the horror, death, and sanity-shredding reality of close-quarters industrialized combat. And I'm saying this as a war-whore; I've done my time in Afghanistan and Iraq. But you know what? All it really takes to cut that entire argument down is this: Just draft the women who haven't given birth. Boom, now Feminists, you've got nothing left but more of the same tired, sexist, male-disposability-based excuses. But men aren't taking excuses those anymore. Not after a lifetime of being preached at. Not after a lifetime of hearing women are categorically equal to men... ...because I believe you are, too. So, Feminists, you are gonna be my equal. It's happening whether you like it or not, you don't get to take off your shoes and crawl back into the kitchen this time.

t63md7	hostile sexism	Not getting laid as much these past few years? They planned it.: Our government has designed our society so that there is literally no way for a man to meet a woman in real life. This is deliberate and it\u2019s systematic demoralization and eugenics. They want to convince gen z that getting laid is impossible and that the first world is and was never convenient in an effort to get them to fight a meaningless war by causing endless conflict and turning all their girls into entitled cunts. Also they\u2019re just breeding out all the women by turning social media into a superior male impregnation shopping experience. All the dating sites are now is a frenzy of men who think they\u2019ll never meet another attractive woman or any woman as long as they live. It\u2019s the immediate result of impending socialized medicine. You will never see a 300 lb woman with a man over 200 lbs or a man less than a 4 with ANYONE. Eugenics. Lower half of our face is what sells us.. mask up. Notice how we\u2019ve all been turned into annoying telemarketers trying to land a date over keyboards? All the sidewalks have dried up. All the women can have whoever they want regardless of whether the men are self respecting or will actually stay. So many guys had plenty of luck before the pandemic but became increasingly challenged to find a date progressively through the 2010\u2019s and it\u2019s no coincidence. We\u2019re all being systematically coerced.

so6kgh	neutral	Help me understand: To me feminism is the belief men and women should be equal, along with the fight and movement to achieve that. I've never thought this was a controversial topic. I ask everyone here if they agree with my statement (and if they don't, why). You can agree with what I've said and also believe that some feminists you see on tv or social are not good representatives of the movement. You can also disagree with points made by said feminists. But feminism, ultimately, is the belief men and women are equal. "No but current feminism supports this and that and says this and that" I don't care. After all, this is a movement and it's represent by different people with different beliefs in different parts of the world. You may not like or agree 100% with how the movement is represented today, but the message is the same. Think about it as political parties. Just because you are a republican doesn't mean you have to like every single republican president that the US has ever had, along with every single choice they've ever made. I remember not too long ago there was a movement of Republicans for Joe Biden, as they agreed that Donald Trump was not a good representative of the Republican party or its stands. So, you had these republicans voting for Biden. They never stopped being Republicans but they understood the Republican party is so much greater than Trump. The same is true for feminism. Its ideals and stands have a core, a foundation. You can be a feminist and still disagree with the modern representation of the movement. As those republicans disagreed with Trump. Side note: the reason I brought up Trump and Biden was not to start up a political discussion, but because I thought it was a good analogy we could all understand and use as an example. Please focus on my original question when answering this.
qa1xeb	neutral	Why You Should Never Give Your Life for a Man: I was just thinking about how expected it is for  women to give up their dreams to support a greater man\n\nThis happens when married wives are expected to back line and stall their own careers to cheerlead and advance their husbands shot at being prominent in his. When gfs are expected to forgo educational advantages like an Ivy College to move to where is best for the bf\u2019s profession or for him to get the best school etc.\n\nIt also still exists in corporate America in more traditional industries such as law. A lot of law is built off the backbone of lower level female labor. These big executive and rainmakers are only able to be such because they have equally intelligent wives at home holding it down, raising their kids and caring for their house. Because these women have chosen to shunt their talents not into advancing self but into his own advancement and rise to prominence. They sacrifice their lives to do it. Within the office, owing to the gendered nature of the hierarchy, these same men also have women sacrificing their lives for their advancement there in the form of older female secretaries.\n\nIn some cases, these women have moved with them from firm to firm to firm for them to get the best place for their practice and to maximize their earnings. In some cases, they have even moved with them from other states, from one coast clear to another, to support them. Often they could be doing better things with their lives, advancing their own bottom lines instead of pouring all their effort into a man they believe in and his advancement. Many of these secretary-attorney relationships outlast marriages and go on for 20, 30+ years. These women sacrifice their own financial livelihood to stand with and faithfully serve these men and further their advancement for decades. It can almost become a corporate wife situation of sorts with you serving and supporting his basic needs while he goes out and gets money for both of you/ that also benefits you or allows you to earn more\n\nI almost became a causality of it myself. Almost fell for it. I was supporting an attorney who advocated for me strongly and took care of all my needs within the office- fighting for better pay for me, making sure I was comfortable and cared for and protected, and had access to paths to advancement. In turn I did the Corporate version of washing his socks and minding \u201chis secular house\u201d. He seemed like a good man, always pulling up those behind him. Waging moral fights to ensure fair pay and opportunities for equal treatment and advancement of marginalized groups both within the office and as a social justice warrior without.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t my highest form, I knew I could be far more than someones assistant. That I had the potential for greatness within myself that went far beyond booking flights for/ being the servant of- a supposedly great man. Whose brilliance and ability to achieve, society would claim, made him worth more than me or trumped my own right to make my own mark in this world.\n\nBut I almost consented to it. Reasoning I was taken care of and it might not be so bad to set aside being my fullest self and pursuing my own dreams to stand by and support him in his greatness until he retired in a few years. That it could be fulfilling enough, in its own way. I did like/ believe in him and was genuinely invested in his success. If I stayed with him that length of time it would put me in my 40s making a career change unlikely and difficult for me at that point. Hard to take out major loans for a grad degree at 40 knowing you have a shortened work span to repay them in, KWIM. So resolving to stand by him and follow him for that length of time meant tacitly accepting, quietly assenting to let my own shot in life pass me by- to support his greatest good. Forgoing my own ascent to greatness to support him on his.\n\nHe was an extremely likeable guy with excellent leadership who was a strong advocate and social warrior for many causes I admired. I thought perhaps supporting him and doing his grunt work enough for him to fight these causes would be as good as my fighting them myself in a more primary way. It seemed a symbiotic relationship where we could both take care of each other. \n\nThe day came when he began to act strangely. To believe lies about me in the office and whisper about me unfavorably behind my back- although he knew first hand the truth of who I was and the good I had been to him. When others said ragingly inappropriate things meant to smear me in the office I came to realize he did not object or stand up for me. What would I be doing wasting my life shot for someone who, knowing who I was, would quietly assent to and privately agree with shit talking about me? I also came to see he wasn\u2019t loyal either to any of the women giving their lives to support him in the romantic sector. He had a 10 year girlfriend he laughed to his male colleagues that he would never marry and made a fool of by flirting openly behind her back right there in the office. She was giving her life to support him- packing him up for trips, waiting home alone for him to return, cooking for him. For what???\n\nHad I done the same in the corporate sense I would\u2019ve been the next fool. \n\nIt happens all the time. Woman gives life to serve man- man cheats on or betrays her.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t even a romantic relationship- yet I was betrayed.\n\nA LVM will just see a woman who does this as less, a weak tool for having consented to, willingly bent over to be used. They kick you all the more so, feeling your submissiveness justifies, even *begs* for it.\n\nOn some occasions Id walk in and it was clear they\u2019d been speaking or laughing about me negatively. Both attorneys that I was forgoing my own highest good to serve. I was serving them despite the fact that I almost certainly had the ability to be an attorney myself, and maybe even a better one than them.  Foregoing my own highest good, stepping and fetching for them. Picking up their sandwiches so they could focus, coordinating personal things for their families. Instead of being grateful they were laughing at me disrespectfully when they could, just because they could. *Thats* who deserves my setting aside my own needs and shot in life to serve??? My letting *myself* and my own needs go to support them??? I stepped away.\n\nNow I\u2019m fully pursuing my own career interests. Everything Ive always thought I could be good at or wanted to do. It feels good to be free of any obligation to anyone else. I recognize what folly it is to ever hang your life on a man- even in a non-romantic sense.\n\nLooking back I realize every instance where I\u2019ve thought of forgoing being my own highest self to help or further a man, that man has proven to be unworthy of my sacrifice. I used to think a truly kind, good man doing truly great things in this world might be worthy of that support or sacrifice from a woman. But in every instance where I thought Ive found that, in one way or another he fell short of that or betrayed me. \n\nDoes such a man even exist?? I suspect not. A sacrifice that great is always a liability. In the romantic sense, you\u2019re supporting each other and then one day he wakes up wanting someone 20 years younger, leaves you. What then?\n\nNo man is worthy of the sacrifice. Even ones who start out good may become corrupted and tyrannical by it. Pursue your own highest good for self at all times.\n\nOn another note, I remember walking into his office one day. He was reading a magazine article he\u2019d clipped. It was about how to achieve greatness executives (the implication seemed to be male) must find someone else to do the grunt work for them. Get someone else to wash your socks (it literally said this) and do your lower level basic work maintenance tasks for you like booking flights etc. So that your considerable brain power is freed up for far loftier pursuits and concerns, rather than eaten up by little shit. He sorta hid it when I came in. Lol. But it was obviously something that resonated with him enough to cut out and that he hoped to put into practice. It said a lot about what informs his thinking and I began to think about all the women hes gathered around him both in his personal and professional life and installed in servant positions to enhance his highest good of making money and becoming as prominent and professionally well-known as he can

nvqrwo	neutral	Things I learned about dating app profiles from working with a dating app: So I'm gonna preface this post by saying I can't say which company I work with (it is one of the bigger apps, though) and that I don't work at the company, but as an external collaborator. Having to get to know the product and the types of things being pushed by the company means I've had to do some digging on what does or doesn't work in terms of getting likes and messages. So, here're a few things I learned either directly or from just dealing with this topic on a professional *and* personal level, and if I can help anyone out there improve their profile (when I swipe around myself, I sometimes wish I could just contact these people and help them), then I did my part!\n\n1. **FILL. IN. YOUR. PROFILE -** It's not just a personal pet peeve - you actively self sabotage when you don't do this. Profiles that are properly filled in actually get more likes and messages statistically. Fill in your bio, fill in anything the app you're using lets you fill in. Yes, fill in your height too. You want matches that would actually, you know, *match* you - they're going to notice if you're not who you say you are. This is especially good with new features on the app - they want to test out this new X feature, and if you choose to use it, you will likely be pushed when they test it out over people that didn't try it. This I can't confirm 100%, but from what I gathered is a safe bet, since data I've seen when new features were rolled out strongly suggested these people had more success. It can't hurt! Bonus points, it gives people more to work with if they want to actually talk to you. Make it easy for them to strike up a conversation.\n2. **Pay attention to content -** You want to focus on what you have to offer. Be upfront about what you're like, and don't give a mile long list of what the *other* person should be like. If a dating app profile is like a love life cv, no employer in their right mind would hire you if your whole resume was about what *they* should offer *you* as an employer. **Sell** ***yourself***\\*\\*.\\*\\* No, don't tell them to message you on other apps. It's the same logic as optimizing a website or app so that you don't have to click more than you absolutely have to to get to the main event or product. Optimize how people can contact you. You can use the prompts that most apps have now to show more personality, but the first priority should be something that shows who you are. The line between funny and smartass is a very thin one, so tread it carefully. And no, a grocery list of personality traits and\\\\or tv shows\\\\films\\\\books is not exciting to read. You can be clear without being boring. It also doesn't need to be a whole biography. A few sentences are more than enough.\n3. **Use more pictures -** Yes, it helps. You don't need a million pictures, but 1-2 are not enough.\n4. **But... quality matters -** Artsy\\\\shit-posting pictures are essentially useless to a potential match. Pictures should be **clear and candid**. A professional, posed photoshoot isn't going to really show your vibe, and a selfie isn't going to show you at your best physically (there's actual research on this - other people prefer the way we look in pictures taken by other people). If you must, use a self timer. Actual good quality cameras are best, but phones are pretty impressive these days, so you can probably workshop a useable shot. Bonus points for golden hour\\\\sunrise pictures, which are the most flattering (and some research I found suggested it increases matches). Extreme close ups or really wide shots where you're a tiny little action figure in the distance aren't helping you. A match shouldn't have to zoom in on shitty pixels to see your face or body, nor should you look like some creepy meme edit. And yes, show your actual body in some way. People shouldn't have to guess. **Make it extremely easy for people to see what you look like at a glance.**\n5. **Avoid having other people in your pictures** \\- It's distracting. You are the star of the show. And if you got a match because you included your hot friend in the picture, both you and your match are going to be disappointed in the end anyways. Side note, maybe don't take a picture in a messy or dirty room.\n6. **Use colors\\\\outfits to your advantage -** When people swipe around, they probably see a lot of the same shades of grey, white, blue and black. Wearing color in your pictures, specifically red, will make you stand out when people are swiping. However, men could benefit from wearing a suit, and classic colors work best if that's your outfit. Show some effort and care. **You don't have to be super fit or perfect looking to look put together.**\n7. **Use current pictures -** Maybe that candid your friend took a couple years ago looks great, but if that's not what you look like now, it's not going to go well for either you or your date. If you look like several different people in your profile, that's even more confusing. You can ask a friend or someone you trust if the pictures you chose accurately represent what you look like. It's a good thing to do in general because we perceive ourselves very differently from how other people do, and the same goes for pictures of ourselves. Outside opinions will likely help you choose the best pictures that are both accurate and flattering.\n8. **Smile with your teeth -** It goes without saying, but open genuine expressions will go a long way. People want someone who will make them happy. If you seem happy, at least, that will likely work in your benefit.\n9. **Connect your Instagram if you can -** This actually increases the number of matches you get. Why? I don't know. It's just a data point.\n10. **Do an activity -** It doesn't have to be fitness related, by the way. Show yourself doing something in at least a couple of your pictures. It can also be playing a game, reading or even eating with people (as long as the picture is very clearly focused on you - this goes for any social activity you choose to show). You're not a mannequin - show yourself being a person in the world.\n11. **Use the app regularly** \\- Active profiles get more matches.\n12. **You are good enough -** This is more personal advice, but honestly, you're better off getting less matches with people who would actually be into who you are and what you look like - they are worth way more than matches you got by pretending to be someone you're not, or concealing who you really are in some way. Don't sell yourself short before you even set up the booth at the fair. Give it time. You don't need to be perfect to find love. I'm guilty of being impatient on the apps myself and tiring of them quickly, but sometimes it really is the easiest way to meet someone. Give yourself a solid chance.\n\nGood luck fellow daters! You got this!\n\nEdit: It's cool if none of this is new to you (I sprinkled more specific anecdotes under the big titles, though, but still). It's also okay if your experiences have sucked on these apps so far, though I doubt every person follows this advice too closely considering the experiences shared on this sub regularly (including my own, which prompted me to write it down). You don't need to announce it, you don't look smarter for it. Some things **should** be repeated and closely reexamined, some people are probably new here or new to dating apps. Don't be a dick. \n\nEdit 2: I want to add here that dating apps are just that, apps. If you don't proactively use them even when it's tiring, you will not get results. That's entirely up to you. If they're not your thing, that's totally fine. I hope you find your person somewhere else!
t0wmc7	neutral	Safe spaces for women CANNOT have men! If men are included it ceases to be a safe space for women.: I am so sick of self-proclaimed male \u201cfeminists\u201d invading spaces in real life and online that are specifically for women. The presence of one man (no matter how much they believe they\u2019re \u201cone of the good ones!\u201d) defeats the purpose (even if they stay silent). I think that\u2019s why so many men get enraged by this sub; we make it clear that they are not wanted here and will not be tolerated here and they HATE that. Incidentally it\u2019s one of the reasons I absolutely love this place! If you post anywhere else on Reddit (or online tbh) that even remotely criticizes men (or one man tbh), the topic will inevitably and rapidly be derailed by angry men telling me that \u201caCtUAlLy women are also the problem and here\u2019s why you\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nI have left \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d clubs, groups, etc because I showed up with the expectation that it would be a women\u2019s club but, alas, men had consistently invaded those spaces. One even tried to run for an officer position. All of them thought that being there meant they were suuuper fuckable (obviously they came across as incredible unfuckable, 0/10, and completely insufferable). Like, it\u2019s not enough that they have to trespass, but they also expect to be rewarded for doing so! It\u2019s condescending, infantilizing, and it irritates me to no end. \n\nThe essential appeal of safe spaces for women is that no men are there. We all have a lot to discuss regarding men and frankly, men 100% cannot participate if we\u2019re going to get anything done. Men cannot handle what we have to say about their behavior and I can\u2019t speak freely knowing there\u2019s a chance some annoying and aggressive dude invades my space to mansplain women\u2019s issues to me. Obviously that\u2019s also by design, but I\u2019m so sick of the arrogance, entitlement, and invasion. Leave us alone!\n\nTo any angry lurkers- every single man is a threat to women, yes, even you, so stay away from where you\u2019re not wanted.

Full details here: [https://universityofsussex.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cC5nnBN6MSkAH42](https://universityofsussex.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cC5nnBN6MSkAH42)\n\nMany thanks, and I promise you, you will feel better with every day that goes past. Just focus on yourself and everything will fall into place.\n\nMason x

ob1rn3	hostile sexism	I don't know why I see so much potential here: I've always had the tendency to catch spontaneous ambition, wild ideas that come and go just as fast. I mean right now all I see is frustration and hypocrisy. Another MGTOW, another incel. But if you're ever over in the FDS sub, you'll see a community working to better themselves. They have philosophy and structure, goals, actual strategy. You don't think we could be better? We could always be better. There's a chance to be the 'high value man' that women are looking for, that respectful, considerate gentleman. If you'd read the part of their handbook that describes a HVM, you'd know it was completely rational. Even the idea of vetting men ought to make sense; no denying it, the dating pool of men isn't great overall. But there's a dramatic shortage of humility in FDS, and after a bit of reading, little realistic assessment of what they actually offer in a relationship. Example. \n\nThe highest quality a 'Queen' has is to be controlling. An \"immovable mover\", which is their gentler way of saying it when not literally comparing themselves to God. There is no middle ground, or balance, or shared control. The relationship revolves around what the queen wants. But what's worse is they actually think that controlling women are desirable to most men. It's described as a woman's absolute, most desirable quality. And to be honest, this isn't even a fair example because it places a queen below the bar of average attractiveness. I'll be fair and use an example of a desirable female trait from their handbook that might be right along the lines of average; benevolent, and expressing common courtesy (but being sure to clarify that a queen should prioritize herself in every situation that isn't a mortal emergency). And, lastly, a queen is not crazy. Yes, really. Top of the bell curve right there. \n\nLeafing over the parts about a queen being ambitious and successful, traits that don't matter much to me either way personally, I'd like to get to my point; A queen overestimates her worth, and hence her perceived monopoly on the dating dynamic, and her ability to muscle a HVM into signing the terms and conditions of a 'relationship contract' that prioritizes herself over all. But of course, when a HVM establishes his boundaries and reasonable expectations in contradiction to this biased contract, things will inevitably break off. A HVM isn't roused by the insecure dance of vanity that often follows, or bleak that things ever came to an end. A HVM is empowered by the chance to demonstrate what separates himself from low value men who would sign away their self-respect for their thirst, and would claw and chase desperately when faced with separation. A HVM knows that he can do better, and that he will do better, because he is better, and that gives him just as much leverage as any real HVW has. But first he needs to become a HVM. \n\nI want to start a little project on what makes a HVM. I'm going to start by finding other people to collaborate and discuss this with.

tc04aw	hostile sexism	What's so terrible about men speaking up about men's issues?: Just like most demographic groups, men too have particular issues affecting them. Why is it so controversial for men to speak up about them?\n\nMen make up 40% of domestic abuse victims, but they hardly have any DV shelters to go to\n\nAt least 1 in 6 males has been sexually assaulted, yet their are plenty of male rape jokes on tv/movies for comedic purposes\n\nMen make up 78% of homicide victims, but their deaths are seen as normal, and completely ignored by the media\n\n Men make up 79% of suicide victims, yet there are no government efforts specifically tailored to men's mental health needs\n\n97% of people killed by police are males, yet it's still acceptable to view all men as potential criminals\n\n93% of people who die in the workplace are men, yet society still pressures men to get the highest paying job they can find, even if it may kill them\n\nProstrate cancer kills around the same number of men as breast cancer kills women, yet prostate cancer research gets a fraction of the funding \n\nMen are given a 63% higher sentence (on average) for the exact same crime committed by a woman\n\nBoys are falling behind in schools, yet school curriculum continues to be more tailored for how girls learn better\n\nOnly 40% of college students are men, and only 35% of college students who graduate today are men, yet gender based scholarships/grants only exist for women\n\nViolence against men/boys, especially when committed by women, is shows as comedy in the media, even in children's cartoons\n\nMale genital mutilation is legal for newborn boys, and is defended by ridiculous statements such as 'It looks better, it'll help him get women when he's older' (yes I've heard so many people say this)\n\nMen in the USA still have to register for the selective service, so if WW3 breaks out, they'll be sent to die because of the gender they were born\n\n70% of drug overdoses are men\n\nChild support laws force fatherhood upon men, and many are sent to jail. There are even men who were raped by adult women (when they were teens/boys), and they still have to pay child support once they're an adult\n\nThe family court system/divorce court always favors women\n\nIt's legal for women to put a hole in a condom to baby trap men\n\nIt's socially and legally acceptable to see a man as a potential predator just because of his gender\n\n73% of the homeless population is men, yet most homeless shelters are geared towards families or women, and even the ones that accept men usually only let them stay for a short time \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWomen have plenty of issues they face as well, but they are allowed to discuss them. When they're passionate about it, they're seen as empowered feminist queens. And there's nothing wrong with that, yet when a man is passionate about speaking up for issues men face, he's a bad person, a misogynist, an incel. Why is being a Men's Right's Activist seen as something evil? Granted there are a handful of actual misogynists who claim to be MRA's, but how does that invalidate men's issues? There are many women who claim to be feminists, who use hashtags such as #KAM, or #PegAllMen, and those misandrists don't invalidate women's issues or define all of feminism. There will always be a handful of toxic people in any movement, yet society is always finding a way to invalidate men's issues.

t99oz4	neutral	Brooklyn 99: I\u2019m not sure if any one on FDS has watched this and remember how toxic the relationship between Jake Peralta and Sophia Perez was in season 2. \n\nWhile Amy was still dating Teddy, both Terry and Rosa were heavily encouraging Jake to move on from his crush on Amy. One night at a bar, Terry points out an attractive woman sitting alone having a drink - character Sophia. Jake goes over to her, they hit it off immediately and have great chemistry. He ends up sleeping with her the same night.  \n\nThe next day, Jake and Sophia find themselves in the most awkward situation. In a court room, they realize Jake is a detective for the NYPD and Sophia is a defense lawyer. They bicker and shit on each other\u2019s profession due the conflict of interests. But by the end of the episodes when Sophia wins her case - Terry still eggs Jake on to ask Sophia out again since he felt he was into her and because she was hot. Jake clearly was not going to pursue Sophia without Terry\u2019s interference both times at the bar and after court. Hence, if he really wanted to, he would have done it on his own\u2026 \n\nAnother episode rolls out where Jake and Amy have to go on a work trip; Jake ends up inviting Sophia and Teddy to come along. Only to find out that Amy was actually going to break up with Teddy\u2026 Jake receives a nude text from Sophia right then and says he will be right back - has sex with Sophia before having the audacity to help him make things less awkward for Amy at a dinner that makes Sophia incredibly uncomfortable. She tried her best though and literally called herself a cool girlfriend\u2026 look where that ends.\n\nWhile Teddy was being dumped, he points out that he thinks Amy became confused since Jake had formerly confessed his feelings for her twice before he had met Sophia. Teddy says he thinks Amy likes her back. Jake\u2019s eyes literally lit up when he heard that. Sophia is in shock at the table because she also didn\u2019t know of this info. She walks off to their hotel room. Jake reconciles with her and they keep having sex + dating for only a couple more episodes before they break up inevitably due to their careers and ethics being at odds with each other. (She breaks up with him after their dating interfered with her receiving good cases and he justifiably arrested her boss). \n\nBy the next season, Amy and Jake become a couple. I hear that they are highly compatible and complimented one another well throughout the series, got married, had kids. I find Jake\u2019s character very funny and mostly good at heart despite his immaturity and flaws. However watching the way things panned out with Sophia through an FDS lens disappointed me. I lowkey thought  damn, if it were FDS, she likely would have never wasted her time with Jake\u2026 She would have never slept with him without vetting their compatibility. In a way, I felt like she was used as a place maker for his dream girl - Amy. But then again sometimes things just don\u2019t work out and he was the only one who said I love you to Sophia + she was the one who ended their relationship. I like that she was portrayed as independent from Jake and good natured despite her boss being shitty. \n\nI\u2019m not saying their relationship was low value. I like Jake and think he\u2019s a character with good intentions, but the whole relationship was so messy. \n\nI\u2019m only on Brooklyn 99 season 3 right now so I don\u2019t have commentary with full context or the entire series yet. So far, I love the show for it\u2019s humor and I think Sergeant Terry Jeffords seems like the most high value male character in it considering how much he talks about being faithful to his wife and daughters. Amy Santiago, Rosa Diaz, and Gina Linetti are all unique, charming, driven female characters. Do other FDS watch Brooklyn 99, how do you feel about the show? \n\nMy favorite feminist moment so far was when Santiago told Amy that she\u2019s not the only girl at the table any more and they have got to have each other\u2019s back as women in a male dominated field.

I like using that relationship to tell funny stories of my ex and how stupid he was to warn other women of certain behaviors but also just because I love telling stories in general and pulling personal anecdotes. There are also some good times with his family and good memories that have shaped who I am now. I also appreciated my ex answering questions I had about his ex \u2014 as it helped me know about him and also helped me piece together certain behaviors of his later on (gave me a lot of clarity)\n\nI tell my current friends horror stories and just regular ones of my ex-friends... could I do the same in my next relationship? I wonder? Or do I just pretend he never existed? \n\nI can't remember if the handbook mentioned to never *ever* mention your exes, but I'm curious if anyone here who are/have been in LTR and have spoken about each others exes and it went okay and not used as a weapon against you. How did it go? And do you use it as a vetting tool? If so, how?
t6o1ps	hostile sexism	I’m an influencer on tiktok. One of my mutuals are getting canceled for cheating, but they’re calling it rape.: So I honestly don’t know what to say. This guy allegedly cheated even though they weren’t exclusive, and the claim is that she wouldn’t have slept with him if she had known that he was messing with other women. She made a post stating that her consent was stolen from her, and did nothing to stop thousands of her followers from brigading his post where he was defending himself because people were equating what he was doing to be a sex offender. The narrative is that if you lie to or deceive someone and have sex with them, that you are committing sexual assault via coercion and even rape. The problem is that this logic is not fundamentally, legally or clinically supported in any way. They continue to bring up “informed consent”. If I pad my bra, or tweak my personality or lie about my political beliefs to have sex with a man, why would this not be considered sexual assault as well? I feel like we’re going off the deep end.

szd5gz	neutral	Vetting: if a worst case scenario happens to you, can you rely on him?: Vetting is crucial and one of the most important things to do, especially as you are getting more serious with him, is to think of the worst case scenarios. Think about what would happen if you got very sick, if you were seriously injured, or even if you lost your job spontaneously of no fault of your own? These are situations that would leave you vulnerable and needing help. \n\nAsk yourself would he be there for you? Would he help take care of you?\n\nLook for the early small signs as a vetting tool you can do sooner rather than later. Let him know you aren't feeling good. Ask him if he can make you soup or maybe you need something from the store (like your go to brand of cough syrup) see how he responds. Is he willing to help? Does he do these things with love and care? Does he make sure to pick up the correct item? Or is he playing dumb, complaining, half assing, or refuses to be around you? Does he still whine and try to get sex even though you really don't feel good? \n\nIf you have a family member that's sick or just passed away and share this with him how does be react? Is he caring and does he listen and comfort you? Or is he cold, dismissive, and distant. \n\nAnother one is just having a bad day, the type of day where you just come home and cry. Is he Supportive and loving or nasty and indifferent?\n\nThere's some pickme-esque posts online saying that \"it's okay to not love someone and dump them at their worst. They didn't deserve you because you were a mess\" and this isn't the case. When you are further along with someone and they genuinely love you - they'll love you in your sickness, they'll love you when you're grieving because you're loosing a family member, they'll still love you if you're having a bad day and had a panic attack. You do have to advocate for yourself and be a hv woman, get therapy or whatever resources you can, but we all have some bad days and challenges. You will work through it as a hv woman and a hvm will also fully step up and be there for you. \n\nThink about it, if he can't step up for the one bad day or if you have a cold then he won't be there if you get cancer or had a serious injury ... even if you are having his kids... you don't want a man that won't lift a finger, only wants sex, and that won't even help you when you're sick and in pain in a hospital bed! You don't want to have to run home to your own parents because a scrote won't step up in dire times.

I\u2019m also sorry I don\u2019t know what better community to turn for comfort. Just emotionally overwhelmed. There was a girl who I\u2019ve been sorta distant friends with the past 5 or so years. She was 21 and I was 17 when we first met. My rapist and her bf were 22 or so. She found out I was a minor and expressed disapproval to her bf over it. It drove us apart since both our boyfriends didn\u2019t want us talking\u2026 she never took action beyond that to help me though. Maybe I\u2019m being ridiculous for wishing that as the adult friend at the time, I wish she had done more to help me. I never blame the abuse on her though. \n\nI truly cared about her a lot because we\u2019ve been through the same traumas; having been through rape and abuse from men. I met her through my ex rapist\u2026 her boyfriend is best friends with him. He still is\u2026 after all of these years. &amp; she never broke up with him over it\u2026 knowing our mutual history, I guess I expected a different outcome once my rapist and I broke up + she found out? Because personally I could never date a man who knowingly is \u201cbros\u201d with a rapist. I didn\u2019t hold it against her though. \n\nUntil one day she replied to one of my FDS stories on Instagram that I made about internalized misogyny and pick-me shit. She asked me how do I know the girl I described is a pick me? What if she is just further healed than you are?  It was referencing a situation I brought up about how a fuckboy tried to play me, but I wouldn\u2019t let him sleep with me. Then he ultimately ended up with a pick me girl who always says she can\u2019t be friends with women because we\u2019re too dramatic, LMAO . \n\nI just felt like from the way she framed her question, she was kind of against me or coming at me for no reason? So I told her I shouldn\u2019t have expected her to be on my side since she never stood up for me to my ex. She cursed me out after, saying she fights tooth and nail for me\u2026 I explained that I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know she stood up for me because how am I supposed to know if she\u2019s never mentioned it/we barely talk/the fact she and her bf are still associated with my rapist\u2026 I felt like it was justified why I felt unsupported. \n\nBut she ended up making me feel super bad about saying she didn\u2019t speak up for me because apparently she did. I hope you ladies on FDS understand why I didn\u2019t assume she would considering how close in proximity she still is with my former rapist. Any how, I apologized for falsely thinking she didn\u2019t care for me? \n\nAnother time she messaged me to yell at me for contacting my rapist without letting her know I told him her and I were talking (because I guess I caused conflict and tension in her friend group? I don\u2019t know.) I actually did not reach out at all to him. She just assumed I did because my rapist started acting super weird (rapist started talking about what happened with me, tried to get sympathy) then her bf and her started fighting. \n\nApparently her bf is still his bestfriend because he wants to \u201cprevent him from raping another girl.\u201d But I let that go because I knew she\u2019s been with her bf for years and at least she said she isn\u2019t directly friends with my rapist. She said sorry for assuming wrong just because everyone around her was behaving so strange. But honestly looking back, why the fuck did I put up with that??\n\nThird time today, she decided to message me to tell me that she has to unfollow me and say goodbye since the convo we had where I said she didn\u2019t stand up for me took a toll on her mental health/she became suicidal. (Haha I felt suicidal too from reliving the trauma in that convo and feeling gaslit for feeling unprotected). She said it made her feel like all the times she spoke up for me was for no reason\u2026 I already had said I\u2019m sorry and acknowledged her efforts that I wasn\u2019t aware of before\u2026 I thought that misunderstanding was cleared up. As well as the time she accused me of talking to my rapist about our friendship without notifying her. \n\nShe said my actions have triggered her  very much. That her bf and her keep fighting and now she\u2019s contemplating breaking up with him since he\u2019s still associated with a rapist. Also mentioned she is uncomfortable when I post anti sex industry stories on Instagram because it triggers her trauma from sex work, which I really do empathize with. I\u2019m never insulting sex workers, I do insult the industry and exploitation from depraved men though. I would have hidden my story from her if I knew it negatively impacted her that much to read about. I feel quite terrible about that. \n\nShe basically abandoned me as a friend. Because I guess I was so wrong that first time for thinking she wasn\u2019t really on my side? Claimed what I said was impulsive and cruel. I guess she doesn\u2019t remember the time she attacked me for doing absolutely nothing. I guess she couldn\u2019t understand why I was defensive the first time we had a dispute. Hahahaha. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crazy for feeling slightly gaslit. I feel pathetic for looking past all the times she made me feel like shit. The fact that I didn\u2019t cut her off first makes me feel like a dumbass. The way this deepened the wound\u2026 I guess sunken cost fallacy happens in friendships too. \n\nI thought I meant more to her than this. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t had a friendship breakup in awhile so I probably sound ridiculously sad. Half of me keeps blaming myself even when I know I had justifications for my own actions and apologized for my missteps.
t0kqia	neutral	Straight men: want to know how women feel being made to feel unsafe and overly-sexualized by men? Imagine if a man did it to you.: A man who was much larger than you. At least a few inches taller and 50lbs heavier. Maybe he follows you around, stares at you, or tells you dirty things. Maybe he asks you out over and over again or suggests that you only got your job because you gave your boss a blowjob. How comfortable would you feel? You can't compare it to as if women were doing the same thing to you because you're imagining a scenario where you'd like that attention. Women don't like it, so imagine a big, hairy, sweaty, older man who is much larger and could easily hurt you at will doing it to you. Imagine how you'd feel then. That's how women are made to feel. So when you're dating, please be empathetic and kind and understanding as to why some women have such strong boundaries. Little things like not giving you her phone number or wanting to wait a few extra dates to go over to your place may not seem like much to you, but it could be to her. Try to be understanding and put yourself in her shoes and not make her feel pressured to lower her guard earlier than she's comfortable with. I promise you, most women find nothing sexier than a confident, secure man who respects their boundaries. Edit: I typed this quickly and realize I should have said men or men who date women and not straight men. Apologies!

Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.\n\nWould a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?\n\nWould a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?\n\nWould a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?\n\nBe a catalyst for things occurring.

tarqbm	neutral	Baby, you are not paid less.: Per job and per credentials you are paid exactly  the same and among the age group of 20-30 you are paid more. The \"gap\"  is not a difference between two people doing the same and paid  differently, but what you get when all the income of all women taken  together is compared to all the income of all men taken together, and  this gap is formed by the fact that in low-pay jobs, there are more  women than men (both paid the same), and in high-pay jobs more men than  women (both paid the same), making the total earned by women nationally  lower relative to total earned nationally by men. Imagine 100 men and 100 women facing a pile of feathers and a pile of rocks and being asked to choose what each wants to carry and stand accordingly in line in front of the relevant pile, imagine each man and woman in the feathers line receiving a feather of one uniform weight and each in the rocks line given a rock weighing exactly the same for all, imagine them being asked to divide by sex and stand on a scale, 100 women on one side of a scale and 100 men on the other, 10 of the women holding rocks and 90 holding feathers, while 10 of the men are holding feathers and 90 holding rocks. The scales will tilt to the male side without anyone discriminating women - all women in the rocks line received a rock the same size as any man and men in the feathers line received feathers identical to what women received, the entire difference coming from the choices about in which line to stand.   \n\n\nWhy are  there more women in low-pay jobs (feathers line) and more men in high pay (rocks line)? Because of  women's free choices to study areas that don't lead to high pay and  their choice to devote less hours to working, that's it. What are men  expected to do about it? Force women to work in things they don't want?  Imprison them in offices to get more hours out of them? Tell us, please,  how are men accountable for women's free choices, and what exactly are  men expected to do that you blame them for this? Men are not responsible  for women's free choices to study things that are less lucrative or  their choice to work less hours.   \n\n\n\"It's the husband's fault that  the wife works less hours because he's not spending enough time with  the children\" is not a valid argument in the US at this point. Mind you, as of 2016 the majority of  births in the US are by single women, and when those single mothers are  added to 50% divorce rates, the idea that husbands are to blame for women's choice to stand in the feathers line vaporizes - the overwhelming majority of mothers in the US  don't have any man as a husband to influence any choice they make (and blame for their choices)  -  they make their own choices. \n\nPlus, most child support, over 90% I think, is paid by men to women, so even the overall sexes-difference on those scales is not exactly what they say it is, many of the women have another income, from  an ex, and when this is added, who knows what the \"gap\" is. Not to  mention that in married couples, the husband's income is not \"his\" but is his wife's as well - part of her own private resources, so this \"overall  gap\" is far from being the number cited, and might be even reversed - I  saw once a feminist website for promoting advertising for women that  argues that in the US women hold 60% of wealth. \n\nSome people simply have an urge for superiority, and they make excuses  for their urge by trying to present their urge as if there are reasons that justify superiority. Someone who likes equality would reject a situation where one sex mostly chooses to carry feathers and rely on the other sex's willingness to carry rocks under the shouts of a group of the feathers carriers and their attempts to distort data to make it seem \"justified\" to batter, humiliate and discriminate the rock-carrying sex for bearing more weight.

tbuhm4	neutral	Why I fundamentally oppose the male right to a paper abortion: As I thought back to my past, I remember how discussion around the male right to a paper abortion was the deciding factor that finally pushed me into the MRM.\u00a0\n\nI remember how whenever I brought up the subject of the female sexual abuse of boys and men and how men need more sexual protection in the law to address this, the common feminist response was to promote the male right to a paper abortion. They often reacted with confusion at my opposition to the male right to a paper abortion and frequently misinterpreted that as opposition the female right to a physical abortion too.\u00a0\n\nThis insistence on equating opposition to the male right to a paper abortion with opposition to the female right to a physical abortion frequently got me banned from online feminist forums.\n\nWhile many MRA's favour a male right to a paper abortion too, at least MRA forums do allow open discussion and disagreement on that subject, something feminist forums tend to disallow.\n\nIn discussions with other MRAs who oppose the male right to a paper abortion, I learnt that I'm not the only one who recoils with terror at the potential repercussions of granting men such a right.\n\nFirstly, I reject the false premise that a woman has a right to a physical abortion because it's her body. I defend a woman's freedom to obtain an abortion on legitimate medical grounds:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/12/el-salvador-abortion-laws-on-trial-in-case-of-woman-jailed-after-miscarriage\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/polish-activists-protest-after-first-death-in-wake-of-stricter-abortion-law\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59214544\n\n\nWhile this might make me resemble a feminist pro-choice advocate (since we both support decriminalizing abortion) at least superficially, the fundamental philosophies underlying our reasons for favouring the female right to a physical abortion affect our respective perceptions of the male right to a paper abortion. I presume that the feminist argument goes something as follows:\n\nSince the foetus is a part of the woman's body, she ought to be free to do with it as she pleases; and since it's a part of a woman's body, what does the father have to do with it? Therefore, just as the mother should have a right to a physical abortion, the father should have a right to a paper abortion too.\n\nSince I accept that human life and rights start at conception, I therefore believe that a father's parental obligations stem not from consent to the sexual act that led to the conception, but rather from his biological paternity alone.\n\nFollowing this argument to its logical conclusion, even if an underage boy impregnates the adult woman who sexually assaulted him, was later convicted, and delivers the child in her prison cell, he still enjoys his paternal obligations by virtue of his biological paternity.\n\nThis is a separate matter from the question of financial and psychiatric services that the state should provide him or whether he should be allowed to give the child up for adoption.\n\nWe get from that that a man should enjoy full paternal obligations by default and, as long as he is not convicted of raping the mother, molesting the child, committing criminal negligence in allowing someone else to molest the child, or some equivalent crime, he ought to enjoy his paternal rights by default too.\n\nGranting men the right to a paper abortion creates a dangerous precedent to strip fathers of their parental rights and obligations by default.\n\nMany feminists presume that a man would not want to accept his obligations towards a child conceived through sexual assault. In fact, a male victim of sexual assault might still feel an attachment to the child by virtue of his biological paternity and, if necessary, might even accept shared custody with the woman who sexually assaulted him should he fail to obtain a sexual-assault conviction against her.\n\nI believe that the feminist insistence on promoting the male right to a paper abortion stems from an oversimplistic rationalization that confuses sameness for equality.\n\nAdd to that that at least my anecdotal observations suggest that the vast majority of women who sexually assault boys and men do so for their sexual gratification with no intention of delivering any child conceived during such a sexual assault.\n\nWith the above in mind, granting a man the right to a paper abortion would do little to deter the female sexual abuse of boys and men in the vast majority of cases. Worse yet, it could embolden more men to rape women with the idea that rape is difficult to prove and that he can easily walk away from responsibility just by obtaining a paper abortion. Granting men the right to a paper abortion risks increasing the rate of male rape of women while doing little to reduce the rate of female sexual assaults of men.\n\nIf we acknowledge the fundamental physiological, psychological, cultural, and other differences between men and women, then we cannot address the female sexual abuse of boys and men simply by granting men the same rights as we do women. Sameness without recognizing legitimate differences will never achieve equality between the sexes.\u00a0\n\nIf we truly want equality, then we must grant men and women different but equal sexual rights in recognition of the legitimate physiological, psychological, and cultural differences between them.\n\nRecognizing that a man's reproductive rights end and parental obligations start at conception and that granting a man the right to a paper abortion risks causing much more harm than good, we must then find the solution in granting men not the right to a paper abortion, but rather more pre-conception sexual rights.\u00a0\n\nAlso, since a male is acutely aware that his reproductive rights end and obligations start at conception, a man will likely be far more willing to forfeit excessive sexual freedoms in exchange for more reasonable sexual protection under the law, to more effectively deter female sexual assault before it happens, than many women could understand.\n\nThat's why I believe that the best way to evolve male sexual rights to a more equal footing with female sexual rights is not to just blindly extend female sexual rights to men in the name of sameness, but to grant different sexual rights to men and women to achieve true equality.\n\nOne way to do this could be a Right-to-Self-Exclusion Act that could allow a man to self-exclude from excessive sexual freedom under the law in favour of more adequate sexual protection under the law.\n\nAlso, if we argue that a woman should have a right to a physical abortion not because it's her body, but rather for legitimate medical concerns, and we accept that human life starts and conception and that no one should enjoy an absolute right to sex on demand, then it is reasonable to curb excessive pre-conception sexual freedoms to more effectively deter unplanned pregnancies resulting from rape or sexual assault in the first place.

sv264f	hostile sexism	For this March 8, let's collect evidence of the damage done by feminism: March 8 is approaching, a day in which feminists celebrate their “accomplishments” and also “raise awareness of women's issues”, and by these I mean spreading lies and twisted narratives of both victim-hood and misandry. **Can we collaboratively elaborate a list of damages done by feminism so we can remind people of them in this date?** I suggest including properly referenced examples of: * Anecdotes of former feminists that have been harassed by other feminists for bringing awareness to men's issues, for example:   * The harassment and death threats received by Erin Pizzey when she suggested men should also receive help and shelter from abusive partners.   * The feminist backlash and demonetization against Cassie Jaye, backed by the media, because of not demonizing men's rights movements as she was expected to do by feminist organizations that funded her. * Evidence of feminist backlash against initiatives that don't solely focus on the feminist narrative as dictated from their patriarchy premise, for example:   * The Spanish civil guard [received a huge online backlash for tweeting an image suggesting that men can also be victims of violence](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/04/02/551cfc84268e3e5a0a8b456b.html), also [people demanded they remove the tweet and suceeded](https://www.publico.es/politica/psoe-exigira-guardia-civil-explique.html). * Anecdotes that evidence the double standards imposed by the “feminist approach” in criminal cases, for example:   * The double standard in the treatment of female criminals, evidenced in the official statistics.   * Evidence of false accusations weaponized against men, [like the still ongoing epidemic of false accusations in Spain](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/p01ir2/the_epidemic_of_false_accusations_in_spain/). * Authorities that spread misandry without consequence, for example:   * Feminists that have actually called to #killallmen, and have faced no consequence. * Authorities that purposely ignore men's issues despite having evidence shown on their face.   * Some of these are seen in MRA documentaries. **I'll be periodically updating this post and sorting the evidence provided, I also need more ideas to expand the previous list.** The purpose here is to concentrate the information that people need to see in a date when feminists lie the most. This can enable people to elaborate media to spread this information in other platforms.

I decided to check her other social medias and I couldn\u2019t find anyone by that name, so I checked her sibling\u2019s and friends social medias to see if they followed anyone by that name to see if it was a mutual friend since they pretty much the same know the same people and I found only one friend followed someone by that name. I find it strange because she\u2019s told me every guy she talks to at the moment and she really doesn\u2019t have guy friends (at least to my knowledge) and she\u2019s never mentioned him. There also wouldn\u2019t be any reason for anyone texting her since she has a break from both school and work. What can it mean?
tc1xcs	neutral	Reminder to also vet your female roommates!: I'm in an argument with my roommate right now because she wants to invite a man she went on a first date with last night to stay over this evening.\n\nShe met this man less than 24 hours ago. I don't want him in my space, to have access to me while I sleep, to be near my pet, to have access to my things. I think that's reasonable.  I told her I don't feel comfortable with it, she's saying she has a right to have guests over at the apartment. Which is true, but this man is essentially a stranger. \n\nWhen you live with someone, you're giving them the opportunity to compromise your comfort and security. Make sure it's someone whose values align with yours. Roommates who bring strange men over put your safety at risk. Make sure you vet your roommates, and consider establishing ground rules about dating before they move in!

spr0wd	neutral	Hypocrite in the name of "Gender equality": This was when I was 11 years old, in school(5th grade)(this was 2017). We had this thing called UOI(Units of inquiry) where each year a topic would be picked, and we would create awareness about it. That years unit was "Gender equality". &amp;#x200B; So basically, while we were in the process of creating the presentations(this isnt the part I want to focus upon). &amp;#x200B; There was this girl who had this grudge against me, so on my birthday, she created fake news to somehow "get revenge" even though there was no prior action from my side, she created fake news about me hitting(physically) her, it was complete fake and my friends knew it was fake. &amp;#x200B; She told the teacher that "{My name here} hit me all over my body", and she faked crying. When everyone was eating lunch, the teacher came to me and say "Why did you hit {girls name here}?" I said "I dont know what you are talking about" Then the girl(who was standing beside the teacher) said "OH really, we are doing gender equality as a subject, have some respect against girls" and she tried every possible way to make me look as a misogynist student abuser. &amp;#x200B; The conversation looked like this: Me: teachers, this is completely fake, you can ask my friends they were with me the whole time Teacher: Obviously your friends will testify against you Teacher: You will be expelled(suspended) for this, and you will be kicked out of the school Luckily, A girl was in my friend group and she testified "teacher, this is completely fake he did not hit anyone I was with him the whole time" &amp;#x200B; And then the teacher looked at the girl who complained: Teacher: Is this complain fake? Girl: Ma'am I was just trying to get awareness on violence issues Teacher: Okay, understandable &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; THE GIRL WHO COMPLAINED DID NOT FACE ANY PUNISHMENT, SHE GOT AWAY WITH RUINING MY REPUTATION AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE SCHOOL IF I FAILED TO PROVE I DIDNT HIT HER.

Men without fathers I've heard tend to become violent more often. I have heard that men without mothers dont develop empathy skills, more often become sociopathic. As someone who grew up with a negligent mother who left our family in my later teenage years, I personally care far less for empathy or other peoples feelings, signifiacntly more so than my father.

t8ot5r	interpersonal sexism	Women who hug: I met a woman the other day (it does happen). Someone I didn't know; someone I'm likely to be working with a lot in the next few weeks. I should preface my remarks with the fact that I hold this woman in very high regard; she's very skilled at her job and I was the decision-maker in hiring her. She's delightful company professionally; I barely know her personally. She's also conventionally very attractive and a good fifteen years my junior.\n\nThe first thing she did, on our first meeting after the interview, was approach me for a hug. I instinctively recoiled, and a look of some confusion and offence crossed her face. It was awkward. I hated doing it. But \"I don't do hugs,\" I explained. \"Not in this me-too world.\"\n\nShe literally gaped at me in absolute astonishment.\n\nNaturally, since this particular woman is, as far as I know, a completely reasonable and sane individual, her reaction was to start explaining that I was overreacting and she has *no* intention of taking any action against me, and it's probably true. The harder-line feminists of the world would probably lecture me on the idea that if I don't give her any reason to object then I won't suffer the consequences, but as I say, I don't know this woman personally. I don't know how easy she is to irritate. I don't know how angry she gets, how quickly, and [it is a material fact that women are more likely to exhibit negative emotion than men](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sexual-personalities/201504/are-women-more-emotional-men).\n\nBut even if we assume they're right and it's rare - and it probably is - the problem with is, as we're all painfully aware, it's a huge risk to take. In many modern western countries, any woman has the arbitrary power to have any man arrested, publicly pilloried as a sex pest and permanently deny him a social life and a career, even if the case never goes to trial ([and sometimes they do](https://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-02-16/commuter-cleared-of-ludicrous-sex-assault-warns-the-same-could-happen-to-any-man); that example is rare only in that the guy was exonerated and received a lot of publicity).\n\nHonestly, refusing this woman a hug was probably pointless in any case. If she even *claimed* I'd touched her in a way she didn't like, I'd be instantly arrested, even if I actually hadn't; I feel like I'm giving myself the best possible chance, but I have no real confidence in that.\n\nStill, this is where we now are. This is the world in which we have to exist. This is what a minority of feminist activists wanted, and they got it. So, woman-I-just-hired, I apologise for what happened on Saturday, but it's because of the fact that every woman I meet is effectively a ticking time bomb capable of destroying your life.

t77kfl	internalized sexism	Why we need to de-center men from our life (yes, even in dating) - It gives you the power to walk away.: I found some ladies questioning about why FDS advises to de-center men from our life considering this is a dating strategy sub - it sounds like we are advising people to stay single FGTOW-style. A fair question if you have not yet fully understand FDS-style dating approach.\n\nConsider this: imagine yourself going up to your employer trying to negotiate a higher salary, but as women we all know our tendency to low-ball ourselves and get anxious about having no bargaining power.\n\nWomen carry that belief of having no bargaining power into all aspects of our lives - including dating. *Except we do have the ultimate bargaining power.*\n\nBut you only realize that fact when you successfully de-center men from your lives.\n\n**When you de-center men from your lives, you aren't afraid to walk away.** ***That's*** **your ultimate bargaining power.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLadies, remember that man chase and women choose,\n\n**and being the chooser means that you are always ready to walk away when you deem the situation is not to your favor.**\n\nYou see no reason to continue spending time with him - regardless of it being the first date or a 5 years relationship.\n\nYou are far more resistant to the sunk-cost fallacy and you don't make judgement based on what you've *sacrificed* for the relationship - you dislike how he make you feel, so you end it. Simple as that.\n\n\"You have to work on this, you can't give up too early!\" is reserved for goals and ambitions that you *know* is good for you in the end - *not* for a man knowingly and purposely hurting you. We ain't a human punching bag here ladies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDe-centering men in your life puts you in the position of a judging observer - it gives you the clarity to see men for who they are. You aren't as vulnerable to mind games and manipulation attempts - even when you don't understand what's happening. But you can *feel* that it is all so bizarre and you don't like it.\n\nDe-centering men means you aggressively push back on the female socialization we have been deeply brainwashed with since the day we are born - the belief that \"being chosen\" by a man is the single most important thing in our life, everything else be damned.\n\nDe-centering men means you instead prioritize *yourself* and put your desire, needs, goals, happiness and dreams above everything else. And relationship with a HVM becomes something like owning a luxury car - you dream of him sometimes, think that it would be nice to find a ideal HVM that enrich your life and fill you with happiness, you daydream here and there - but if you never find him? Oh well no loss here, you are already happy and fulfilled by yourself.\n\n**De-centering is totally detaching yourself from being burdened by men's foolishness. They no longer actively occupying your mind - they sort of becoming a background noise.**\n\nYou literally don't care. Ideally LVMs and NVMs don't even register in your radar and you only take action when you or other women are endangered by those people. Whatever tactics they use to get a rise out you, it easily roll over your shoulder. You understand that shitty people are shitty, and whatever drama they try to pull you in, you calmly avoid it and go on with your life.\n\nDe-centering men means you remove them and their issues from your life, and only allow quality men to get your attention and be considered as a potential suitor. *You literally embody the definition of \"Giving ZERO f\\*\\*ks\".*\n\nAnd ideally when you are dating a man, whenever he starts to pull any of the scrotes tactic - you don't get confused and start thinking \"What is he doing? Why is he doing this? What does this means?\"\n\n**You simply raised an eyebrow because he is acting \"weird\". And immediately cut the date short. Like a queen dismissing her rude minister.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"But does that mean I cannot allow myself to be fully in love with my partner? That sounds awful.\"**\n\nIt does if you keep thinking that in order to be x, you can never ever everrr be y - everything is black or white, one extreme to another, nothing in between at all.\n\nThink of the opposite - does falling in love means you completely strip away your self-respect, personality, your own desire, goals, life, friends, family? (which a lot of women do unfortunately) - No right? Because you are human, you have complexities, layers, nuances - having one thing does NOT mean you have to completely abandon all the other things.\n\n*You can be a woman who de-center men from her life but trust her partner will all her heart and be completely in love with him.*\n\nIt's called being selective with whom you give access to your heart.\n\nBut if shit happens and you found out that you are being disrespected - you have no problem leaving everything behind and start afresh. You feel the pain of betrayal, yes, heart's broken and all that - *but at the same time you are methodically planning your departure.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"I know that this is good for me, but it seems so...** ***selfish***...\"\n\n[Being selfish isn't bad - it is smart.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/svy6hx/learn_to_be_selfish/)\n\nA lot of times women are afraid to try things that are a little more selfish and self-serving because we are brainwashed to believe that we suddenly become the evilest evil to ever evil in the history of evils if we start prioritizing ourselves. It is all a lie - a patriarchal propaganda.\n\nMen live all their life prioritizing themselves and never feel guilty about it - so why can't you?\n\nYou *aren't* born a monster narcissist psychopath that will burn the country down once you taste a little power, relax. Deep down you *know* who you are - prioritizing yourself won't suddenly turn you into a heartless monster. You are fully in-tune with your empathy - trust yourself a little more will you?\n\nDon't knock it until you've tried it. Have faith in yourself.\n\nBe free and stay safe ladies.

I\u2019ll delete this if it\u2019s inappropriate. \n\nTwo years ago I was sexually assaulted by my LVX, and I was in such a messed up place mentally, and so delusional that I blamed myself for it, and even comforted him after he was upset that he pushed me to do things I didn\u2019t want to do (I know \ud83e\udd22).\n\nI have come a long way since then (especially thanks to FDS), and I have learned to stand up for myself, enforce my boundaries, and reject men without any sympathy when they show the tiniest red flag. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t see myself ever fully trusting any man again, and I also feel repulsed by the thought of getting physical with anyone. \n\nTo the ladies who have unfortunately experienced the same, how did you learn to ever trust, and feel comfortable being physically vulnerable with someone again? \n\nNote: I cannot speak about this to anyone I know IRL for a multitude of reasons, including any therapists.

tcf2ie	institutional sexism	Enough with this lie about the right to vote.: \n\nFirst, WOMEN HAD THE RIGHT TO  VOTE SINCE THE 18TH CENTURY. True - the right depended on wealth and  there were much fewer women who met the criterion than men, BUT WOMEN  WERE NOT CATEGORICALLY DENIED VOTING DUE TO THEIR SEX. Almost no one -  man or woman - had the vote in the 18th and 19th centuries. Secondly,  the ones who wanted everyone, men and women alike, to have a vote, were  THE HUMANISTS, NOT THE FEMINISTS. When the vote was given to 8 million  women in England it was also given to FIVE MILLION MEN for the first  time - all those men and women did not have the vote and the reason was  that at the time, voting was tied to going to war. Regardless of what  you think of this link today, WOMEN WERE NOT DENIED THE VOTE BECAUSE OF  SOME CHAUVINISM but were part of an entire civilization in which voting  was perceived as being sent to the front and nor women or men wanted  women to be sent to war. Again - from your modern perspective this  vote-war link may sound absurd, but for those people living in the end  of the 19th century, the vote and being sent to the front were perceived  **as lightening and thunder**,  they could not perceive them as separated, yes, what can we do, this is  the evolution of the human mind, and 150 years ago the human mind could  not cognitively perceive a vote as separated from going to war, and  THIS is why women did not want to vote. It was HUMANISTS of both sexes,  NOT FEMINISTS, who after World War I, innovated and demanded to separate  between serving at the front and having the right to vote, and so,  millions of MEN AND WOMEN, who BOTH did not have the vote, received it  for the first time. Women should thank **universal humanism**, not feminism, for the right to vote, as should men as well. **Feminism is taking credit for something it had no part in**.  In fact while humanists (of both sexes, that is people who do not see  women as separated from men and as requiring an independent movement for  \"women's rights\" but see all as one humanity, all acting for same  rights for all) demanded the vote for all, FEMINISTS IN THE US WANTED  WHITE WOMEN ONLY TO HAVE THE VOTE, and in fact submitted plans to the  president offering to **extinct** the black minority through birth control. STOP WITH THIS REWRITING OF HISTORY! THIS IS PURE INCITEMENT AND GOEBBELSIAN LIES!\n\n1
t4ovpc	neutral	In response to a researcher wanting to study incels: \n\nA researcher approached the sub wanting to study incels. u/goodmod suggested I post some of my responses here. I thought that was a good idea, and would give everyone some idea of what the mods get up to.\n\nThe researcher wanted to study self-identified incels. I don't like that because self-identity *is* a political or ideological choice. And the choice to study self identified incels, rather than say, men who haven't had sex in the last X years, is a political/ideological choice. \n\nOnly creating data about one political group is political/ideological because there is no context for the data.  If a researcher chooses to study, say, self-identified Liberals eating habits, the results will not be very meaningful. Studying everyone's eating habits and getting data about political self-identification allows more meaningful data.\n\nThe researcher pointed out the academics are happy to use self-identification of white or Hispanic people for research. \n\nHowever, there is a significant difference between people who recognise that they are white, and people who choose to identify as white. A survey of people who strongly identify as white is not going to be representative of white people.\n\nI also pointed out that there is not much research on involuntary celibates, and a lot of interest in incels. So there is a bias in the research base. And as there are no clear definitions, it's likely that research on self-identifying incels is going to be misunderstood to apply to involuntary celibates. \n\nThe definition of 'involuntary celibate' should be someone who wants sex and can't get it, rather than someone who feels entitled to sex.\n\nI also said that 'incels' are a weird new internet subculture so it draws more research. It also attracts ideologically motivated researchers who want to support preconceived ideas about men's sexual entitlement and misogyny.\n\nAdditionally, I think the focus on incels, comes from a bias regarding men's sexuality. It is difficult to talk about men's appetite for sex and how they have to deal with sexual rejection even in relationships.\n\nBettina Ardnt ([https://www.bettinaarndt.com.au/](https://www.bettinaarndt.com.au/)) used to be a sex-therapist in Australia and tells a story of a event she was speaking at. One of the things she found in her work was that men often wish they had more sex in their marriages, and the constant sexual rejection takes a very heavy toll. One of the men in the crowd starting weeping as she was talking about this. Obviously hitting very close to home. After that talk, the man's wife came up to Bettina and told her it was the first time she had seen her husband cry.\n\nOne thread here, I suggested that involuntary celibates have a kind of 'rejection trauma' and a one respondent said the term fitted his experience very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's about it.

t4og7c	neutral	Family annihilators and how to spot one quickly when dating. Long-ish post. TW [murder, suicide]: I recently came across an article in the news sub stating that an estranged ex-husband just killed his 3 daughters inside a church. He killed 2 others who aren't identified yet. He then took his own life. The mother wasn't present.\n\nThis is painful in many ways. 3 beautiful girls are gone, the mother is probably in the deepest pits of depression and mourning (jfc I can't even imagine and frankly don't want to), the murderer will never see true justice through the hands of the law, and it's another reminder that cops are not here to protect you, really. I don't want to get political in the comments because this post isn't about that so, please, just save it.\n\nFirst, know the difference between a **protective order** and a **restraining order**. I'm doing my own research for the state I live in. If FDS has any divorce lawyers, please share any knowledge about this in the comments.\n\nYou can also lookup:\n\n* **domestic violence protection orders**\n* **no-contact orders**\n* **civil antiharassment protection orders**\n\nNow, family annihilators (FA). The first name you may think of is Chris Watts.\n\nFor a long time, I never knew that there was a term for these types of people. Both men and women can be FA but largely and overwhelmingly, it's the former.\n\nI [found this article by Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/family-killers) VERY helpful. [This thesis done on the subject](https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=honorscollege_cj) done in May 2020 is also enlightening.\n\n&gt;\"So-called ordinary men who were loving husbands and fathers could do quite extraordinarily appalling things to their partners, ex-partners  and their children. Family break-up -- including related issues, such as access to children  -- was the most common cause of family murders, followed by financial  troubles, honour killings and mental illness.\"\n\nFamily breakups followed by financial troubles, honor killings and mental illness. The profile of the LVM that we discuss in this sub could be the ending of your entire family. If he comes off as histrionic and controlling (making a scene), he's more likely to kill your children. Has he threatened to kill himself or you or both of you? He's not playing around, he'll kill your current or future kids. Ask him what a family should look like to him. Is he traditional? How strict is he on having a trad-wife? Ask him what he would do if you two were to break up. It might seem strange but his gut reaction to that question should tell you all you need to know.\n\nLVM can become FA. FAs are everyday working men. FAs are usually domestic violence offenders already. If FAs are in financial distress, they're more likely to kill.\n\nSome interesting points in the Wired article and thesis:\n\n1. Men are most likely to commit these acts during August, with 20 percent of cases occurring within this period.\n2. There are 4 types of family annihilators: Self-righteous, anomic, disappointed and paranoid.\n3. Shooting was the most common method of murder across familicide cases (79%).\n   1. How many of you ladies know a man who owns a gun and uses it regularly? Is it your romantic partner or husband?\n4. After the crime, 87% of offenders either completed or attempted suicide.\n   1. The Wired article had a similar statistic.\n5. Reasons can also include, jealousy, wife affair, offender affair (as in he cheated, *I can't even believe this one*), unemployment, ill children, substance abuse, legal history (as in he's already been arrested and/or convicted).\n6. Illnesses that should be most seriously considered as risk factors to the commission of familicide are serious psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and personality disorders (so basically if he has an SMI but not always).\n\nThis is serious. It's survival at this point.\n\nI can go on and on about this but I'm tired and need a mental break from the research so if there are errors, my bad, correct me in the comments. I hope we can start a dialogue about this in the comments. Men won't save us, we need to protect ourselves. No one is talking about this seriously but people will watch true crimes about it all day thinking it won't be them.\n\nVet the absolute fuck out of these men! No mercy. No prisoners. Block and delete without hesitation. I want you all to live, with your kids, in peace. Be safe out there.
ta1pq0	neutral	How would you feel if your partner said they were open to a threesome?: Hello everyone,\n\nI was watching a movie with my fianc\u00e9 recently. A threesome happened in it. I asked him how he feels about that, a threesome with another woman. He says he\u2019s never done it but he\u2019s open to it. I was kind of surprised, we\u2019ve been together for more than 2 years. We\u2019re getting married next year. We  have another trip planned for us right when I finish classes, we\u2019re calling it our pre-honeymoon. We\u2019ve been living together for a while now and everything is perfect between us. I\u2019m very in love with him and it\u2019s clear he feels the same.\n\nBut him saying something this makes me feel really insecure. He said it\u2019s not something he\u2019s actively looking to do with me, he\u2019s just open to it, talking about it if it\u2019s something I want to do. He\u2019s a young guy, he\u2019s 20. I was his first girlfriend but he\u2019s been with many girls before me. He said around 8 girls. In contrast, I was a virgin before him. We met when I was 16 and he was 17. He was definitely a player at first. We started as friends with benefits. But I couldn\u2019t really handle that sort of thing. I took a big risk in losing him and told him that I needed a relationship if whatever we had was going to continue.  It was very confusing us going on cute dates,  passionate nights, all the intimacy, then just acting just as friends when near his friends and family. He took some days to think about what I said and decided to get serious with me. After agreeing to a real relationship he has gotten extremely serious about us. He proposed to me on our first anniversary, we\u2019re engaged and living together now, and getting married soon. It\u2019s not just these actions, it\u2019s the way he\u2019s with me in general that I know he\u2019s serious about us.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t a big deal. He said it\u2019s not something he\u2019s crazy for or that we wants. But I\u2019m so crazy over him that these small little things get me worried as I love him so much and I don\u2019t want to lose him. I mean I would kind of be open to it. I trust him and I wouldn\u2019t mind him being with another girl as long as I\u2019m there participating as well and every time he finishes it\u2019s with me. I\u2019ve read some horror stories of this stuff on the relationship subreddits though. But the thing is ever since the first day I met this man, I haven\u2019t had sexual thoughts of anyone else. I don\u2019t even see the purpose of a conversation with another guy that\u2019s not him as I\u2019ll get nothing from it. If I have a sexual need, or if I want to talk, or have a good time, it\u2019ll be with my fianc\u00e9. Of course for school and work I\u2019ll have to communicate with other men. So I\u2019m just saying that there was a chance he would be open to having sex with another girl, if I were present. I highly doubt he is open to this now based on how I reacted. He cares for me so much and is very protective.\n\nI\u2019m very open with him. It was obvious I felt insecure and jealous when I was questioning him on this. That\u2019s just something I can\u2019t control with him as I really care about him.  I\u2019ve had many family issues in the past and maybe this explains my reaction. I even ended a friendship with one my friends when she proposed a threesome with us. That was really disrespectful, so I ended it. I never told him that was the reason we stopped being friends. So this is the first time threesomes have come up. I think I might be codependent, which may add on to it. I can\u2019t sleep without him, I feel happy, cared for, and safe whenever we\u2019re together. He has added so much to my life and I can\u2019t lose him.\n\nI do so much to be attractive to him. I know often in relationships one party loses sexual interest over time. I want to be everything to him, I want us to maintain the intimacy and connection we have but also the naughty sexual aspect of it. I\u2019ve spent so much money on lingerie for him, he really likes that. It\u2019s his money I\u2019m spending, but I spend time finding something special we\u2019ll both like so it\u2019s still an investment of mine. He also has a foot fetish that I go along with. I\u2019ll ask him sometimes if he likes it more if I do X or Y with my appearance. He usually doesn\u2019t give a real answer to a question like that but the rare 1 or 2 times that he has I definitely have taken that into consideration since I want to look as good as possible for him. I take care of my body in general of course, I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. I love how he worships me, treats me like a goddess honestly, and that dynamic is  present outside the bedroom as well. Sometimes I just get worried he\u2019ll want someone else, or he\u2019ll get tired of me, I try my best to not be clingy although that\u2019s pretty hard. I feel like even though I try my hardest not to, I sometimes come off as needy and insecure around him. Especially when I asked him about this. I just couldn\u2019t help it. \n\nHe\u2019s a sweetheart, he assured me repeatedly this isn\u2019t something he wants. But whenever there is a small situation like this, I get really nervous about losing him. And no amount of improving myself or anything can help that. And I don\u2019t like being like this as I don\u2019t want to push him away. He\u2019s so consistently perfect to me that I want to do my best to be enough for him. In some ways I don\u2019t feel deserving of the love and care I receive from him. Like I know this isn\u2019t really a problem, but it\u2019s the most recent major thing for me for us. We never have real issues in our relationship.\n\nSo the question proposed for discussion is the one in the title. I provided some context as to why I\u2019m asking. Any advice to my situation is appreciated as well. Thank you for reading.

t5mdmd	hostile sexism	I saw a post today made me mad: So in the post this kid , is about 16 , ask if he was the asshole because he gave his mom a book about cheating, because she cheated on his dad . The poor kid was a mess , because not only did she cheat on this guy but left him and the son for the man she cheated with. And everyone was saying he was the asshole because I shit you not , "she could have been abused " Then it comes to light she wasn't abused, was just living in the moment. Well apparently everyone still said he was the asshole because "he needs to respect his mom " But no one else sees how fucked up this poor kid is . I fucking hate stupid feminist for allowing that .

I\u2019m normally a quiet, introverted person but I felt comfortable around her. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, this might just be her personality type and I was simply following along, I\u2019m not gonna jump to conclusions and assume I\u2019m special but I thought I\u2019d point that out.\n\nAfter our shift I asked if she wanted to have a cigarette and chat for a few mins, she agreed and at the end I asked for her IG. The next day I was lowkey looking for a reason to text her and I realized I forgot to thank her for her help throughout our shift (I\u2019m still kinda new), to which she replied telling me not to worry about it. I wasn't sure what to reply and she seemed busy so I left it at that.\n\nWe rarely work together and when we do I still try to keep a straight head and do my job properly, so it's not like we have the day to ourselves, and over text it just seems kinda weird seeing as we just met and I wouldn't be sure what to say.\n\nShould I wait it out? Text her? or should I focus on my job and stop tripping over stuff like this? I\u2019d love to hear your opinions! \ud83d\udda4

q0en4b	neutral	How do you find a partner as an introverted guy?: 26 year old male here. Sorry for bad grammar. English is not my mother language.  \n\n\nI have been single for over 8 years. My last relationship was when i was 18 with a girl that had bipolar disorder. This was also the only relationship i ever had in my life.  \n\n\nThat relationship ended in disaster because  her mental issues dragged me down to such an extent that i experienced a mental breakdown myself.  \n\n\nAfter that happened i started avoiding relationships and any situations that could potentially lead to one. Because of the fear that i would attract another girl who would again drag me down and add nothing substantial to my life.i was going through a bad period in my life back then.  \n\n\nAnway, in the past few years i have been trying again to find a partner. Only to realize my introvertion severly limits the possibilities that i have in meeting girls. I don't like to go out to bars and clubs( This also counts for pre covid times) and i don't find myself going to any social situations were meeting a girl and getting a conversation going is a real possibility. I have friends but those friends themselves also don't really hang out with girls so  making contact that way is not possible.  \n\n\nFrom my experience. If you are a guy that just isn't a social butterfly and who does not go out clubbin and to bars. finding a partner seems to be extremely hard.  \n\n\nI also tried dating apps like Tinder etc. Had some conversations that ended up in me getting ghosted or just fake profiles. Tinder also seems to be almost entirely based on looks, which does not really match with my principals on how to approach a partner. In general i find using those apps not enjoyable at all.  \n\n\nMy dad used to tell me story's how it was pretty common in the 1980's when he was young to Pick up  girls in the supermarket  and at the Busstop. But in our times this seems to be much less the case. The girls i encounter at those places always seem to be in their own bubble with their smartphone. not looking approachable at all.   \n\n\nSo how do i find a partner if the most common ways other men do it simply don't work for me? I simply cannot find a solution currently  that would allow me to find a partner in a way that does not require me to change my entire personality to something i am not.
t73rjp	neutral	Being a more private person: I used to wear my heart on my sleeve and tell everybody everything about me so they would feel comfortable and like me. \n\nAfter FDS, I keep my cards close to my chest, and am very careful and selective about sharing myself and my information. \n\nTonight, after a social gathering, I realised how much I have changed in this regard with everyone. I don\u2019t need to reveal my vulnerabilities to be kind and connect. \n\nI feel much safer as a person, and now that I\u2019m coming around to the idea of dating again, I feel more confident about not being hurt. They can\u2019t hurt me if I don\u2019t willingly give my weaknesses away- if I don\u2019t hand over the weapons to shoot me down. \n\nGuarding their access to me, being ruthless at blocking, and being more selective about who gets access to me\u2026 All of this makes me feel more protected. \n\nI\u2019ve taken my time before being ready to date again. Being patient and slow has been rewarding.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who needs to hear this: just take your time and see how you change around your social circles before you get back into dating. You don\u2019t need to keep exposing yourself to abusive men to get better at vetting.

Like, I lead every single conversation we have had and I guess I'm just wondering if that's a bad sign. I like her a lot and want to meet up but she deflects my questions if I ask about it. At first I figured she was just a little shy and she'd warm up after a bit but It makes me feel like she's not interested in me and more like I'm just interrogating her. Any time I mention something about me or my life she has a one word comment about it and redirects the conversation. I'm not the best with this sort of thing, clearly, but I was just wondering if I'm going crazy or if there's some hints that I should be taking here. Any advice?

If a male did this to a female, he'd go to jail. But since it's a female doing it to a male, it's just a TikTok joke which we're taught to laugh along with. Just imagine if it was the other way around, where a bunch of males were doing this to females as a trend on TikTok, it would be national news for weeks. Headlines about how men/boys are so toxic and perpetuating rape culture. But since it's females doing it to males, it's just a joke/trend.

That is, by definition, NOT equality of the genders. 23% of families in the UK are single parent, female led households **74% of Primary and secondary school teachers in England are women** This means millions of boys in the UK are growing up without a male role model at home or in school, so where are the feminists calling for equality in education? I don't see a single woman saying that more men should teach in primary or secondary schools, yet, funnily, they'll complain about the lack of women in science fields. Same with nursing, female-dominated, but they're fine with that. If you ever try to call out hypocrisy or standards hurting men, you will be called a sexist, they will try painting you as a hateful person, and attempt to get you banned.

We should ignore the loud outliers that belittle the other sides and strive to make the world a great and accepting place for all. Well thanks for reading!

How can I support him and make him feel comfortable while he recovers?For context, we are not super well off, but I am a SAHM, so I will be home with him during the day while he recovers. Anyone have experience with this procedure, and is there anything special your partner/loved one did for you that made the healing process easier? Anything in particular I should avoid? He isn't vocalizing it, but I think he might be scared to death :(\n\nThanks!
td0mf5	neutral	Men's Rights Should Not Be Right Wing: I guess I'll alienate most of you both by how long this post is but also because I think we should stop with the feminism-hating and most importantly we should not position ourselves in the right. For full disclosure, I don't see myself as a feminist but I am on the far left. I may not agree with most of you on these issues but I'm arguing in good faith. Here it goes:\n\nI want to preface this by saying I looked at a bunch of posts and comments here and I agree many of the issues being brought up deserve attention and are totally ignored by society at large. I think what's going on in Ukraine right now is outrageous and no one would accept it if the social group being singled out to stay and die was any group at all other than men. But even when it comes to smaller issues, I'm with you on many of them: circumcision when not medically necessary or done by personal choice should be absolutely forbidden, rape and domestic violence against men are not taken seriously by society, there is a bias favoring women over men in divorce courts, etc. And I agree that there needs to be some form of men's rights advocacy. People will sometimes tell you that because feminism is about the equality between the genders there's no need for a men's movement, but if we're being realistic, feminism isn't doing much to address these issues.\n\nThat being said, I think this movement does a HUGE disservice to itself by leaning right wing. I get it: you've seen all the crazy SJW and feminists compilations and they claim to be leftwing and they often antagonize men, and so you oppose that and you drift to the right. Also men used to be in a better position when it comes to gender relations so you lean conservative.\n\nBUT, first of all I think it would be very helpful if the movement dropped the feminism hating. Understand that feminism is a gigantic range of movements and ideologies. It encompasses so much that one can hardly say they oppose it all. In fact, I bet none of us really understands it all. Be honest, how much feminist literature have you read? I don't mean singled out quotes cherry picked by people who already hold the same views you do. I mean how much of the decades of feminist theory have you read? The literature is endless and most of us never read any of it at all and even those of us who read a bit are far from having an extensive understanding. Remember that the examples of feminists going crazy and extreme that you know about have only reached you exactly because they are crazy and extreme. Those are cherry picked fringe cases that are not representative of feminism in general. You know when people mischaracterize the whole \"manosphere\" as people who want the state to redistribute women to men? Or a movement that indoctrinates mass shooters? It's the same thing. There are always fringe and crazy cases in every movement and those are the ones that people talk about because it causes controversy. If you never read feminist literature, just assume you don't know enough about it to take a position for or against it, and instead be for or against specific instances.\n\nUnderstand that most people see feminism as a movement for women's rights and equality between the sexes (even if you think it's not). If you oppose this you'll alienate most of the people who would otherwise sympathize and care about our issues. That's totally misguided. A men's rights movements should be about securing men's rights and not about opposing some other movement, specially when that other movement is very popular and you'll drive people away by opposing it or reducing it to man hating or whatever. Instead, we should build bridges with the other social movements. Look at how feminism, the LGBT movement and even anti-racism movements often come together in mutual support and how effective that's been. We must learn from that. If we can get along with other movements, including the feminist movement, we stand to gain a lot more.\n\nBut more importantly, even if you disagree with me about feminism and other social justice movements, understand those don't define the left. A lot of it is liberal nonsense, which is not the same as leftism. The left or the radical left is primarily concerned with economics. We leftists want the overthrow of capitalism. And I know, many of you have been exposed to a lot of conservative pundits and think capitalism is fixing poverty everywhere and that trying something else by some law of the universe leads to gulags or whatever. I used to think like that too and that's a conversation we can have but that's besides my point here. I just want to stress that in no way does the advance of men's rights require deregulation or so called \"free\" markets or the destruction of public services or any of that right wing economics nonsense. You can be an advocate for men's rights and still oppose the exploitation of Man by Man. In fact, you should! Whatever infringements on the rights of men and of any human being, our economic system is the biggest culprit. Just because you oppose feminism you don't need to \"buy the whole package\" and position yourself on the right.  \n\n\nTLDR: Men's rights activism is absolutely necessary. But also most of us don't really know much about feminism apart from some internet nonsense and constantly bashing feminism from a position of ignorance is both wrong and very unhelpful when it comes to getting people to care about our issues. And even if you stick to your anti-feminist position, that shouldn't make you reject leftism in general, as the greatest forms of oppression still come from capitalism and there's nothing in men's rights advocacy that requires defending a rotten, murderous, anti-democratic and exploitative economic system.
sud1wg	hostile sexism	The difference between a Feminist and a 'Feminist': A Feminist: -Wants equal rights as men -Believes men and women to be equals -Isn't going around saying #FemenismFuture or anything of the sort 'Feminist' -Wants women to be superior than men and believes it -Thinks all white men should die (but not the black, Asian or any other men of colour because they're 'not' racist). Oh also not the gay men either because for some reason they're different than straight men other than their Sexuality. -Usually has #KAM #FemenismFuture or #FeminismIsKey or stuff like that. -those who even slightly suggest they're wrong are immediately sexist -believe that misandry doesn't exist

I made a post venting about the housing market. I bought my first home in 2019 and felt it was a fair price but due to everything going on a house on my street just sold for double. I simply said how crazy it was. Then out of nowhere, he arrived. A man that I never talk to. He must’ve been lurking in the shadows. Here to educate me. “Take it from someone who knows…this is normal now”. Gave me a lesson on the housing market…that is crazy..that I literally just said was crazy. Damn dude. Let me eat my Frosted Flakes in peace.
t5uyha	neutral	UPDATE: Part 1 of my 3 experience implementing the 3 month rule. I HAVE MADE A HUUUUUGE MISTAKE with cohabitation.: Well Queens...spoke too soon so I want to emphasize the importance of checking FDS as it's a LIFESTYLE--the potentially HVM you think can slip their mask at any point whether it's 1 year...a few months...or even 30-50 years down the line, and you need to be prepared to dip the second the disrespect confirms they are a LVM or NVM as it will take a considerable amount of time and transition afterwards that will gravely hurt you more than it will hurt the LVM in these situations (sexism).\n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/gt2g2d/my\\_experience\\_implementing\\_the\\_3\\_month\\_rule\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/gt2g2d/my_experience_implementing_the_3_month_rule_on/)\n\nI have grown a lot since the original post and took a few months after breaking up with the ZVM/NVM-in-HVM-clothing after realizing their red flags put me at a high likelihood of being victimized by domestic violence so I got my ducks in a row and GTFO before things escalated. I LOVE FDS and want to **affirm that FDS is similar to other self-help and mental health recovery models where they emphasize that you must \"walk the walk and do the work\" each day for you to be intentional and continuous in making sure you put yourself forward as well as staying vigilant with the fuckery of men as triggers, environmental/social/cultural pressures, and our own biases/lived experiences can often downplay many red flags that could have the potential to harm you in a variety of ways long-term.** This is some of my story since the original post and I plan to make this a few parts now that it's been 6+ months since the nuclear breakup/escape so I have time to process, reflect, and share some insight that I feel may help some of you in your own healing.\n\nAfter this \"test\" with my ex along with some time after we had sex, they SEEMED like a HVM \"enough\" for me to cohabitate with them. For context, this was at the winter/spring peak of the pandemic in 2020, so it was the PERFECT opportunity for a predatory NVM to use cultural/societal circumstances to manipulate their way into my newly (started reading FDS) logical, FDS centered mindset so as a newly recovering pickme, I didn't use the same cynicism I had initially to question WHY there was such a \"sense of urgency\" for us to move in after this point and went ahead believing that the \"money saved, pandemic risks of spreading virus, etc.\" excuses would justify me moving in with a man I BARELY knew since \"it's like moving in with a roommate, but someone you are dating.\" **Now I know how WRONG I WAS and FUCK THAT NOISE. What I was trying to justify was cultural conditioning from liberal feminism (particularly Millennial style if you are within this age range because our generational vulnerabilities with the housing/rent market and other societal issues is the perfect shitsorm for NVM/ZVM to use those factors to prey on you) and although it's a mindset that permeates around us with our friends, colleagues, and other people you may know...you have to QUESTION EVERYTHING for your own SELF INTEREST, WELLBEING, and PRESERVATION OF LIFE. Let's be real...living with a significant other that isn't FOR SURE (or close to 99% certainty) they are a HVM with an engagement ring/wedding date previously set IS NOT THE SAME THING as cohabitating with a relative, college friend, or female roommate. It isn't. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not putting your best interest first and you need to question why they are giving a complete stranger \"the benefit of the doubt\" because NoT aLl MeN versus the HUMAN BEING THEY KNOW that is a woman knowing that the world generally is stacked against us.** \n\nAnyways...I wanted to break down some of the MANY red flags that were present that I had either misread due to my neurodiverse identity, my own denial, cultural conditioning, and the manipulative fuckery my NVM displayed to lure me in like a total POS user predator he inherently was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Using the pandemic (in my case) to \"justify\" a sense of urgency for us to cohabitate/move in together sooner than I had initially mentioned by taking aspects of my character/values to manipulate/gaslight me into considering and/or compromising on my truth/boundaries I had initially set.** I do not see any value in continuing to beat myself up over this situation as I've learned A LOT, but this is the one thing that initially \"felt off\" to me but I was na\u00efve to get input from pickme friends/family/coworkers that had me questioning my gut reaction. Trust your gut reaction (read \"The Gift of Fear\" too). What started as a situational \"we are going on dates during the pandemic start\" turned into him trying to escalate the relationship sooner and with more intensity...AKA LOVEBOMBING...but he was able to mask this with excuses/justifications. **This is also a KEY THING an abusive men will do early on: take begin things you do/want then twist or undermine them with what HE WANTS along with justification on why it \"makes more sense\" for them to not hear you....to see if you will CAVE. And I did.** And the \"reasons\" he noted \"made sense\" at the time, but it was not what I had wanted or was comfortable with so he would either neg or try to mantrum their way into my head. Clearly if I was able to cave this quickly...it's CLEAR NOW that I was not ready to date FDS style and would encourage anyone lurking here or recently broken up/considering dating again to take your \"wait time\" and extend it 6-12 months longer, but hindsight is...interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **\"But we will save money living together and plan to both have roommates anyways!\"** Yes, I was going to need a roommate to continue to financially be in a better spot than living alone, but a roommate is a CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT that you legally can dispute/discuss, but other than sharing a living space and keeping the mutual shared areas of a living space clean, there are NO OTHER RELATIONSHIP expectations or emotional labor expected or pushed upon by other parties.  **The first 2 months living together was a \"honeymoon\" period but by month 3, it was evident that the male entitlement of having a woman present as their roommate AND BANGMAID 50/50 girlfriend was a RECIPE for disaster.** By month 4 I was questioning leaving and by month 5, I was job searching to leave and GTFO before I saw other red flags that made me have to do a quick escape (I'll share that tale another day). \n   * What started as \"can you get groceries and I pay the electric bill?\" turned into me paying a $200-300 grocery bill per week because this POS scrote was over a foot taller than me and started eating like a linebacker because they had a 50/50 girlfriend where they could go hogwild with food and their \"electric bill\" was usually $300-500 THE WHOLE MONTH. They will \"innocently\" suggest these things and try to downplay or make you feel like they are doing a \"sacrifice\" by taking one bill over another type of expense but do not even entertain that BS for a minute. By month 2, I knew I was PLAYED by this \"agreement\" and I had spent $500+ in moving costs to \"cohabitate\" during the pandemic to \"save money, get to know each other as we date and reduce risks with spreading covid\" because I truly for a second got swept into the 2020-2021 pandemic hysteria, but a LVM/NVM will see this as their chance to land a person beyond their league and drain you emotionally, financially, psychologically, socially, and with your time. \n   * He used holidays during 2020 to not plan or do anything. When I went to my parents house, he would then use COVID as an excuse to try to get me to isolate from MY FAMILY because of \"covid exposure\" yet this scrote smoked e-ciggerates and had a bunch of health aversive behaviors so it's ironic to see the manipulation NOW. \n   * When we first started dating, he mentioned this 1 \"aunt\" that he had. I don't even know at this point if it's a real person or a fake delusion he created because he knew deep down how shitty he was and that no woman would honestly want to spend time or be around his home 24/7 otherwise, but he told me that he had an aunt receiving CHEMO in January 2020 before the pandemic. During the pandemic and when we started living together, he would constantly mention this \"aunt\" and I had offered to drop off groceries, get their mail, and assist as he claimed she lived 5 mins away. I NEVER MET THIS AUNT. I don't even think she's real. She was a ploy to get an empathetic person like myself who was vigilant of healthcare during the pandemic to continue to be isolated and under his reign. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm heading to work and will continue to add onto these flags, but there is a laundry list. \n\nHe tried putting his finger in my butt during sex to groom me for anal....he would \"call me\" when I was at the grocery store EVERY TIME I WENT to \"add or remind me of things we didn't put on the list\" (the EVER EXTENSIVE LIST FOR HIM) to keep tabs on me and to get more $$$/groceries out of my pocket, and he GOT A PUPPY FOR ME as \"a gift\" 3 months before I left as a fakeass grandiose gesture to keep me tramuabonded and invested because it was a FRESH CUTE PUPPY so it would be harder for me to leave. I'm proud I left, but this tale will take some time to share and it's emotionally draining to go back through my notes.\n\nPLEASE KEEP A JOURNAL OR NOTES when you date or cohabitate or even just go through life. It has saved my life many times, and in this instace...it made ALL OF IT CLEAR in documented evidence. \n\nIf he was a HVM, I guarantee there would be no pressure or sense of urgency to get me to meet some arbitrary cohabitation milestone so from here on out, it's not even going to cross my mind as something I need to compromise on anymore. I've seen how a bad relationship can set you back emotionally, psychologically, and financially.\n\nIt's month 6-7 of our post-breakup and I JUST NOW am getting back on track from that shitstorm. I paid off the moving costs and am living at my parents. It's not ideal, but it's better than being put down daily, gaslit, and having my central nervous system questioning EVERYTHING. It's better than seeing a man you dated go from 0 to punching a bunch of drop ceiling tiles in front of you to intimidate you with their anger to silence you and it's better than trying to make things work with an abusive man who would eventually kill me or put me in an inpatient psych hospital with their fuckery. \n\n**If something is costing your mental health, inner peace, and/or freedom--it's TOO MUCH OF A PRICE TO PAY.**

t76xbs	internalized sexism	My experience with female dating advice.: To begin, I'll state that I'm a 19 year old girl. I like to follow social issues, as I'm a fan of learning from all kinds of different perceptives and I was recently brave enough to venture into the men's rights community, and it's not what expected! \n\nAnyways, I wanted to share my experience with the dating advice girls my age receive, and how horrendous it actually is.\n\nAt my last job, I worked in a department store staffed with at least 90% women. Mostly over 30. Most of my coworkers readily listened to my boy issues and handed out support and advice, particularly the dating life coach coworker.\n\nI was put on my head with the advice I was given. It seemed so unnatural and frustrating. In situations where I felt the need to express my wants and emotional needs, I was told to \"back off\" and ignore a potential partner so they would feel \"manly\" and want to chase me. It was phrased in a particularly manipulative way, as you are supposed to ignore a man, make him feel unwanted and make him feel as if he were an option (regularly remind him that you've gone on other dates and that he is not your first or only pick). So basically, play it cool but be manipulative too.\n\nSome other things I was told was that men hate emotional comfort and support. Never act like you care, because apparently that would make a man uninterested and no longer want you. Be cold and uncaring. Let him care but don't care back. Do not let a man get lazy on dates. Don't let him take you to his house too many times. He'll think that's acceptable and won't try anymore. Never text back fast regularly, never tell him you're interested in him. Men have short memories. Just disappear for awhile and he'll forget whatever you want him to. Have sex with a hot guy before breaking it off with him, because thats moral apparently. The list goes on. \n\nIts funny, because this advice is almost good. I've learned the benefit in not becoming too reliant on another person's attention, controlling my emotions, and being able to spot guys that value me enough to show they care about my time and feelings versus guys that stand me up and treat me as a sex object. \n\nBut none of that requires emotional manipulation. None of that really requires coldnessness, complete personality changes or having to \"train\" (yes, I have been told I need to train men) another human. \n\nIts just as easy to learn how to have healthier connections with others and learn how to choose people who can do the same and want the same things as you. \n\nI thought this was a good post to this sub, because I get angry just thinking about it. How many relationships have I ruined by taking this self riechous, narcissistic advice my female role models have given to me? What is so wrong with having human connections and treating men like regular people instead of these strange alien creatures we must train and play fucked up games with? Food for thought, because I'm not sure how many men actually know what kind of advice young women are getting.
slofph	ambivalent sexism	Why You Shouldn't Take Fèminísts So Seriously? They Are Secretly Hypocrites And Explained In-Depth.: I wrote this long time ago, now posting it here. What comes in your mind when your hear the word "feminist?" I can bet you, what clouds your mind is some obese woman who has purple/green hair, who claims she's opprèssed and now she wants "equal" rights, and low-key hates all men. On Reddit, this is indeed the case. But... in the real world? There are more woman than you think, who openly claim they're fèminísts, and these women are average to what someone would call "hawt." Why? Because women naturally are more inclined towards to follow an agenda for what the elitist, government, and their corporate bosses tell them to. So, if they identify themselves as a "feminist" that doesn't mean they truly are, rather, they're playing the politically correct card to make their obese "friends" happy. But deep down even she knows, she's not a real feminist and neither she gives a fuck what fèmìnists tell her to do. A hot woman knows, a patriarchal society will benefit her. To understand this, one must first understand that men and women are not equal, in the sense that is used currently in society. Let me repeat: Men and women are NOT equal. There. I said it. Many reading this now will get a heart attack and be like, “OMG! You MÎSOGYNìST! You SÈXIST!! You RÀCIST!!” When the feministas claim that "MeNz and WimMinZ are EQUALZ!!" What they really mean is "Identical" and that's entirely false. **One can believe that, humans are equal in intrinsic value as human beings, while simultaneously accepting that men and women are NOT identical. We are intended to be complementary to each other.** Men as hunters/leaders and women as lovers/nurturers. The latter, in the Grand Bargain between Men and Women trade sex and fertility for food and protection. [According to the Washington Post, nearly 2/3 of women fantasize about being dominated sexually.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/03/study-up-to-60-percent-of-women-fantasize-about-being-dominated/?noredirect=on) [If you believe Psychology Today 80% of women fantasize about being tied up.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shameless-woman/201011/tie-me-please) [Oh, and per Nat Geo/Ipsos, less than one-third of American women identify as ‘Feminist’.Think about that](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/american-women-and-feminism) The Percentage of women who want to be tied up at sex is DOUBLE than those that say they are feminist – and there will be overlap between those groups. This is why they say: **“Don’t listen to what they SAY, watch what they DO.”** If women were such feminists, why do they want to be dominated sexually by Men? Isn't that "sexist?" Well, again, it all comes back to their primal instinct which is to submit, and be lead, no matter what feminists tell you otherwise. The same feminists who are "fighting" for feminism are screwing the same "toxic males" that they complain of behind the scenes. You might be thinking, they're getting with the "male" feminists in those protests, well, truth be told, if you didn't know, women aren't attracted to weak males. Male feminists are emotional, weak minded males, who consider everything "oppressive" and no women is attracted to that. Nothing gets her panties more soaked than "sèxist" males, who say how it is, and aren't there to suck up to some women. Society has brainwashed men into thinking if you act as the "nice guy fèmìnist" you'll get her, but what the real statistics show is something different. Studies show [women who call themselves fèmìnists have the most rape and forced sèx fantasies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490609552336) and if you're still out here thinking that, "Oh she's a feminist, and how lovely! If I act like I also hate men, maybe that will get my way into her panties." Nope. The primal instinct of a women will always remain the same. Women were made to serve men. Back in the cavemen days, who had the obligation to hunt, protect, and fight wars? Men did. And women were there to serve their man, and birth the new generation. This is how it worked since the dawn of time, and no amount of feminism can change this. Yes, society has become a joke. But what you must understand is the primal instinct of a woman will always be the same. You know why books such as the "50 Shades of Grey" has been an all time fastest selling book, even beating Harry Potter? Because it's in the primal instinct of a woman, to submit to a powerful man who she perceives in her eyes, and even be his chained up sex doll. If that wasn't the case, over 200 million woman would have bought that book. Just look at the statistics. The key takeaways from this post is, don't take fèmìnists seriously. - Feminism was the biggest shi test known to mankind, and the statistics don't lie. - Fèmìnists want equal rights but don't want to take equal responsibilities. Who does most of the dirty work? Such as construction, working at oil fields, driving trucks, etc men do. If all men were to stop working for a day, society would collapse.
slax3t	interpersonal sexism	School opportunities: At my school (in rural Canada) we\u2019ve had many large events for the girls to get experience and insight into fields that are dominated heavily by men, these events are of course female only. They include engineering, coding, working at power plants and cool stuff like that. I accepted that as completely fine and helpful until I got into my grade 12 university bound English and I made up 50% of the guys in my class. I talked to some people I know about their classes (sciences and math classes) and yeah it turns out in the higher levels of university bound courses there are incredibly few boys, I\u2019m taking about five in our 600 student school, of which about 150 are male seniors.\n\nIt also turns out that the majority of university graduates (not just in my area but the country) are women. So where\u2019re the events to get boys into academic fields?? The majority of the guys in my area end up as farmers and that\u2019s fine, a great profession and all but there\u2019s so much more support for girls to get into traditionally male jobs than guys to even make it into uni. Beyond this there\u2019s so much propaganda in the school promoting labour, a field that\u2019s majority male. Why aren\u2019t construction jobs and mining being pushed on girls like the higher paying less dangerous jobs are? Why are there no experts coming in for male only nights to teach us how to educate, a field dominated by women?\n\nI just think it\u2019s rich that we give so much support to those dominating the university field. It\u2019s just bizarre.

Insults are not trolls. &amp;#x200B; One of the most heated subjects is transgenderism. People are in complete disagreement on the matter. Many, including myself are on the side of mental illness. Others see it as choice and others even support it on toddlers. Of course the usual insults fly. Transphobe, pedo etc. I have no issue with that. But any banning and censorship for such heated subject is a big red flag. Also for insults. No mods is better than a heavy handed one. &amp;#x200B; Now the poll at hand. I am against requiring requests to post as it will deter people from posting and it would also give too much discretion to the mods. I think it should be open to anyone who has a high enough Karama. It will mean it is their main account, and once it gets banned, **it** will have to farm Karama again for a new account. &amp;#x200B; As to seeking Request, I do not see any advantages over Karama.

She always seems to have some level of 'disgust' towards me, but the past few days she's been telling me more and more about how she hates all men and it's awful to hear that when I'm doing my best for her. I've talked to her about her opinion, but she keeps telling me nearly every man has done something bad to her. I've been getting really burnt out lately because of some past trauma and her asking a different dude for nudes (to compare to mine as a matter of fact). Should I just let it go and deal with it or is this not okay? Her reasoning does seem fair.
t64hx9	neutral	[STATISTICS] The truth about college rape. College women just as likely if not slightly more likely than college men to commit rape, and are about as likely as college men to commit other forms of sexual assault and sexual assault in general. The real prevalence of college rape also revealed.: [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ccsvsftr.pdf) conducted a survey of college students for the 2014-15 school year. The sample size was 15,000 women and 8,000 men from 9 schools. The average response rate for women in all 9 schools was 54%, exceeding the expected 40% response rate for women. The average response rate for men in all 9 schools was 40%, exceeding the expected 35% response rate for men. More details about the methodology:\n\n&gt;Nonresponse bias analyses were conducted at the school level using detailed student roster data provided by the schools. Minimal bias was detected (i.e., differences in characteristics of respondents and the population of eligible students) and survey data were adjusted or weighted to compensate accordingly. The survey data were thoroughly reviewed for quality and completeness. Only about 2% of respondents started but did not finish the survey, and the level of missing data (i.e., the proportion of survey items not answered by survey respondents)  \nwas also relatively low for most items. In addition, the CCSVS used representative samples of students at eight of the nine schools to obtain female **prevalence estimates of sexual assault within the desired level of precision (Goal 2)**. In other words, the precision for the prevalence estimates for sexual assault experienced during the 2014\u20132015 academic year exceeded the design goal of a 9% RSE at all schools except one.\n\nAccording to Figure 48, the data shows that women are often perpetrators of rape/sexual assault, too. It found that when it comes to any kind of sexual assault, whether it's rape through physical force, groping, rape through incapacitation, threatening to harm, etc., women were barely less likely than men to have done any form of sexual assault (2.9% of men and 2.7% of women). When it comes to touching and grabbing in particular, 2.5% of college men and 2.4% of college women were perpetrators, a minuscule difference. College men and college women are just as likely as each other to have threatened to harm someone in terms of sexual assault (0.6% for both), and college women were slightly more likely than college men to have used physical force before to rape or sexually assault someone (0.8% of women and 0.6% of men). They're equally likely to have raped/sexually assaulted an incapacitated individual (0.7% both). Admittedly, according to Figure 47, college men were more likely than college women to perpetrate sexual harassment (4.4% of college men and 2.9% of college women). Although women are less likely to commit sexual harassment, they perpetrated more than half the amount that men did. Women did ***not*** comprise a minuscule percentage of sexual harassment perpetrators.\n\nA lot of feminists argue that 1 in 5 college women are sexually assaulted, but this is a myth. It's not 1 in 5. [According to Christina Hoff Summers](https://time.com/3222543/wage-pay-gap-myth-feminism/):\n\n&gt;This incendiary figure is everywhere in the media today. Journalists, senators and even President Obama cite it routinely. Can it be true that the American college campus is one of the most dangerous places on earth for women?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The one-in-five figure is based on the [*Campus Sexual Assault Study*](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf), commissioned by the National Institute of Justice and conducted from 2005 to 2007. Two prominent criminologists, Northeastern University\u2019s James Alan Fox and Mount Holyoke College\u2019s Richard Moran, have [noted](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/10/sexual-assault-rape-survey-college-campus-column/13864551/) its weaknesses:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe estimated 19% sexual assault rate among college women is based on a survey at two large four-year universities, which might not accurately reflect our nation\u2019s colleges overall. In addition, the survey had a large non-response rate, with the clear possibility that those who had been victimized were more apt to have completed the questionnaire, resulting in an inflated prevalence figure.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fox and Moran also point out that the study used an overly broad definition of sexual assault. Respondents were counted as sexual assault victims if they had been subject to \u201cattempted forced kissing\u201d or engaged in intimate encounters while intoxicated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Defenders of the one-in-five figure will reply that the finding has been replicated by other studies. But these [studies](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html) suffer from some or all of the same flaws. Campus sexual assault is a serious problem and will not be solved by [statistical hijinks](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/01/24/bias-clouds-campus-assault-solutions/RJYPBGvOwdScjxKlxB9u3M/story.html).\n\n[The real percentage of college women who get raped in a span of 4 years is actually about 1.9%](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf), according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics study of college-age women from 1995-2013. Even CDC's survey of women showing that 1 in 5 are raped has similar limitations. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics' 1987 report of an estimated lifetime victimization rates for certain types of crime, they made an estimate of what percent of people are victims of a certain type of crime in their lifetime by using estimates based on annual rates of certain crimes. [They estimated that percentage of women who will be raped in their lifetime is estimated to be 8% of women, including 8% of white women and 11% of black women. In fact, people were far more likely to be victims of motor vehicle theft, burglary, robbery, and assault in their lifetime](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/104274.pdf). In fact, the percent raped in their lifetime could be lower now because rape rates plummetted since 1987.\n\nAccording to Bureau of Justice Statistics for the 2014-15 academic year for college students, the percentage of women who were raped that school year across nine schools were an average of 4.2% if unweighted (4.1% if weighted), and 5.6% were victims of sexual battery that year (this means things like groping and touching and other unwanted sexual contact). Encompassing all forms of sexual assault, 10.3% of college women were sexually assaulted during the 2014-15 year. When it came to unbiased estimates, it was 10.7% and 10.2% for P2 estimates. According to Table 31 and Figure 42, 7.7% of college women were victims of coerced sexual contact in the 2014-15 year, and, according to Figure 43, 5.8% of college men were victims of coerced sexual contact in that year.\n\nHere's another interesting fact: according to Figure 27, sometimes when college women are raped/sexually assaulted, the perpetrator is a non-student/non-professor/non-employee of the school. Perpetrators who were students, professors, or other employees of the school comprised 55% of rape incidents and 56% of sexual battery incident. This means they aren't necessarily part of the school the victim goes to.
t0zffi	neutral	Co-Worker Randomly Offered to Rent His Room to Me \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23: An older male colleague (late 50\u2019s, I\u2019m guessing he may be old enough to be my grandpa ) offered to rent his room to me (late 20\u2019s) from the very first conversation we EVER had! I politely declined. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about this for second because my friends are accusing me of sending him \u201cmixed signals\u201d and my mother was saying that he just \u201ctrying to be nice\u201d.\n\nI often like to introduce myself to my co-workers and what city I\u2019m from because a) it either comes up in conversation b) that\u2019s how they introduce themselves as well. At this place, it\u2019s common practice to introduce yourself, say how many years of experience you\u2019ve had in the field, where you completed your education, and what city you travel from to get here. It\u2019s commonly known that it\u2019s too expensive to live in the city. \n\nI\u2019d usually get comments from my colleagues about how  expensive it is going to be for me to buy a house in this expensive city where I work. Or some other comment about my long commute to work. I don\u2019t mind those comments, because it\u2019s just lighthearted banter. NEVER in my life had someone let alone an older male offer to rent one of his spare bedrooms to me. He said he only lived three minutes from work. His job here doesn\u2019t pay much but it pays money.  He told me he was a clean guy, he loves children, and rent would be \u201csuper cheap\u201d.  I was surprised he said that, and politely declined his offer. It felt so weird. I wasn\u2019t interested. I\u2019m currently living with my parents, and in grad school. I\u2019m literally trying to save money to pay for grad school and student debt. I\u2019m just looking to make some money while gaining experience for the next 2 years. Renting a room from him literally defeats the purpose of saving money and I may not even finish grad school without the support of my parents . \n\nHere\u2019s the thing after talking wih my friends they said that I gave him \u201cmixed signals\u201d because my opening line after giving him my name was that I commute three hours to work everyday.  I do not think so. I\u2019ve told my other colleagues and we laugh about it. My mom was saying that he\u2019s just being helpful. \n\nTo me, it made me feel uncomfortable. I see this as predatory behaviour and highly unprofessional. How he went about it was really weird since he sounded like he was trying to court me rather than offer me a place to stay. The whole pitch was mostly about him, his salary, and had nothing to do with the room (aside from the 3 minute walk part). Was I in the wrong to talk about my long commute to work? Is this something I should take up with HR? Am I overreacting? I feel like this has to constitute as some kind of workplace harassment\u2026\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?

t6wpkf	neutral	why it's mostly easier to date as an older woman: First and foremost, it's super easy to weed out men who aren't interested and who aren't interesting. Vet using the smallest, least visible ways:\n\n\\-- **their eyes**: do they look at you, look through you, see you as a piece of meat? It's rare to have someone look at you and truly SEE you. It's rare to have someone look past your looks. Everything has to start with attraction, but for most men, their eyes tell 90% of the story right off the bat. This is why you know within seconds if you're attracted to someone. How do you know if they're attracted to you? Almost always, they'll do the eyebrow flash, a micro-expression of openness and appreciation. \n\n\\-- **body language**: most men, when talking with buddies, stand side by side; women tend to stand face to face. Unless I'm mistaken, a man who's truly interested will stand mostly face to face, plus he will mirror your movements, so as to create symmetry. A very subtle vetting strategy is to be conscious of this. Move your arms around a bit, see if he unconsciously mirrors you. (Mind you, narcs are masters of this, so if it looks a bit too rehearsed, it probably is, and is a red flag.) In the same vein, a man who stands side by side, I'd say no romantic interest at all. That's colleague/buddy interest, at most. \n\n\\-- conversation: \n\n**1) from users**: watch out for hobosexuals or any man who's looking for an intelligent pack mule, ie mommy/bangmaid. I've noticed men like this ask about your job, maybe even ask how much you make if they're particularly clumsy. They ask about your living arrangements: do you live alone, are you married, how close is your family. I'm convinced those who are predators/abusers are looking for women who don't live close to family, and/or who are estranged, so they can move in, then make moves on a woman, isolate her from everyone she knows, and abuse her. I've noticed my saying I'm back in my home state, around family, friends, community, often signals a cooling of interest, along with my saying I'm settled here and won't move, or rather will only move to my forever home.\n\n**2) from men who hate women**: watch how he refers to the women in his life, or even how he treats wait staff. See if he owns books and/or music by women. Bring up women in conversation, and see how he reacts. Does he ever ask questions about women? Does he support, or does he mock, undermine, dismiss women's opinions, music, writing? I was married the first time to a man whose whole world was homosocial. His books and music were missing half the population. These are not well-rounded, well-educated, openminded men. And at base level, they are horrifically insecure. The moment you outshine them, they will retaliate. \n\n**3) good old boys/patriarchs**: does he do that THING where when another man joins the conversation, you get pushed to the side and not included? Big no from me! Does he introduce you, include you, keep including you if a bro-type keeps on wanting to talk just to him, and cut it short if the bro is a boor? does he act as if conversations/interactions with other men are the MOST important thing in the world, and any conversations/interactions with women are not that important, secondary, adjunct? Does he keep you or other women waiting? \n\n**4) expectations:** does he communicate what he wants? get angry/upset/annoyed if he expects something, you don't do it, and he actually has to use words? are his expectations normal, across the board equal for everyone, or does he expect more from women? if there's any expectation of domestic labor, that's a big no from me. Keep your own house, I have my own. Hire a housekeeper and don't be a cheapskate. \n\nJust a few off the top of my head. Hope this helps.

I was angry for the moment at the phone and then I got calm, she did not for 1h. Does she want a toxic relationship? \n\nSomething about myself, I did with her very freaky and kinky stuff because I'm not a nice guy. I always did good with girls, my confidence is so good that I never experienced any drop to it, not even 0.01%, and no stress at all. I settled down at 25 before meting her. Right now I'm not a beta provider, but I do boyfriend stuff like going to a restaurant once a month and paying for her food, getting her some groceries when I go to her place, etc. I never tried to make her jealous with no-one and she knows I'm trustworthily. The pp game is very strong and everyday(we initiate 60her-40me). She's settled down too, but she's bossy.

And every-time I hold her accountable she runs away. She told me \"it's not good because we can't even communicate\" and I told her \"i wanna show you that we can communicate, I'm open to talk but you run away when we need to talk\" and now is the part where she's going to ignore me 7 days. \n\nI don't want myself to be disrespected like that because, once you let yourself disrespect, you'll always be disrespected.

Fucking lol) and I came across a bunch of articles on male postpartum depression.\n\nFirst, let me clarify. I absolutely agree men can experience depression after the birth of a child. It's a huge, life altering event, and for some people, bound to have ramifications for their mental health.\n\nBut postpartum depression is a thing that women go through because they birthed a child. It is by definition, \"after childbirth\". It is triggered by the complex hormones that flood a woman's body after she gives birth. And I really hate that the term has been co-opted to say that \"men experience postpartum too\". No. They experience depression. They do not go through the hormonal fuckery that women go through after childbirth. They didn't go through childbirth!\n\nSaying that men experience postpartum too is to me like saying if my dad has heart surgery that I'm also in recovery because his heart surgery made me depressed.\n\nI understand why they use the same term because broadly it refers to the depression men experience after the birth of a child, but.. why is it only postpartum depression that has to be labelled with the specific type of depression it is? For example. Lots of men get depressed after losing a loved one. Or being broken up with. Or losing their job. Why aren't there specific names for those types of depression? Hell, depression in terminally ill patients doesn't even have its own name - it's just called depression.\n\nWhy is it that the medical condition that women experience due to actual physical changes in their body or the very unique experience they are going through, that gets it's own name BECAUSE it is DISTINCT from every other sort of depression - has to be co-opted by men to say, \"men go through postpartum depression too!\"?\n\nI don't know if I'm being ridiculous. Please help me wrap my head around why this is a thing.

p1dqkx	hostile sexism	Attraction is not created by what you logically say but instead by what you emotionally convey: Technical people, that is people who work in areas such as engineering, mathematics, computer science, etc., often have problems communicating in casual social environments.\n\nTheir primary issue is due to not understanding the difference between communicating information and communicating emotions.\n\nAttraction (either generic or romantic) is not created by what you logically say but instead by what you emotionally convey.\n\nSome of the most important information, such as if a person seems honest and trustworthy, is primarily communicated via the emotions felt during the interaction. \n\nThe same is true about attractive traits such as confidence and high self-esteem. \n\n**You cannot logically convince someone to like you**.\n\nIn addition, technical people often get stuck in their own heads and over analyze every little thing in an interaction. \n\nThe act of trying to process and interpret every piece of information takes you out of the present moment, making it even more difficult to communicate authentically on an emotional level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked this post then consider joining r/datingadviceformen
rtg3x3	neutral	Probably a no-brainer for most but stay away from Daddy's Little princess (high maintenance) type of girls.: I read an article a while back that said women from unstable homes require you to invest in them due to their insecurities it's a sunken cost fallacy that psychologically hooks you to stick around pretty much a shit test for dumb dudes who don't know any better or themselves have low self esteem and don't think that their relationship prospects will improve.\n\nThese women will weave a web and wait for some dumb guy to fall in and reward this crazy behavior and it usually works as long asa they're not hideously busted or fat they'll find some idiots to trick.
tasdc2	hostile sexism	Who designed the law requiring Men to fight in Ukraine while women were allowed to choose? And who is physically enforcing it? We need to talk more about how Men can stand up to Men that oppose Men's Rights.: Before I get into this, I want to clarify that I am by no means excusing the role of women in fostering a sense of prejudice against men in society. Women have always held tremendous cultural influence effecting the behavior of both sexes. Sadly we see - not all - but numerous women using that power to condemn men without a fair trial, limit men's parental rights, and strip men of economic opportunities.\n\n**However, I think our sub overly focuses on examples of women violating men's rights and we don't give enough attention to the men that are hurting other men.** The Draft/Conscription is a perfect example of this. Honestly, I find it *fucking stupid* to believe that every 59 year old man would be a more capable soldier than every 28 year old woman. Advocates for this clearly sexist practice argue that woman should go with their children to help preserve their culture. It may shock them to find out that *men also have children and are equally capable of passing on their culture.* Also, no one is requiring women to have a child or plan to have a child in order to be eligible to leave the country. Had Ukraine prevented women from leaving the country, it would have nearly doubled their fighting force. So, again, the entire idea is baseless and founded in prejudice. **Yet, it was a man that enacted the law. And who enforces it? Soldiers - other men. It's not just women that participate in misandry, but men as well.**\n\nSo what do we do about this? Anyone following the Supreme Court challenge to the draft will remember that the SC deferred it to Congress and Congress failed to pass a bill. The predominantly male politicians that supposedly have a solely androcentric perspective do not fairly represent male issues. How are we supposed to convince others that our lives have value when we haven't convinced a large number of influential men?\n\nI really don't have all of the answers. But I think it starts with getting men to question social expectations. Why am I expected to lift heavy things? Don't they know lower back pain is incurable and chronic? Do I really have equal parental rights if I can't decide to \\*not\\* be a parent while a woman can? Why does everyone get to vote, but only I am required to fight for my freedom? If we can get men to just ask questions, then maybe it will occur to them that their lives have equal value and shouldn't be readily discarded.\n\nCurious to hear what everyone thinks.

t2n58l	neutral	I wish feminists would quit using me as an example to attack men.: I was raped. I met an awful man and had an awful time. I didn't report it. It wasn't the fault of the patriarchy. It was the fault of one awful man. I wasn't scared of male cops not believing me, or dismissing me. I knew Id be believed and taken seriously. In fact that was precisely what I was terrified of - their belief in what had happened and the court dates and examinations. I didn't want to be believed. I didn't want it to be real. I wanted to pretend it didn't happen and go on as normal. \n\nIt's been many years since. I'm mostly fine now. I've left it so long that I can't expect any justice, nor should I. There is no evidence or burden of proof remaining bar my drifting memory. I can barely recall what he looked like. I will forever carry the guilt in my mind that many other women may have met this awful man as a consequence of my silence at a pivotal moment. This is my burden alone.\n\nI get angry everytime I see women tell other women that all men are evil and want to hurt women on some primal, instinctual level. As a rape victim this was the last thing I needed to hear, it made an already scary world more scary.\n\n Luckily actions speak louder than hollow words. \n\nIt was a man who helped me in therapy to process my rape. It was a man who made me feel comfortable having sex again. My obstetrician is a man. My favourite teacher, professor.  It was my father who read me bedtime stories. It was a little old man who lived next door who walked miles in blistering sleet and rain to get me a present on my birthday. \n\nThe baby I'm carrying will be a man one day. And I wanted him to be a girl so very badly. \n\nNot because I was scared to raise a boy - or because I don't like them, but because I know how hard he will find the world. I know that if he's ever raped. He will have to worry about being believed, he'll be dismissed as a hollow statistic or doomed to never even become one at all. He'll feel his manhood stripped from him. If his girlfriend punches him, he'll be laughed at instead of protected. He will live his life at the mercy of a culture that believes half the population without seeking proof and believes the other to be instinctively cruel. His life could be irrevocably destroyed at the utterance of one lie and there's nothing I will be able to do to protect him from that. \n\n I don't want to be used as an example of my son is doomed to be evil.
so705r	hostile sexism	Rant: I can't understand the thought process of women who think it's okay to treat men like shit because that's what happened in the 1950s. Like women are going to use the excuse of the oppression in old times like they were the ones oppressed that much and pretend it's a good excuse to bully males who had nothing to do with it. They act like it's out fault our female ancestors were oppressed and we should take the blame.
nbec2d	neutral	Women are choosers and it literally does not matter what men want: In the entire animal kingdom females are the sexual selectors. Exceptions exist (like some random species of fish that rear the offspring or something) \n\nBut women are meant to choose and men are meant to be the sexually exploited ones. I'm using the term exploited because I mean it in a biological sense; as in, they are meant to be competitive in attracting a mate. They're supposed to impress US. The \"pickmes\" shouldn't be women. They should be men. \n\nOur culture is backwards from our biological cues. Our way of dating, relationships and courting all revolves around the sexual exploitation of girls and women, instead of men. It feels unnatural because it IS unnatural.\n\nIt got this way because men have put a lot of effort (through production of media) into taking that role themselves and conditioning us all into getting used to it. They want women to impress THEM. THEY want to be selective (even though they're not the ones with the burden of offspring) because they feel entitled to evvvvverything.\n\nWe get announcement after announcement from men about what THEY want. \"I'm am ass man, A boob guy. Men don't like when women...blank. Men like women who...blank.\" some women are really sensitive about it. It really hurts them to hear that they don't fit the standards that men have laid out. \n\nMeanwhile who cares tho.\n\nIt's all talk. Men don't have sexual selection skills AT ALL. They're desperate. They swipe on everyone. Their desire for impressing women controls them. Their frustrations over failing to impress women destroy them.\n\nThey can talk a big talk about all kinds of stuff; only wanting 20 year olds or insisting that women need to sexually satisfy THEM I order to be \"gifted\" a commitment or relationship. But look around you. Men are OBSESSED with us. At all ages, in all demographics. They can't stay away. They scramble to get our attention. They literally pay for us to touch them. Single men DIE earlier than married men. They call porn a neeeeeeed because it literally feels that way for them. Because they're miserable without us. They're biologically at a huge disadvantage because their desire controls them. Meanwhile we have power over them because we don't have that desperation and we function just fine without them. \n\nWomen are waking up. The upcoming generation sees it because more women are participating in media, so women's art and voices are being heard by other women. AND we communicate freely online at places like this. It's starting to click. \n\nThe bad news is that the pool of acceptable men is minuscule because of generations of denying our biological role. So at the point in time it's ROUGH. The appealing men are few and far between, the bar is in hell, and most men are still in denial over the fact that they need to do better. It takes a massive amount of luck to even come across a decent man. If you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't. But if you're here you have an advantage because if you know FDS then you know that you're a chooser, not a pickme. You won't exploit yourself ever again. You'll dedicate all that energy into **your actual role in sexual partnership: vetting and selecting, and making THEM impress YOU.**\n\nDon't waste another second of your life worrying about what men want in a partner. It literally does not matter at all. It's about what YOU want.\n\n\n\n**Someone just rightfully pointed out that men use \"humans are animals\" into justifying hedonism, violence and immortal behavior. I didn't even think to address that hang up since this is a community of women and women don't romanticize the stone age the way men do...**\n\n**But I forgot about all the male lurkers,**\n\n**So I'll add that: humans are animals with an undeniable biological guides. But if you're reading this that means you are among those of us who chose to live in a civilized society. We're not in the jungle. We don't let our biology guide our every move. We don't partner JUST to mate. We embraced our morals and capacity for conscious thought and have built structures to prevent hedonism and animalistic chaos from dominating our lives. We decided to punish things like rape, murder and pedophilia despite any biological urges because we (most of us) have moral fibre and functioning human brains, so we determine what parts of our biology are worth embracing and which ones hold us back**\n\n**In this case, it doesn't hurt anybody or cause moral dilemmas to embrace the natural biology of feminine sexual selection. In fact, the reverse (to deny it) is much more violent and \"animal\".**\n\n**So no it's not the same as men running around trying to justify their pedophilia as \"bIoLoGy\". That should be obvious and im sure it is to most of us, but I felt it was important to add for all the male lurkers because they don't need any more fuel to their fire of justifying things like rape, pedophiles, \"spreading their seed\" and cheating.**
tbrupt	neutral	maintaining healthy boundaries: I've been dating someone for a year and would like to share some of my journey from a dating strategy perspective.\n\nI consider myself an OG.  I've been living on my own and financially independent since I was 18, so 15 years \ud83d\ude01 I have 2 degrees, 3 if you count the one from the school of hard knocks \ud83e\udd23 and a beautiful diverse work history going from janitor to barista to social worker to business systems manager. I've been with my therapist for almost 7 years, I have healed childhood wounds, taken accountability for myself, forgiven myself, showed up for myself.  I have strong relationships with my family and friends, fun creative and active hobbies, I've created a stable happy life for mysekf and my daughter.  Her father and I coparent and are friends.  I am not perfect, there are still many things that bring me to my knees - there are still many triggers that I am working through.  \n\nDating is field of land mines, and there is nothing so sure to me as how important it is to practice setting and maintaining healthy boundaries.  You start with yourself, keeping the promises you make to yourself first and foremost, before you can even think about others.  Want to lose 10lbs and keep telling yourself you're going to start tomorrow? Want to be treated with respect but keep telling yourself the other person has good excuses for testing you poorly?\n\nStart with yourself. This is echoed here often, and with good reason.  How can you expect yourself to stand up to and protect yourself against a master manipulator if you can't stand up to yourself??\n\nWe spend a lot of time living in our egos.  Listening to the stories it tells us about how we deserve bad things.  The most useful tool I can tell you will help you in your dating life is mindfulness.  Observing your thoughts, allowing them but acknowledging that *they are just thoughts*.  Pausing before reacting.  Recognizing your nervous system has shifted into response mode and instead of engaging with the environment that triggered this, taking that as a sign that you need space and time to be curious about your body's reaction.\n\nManipulative men count on you to react without pause.  Keeping you in a state of hysterics keeps them in control.  I actually learned this bc my sister, who I've not been in contact with for several years now \ud83d\ude4f is an abusive narcissist who targeting me for many years.  I felt so *obligated* to her, until I learned how to set and maintain healthy boundaries with myself.\n\nThe issue was, I didn't think I deserved to have those boundaries.  I second guessed myself constantly - I thought about what others would think of me, instead of just focusing on what boundaries did I need in order to feel safe and happy.\n\nIt turns out that I definately deserve a safe and happy life, but I curate that for myself every single day when I wake up.  I chose to listen to my body the moment it feels disregulated, choose to observe my thoughts with curiosity and compassion. I chose to be diciplined with practices that I know keep me mentally physically and spiritually centered and build my resilience.  I feel more compassion towards others bc I have compassion with myself.  I feel strong in moments of adversity bc I've *practiced with myself*.  You may have heard suggestions for things like cold showers - the benefit to things like this is training your nervous system to respond better to stress.  Who the heck would choose a cold shower?  Well, I certainly don't choose to be targeted by malicious people, but it happens and I want to know that I won't abandon myself when that moment comes.  And when that moment does come, my body will surely send signals to do a whole bunch of things that aren't necessarily true to my higher self and I want to be ready.  So I chose to practice, I turn on the cold shower and step in, everything tells me to stop it but instead I focus my mind and connect to my body and practice allowing the discomfort to fade.  I am in control of myself, and I withstand the cold and smile.  In 5 minutes, I've given my body a chance to practice what it's like to be resilient, a chance to use that skill when it counts.\n\nThere are so many instances I've struggled to know what it right.  When your reality has been questioned your entire life, you don't trust yourself.  You MUST relearn to trust yourself.  So many of you hear are experiencing this in real time - my rational mind tells me this is not ok, my buddy tells me this is not ok, so why can't I stop allowing it? Why do I keep going back?\n\nStart small, but the answer is that you must learn to set healthy boundaries with yourself.  You do this by being diciplined in practices that facilitate mindfulness and resilience of self.  Dating is going to be a dumpster fire unless you either get incredibly lucky or do this work.\n\nI didn't believe that learning this stuff within relationships is perfectly acceptable.  There are people who really need to pause and get a handle on themselves, there's others who are burnt out, but many of you are in the in between and I think it's ok to be in less than ideal dating scenarios if you are being very self aware and have the goal of staying true to yourself.  The journey is important, but you also have to balance this with protecting yourself.  If you meet a guy who is showing some HV traits but starts digressing, how do you react?  Do you freak out at him and send blocks of texts about how you deserve better? (I've been there). Or can you recognize that their behavior is discrepant with your expectations and that is not a reflection of your own worth?  My point is that, if you're sending blocks of texts IT'S OK. Learn from this, watch yourself, feel your feelings and try to understand why you feel SO STRONGLY.  9/10 you are responding to an idea inside yourself that *what they are saying is true*.  You deserve to have compassion with yourself in these moments, learn from them that your big reaction is bc you may still not have the skills you really need to return to your higher self in these moments.  \n\nSo build those skills. When you set a standard or boundary for yourself, keep your promise to yourself first and foremost every time.  If you decide that a healthy boundary for you in dating is that you don't want to have sex without commitment, then in the moments where society or people or especially yourself is trying to convince you that this is wrong, be resilient and true to yourself.  WRITE IT DOWN and repeat it daily if you need to.  The point is that YOU DECIDE what is right for you when you are in the state of connection with your higher self, and when you are NOT, you better be ready to lean back on yourself to guide you.  Too many times do we find ourselves doubting our own selves and abandoning promises we've made bc we have not focused on building the skills we need to actually connect back to our higher selves in moments of duress.\n\nSo do hard things.  Face your fears. Set small goals and achieve them.  Even something like \"staying hydrated is important to keep my body and mind healthy, so now i will drink a glass of water every morning before my coffee\" is an incredible way to set a healthy boundary with yourself and practice sticking to it.  How many mornings will you convince yourself it's not important? How many nights will you be too tired to get the glass and place it on your bedside table? How many times will you listen to these voices tell you to NOT do the thing you know is good for you because it's HARD IN THE MOMENT?\n\nIt is very reasonable that you would fail to be true to yourself when dating someone if you can't get through exercises like this one.  It's OK, you're not a bad person, you are just human. You can build this resilience in your daily life.  But until you do, you should not expect yourself to magically know what to do within the setting of a relationship.  Relationships are *all about testing boundaries*.  What this should be is a test to make sure two people are aligned, but often it's a test to see if you will abandon yourself for the benefit of another.  I believe that's human nature as well, those people are in the same boat.  They can't keep promises to themselves so they look to others to do it for them.  When you can identify that in yourself, you can identify it in others, and it stops being so personal.\n\nI hope this post is helpful, because it's taken me a very long time to work all this out.  I still am reactive, I have CPTSD and there are some things that will always trigger me.  But there was a big shift when I realized I was doing only what my body mind and soul was equipped with - I was doing the best with what I had at the time, but I have the power to give myself more.  I started to be more disciplined in keeping promises I made to myself. I practiced mindfulness when I was having  thoughts of self hatred.  I looked in the mirror and said things no one ever taught me to say to myself - I am brave, I am strong, I can do it.\n\nThis guy I am dating, I have kept him at arms length and he has not wavered in his dedication to me.  Who knows what will happen, I'm not attatched to an outcome.  But what I know is that throughout the year, getting to know him and observing myself and how I am responding to being in a new relationship, my last being 8 years with my daughter's father, I watched myself fall into old habits and then watched as my lack of healthy boundaries had immediate negative relational consequences (defensiveness). I have also watched myself process this behavior, realign with myself, and reinstate those boundaries with immediate positive relational consequences (compassion ). I have worked hard at building these skills.  \n\nIf you project your shit on people, there's 2 things that can happen.  The other person is secure enough to recognize this and will gently step themselves away, or they will meet you with the aggressively defensive energy.  I want to tell you that there has been many times where people have projected on me and my security flew out the window and my defenses went flying.  What is important is that I could recognize all this later when I was calm, and put some new measures into place to work towards being more secure.  Does he? Reacting poorly when your cornered (imo) is not the mark of low value person.  Reacting poorly after the fact when everyone settles down is.  What you look for is that there is accountability and an adjusted response, and that the next time it happens it looks different based on what is agreed.  If you can process with a partner and see improvements, that's a green flag.  If you're made to feel guilty or shamed, that's a red flag to listen to.  Everyone makes mistakes, they can either be learning opportunities or an opportunity for a manipulative person to gain more control over you.  Your ability to maintain healthy boundaries with yourself okay a big role in which path you will take \n\nPeople are complex.  But intention and good faith effort is important.  This is what I've learned.  I'm responsible for maintaining my own boundaries.  Conflict will come up, and if you cant turn towards yourself you will not be able to expect someone else to turn towards you either, and you will have no baseline to truly evaluate the other person's value in your life.  If you DO learn to do this, then you will see clearly who is worth your time and who is not.  \n\nEat your vegetables, move your body, do the hard thing, and above all be kind to yourselves \ud83e\udde1

There are TWO I would classify as good-looking, one with terrible acne scarring so that's a big asterisk - that means there's ONE unreservedly handsome man (though he IS short.) The rest range from average to TROLL. One guy looks like a gangly scarecrow with terrible hair and fuzzy yellow teeth like he seemingly never brushes. Excuse me WHAT?!? At least on the original US version they cast all attractive people. To cast only attractive women and then mostly ugly guys... Hateful.\n\nThe other issue is the age ranges. The women are all mid twenties to early thirties. The men range from 23 to 56. WTF?? You're setting these lovely women up to FAIL, to be let down and/or taken advantage of. I already know the spoiler that 23 y/o f\\*ckboy Yudai with the bad skin &gt;!lied to his 30 something fiancee about wanting kids because he knew that's what she wanted to hear.!&lt; He also proposed to her without breaking up with his two other main candidates first, SO disrespectful. Even on the Pick Me Olympics aka The Bachelor they have the decency to break up with the other girls first. He had no business being there, he had no intention of being a husband. OTOH we have 56 y/o Shuntaro dating \\*30\\* year old Ayano, he's LITERALLY old enough to be her father!!! So so gross. He spoke to her SO paternalistically too, like \"I want to take care of you\", \"I want to help you achieve your dreams\", etc. Like a dad. He should have NEVER been cast unless there were also women there in their 50s. (Oh right, women in their 50s are dried up and useless, no one would want them... Grandpa here is fine though...)\n\nTo sum up I think the casting people really failed these beautiful women and should be ashamed. Definitely speaks to the misogyny in Japan that they thought this was okay.
tdnwve	neutral	How do men feel about a woman telling them they are pretty?: I told this guy at the laundromat he was pretty. His expression completely changed, he was super sweet. I wasn\u2019t being flirty, he was pretty, he looked like a model.
t9abec	hostile sexism	If men are the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of marriage, then all the divorces and marriage breakdowns we see today, is their fault.: You know the popular saying about how women are the gatekeepers of sex while men are the gatekeepers of marriage? That same one that these manosphere males often use to castigate and shame single mothers. Their logic is that since women hold the \u201ckey\u201d to access to sex, then it is up to her to ensure that she picks well. As such, subsequently, she has to take responsibility for her poor choices if the man turns out to be a deadbeat or a terrible father that abandons her and their child. Often, she is also accused of pushing the man away by her \u201cbad attitude\u201d to the point that she \u201cprovoked\u201d him into no longer wanting to be a part of his family\u2019s life.\n\nBy this logic then, it means that all the marriage breakdowns and the high rates of divorce, is because men are choosing their partners poorly and/or they\u2019re engaging in activities that eventually push their selected partners away. They are not intelligent enough to pick partners that they are most compatible with, and to whom they can put most optimal effort towards. So the degeneration of society with the high divorce and marriage breakdown is their fault, as they ultimately hold the \u201ckey\u201d to marriages.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect them to ever accept this line of rational reasoning though. When something that women apparently hold the key to, falls apart, it\u2019s women\u2019s fault. But then when something that men hold the key to, falls apart, apparently it\u2019s ALSO women\u2019s fault. At no point is it ever a man\u2019s fault for his own demise. He is excused for his bad behavior as society constantly only points the blame at women.\n\nLadies, know this and know peace: It is male nature to dodge and evade accountability. Taking responsibility for anything is like kryptonite to them. And is why in these modern times, hardly anyone has respect for men in general anymore, and they have become the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes virtually and in real life. Frankly, I see it only getting worse and the meaning of the word \u201cman\u201d continually likened to shame and disgrace. A tragedy.

t3idew	neutral	Strategy: How to get your ex to move out.: I just saw a post on another forum of a woman who had an ex that was refusing to move out. It had been months since they had broken up. Every time she asked him about it he would start crying and manipulate her into letting him stay there.\n\nMy old roommate did this to me too! Here\u2019s how I handled it. \n\nTell him you have someone else moving in. \n\nThis is a bit of a long con so you\u2019ll have to be lying for at least a month, possibly two.  \n\n1. Make a post on Facebook Marketplace and share it to your personal Facebook. \n\n2. Talk about the messages you\u2019re getting. Hmmm this person looks good, one person seemed awful, etc.\n\n3. Tell him you\u2019re leaving the house to go have coffee with a girl who might become your new roommate.\n\n4. Come back excited! She sounds great and really needs this place for whatever reason. \n\n5. Give him a deadline time for when she moves in. \n\n6. Tell him he has to be out by noon the 1st.\n\n7. Start packing up or organizer your things to \u201cprepare\u201d for her arrival. Maybe sell some things you already don\u2019t need because \u201cshe has a better one.\u201d I literally sold my couch\u2026 she no longer had a place to sit around and be lazy all day.\n\n8. Make it less pleasant for them to be there. This one is critical. For example, Turn off the internet randomly. This will annoy the crap out of him. When he asks about it say that it\u2019s working fine for you. (Bonus if you have an Internet provider that allows you to turn off specific access to the Internet based on the devices.)\n\n7. Hire cleaners to come in and clean your place the day he\u2019s supposed to leave. This will make it really uncomfortable for him as realizes he needs to get the fuck out.\n\nIn the end my roommate never actually found a place to rent. She barely looked. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even start packing until the night before and then she called a friend crying saying she needed a place to go. \n\nThe intensity of the situation was the ONLY thing that pushed her out. \n\nShe really believed somebody was moving in and I have no doubt in my mind that she never would\u2019ve left without that thought. \n\nP.S. If you have an ex who is violent I don\u2019t recommend this strategy, this is best for lazy men or ones that manipulate you to let them stay by crying and playing the victim. \n\nKnow that he might try to beg or cry right to the bitter end. Remember, crying is a form manipulation. Don\u2019t feel bad for taking charge of your life and your living situation. It\u2019s your home and he can\u2019t stay there. \n\nShe was literally crying as she was walking out the door. It was hard to watch. Stay strong, it\u2019s not right to hold somebodies home hostage. \n\n\nNote: Yes, of course I agree this is completely terrible of me to do\u2026 I normally don\u2019t agree with lying or manipulation but it had been six months of trying to get rid of her and I was at the end of my rope. This was the most strategic, calm, and polite way for me to go about it without having things escalate.

sgyh4u	neutral	You ladies ever browse the women on dating apps?: Disclaimer that I identify as a cis, generally straight woman, so I realize for my fellow queer ladies this question is ridiculous lol.\n\n\nI'm not a huge fan of apps for meeting men. I am American and have lived in East Asia for nearly four years and I've realized that due to the culture here (and the pandemic) it's quite difficult to meet people. Many of my foreign friends have moved back home and I was looking to mix it up in my friend group. I decided to try BumbleBFF. For those of you who don't know, you can use Bumble for meeting friends, and even for work connections. In the BFF mode, I mainly see women. But you know, curiosity got the better of me and I occasionally toggle to the dating tab to browse guys in my area.\n\n\nIs anyone else of the same mindset as I am and feels the disparity between men and women's profiles is just like... way too fucking much? I see this written here every now and then but my god man... For all of the whining and complaining I see on this site about men feeling entitled to sex and women \"withholding,\" the general lack of effort is appalling.\n\n\nI want to start by saying I've met a couple nice guys on Bumble with a fairly solid profile, but for the most part, men's profiles:\n\n\n-lack a bio\n\n-lack pictures of their face (and these days, wow the masks are everywhere)\n\n-lack a bio. I have no idea of who they are or what they're about\n\n-IF they have photos, they have no idea how to present themselves in a positive light. Angles a mess, lighting a mess... you look a mess.\n\n-many guys post derogatory photos, which I can only assume they're posting to insinuate they're down to fuck... however, even if I or my friends are of the same mind, I don't think that's the best approach to attract someone lol\n\n\nGENTLEMEN. Even if you checked \"something casual\" these fields are still important. Give me an idea what you're like, what you're into, and make me feel interested.\n\n\nLadies profiles:\n\n\n-substantial bio\n\n-pics. No masks. Angles and presentation are solid, giving me an idea of their style, hobbies, and general appearance.\n\n-even girls with a sexier profile tend to have more substance, and lack a derogatory undertone.\n\n\nI don't really understand why this is so polarized. Of course this is such a general statement, but it's really alarming. On BumbleBFF, I swipe A LOT of cool girls, but I rarely swipe men on the dating tab. I realize we're all bombarded with media that caters to a male gaze, and as women we are constantly aware of what men like to see, but are men really that clueless as to what women might find attractive? It's so disappointing, honestly. A lot of these guys aren't unattractive. I can only assume they just really have no clue how to present themselves.\n\nI was thinking about it recently as I watched an episode of TryGuys  where the guys made tinder profiles and they just got roasted for how weak they were. I'm sure I'll get downvoted or hate mail for this, but I would love to know if I'm the only one here...
t9kopc	interpersonal sexism	Disturbing feminist attempt to give Lorena Bobbit a redemption arc: For those who don't know, Lorena Bobbitt is a woman who cut off her husband's penis in the 90's while he slept. In court, she claimed she did it because her husband abused and raped her over the years (without any proof). Her husband vehemently denied the allegations (and in fact claimed that Lorena pressured him into sex the night she mutilated him). That night she did it, she told police she did it because \"He always have orgasm \\[sic\\], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish.\" Neither eventually got prison time. However, in recent years, feminists have began to sympathize with Loreana Bobbitt. About 2 years ago, there was a docuseries starring Lorena Bobbitt, where she's painted as a huge victim of her husband (again, without any proof). NY Times wrote a piece defending her as a victim in 2019:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/television/lorena-bobbitt-documentary-jordan-peele.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/television/lorena-bobbitt-documentary-jordan-peele.html)\n\nNow imagine for a moment that a man mutilated his wife's genitals while she slept. And then claimed that he did it because she abused and raped him (and had no evidence of either). No one would listen to him, and he'd go to prison for life. Just another example of \"Believe All Women\". Even if the man is the victim, he deserved it (according to our feminist society). It's so easy for a woman to be an abuser, and then put the entire blame on the man, and society will always believe her.
t3yxyl	hostile sexism	So I get a lot of stares , people think im extremely hot when I'm just an avg looking dude with a lean body but yet women stare a lot and almost none below 7 on the attractiveness scale. The post on askmen was a shitpost but I dunno about here: I've gotten a few questions , first is why the fuck do I get stared at , why does this staring mostly happen in the cities where I live in like sure women check me out but not straight up stare which is great. The final one is why do women below 7 on the attractiveness scale not stare , it feels kinda weird , it feels weird when you catch the same girl stealing glances at you multiple times and if I was truly hot some girl would have approached me right? But no that doesn't happen. People take it seriously that women get stared at but men getting stared at is false now? Like it doesn't happen at all? For god's sake I've caught quite a few and yet my family and friends think I'm just fucking with them.
tdupj4	neutral	When you\u2019re dating someone, would it turn you off if she\u2019s pregnant?: I reckon it would turn some men off if I\u2019m not carrying their child. I\u2019m currently 36 weeks pregnant. The last two guys I\u2019ve befriended both left me after hearing that I\u2019m pregnant - one ghosted me after I told him over text, and another ghosted me after our first date... they both showed interest in me before that so I\u2019m puzzled.

Now she's posting about how she's proud  of being  300lbs. And *EVERYONE*  is all  \"slay, queen\". Diabetes, stroke, and heart attack are harder to  diagnose  in Black women.

I\u2019ve taken it personal lately and I\u2019m starting to not see it that way. It\u2019s still hard because I have different wants and needs and if I could I\u2019d see her everyday. Last night I went over to her place and once she was off I told her I was over, she seemed happy about it and was glad to see me. This morning she told me it made her uncomfortable. I also have to ask every week if she wants to see me and she never asks, which I\u2019ve brought up to her. She said she\u2019s just tired from work and that\u2019s why she never asks, but it\u2019s even on our own days off we technically have together that I always ask. Am I being too much? At least in that aspect I feel I\u2019m putting in a lot of effort and she\u2019s not doing much. There\u2019s no bad blood or other issues.

t14m9i	neutral	Confirm the coffee date - Dont show up: I woke up in a mischievous mood today. So yes confirm every single coffee date and low effort date right down to the minute of yea \"Im here where are you\" you say \"one minute away\". In that one minute you roll over unmatch and continue your day. If he asks you for a house date, especially \"let me cook you dinner\"  go as far as \"just got out of my uber he dropped me off kinda far I will be two minutes. Walking over.\" and then you unmatch and eat your sushi and wine to an episode of your favourite show. Leave him and his left over noodles and hotdogs scratching his balls. You are a on a night out and he is like \" Im out too but oh drop by and we can share a glass wine it would be nice to meet you\" say yea totally \" I can meet you at your place in 30 min let me know when you are home, I hope we will be alone\", and when he lets you know he is home (because he will leave his night out for free effortless sex), you are on your way for an hour (while you are enjoying your night out, even passing your phone to your g.fs so that they can help you lie) before you eventually un-match and leave him with his blueballs. You get the gist. LOL.\n\nIs this cruel yes, is this unfair yes, but nothing about dating kind especially to women. Men have no problem leading you on, having sex with and then ghosting you without remorse. Men will leave their pregnant wives/gfs, wives with young children, wives of 20 years sometimes with no rhyme or reason and  again no remorse. When this happens everyone arounds you gaslights you that you must have seen this coming, you missed this or that, you should 've , not all men etc etc. But these are just justifications for evil that people use to cope because we have normalized co-existing with this level of inhuman wickedness.\n\nCoffee and walking dates (and everything free) have dating in 2022 in a chokehold. No matter what there is a camp of men and sadly women who swear by this.  Same with OLD. Everyone knows it low effort, could be dangerous and truly an utter waste of time but there is always a but there is always someone with an exception. I truly hope women on this sub and everywhere who have found diamonds in the rough of low effort /OLD understand they are the exception and not the rule. If there were many exceptions it would be the rule. \n\nBTW my strategy at the beginning is just for laughs. One day when I have a lot of time I will do it  especially the guys who like to package like they are worth the time and out of nowhere spring their cheapness on you hoping you will go along with it because you are emotionally invested, oh they especially deserve that treatment. But its not worth it. Because cheap people will always find a way and you really cannot change anyone. Only the very dumb still propose coffee dates they know we have caught on, innovative cheap guys want to become your friend. They play the long game because they know women are generous with friends. You are comfortable with him in your space etc, he listens he is kind...He is just unavailable for some reason until one random night at you weakness he is available for sex but dont get it wrong he cant be in a relationship and you as his friend understand. For older ladies cheapness is the new impowerment. He is your ally, he believes in equal pay etc, he can even cook, but he believes in 50/50. Or if you plan the date you pay. Only he never plans any dates. He likes to be at home, with you sucking on his... because his love language is quality time and physical touch. Or as soon as you love him \"he falls down on his luck\" and you are the supportive gf who is later turned to bitter wife. You know the drill.\n\nAnyways I didnt mean to make this post long but I hope you got a good chuckle and I hope you dont get stressed over no d. You are valuable ladies, dont forget the diamond in you, no matter how many times the world has tried to chip at it you are still a indestructable. Keep shining !!

You only post about the worst cases of females who are spoiled and have no idea about equality what makes it appear like that's what the majority of feminists are. I dislike those people too. But let's be real here. Most of these are Americans. And no offense to Americans but they are a bunch of drama queens. Male and female. But subs like this also bother me because you represent the same just with the other gender. You dislike the way this group of "feminists" handles equality?

Instead of posting click bait articles of the worst cases or cases that aren't even that bad when you read through it and actually have rational discussions about this subject? Just a little input to maybe think about 😊
t35cfh	hostile sexism	Why do psychologists have so much trouble understanding and helping men: Recent research conducted in Australia has focused on the challenges experienced by psychologists working with men, in an attempt to explore why so many therapists have difficulty enegaging and retaining male clients. The researchers used open-ended responses to a survey and an inductive thematic analysis to identify common themes. \n\nSeidler Z et al. Challenges working with men: Australian therapists' perspectives. Journal of Clinical Psychology. 2021-12, 77(12):2781-2797.\nwww.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.23257\n\nThree main themes explaining why men are so difficult to engage emerged from the study: 1. men's wavering committment and enegagement; 2. men are ill equiped for therapy; 3. therapists are uncertain how to enegage with men. While to study subject is laudable and has a high clinical need (given the high rate of male suicide), the conclusions disturbingly echoe feminist ideological framing of masculinity as a dangerous doctrine, and leave me even less likely to engage with contemporary Australian psychologists.\n\nThe conclusions of the study suggest that psychologists/therapists need to be better trained to engage effectively with Australian men. This sounds OK, but a deeper reading of the study conclusions revealed a more disturbing and sadly sexist conclusion. The authors of the study suggested that \"improving therapist's understanding of masculine socialisation as an underpinning factor in men's presentation to therapy and the manifestation of their distress could have far-reaching impacts in helping therapists achieve positive outcomes\". Sounds like blaming men and their masculinity for their problems.\n\nThe reasons for this conclusion are not clearly explained, and are certainly not directly supported by or related to the results of the study. The related citations are all of the same authors, or feminist gender studies. However, the demographics of the study responders, and some of their response may provide further insight. \n\nFirstly, 71% of responders were female, reflecting the gender imbalance in the Australian therapist professions. This gender imbalance is dismissed by the authors, and its impact simply ignored, regardless of the fact that several therapists noted that the gender of the clients was a problem (just being male).\n\nComments by many of the responders suggested that the maleness of their their clients was not well understood or caused them discomfort, and at worst revealed therapists practiced in a prodominately female orientated framework or a culture of misandry: \"I find it difficult to not feel intimidated by adult male clients\"; \"Having to balance feminist principles of the work I do .... with not pushing a feminist stance too hard - some men react poorly to this...\"; \"There seems to be a lack of the natural understanding and concept of inherent sameness than when treating female clients\". This framing of men as \"other\", as not-female, as problematic seems to be more related to the therapist than the client, but was also ignored by the authors.\n\nWhile the authors identified several limitations of the study, they did not identify the gendered imbalance of the profession/responders, the potential misandry of the responders and the researchers, and the obvious confirmation bias that limited the conclusions of the study to reiterate themes previously explored by the authors, attributing the poor engagement of men in therapy to problems with masculinity, or in simple terms, blaming men.\n\nIt seems there is little hope for men seeking help in Australia, unless they are willing to accept the prevailing feminist view that masculinity is a dangerous and damaging doctrine.

t2c924	institutional sexism	Seeking FDS advice for dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace: This isn\u2019t related to dating, but I hope there are principles I can apply. I work for a large private corporation in the US which has ex military in most senior leadership positions. \n\nFirst incident: I went into a male coworker\u2019s office. His mousepad was a photo of a young woman with very large mostly exposed breasts. The mousepad was two large silicon mounds, which were her breasts, and to use the mousepad you place your wrist in the valley of the woman\u2019s cleavage to operate the mouse on the mousepad.\n\nI complained to HR and they deactivated his card access to the floor I work on. The building has three floors. Aside from this, I have no idea if he ever suffered any negative consequences.\n\nSecond incident: A different male coworker tells me that my name, first and last, is the same name as his favorite MMA fighter. I tell him that I haven\u2019t heard of this MMA fighter. He brings up on his monitor a photo of a woman nude from the waist up and she\u2019s covering her nipples with her hands. I don\u2019t report this to HR but another coworker reports this to our boss. I have no idea if this man encountered any negative outcomes.\n\nThird incident: A few days ago a male coworker walks past my desk and he has a pretty big hole in the butt seat of his jeans, about five inches long. His underwear and underwear covered butt is clearly visible through the hole. I don\u2019t believe that this man intended to harass me, but really how hard is it to come to work with your butt covered?\n\nDoes this qualify as a toxic workplace? What would you do? I\u2019m looking for another job, but I am being selective about where I\u2019m willing to work and it may take some time.

sz1ldq	neutral	Is Leaving Early the New Coming Home Late for ZVM Who Buy S*x Workers?: So I live in a big city, in a neighborhood that is on the rise but still kinda dicey at times. (Yes, I am working on leveling up and getting out of here!) The area is sometimes a magnet for sex workers. The weird thing I've noticed is that they don't seem to show up on the streets until 4AM or later now. Because my German shepherd likes to get up for early walks, I frequently see these gals on the streets around 6AM. Lately I've noticed that the sex workers are sticking around later and later every time. Working the streets in BROAD daylight. This morning, I walked to my corner coffee spot and one of the gals was in there at 8:30AM, looking worse for wear and strung out as hell. (Sure, SeX WoRK iS SO emPOwErIng). Poor thing, she complimented my shirt and obviously just wanted to feel normal for a minute of her miserable life. \n\nAnyway, what I'm realizing is that \u2014\u00a0in this working class neighborhood \u2014\u00a0these sex workers are clearly fulfilling a demand that happens early in the morning \u2014\u00a0NOT late at night like we're used to typically thinking men buy sex workers. These guys are buying sex workers at 7, 7:30 AM. The NVM johns are obviously leaving their wives' and girlfriends' homes early and claiming to go to work. Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone out there has a friend or family member who's suspicious of their NVM leaving the house too EARLY. I wouldn't have believed this unless I'd seen it myself.
snvfii	neutral	Slave Leia is "Huttslayer Leia" Nowadays...: Slave Leia. You know, the 30+ year moniker given to Princess Leia as she was portrayed for a stretch of scenes in RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983), from marketing and toys to official costume designs. I mean, with her in the gold-trimmed bikini, with the collar and chain on her neck and her unusually silent and submissive behavior around Jabba...that makes perfect sense, right? Hell, HE probably referred to her as "Slave Leia," because for that time, **she was his** ***slave****.* Yet, nowadays, feminist-minded girls like [Kir Manda on Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mandaklorian/video/7021129007265484037) get such a kick out of Disney's post-#metoo retcon of the image. That retconned moniker? Yeah, they now call her "Huttslayer." Feminist YA writer Claudia Grey, AKA Amy Vincent, coined this term in her 2016 novel *Star Wars: Bloodline*, when a character sees Leia and refers to her as such. Since then, feminists (and cosplayers, and Tiktokers...) everywhere have been all rah-rah-rah about this title, because their beloved Princess is now being referred to for her triumph over Jabba the Hutt, rather than the fact that the only reason it came to that is BECAUSE he sexually overpowered and objectified her for a time. So yeah, if you see someone referring to Slave Leia as "Huttslayer," maybe correct their discourse. She was always, and is, and always will be, SLAVE LEIA. \#SlaveLeia \#JabbaLeia \#huttslayersareposers

tchepw	benevolent sexism	If He Wanted to He Would, God Edition: I am pissed enough to make a whole as$ post about this: Someone recently made an excellent post about Woke Bros and their tomfoolery and I wanted to expand on my comment there because I see these dynamics daily as a leader of a spiritual community.\n\nSpiritual communities, from the leftiest of the left to the uber-conservative, organize themselves in similar ways.  By and large, when it comes to men, they attract the best of the best and the worst of the worst.  \n\nYou *can* find men who share your values in these places--in fact, it's a great place to do exactly that. But terrible, terrible predators flourish in spiritual communities because that environment is a heady blend of power and vulnerability.  When the encounter between spiritual/divine power and human vulnerability and longing for meaning is allowed to happen in a safe, boundaried environment, people heal and grow and discover whole new depths to themselves, while going on to serve others in joyful, committed ways.  When it is co-opted by power-hungry men, you get abuse of all kinds, which attracts and grooms LVM into becoming abusers themselves.  \n\nReligious power is serious power.  When abused, it ruins lives and keeps women and other vulnerable people in generational oppression.  When used rightly, it changes the world (think the Black Church in US Civil Rights or Gandhi's satyagraha in Indian Independence). \n\nSo how do you know if that good looking man you just glimpsed at the Ashram/Yoga retreat/Friday prayers at Mosque/BLM meeting/Bible study/Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is worth entertaining?  \n\n**Introducing: Spirituality Vetting: If He Wanted to He Would, God Edition.**\n\nActions speak louder than words\" and \"if he wanted to, he would\" apply to his spiritual life as well. If he's so \"spiritual,\" his actions should back it up. \n\n* What's his literal, actual spiritual practice? Showing up at meetings/services/gatherings to troll for women doesn't count. Spirituality via meme and throwing around deep quotes on social media *especially* doesn't count.\n* Does he pray/do yoga/meditate etc. on the regular in a serious, dedicated way?\n* Does he do his spiritual practice when people aren't looking or only in full view of the world where he can get credit for it?  \n* Does his spiritual work/practice/life come from inner motivation? Or is he just capitalizing on the latest performative trend in your space?\n* Is he an actual *contributing* member of a spiritual community, *including financially*?  Most spiritual communities need financial support of some kind from their members.  Is he a giver or a taker? This will translate to your relationship. \n* How many hours of volunteer work is he putting in a week for the spiritual community or the wider community?\n* Does he support the ethics of your tradition only if they're convenient to him or support his interests? Or worse, require women to adhere to a stricter form of the tradition than he holds himself responsible for? (of course the big one here is sexuality) \n\nI have less than no time for spirituality by proxy that only shows up for convenience or impressing others.  On the right this shows up as building the Perfect, God-Fearing Family while still watching p0rn in secret. On the left this is the endless competition for points in the Woke Olympics while using women's bodies for tantric sex and then ghosting them. No ma'am. \n\nPay attention to *your* spiritual practice, whatever it is, and use it to strengthen you against LVM.  Don't let it get derailed by them.\n\nAlso remember this: pretty much every spiritual tradition teaches that there are consequences for low value behavior.  Let God/Goddess/Spirit/Source use you to BE the consequences for these LVM by cutting them out of your life. \n\nIn other words, when you block and delete, you're doing the Lord's Work.  Amen.

My theory is that we are already TOO THREATENING with makeup anyway, so we really don't need to assert our superiority even more with makeup tricks.

nzv7z4	neutral	You should have an active social media presence.: If you're actively dating, it's imperative that you actively have a social media presence. Everyone I've recently dated consumes a bunch of insta or snap stories, and getting your content out there helps them keep you in mind. \n\nI don't care if it's pictures of your pets, reposted memes or gym pics. Give em the opportunity to slide into your dms. If someone is interested in you it might just be the excuse to they need to start up or restart a conversation. If you're actively talking to someone it can break up the \"getting to know\" trudge of early communication.\n\nMake yourself available (just not too available)

He told me that he feels like a 16 year old spiritually and he would rather go for a woman in her 20s. He lives with his mom and is in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

t5zetm	neutral	Sex-based medical bias. Should we agree with feminists on this one: Some context:\n\nI'm a female to male transsexual and there is this notion that trans men are less misogynistic because we \"know the struggle\". I made a tweet basically saying that I have never been the victim of misogyny and had a gender neutral upbringing.  A few of my followers agreed stating that they too had neutral upbringings and had not faced misogyny before.\n\n\nQueue the feminist, probably particularly irked not only because of my statement but also that I had noted that I didn't start transition until I had already moved out and started adult life and my childhood took place in a very conservative Catholic area.\n\n\nHe essentially went on to say that I must have faced misogyny at some point.  A little back and forth, mainly me saying that I either didn't face a particular situation or a situation was not inherently misogynistic. One point, however, he just didn't let go of.  That point was medical bias against women resulting in a discrepancy in the quality of care that women get.\n\n\nNow if you had asked me if women's medical care can be lacking due to societal bias, I would have probably said \"yeah that seems like something that would happen\" and moved on with my day.  But seeing as he was essentially saying I was wrong about my own experiences, I felt attacked and instantly went into defense mode.  Such is one of my faults, but it worked out interestingly this time.\n\n\nInstead of just agreeing, I actually put thought into it. And so, my beliefs have shifted to be more nuanced. Way back, we simply didn't know of all differences between men's and women's bodies nor did we have the technology to detect these differences, let alone even start researching how these differences could impact health aside from the purely sexual. Because of this, it was assumed that men and women generally function the same. Because of this, most testing was done on men because men were seen as more disposable and therefore more suitable to be guinea pigs. Because most testing was done on men, we knew more about men's bodies and were less aware of treatments that would work better for men than women, let alone why that might be.  This was also limited by the technology we had at the time.\n\n\nIt's a bit simplified and reality is almost definitely even more complicated, but this is what I find more believable than his response of \"it's all because of misogyny\". Of course, me being just the average wage slave and by no means qualified, this is just my personal theory (if you can even call it that). And of course I'm open to being wrong. But nonetheless, I ended up disagreeing more with the feminist than I would have had he never even contacted me in the first place.\n\n\nAnd so I pose this question: is there evidence to suggest we should agree with feminists on at least some level on this? I know that by asking this sub, the answer will probably be biased.  But given that I've already listened to the feminist answer, it's only fair to give the MRA side a listen too.\n\n\nBonus: one of my followers who happens to be a (much more reasonable) feminist chimed in with \"women are often denied painkillers\". I kinda took that as true because I was just not focused on him, but now I'm thinking that could be more complicated too.  Men are after all denied painkillers too. Is it more disproportionate towards women? Is there evidence to show medical bias against men in some instances?

o54jol	neutral	My (21m) Gf (21F) told me that she doesn't have sympathy for my issues: \n\nMe and my girlfriend have been dating officially for the past 2.5 months and have been knowing each other unofficially for the past almost 6 months.\n\nOur relationship was going amazing up until around 2 weeks ago, she lied to me about some things, one being the identity of an ex, and another being a rather strange lie (see other posts on my account). This created some tension in our relationship but now it just feels like its gone down the can.\n\nLast night we were talking, and she brought up how I was upset the other day. I was upset because I moved to a brand new city and knew nobody, I have always struggled to make friends my entire life due to bullying and such. But I took a lot of socially energy to make plans with people that day, who ended up bailing last minute. I was frustrated, and sad but I didn't take it out on anyone, I was just in an off mood that night. I told my GF about it at the time and I didn't really feel supported or like she cared, but I shrugged it off.\n\nAnyways she brought it up last night and said that she doesn't like how I throw a pity party or that I whine about problems. And then proceeded to say that she doesn't have any sympathy for a lot of issues I have in my life. This hurt me quite a bit to hear because in the first month of our relationship she didn't act like this towards me, she was very supportive of any issue I faced in my life (not that I face a lot) I'm just confused why she is no longer acting like that and is now cold to my issues. Her tone gives me the opinion that she doesn't care and that \"her issues are more important and difficult than mine\". Which I don't think is fair, I believe that in a relationship, both peoples hardships are valid no matter what they are, and you support each other accordingly.\n\nOn the contrary she \"whines\" or \"throws a pity party\" over things all the time and I don't react like that, I either offer to help or just sit there and let her vent to me. One of these things she brings up a lot is about cleaning her house because she has a 2 year old who likes making messes.\n\nI felt like what she said was downright mean, when she is upset she often gets aggressive with her words and says things like \"you're too sensitive\" \"all these talks about our issues are dumb\" \"I don't need you in my life\"\n\nThe talks she is referring too is that when I am upset in a relationship, I like to sit down and talk in a way that is \"When you said/ did this, it made me feel like this and I don't like that\" (which I think is the healthy way to argue/fight). When we have these she clams up and doesn't really have much input or she gets very defensive and says hurtful things. Often the apology she leaves me with is one that I'm not satisfied with. Because she doesn't act like she is genuinely sorry. Idk whenever I upset her I feel very guilty and try my best to not do those actions again.\n\nShe often tells me how I should and should not feel and that I need to get over it. For reference, she told a pretty big trickle truth lie to me that I was upset over because I think honesty is very important in a relationship and she told me that \"nobody else in the world would care about this, get over it\"\n\nI talked to my therapist about it and she said that how my gf tells me how I should and shouldn't feel is a big no no. I agree, but like in the first month she was so good to me and reacted in the correct ways to all these issues, and now she is someone else. It feels like I'm dating an entire new person, this isn't the person I fell in love with.\n\nI am proud of the fact that as a guy I can communicate my emotions with people in a way that is not violent at all. Even when I'm extremely mad at someone I sit down calmly and say \"when you said this it made me feel like this\". I feel like that because I don't yell or act mean when she upsets me she doesn't seem to realize the gravity of how much something hurt or upset me idk, but I don't believe in yelling at people or getting aggressive with words or actions when you are upset, my mom taught me better than that. Maybe I'm a little sensitive but I'm 21 have graduated, has an amazing job, and a very profitable side business and my own place as well. Idk, I feel like my sensitivity and people skills have helped me in being so successful at my young age.\n\nI am currently being stonewalled after I texted her and told her that what she said to me last night hurt my feelings, I'm honestly tired of it. Has anyone been in a relationship like this before? What happened?\n\nI just want things to go back to how she treated me in the first month of dating.\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend has become heartless to my issues, told me she has 0 sympathy for me, gets angry in arguments.

ortdto	interpersonal sexism	Megalomaniac girl - Vent: Recently, I was browsing Facebook and decided to try one of the many meeting groups to meet someone new and see if we could click. I saw this cute girl who was on a dating page and decided to try and talk to her. \n\nWe start off pretty mildly, I introduce myself and start asking about her. She doesn't talk too much, but doesn't seem bothered by having a chat. After a while I notice that I've been asking about herself and carrying the whole conversation from the beginning, while she hasn't asked me a single question. All she knew about me was in my first introductory sentence and she didn't seem interested in asking, or most likely didn't realize, even when I told her \"I am going to finish my questions soon, next I'm gonna ask about pets, you might want to ask me something\". She didn't get the joke but started talking about her parents getting a labrador after she moved out. \n\nI was puzzled at her behaviour, but continued talking to find out more. I asked about relationships and here is when shit unfolded. She started talking about how she is single because she cannot find someone on her level: she has a master's degree in psychology/marketing, a prestigious job (not really, but she puts it down like this, and has been working only for little more than 1 year), and has literally tens of interestes from rafting to deep diving to anything you could think of. She wanted someone with the same academic titles and same interests since she was never home and always around for work or leisure. To which I replied that the only person with her same interest and self worth is herself. \n\nAfter this the discussion kind of died, I realized she was some sort of megalomaniac who values people's worth only on titles and thinks way too highly of herself. I was left puzzled and mad about how she failed to realize she wasn't contributing anything to the conversation. His is that meeting this kind of people leaves you such a void inside?
tbohsb	hostile sexism	The written goal of feminists, as declared in texts from the 1970s, is ending the relations between the sexes. Feminists have not been honest with women about what are the goals of statements feminists have been pushing to women, so women are following feminists thinking that it's about equality: Women are following feminists thinking that it's about equality without understanding that there's a lie at the heart of feminism, that equality is not and never was the goal of feminists, and that the purpose of the convictions feminists have been promoting among women, is utter and complete separation between the sexes save for technical sex for either pleasure or children without a relationship. Feminism does not understand love. It does not understand that every human being and not only women, is dependent on love from the other sex (in the heterosexual realm). They see that love is dependency and conclude that love is weakness and a harmful state. They are the inventors of Women Going Their Own Way - WGTOW - in the 1970s, to which men responded with their own MGTOW but this was merely a response to feminism encouraging women to annihilate the relations between the two sexes of humanity, to "rely only on yourself and think only of yourself" - this message was not invented in MGTOW but in WGTOW, aka, feminism, because feminism's goal was never equality, but separation. Feminists have been distorting for women facts to incite them against any relations with men - they told them that any couple-hood is abusive and an exploitation. They lied to women. For example, they told them "see, married men live longer than unmarried men - proof that couple-hood serves only the man" which is a blunt manipulation, the most probable reason for this data is that women don't tend to marry sick poor men, and men who are not sick and poor tend to live slightly more. They have encouraged women to divorce, explained to women that the slightest dissatisfaction is grounds for a divorce and described a divorce as "freedom" and as a trip to the Caribbeans ("Yacht" is a true association of many women to the word "divorce"), while at the same time feminists helped enthusiastically giving men the opposite message - the "take responsibility" and "be a grownup" message - a culture that tells men "your obligation is to put up with anything and KEEP the marriage" (feminism always likes to collaborate with conservatism when it suits its purposes), and feminism also enacted laws that would make it extremely dangerous for men to initiate a divorce, creating a situation where if a man does consider it, he is often afraid to become homeless or even imprisoned and avoids initiating it, and when as a result of this encouragement to women and inhibition of men, 80% of divorces were initiated by women, feminists returned to women with the lie "see? marriage are bad for women, this is why they are initiating divorce more than men do" - while it was feminism itslef that created these proportions. Feminism is lying to women time and again, because feminists know that if they say the truth - "we want to end the relations between the two sexes, equality is not the point" (by the way, "equality is not the point" is a title of a feminist article from recently, that is, from after feminism took off the "humanist" mask in October 2017 when it took over me too to create fascism out of this important phenomenon and came out as the fascist racist (anti-male racism) movement it is) then no woman will support them, so they have been lying to women by distorting information for decades and by telling women "this is about your equality", while it never was, and feminism also tagged any objection to the lies as "anti-women", "anti-equality", so women never heard the falsification of the lies and believed them, and today the sexes are separated in the west and the separation is constantly rising, feminists have succeeded. And this has nothing to do with technology by the way, the same technology DOUBLED the relations in all types of homosexuality. Because homosexuality was never targeted by feminism, feminism's actions are against relations between the sexes and hence this is what is being annihilated, DESPITE technology, which without feminism, as in homosexuality, should have caused A RISE in relations, not a decline.

tcef4m	hostile sexism	My little opinion text on women's rights, discrimination against boys and men and little bit about our politics here in Finland. Command opinions below.: Women's rights haven't been a big problem here in Finland where I live. Still we have these 3rd and 4th wave feminists who say women's rights are a big problem. There was once an interwoven between one I'd say a feminist and one guy and there was some shenanigans about the Finnish word neekeri wich means nigger in Finnish. The biggest mess came when this guy used the word two times. First was to quoute a politician and second was from a book that was made in 40s. this feminists skin colour was little brownish but still not really black. She said "I feel really uncomfortable in this space because I am here with a white man who said the n-word two times". The thing is in Finnish the "neekeri" word was for long time the only word to describe a person who has black skin colour and black people don't have the same kind of history in here than in America. The conscript military in my opinion isn't bad thing here as it teaches those city soyboys at least some things about not living in their humble studio in the middle of everything. Then our prime minister, Sanna Marin and the central government is made of reds and greens (the leftist party, social democrats and greens). She is not really professional. Biggest thing I could say is that she went to party WITHOUT her work phone, WHILE she was exposed to Covid-19. And mostly the red green central government we have hasn't done anything that good. If there is too much of my political opinions and you don't like it please say it and if any questions come to mind go ahead and ask.

t4symv	neutral	It's never the right time.: No matter when you try to bring up discrimination or sexism against men, it's never the right time. \n\nWhen you bring up how male only draft is unacceptable you'll be shut down by people who accuse you of trying to divert the conversation from \"real issues\" that actually affect people in everyday life. Cause it's not like the draft will ever be relevant again, right? Then you try to bring it up when men are forced to stay put and fight a hostile invasion, but then it's also not the right time, because people are dying! Suddenly people are all pragmatic about things and acknowledge how men are better suited for war, so this overt sexism suddenly becomes justifiable. Strange how that happens. Equality goes out of the window when reality comes knocking on your door. \n\nThe public conversation is completely dominated by women's issues and even attempting to raise awareness to discrimination against men is seen as an attack on women, even as men are literally thrust into war en masse. \n\nWhat the men of Ukraine experience now is a worse and more undeniable form of sexism than anything women had to endure in the civilized world in the 21st century, yet it's still not acceptable to talk about it.

tbrynz	neutral	How people see MRAs: Basically, I believe that how people see men's rights activists is really messed up. In society, if you say you're an MRA, you're gonna get laughed at. And the image that's been formed of us really makes me feel just so mad.\n\n Feminists are seen as radical, human rights supporting, good people by society nowadays, even though most of them are just beating a dead horse at this point. But it's very hard to make people see just what kind of culture is developing in society, and it makes me really angry that we can do so little to stop it. There ARE injustices against guys happening on a massive scale, as a recent example the Ukraine-Russia war. You'll notice no-ones talking about what's happening to the guys in Ukraine.\n\n Circumcision is still not seen for what it really is, a pure violation of male rights that exists only because of a tradition to stop men from masturbating, even though this is obvious if you do the TINIEST bit of research. Guys are losing court cases against spouses and partners who've domestically abused them, they're being forced to pay child support for a kid that isn't theirs, they aren't generally believed when they say they've been sexually assaulted or raped, and even when they are believed they're told they're 'lucky' and 'they should be happy they had sex'.\n\n All this is because of the stigma that's slowly growing against guys. It's not black and white, and will likely never be, and I'd be a fool to try and explain all of it in a post. The said stigma, that's enforced in the media and even movies, is leading people to believe that guys have no problems, even when the suicide rate, homicide rate, and assault rate is SO GODDAMN MUCH HIGHER against guys. That's why MRA's are seen as losers who complain about nothing, and the problem is that EVEN SENSIBLE PEOPLE DO THIS. People have been influenced by society so much it's disgusting, but we've gotta persevere and attempt to rebuild our image. This isn't about any political group either, we're one human race and we've gotta learn to see and solve the problems for ALL groups in it, and that's what we have to start rationalising to people. Aggression isn't going to solve anything.\n\n Thanks for coming to my TED talk!

The first was involved with a man 10+ years her senior. The other with a man 20+ years younger after escaping a bad marriage.\n\nReddit is a cesspool where every time a woman posts about a behaviour that indicates an abusive mentality of her boyfriend / husband, people minimise, say its just one isolated incident and she's exaggerating, tell her to CoMmUnIcAtE, give him a chance, etc, etc.\n\nNo. It's never just \"an isolated incident\" when it's indicating that the man thinks and operates like an abuser. It's a tell that clues you in to the bigger picture... If you know what to look for.\n\nBut women don't know. Nobody teaches you how abuse works, how controlling men operate and think, what the patterns are and what \"small things\" are actually serious indicators of danger. Nobody teaches you how to vet instead of walking blindly into a relationship with someone. Nobody teaches you how to build a solid psychological, emotional and financial foundation so you are empowered to leave an abusive relationship. Ignorance on this topic is widespread and absolutely catastrophic.\n\nAnd once you're involved with an abusive man, even if you do want to leave, you will be in danger if he decides to get revenge for it. Time and time again in my country, women seek help for years but he still gets to them eventually. \n\n\nThe victims are completely innocent and blameless. But they're still dead. And to add insult to injury, people will say it was their own fault for picking the wrong man... While bitching at anyone who tries to teach women to recognise red flags and leave before things get worse. While bitching at any woman who dares actually have any standard and be selective. \n\nWe are lucky enough to have access to the information. So use it. Avoiding getting involved with this kind of man in the first place is the best thing we can do to protect ourselves, while we strive to better society as a whole. The predators shouldn't be there, and it's not fair, but they are and they're not going away any time soon. \n\n\nPeople say we're exaggerating and being paranoid. The thousands of women murdered by boyfriends, husbands and exes every year would beg to differ.\n\nJust remember: Vet like your life depends on it, because it literally does.
t2rap2	institutional sexism	On Pornhub blocking russian users. A strategic move and some history lessons.: I guess everyone is aware of the ongoing war between Russian and Ukraine. However for this post I really don't want to discuss politics but what Pornhub is doing and highlight feminist issues in eastern europe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt starts with me reading that Pornhub has blocked russian users a couple of days ago, if they tried searching for Pornhub the only they would be met is the Ukrainian flag. Later this day was a comment left on the sub worldnews by a user on the news that Switzerland started blocked russian banks             \n\n\n\" Hackers anonymous, Pornhub and now Switzerland, the power rangers I didn't know existed\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm paraphrasing this and someone can definitely check me but it was in these lines. This comment was what prompted me to do a post. This was  a smart STRATEGIC move by Pornhub. A lot of people know the name Putin but not who owns and cashes in on Pornhub, the site that helps sex traffic kids, show rape videos of kids and women and has normalized sexual abuse and torture of women. By deciding to block russian users they position themselves on the \"good side\". There are several flairs that they have that capitalize on easter european girls. \n\nA history lesson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Fall of the Soviet Union\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_trafficking_in_Europe&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fall of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) has been identified as one of the main contributing factors in explaining the recent increase in human trafficking. It provided both human capital and new regional opportunities to fuel the expansion.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_Europe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKligmanLimoncelli2005-11) After this period, trafficking victims, primarily women, expanded to include more diverse forms, aided by the rise of organized crime, corruption, and the decline of borders.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_Europe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShelley2010-12) Porous borders and close proximity to Western Europe have made it easier and cheaper to transport victims within the region and abroad.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_Europe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKligmanLimoncelli2005-11)\n\nsource:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex\\_trafficking\\_in\\_Europe#Causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_Europe#Causes)\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=russian+prostitute+90%27s+katja&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-layKmKD2AhX0olwKHapuDQ8Q2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=russian+prostitute+90%27s+katja&amp;gs\\_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoHCCMQ7wMQJ1CQDVi9FWDbFmgAcAB4AIABeogBnASSAQM2LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=SpcbYv7IOPTF8gKq3bV4&amp;bih=625&amp;biw=1366#imgrc=B8SBToJ9GrwfSM](https://www.google.com/search?q=russian+prostitute+90%27s+katja&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-layKmKD2AhX0olwKHapuDQ8Q2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=russian+prostitute+90%27s+katja&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoHCCMQ7wMQJ1CQDVi9FWDbFmgAcAB4AIABeogBnASSAQM2LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=SpcbYv7IOPTF8gKq3bV4&amp;bih=625&amp;biw=1366#imgrc=B8SBToJ9GrwfSM)\n\nThis image above has often been reposted as to symbolize the collapse of the soviet union. A young prostitute, Katja 18 years old. (Idk how to link without all the extra text). Think about it. A young russian prostitute, a symbol of decay.\n\nI follow a known youtuber, Valeria Lipovetsky. She did a video with her mom that fled to Israel when the soviet union collapsed and one of the reasons was that she was scared for her daughter since kidnapping and trafficking girls was so big at the time. \n\nI think porn capitalized on the influx of sex trafficked Easter European women first by making the category Eurobabes. Then movies came along that played one this stereotype. Has anyone watched American Pie? Remember Nadia? Why are all of Donald's Trumps wives eastern European? Coincidence? \n\nUkraine has before the war been a poor place with shady laws. I'm a Christian and several years back I used to follow the YouTube fundamentalists Bethany and her sister Kristen. I'm out of the cult but occasionally I pop up on fundiesnark and read up on them. Kristen couldn't have kids so she and her husband went to Ukraine to adopt 2 boys...it took them no more than 6 months. Adopting kids from Ukraine was before the war borderline criminal. Fundamentalist also change the kids original names and force them on their religion. \n\nUkraine also allows for surrogate mothership ([https://qz.com/2133797/russias-invasion-is-damaging-ukraines-booming-surrogacy-industry/](https://qz.com/2133797/russias-invasion-is-damaging-ukraines-booming-surrogacy-industry/)) now there are news stories of \"poor\" couples who can't get \"their\" babies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Surrogacy is fraught with ethical and moral considerations. It is a process that can exploit vulnerable women. It carries significant health and psychological risks.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The children of surrogacy arrangements are deliberately separated from the only mother they have ever known the moment they are born.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The international surrogacy market appears to have significant and growing overlap with human trafficking.**\n\n[https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/how-surrogacy-harms-women-and-children](https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/how-surrogacy-harms-women-and-children)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis move by Pornhub is such a ugly but smart strategy. These POS are trying to strategically put themselves on the good guys side after decades of exploiting these girls. I hope to see one day blocked swift payments for them.
tc6bd3	benevolent sexism	Is there any way we can hijack the Latina subreddit? I'm so disgusted my entire ethnic &amp; female identity is a porn sub. Is there anything we can do? Has this ever been done before?: I'm so disgusted the entire Latina identity has been made into a porn sub of over 1M pornsick most likely white males. This should be a sub focused on worldwide Latinas sharing their experiences, not pornsick fantasies. It makes me sick to my stomach I can't even type \"Latin\" into the search without getting nsfw subs. \n\nIs there anything we could do as FDS? I know we have significantly less FDSers than the 1M pornsicks. Do ya'll think we can band all the female subs together and maybe even find a way to get other Latino subs? Can a sub get hijacked? Maybe we can reach out to other social medias and get women who otherwise don't use Reddit to make accounts just for the cause to outnumber these scrotes. \n\nI used to follow a cute sub called \"tight \\*insert provocative name for cat\\*\" and I thought it was hilarious cause it was literally just cats in tight areas. I'm assuming it used to be a porn sub, but may have been hijacked for the sake of... cats lol. We should be able to do the same for women.

Now, yes yes, I know that anti-feminist groups like MRAs and MGTOWs have their own little set of stats to say that men actually have it worse ('men are a majority of combat deaths', 'men are a majority of prisoners', 'men are a majority of suicides' etc) but let's remind ourselves why all of those points are basic statistical manipulations or rooted in hypocrisy: **"Men are the vast majority of combat deaths in war”** * Because for 99.9% of history, militaries and governments led exclusively by men deemed women too physically weak and biologically inferior to be in the army, so combat forces were solely comprised of men. Even today women are still excluded from combat roles in a lot of countries, and they were only allowed to start applying in developed world countries within the last 10 years (2013 in the U.S., 2016 in Australia and the U.K., etc). So obviously men will be the majority of combat deaths, since they have consistently decided they're the only ones fit and able enough to be out there. Plus this ignores civilian casualties of war, a lot of which are women. **"Men are the majority of prisoners"** * Men commit over 90% of all homicides, 86% of violent crimes and almost all sexual violence crimes. What do they expect the numbers to be, 50/50?? **"Men are the majority of suicides"** * Women attempt suicide at 3 times the rate men do, and suffer from psychological disorders that lead to it twice as often. Men simply succeed in committing suicide more, despite attempting it far less often, because they typically choose more violent means such as putting a gun in their mouth or jumping off a building, whereas women choose less violent means such as taking pills and falling asleep, which give a much greater chance of something going wrong, changing your mind at the last second and calling for help or being found in time etc. **"Men may be the majority of high paying jobs, but they are also the majority of construction workers and brick layers"** * Only because the toxic masculinity permeated throughout the trades effectively keeps women away from them. And some of these jobs pay a lot more than women make in fields they traditionally dominate such as teaching and social work. Plus, it's laughable hypocrisy to constantly talk about women not having a greater share of high prestige/high paying jobs because they CHOOSE not to do them, yet then ignore men CHOOSING to go into these types of fields. Last time I checked, nobody put a gun to their head and told them they had to work in construction. People have tried to shut down women's causes and gaslight us for years, but on this Women's Day I say we take a stand to reaffirm our resolve, remember what we're fighting against - all that societal injustice - and NEVER let the likes of the MRAs, the both-sides crowd, men scared of losing their privilege or other unscrupulous individuals gaslight and trick us from continuing the fight. Whether that be through 'we're equal now', 'sexism is over', 'women are actually privileged' or anything else, it's all crap. Stand up for yourselves and your values, stand up for the women around you, and let's change the world!

t385ge	neutral	Man I'm just disappointed and I realised something. Sharing my perspective.: Well this post might not be worthy of upvotes but I just saw something and I'm really disappointed. \n\nI am a guy who always supports gender equality and I always support men when they talk about gende equality. So just to let you know this is not a hate post or anything, I'm an active member of this sub.\n\nToday I saw a video of a man beating bis daughter because she was texting someone on Instagram... I'm from India and that video is from India too, some families here are really like this and this stuff happens here.\n\nWell I opened the comments and all the comments were \"haha this is gender equality\" \"this guy deserves to be our prime minister\" \"this video made by day\" etc etc stuff.\nI can share the link of the post here but all the comments are in Hindi.\n\nI'm really disappointed with them but also at the same they're spreading a really really wrong message. Violence should never happen from any side, a father abusing his innocence daughter is not something to enjoy.\n\nIf a girl will read those comments, her hate for men will really increase. Trust me even my mind got shocked after seeing that people were enjoying that video.\n\nMy point is that supporting gender equality is right but the way it's done is sometimes wrong. Like when I see a post about a woman talking about some kind of sexual abuse, someone will comment \"men get raped too\" and I think \"yeah but this wasn't the time to say that buddy\".

syle9p	interpersonal sexism	The ultimate groping hypocrisy: I think it’s finally time I share this insane hypocrisy I came across not too long ago. Let’s compare just how differently gropers get treated depending on their gender. [Over here](https://youtu.be/A6zXSkKkoMQ), we have a female fan running into the field to hug a male athlete. Besides being tackled, handcuffed and escorted out by security, she walks away scot-free. And [here](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1236558-college-world-series-features-wild-woman-running-on-field-grabbing-butts.amp.html) we have a female fan running into the field to grope all the male athetes’ asses. Besides being escorted out by security, she too walks away scot-free. But what if the genders were reversed? Fortunately, I happen to have the answer right here. [Here](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/10/10/football/sofia-huerta-tigres-houston-dash-spt-intl/index.html) we have a male fan who groped a female athlete’s chest. He now faces a lifetime ban from all the club’s facilities and matches and is likely to face prosecutions. What’s even more hypocritical is the way they were caught. Both women were seen in hindsight and fully caught groping the male athletes on camera, but nothing was done about them. The man on the other hand was seen allegedly groping the female athlete in the background of a selfie someone took and was identified after the authorities put time and resources into tracking him down which led to him facing the consequences listed above.

skiqnp	internalized sexism	Ramblings about Feminism, how do we progress past feminism?: I'm a woman, I've grown up under this indoctrination, currently I'm working on a book though it's in very, very early stages. I've been writing for well over a year now on my thoughts about feminism and it's flaws (I say this because any extra inspiration for the topic would be appreciated). I don't know how I want to aim this book yet but I'm thinking I specifically want to aim it at teens and young women to try and give them some parables about the dangers of feminism. So in the beginning I like most other girls played with dolls, wanted to be a mother all those kinds of things. The indoctrination into feminism starts in first grade though it is never spoken by name then, it starts with them telling boys and girls that they are equal, that a girl can do anything a boy can ect, this goes on until about 10-14 when girls start to notice that they are different from boys, that there is a strength difference, a difference in interests and the way that they act. It's at this point that feminism starts to be pushed as a way of equalizing men and women, it's not uncommon for girls to be very distressed by developing especially with all these messages about sexualization and feminism and how they are victims which is where this gender stuff is being pushed from. The messages we give to young girls about being a woman is almost 100% negative and it makes them resent themselves, resent being female and go out of their way to try and prove everyone wrong. The most I was catcalled in my life was not when I was a fully grown woman, I was catcalled for the first time at 14 and that continued until about 18. Young women are told this will go on indefinitely but really by 20 you don't get cat called nearly as much, especially if you appear to be confident and with other people. Then you factor in social media and the pipeline from instagram to onlyfans and the call from feminism to sexualize yourself. It's all a carefully concocted narrative to catch all types of women in it's grasps. We are then pushed into higher education a lot of the time even if there is no particular interest where drinking until your blackout drunk and meaningless sex is encouraged. Even more confusing is how we've stripped most of the language around dignity and sex away and only left the words "rape and sexual assault" and aquated these with not having a positive sexual experience. What I mean by this is women have sex to show love, when they have meaningless sex they come away from it feeling as though their dignity has been violated, they have been played but they don't have the words to express that so when feminism is yelling that having a negative experience in sex is rape, and no other language exists, they think "something nonconsensual must have happened I guess". So all of this mixed with everyone telling young girls that they shouldn't want to have kids, that it's something to wait until your 30s to do, to focus on career and money of course creates girls who think they don't want kids only to be derailed by their instincts and not even understand why. Feminists have completely infiltrated this, where conversations around "baby fever and broodiness" are shut down and they deny that maternal instincts even exist. It's taboo to even talk about wanting kids right now as a woman, my boss told me that I shouldn't want kids because he hates his kids, I've been told by women all around me for years about how kids will ruin my life, so no wonder I was surprised when I felt joy holding someone's baby for the first time and feeling love for this little creature that's not even mine. No wonder we are a society in decay, we thrown out the cornerstone of civilization where women have babies and create good members of society and let it sink to the bottom of a river. How do we teach the next generation the parables of all of this?
t6ct1c	institutional sexism	The exposure of misogyny against famous women is a massive part of the revolution.: As Andrea Dworkin says, the fate of one woman is the fate of all women, and it is does not discriminate by wealth, status, age, race, or rank.  \n\nThere's been a massive exposure of how celebrity women are grossly abused by the men around them. This is a big deal for many reasons. These women's trauma is incredibly public and that must be a whole different level of traumatizing. We're seeing how wealthy and powerful women's assets are so often exploited and controlled by men around them. We're seeing how their children are harmed in the process, and how these mothers try to protect them.   \nSo so many of us are hurting through the pain alongside these women. I foresee this being a colossal turning point for women's rights. \n\nIt puts a glaring spotlight on the truth of Dworkin's words: **one woman's fate is every woman's fate.**  \nWe stand behind Kim. She is a woman and she deserves to be free from male terrorism.   \n\n\nI chose Global Resistance as the tag because it is in every woman's best interest to globally unite in support of one another.

sq8sjr	hostile sexism	The double standards for men are insane and I’m tired of it: Just something I’ve been thinking about more recently that a lot of people don’t agree with. This seems like a good place to post this but remove it if not One: why is it that if a man doesn’t like giving oral he’s called a whole bunch of names and completely crapped on by everyone and his mother but when a woman doesn’t want to give a man oral it’s a different story. If she doesn’t want to she doesn’t want to but for the man society says he’s less of a man because he doesn’t want to give oral. Realistically it’s just a preference and if your partner doesn’t like something man or woman you should respect that and find something else they like or find someone who can meet all your needs if they can’t. It doesn’t make them less of a man or woman, it just makes them human. Two: if a man can’t get it up, doesn’t matter if it’s a health problem or what instantly frowned upon, can’t please his woman this and that. Sometimes it just doesn’t happen and I think that’s okay. Sometimes you can be mentally there but physically not however if a woman doesn’t get wet that’s somehow the man’s fault and he’s bad at sex. She could have a health problem or some women just can’t get all that wet, why are there so many double standards when it comes to all of this in the bedroom? It’s annoying and I’m so tired of sharing these opinions with people just for them to stumble on their words and insult me instead of giving me a reason why either of these make it okay to bash men and applaud women. I don’t understand this hating men culture/double standards; It’s gross.
pr4j4r	hostile sexism	Women leading on: Hey lads \nHere's the situation, I wondered if anyone could give some advice. \n\nThe last 6 or so romantic encounters I've had with women have all been them leading me on for attention. \n\nLast night a girl grinded on me in a club for a few hours, got her number and the next morning it turned out she had 0 interest in me. \n\nAt this point I am numb to feeling used and rejected but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't angry or sad. \n\nI feel very much done with women I feel the respect I once had for them is gone. \n\nEvery time I bring my problem up to my female friends or family they don't know what to say and sometimes even get angry at me which just pushes me further away from them.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I feel there is no hope. \n\nSo my question is how can I avoid being lead on ?

t8ymo9	interpersonal sexism	The utter disappointment of realising that all the men in your life are low-value: Hello ladies, I'm writing this post in the midst of a crisis, so forgive me if it'll be all over the place.\n\nI've just had the umpteenth argument with my brother, and I've finally admitted to myself that he's a misogynistic abuser. Not that I wasn't aware of his attitude before, but today... I've had enough. So much so that I've decided I'll grey rock him from now on, even though we live under the same roof.\n\nI'm the eldest sibling in my family, and the only female, so I obviously received a different treatment growing up. My behaviour was constantly under scrutiny: as a girl, swearwords were forbidden, and if I happened to reply disrespectfully to my parents out of anger, or express my thoughts and ideas more harshly than appropriate, I was always scolded and made to feel like I was defective. The same can't be said about my brothers. This brother in particular is the epitome of entitlement and male privilege. He is so much freer than me that he can be condescending and verbally abusive towards my mum without any consequences. It's always been like this, although his behaviour has degenerated over time, since now he's an adult in his mid twenties and his rage is still as disruptive and over-the-top as when he was a teenager. Now that I've been to therapy, and I've developed self-respect, I firmly and calmly stand up for myself whenever he gets mad at me, and I also take my mother's defense when she's the target of his rage. However, the same can't be said for me. Nobody, and I say NOBODY, ever takes my defense whenever he's abusive towards me. Not even my dad, who is the only one that my brother respects. And guess what? These rage exploits are only aimed at the women in the family, i.e. me and my mum. I'm sorry to say they are probably also aimed at his girlfriend, since I once heard him rage against her for no reason - at the time, I called him out on his behaviour, and his girlfriend was very embarrassed, so I believe this is not uncommon in their relationship.\n\nTonight, my family and my brother's girlfriend assisted at another one of his fits of rage against me, and nobody said anything. He even screamed profanity and told me to \"shut the fuck up\". I won't go into detail, but the reason for his anger was absolutely absurd. At that point, I turned to his girlfriend and said \"I really hope he doesn't treat you like this in private, because it would be very serious\". I finished my food, cleared up my place, and left. Still, nobody said anything. I swear I even saw the shadow of a smirk on my dad's face, but I really hope it was only my imagination, since he's not a bad man and he's never been abusive - just low-value, I guess. Which brings me to the point of this rant: today, I came to the realisation that ALL the men in my life are low-value, since even my dad allows this kind of behaviour to the detriment of his own daughter. It's no surprise that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for four years, struggling to feel accepted and loved by a low-value man.\n\nIs there a silver lining in this realisation? Well, yes. The mere fact that I'm now able to recognise abusive behaviour, and that I refuse to be treated like shit, is great. Therapy works, I guess. The one thing I know for sure is that I will never, EVER allow another man outside of my family to treat me like my brother - or my father, with his indifference - treats me. Tomorrow everything will go back to normal, my brother and my parents will pretend that nothing has happened. But not me.

He goes to another school in another state (NYC) but is from the state that i go to school in. We talked all night and exchanged contacts because I plan on moving to NYC after college. We have been in very light contact throughout these last couple of months. \n\nI haven\u2019t been stressing over him because dating isn\u2019t really a priority right now. I currently think that if the right one comes along then ok but I\u2019m not seeking anything. \n\nThis guy hasn\u2019t shown me any red flags so far \u2014 innocent social media presence, same religion, isn\u2019t known to sleep around, has a pretty good background on paper that I know of (not putting him on a pedestal). \n\nHe would send me photos when he\u2019s out to eat at nice restaurants with his friends or brother saying he wishes it was me instead. This of course is all words and no action so far. \n\nHis spring break is next week and he\u2019s visiting my college and is staying with his friend. He stated that he was excited to see me and he just asked me what days he should come next week (I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s visiting for me.) What strategies or tips do you have for when he visits? Right now I\u2019m planning to kind of just sit back and see what he does. Im not going to mention that I\u2019m going out and see what he plans without the factor or the implication of going out at night.
q2up0o	hostile sexism	Solution to our problems with feminism: We all now have realized feminists are too deep in their madness to be saved. They have allied with the dissolving interests of liberalism and judeo-christianism to destroy our society for their benefit and those of interests that gain to get rid of us as free men. \n\nThey are trying to destroy and castrate us literally to allow their hypergamy to run wild while we toil for them as ennuchs. \n\nFuck them. I don't want this to happen to me or to my people.\n\nWhat about importing suitable non feminist women ? Feminists are advocating for mass immigration in Europe/usa to artificially increase their sexual value and make us fight for them. \n\nWhy not return the trick and buy/import women from other places to have suitable breeding stock while keeping these New ones under out full control via legal means? \n\nPlus, denying ourselves to feminists while creating stable nuclear families will make them even madder. Double win !\n\nAnyone have ideas/experience with this ?\nTarget importation from Asia/south America, maybe eastern Europe...needs to be from stable non feminist societies.\n\nWE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO THE FEMINIST DEGENERACY OR ANY TYPE OF WEALTH AND RIGHTS or they'll just become like the western bitches we have to deal with now. \n\nSome sort of white sharia / roman pater familia type of domination. Ideally They must depend on you only and not be able to access work or wealth. \n\nWomen define themselves only by their perceived value, as common goods, let's start to treat them as such.

srnq9g	institutional sexism	India: Men from India that are here claiming they experience even ONE discrimation are ridiculous. Factually India is the worst place to be a woman.. Indian men also sexually abuse children more than anywhere else in the world and they rarely are punished. Whole towns get together to rape the same child and that's not an exaggeeation. They deserve the hatred that men of the US, UK etc receive. More than 98 percent of crimes against women go unreported at all and only one percent of the rapes reported result in conviction. Any case that doesn't result in conviction is automatically classified as false. They do not test DNA and even when there has been video evidence the cases were dropped. One woman was raped and the media put a video of her on the ground crying while stopping at her boobs and thighs while men were cheering and laughing in the background. They said the rape was her fault even with very clear proof and not one arrest was made. Thousands of women are killed, tortured and commit suicide because they can not take the torture they're induring every year because the man is unhappy with their dowry. India still kills women and children and forces abortion because their child isn't a boy. The majority of crimes against women are not seen as crimes because of the culture. Honor killings are still happening and when a man beheaded his daughter for dating a boy there were a large amount of men taking up for him. Women are still killed because they're accused of witchcraft. Women are forced to sleep on the kitchen floor, not allowed to sit at a table with others, can't be touched or talked to because they are on their periods. Don't tell me that women of India are the bad guys when Indian men are the worst gender group in the world. You do not face any of the issues that men in other countries face. The men that are from India that believe men are the victims of India and complaining about women are insane. When the majority of men believe the rape of women and children is okay you have

Things were great at first (so I thought) then kept getting worse, spiraling downward. \n\nAt one point he literally told me that I wasn't the priority in his life; law school was. I stayed. I thought that after he finished his program things would be better. Even after his program ended I still wasn't priority in his life. \n\nWhen he was working his first real attorney job his bosses invited us to a fancy Christmas dinner. Just before we left for the dinner, he told me that he had told his bosses that we were engaged but he hadn't gotten a ring yet. \n\nWe weren't engaged &amp; I would never actually get engaged to anyone without a ring. I was caught off guard &amp; he coerced me to play along with the story. He still didn't even actually try to propose. He just wanted me to play along to impress his bosses. That dinner was so awkward &amp; uncomfortable. I felt like such a fool to have these people think I'm engaged &amp; I didn't even have a ring. \n\nBut, I still stayed with him. \n\nThen I finally discovered he was cheating. He had been cheating the entire relationship - with strangers from online &amp; prostitutes. \n\nI finally left him. \n\nAfter I healed from that train wreck, looking back I see the red flags. I also see how I kept making excuses for them. I kept convincing myself that things were fine or would get better. I was afraid to face the truth. I was afraid to leave &amp; have to start over on my own. I was devastated that I wasted so much time &amp; energy trying to help him be a better person &amp; to make our relationship work. \n\nI hope more women find FDS &amp; they're able to shed the veil of lies they tell themselves about these scrotes. \n\nAlways listen to your intuition &amp; your gut instinct. If something feels off or wrong then you're probably right. I wish I hadn't made so many excuses for him. I wish I would have left sooner &amp; not wasted so much of my time &amp; tears on him. \n\nSince I left him I have gotten my master's degree, I'm starting a business, I started finally hiking like I always wanted, I started traveling internationally, &amp; I finally moved to another country which has been a goal of mine for a very long time. I'm doing everything I had always wanted, now that I don't have the dead weight of our relationship holding me down. \n\nMaybe I'll be single with my pets for the rest of my life.

Your main goal is not to have as many men and boys as possible want to have sex with you. They want to have Sex with anyone who will have sex with them. \n\n- When you feel your gut screaming, just jump, jump off the cliff. The never ending string of boys and men who you love don\u2019t love you like you love them. Don\u2019t try to understand, don\u2019t try to rationalize their abuse.

What are nations to do?\n\nPersonally I lean toward a volunteer-only armed force policy.\n\n***But*** is the \"Women and Children First\" evacuation policy really so anti-male, or is it perhaps more based in logic?\n\nFirst of all and very Important -- it's CLEAR that there are plenty of women, young and old, volunteering to stay and fight. As a woman beyond my child-bearing years but still healthy -- and especially if I had not had children -- I would 100% enlist and fight. I have had a good life and although I would prefer to live to 100,  I would make the ultimate sacrifice if it meant my kids and others with their lives still mostly ahead of them would be spared.\n\nAbout men's life value:\n\nWhat about the idea that men benefit the most from civilized life? So, maybe it stands to reason that those with the most privilege and power (and, in many cases, ability to do so) should be expected to step up and defend/earn it?\n\nAnd, thinking about the women&amp;children category as having special/protected status... How about backing up a step: Can we agree that *CHILDREN* should be spared if at all possible?  \n\nOf course we can.\n\nSo, based on that premise of protecting children, ***HOW do you save the children without also saving the women who are the ones who take care of them?***\n\nIsn't it more about practicality than about favoring women?\n\nThat's where I had a little silent laugh: \n\nHow about we give men the option of feeding and caring for refugee children if they don't want to fight? (putting aside for a moment the sad reality that it's more risky to leave men in charge of children, and of course that very young children are best allowed to remain with their mothers)\n\n I would bet Money that a good number of them would try it out for a few days and then RUN to join the army as a preferred option to being 24/7 caregivers.\n\n(and, to be honest, I might just be right there with them)

Maybe if feminists spent there energy into bettering themselves, learning and growing and you know taking ACCOUNTABILITY without constantly pushing agendas and playing the victim, it might be more beneficial.

soy0om	hostile sexism	The Walking Dead Misandry: So i recently started seeing walking dead season 1 and i found some very interesting things about division of labor and the women questioning it. &amp;#x200B; What the men were doing: &amp;#x200B; Shane: Doing tasks like collecting the water, taking care of the camp, fighting zombies, operating the radio. Rick: Fighting his way through zombies in a city and then escaping and then going back to the city to rescue someone The old guy: Protecting the camp, repairing the machinery(plus he's old so he gets leeway) Glenn : Risking his life for a stranger, riding in to a horde of zombies to save someone else. Daryl: Hunting, gathering food, fighting zombies in the woods to make sure the camp can eat. The black dude: Fighting, risking his life for someone who was racist against him. &amp;#x200B; What one guy at camp was doing: Sitting around doing nothing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; What women were doing: Women: Cleaning the clothes and cooking the food. Complaining about how difficult their job is and questioning the division of labor. &amp;#x200B; Now, i don't mind that the women sit around and do easy tasks while the men do the dangerous tasks, that is division of labor leading to efficiency and safety of the group. What i do see is that the women are complaining that the men are not contributing enough to the group and about the "division of labor" because they saw 1 guy sitting down not doing work. This is feminism at it's finest, taking one example and thinking it to be the norm of all men. Note: That while the the women saw the guy sitting down, all the other men in the group were fighting hundreds of zombies.

I never actually cared about Reddit but I started to notice how men are literally obsessed with themselves to the point that they can\u2019t even go a day without talking about their dicks and balls.\n\nI have never seen a woman talk about her breasts or vagina for no reason. But these men are so focus on their organs it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nWhy are they so obsessed with these things? I literally saw a post saying there\u2019s an equal number of balls and hearts on earth. What the heck? Why are they so freaking obsessed ab\u0131ut themselves that even their random thpughts are about sex and penises? It\u2019s disgusting, and I pity them so much because they don\u2019t seem to have any other thing to do to have fun or fill their days in a meaningful way. It\u2019s like orangutans have gatheted into a circle and show their parts as a game, heck, even animals don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s as if they don\u2019t have enpugh words on their vocabulary list and just use the same words in every talk. They say women are shallow and obsess over themselves and use makeup but have they ever looked at themselves? The whole image of womenhood in a global scale is just male projecting.\n\nMen literally make my head ache.

t5g37o	neutral	Can a man that has done anal be a HVM?: I've been dating someone for some months after knowing him for almost two years. One day, I asked him if he had ever done anal in the past. He told me he had with an ex gf he had been with for a lot of years, not with his other ex gf. I asked him it how it was compared to vaginal, and he told me that \n1) it was different, not better or worse.\n2) it adds variety.\n3) some parts of the anatomy of a woman can only be estimulated with anal.\n4) that asses excited him but because of proximity.\n\nI made very clear that anal is a total no go for me:\n1) because FDS. I do believe that the reason 98% of men like anal is because they hate women.\n2) because most importantly, I have Chrohn's (and also a deep trauma related to my asshole because this illness also leaves psychological scars, not only physical).\n\nI made very sure to let him know in no uncertain terms that anal would forever be out of the cards. He understood it perfectly, he even told me that I didn't need to tell him the reason that anal was of out the question. I told him anyway because it was very important to me to make absolutely sure that he understands how much it will never happen. So far, his behaviour has been without reproach. \n\nHowever, I'm feeling more and more insecure. My only ex bf had never done anal and was totally repulsed by it. But the current one, well:\n1) I'm torn because he said it wasn't better or worse. Just different. I could have managed it if he had said it was worse, but it still added variety.\n2) I'm also insecure because obviously he did it because it excited him.\n\nHonestly, I think I've tried to let him know how it makes me insecure, but I don't think he's grasped the severity of how insecure it makes me feel or maybe it turns out I have reason to feel this way, because it maybe he just likes it too much for my personal level of comfort.\n\nShould I break up with him? I'm in love with him, there are no current red flags on his behaviour so far, and I cannot fault his behaviour. It just may turn out that we are incompatible, not because he wants to do anal to me but because my ego is too fragile to handle that it might be something he would want to do if it was on the table.

t3oshc	hostile sexism	Should men with children be allowed to escape Ukraine?: Like honestly, only women and children being allowed to cross can cause so many really strange and unfair situations. For example, I just watched a video where a single dad with two children could not cross to Hungary because he was a male aged 18-60. He had to give his children to some random womab.\n\nThat\u2019s so mental and then think that childless healthy 25 year old women can leave as they want. That\u2019s just wildly unfair and this whole war just highlights the hypocrisy of feminism and all of this equality BS that people talk about.\n\nDuring good times everyone\u2019s equal yes yes but then when shit hits the fan we strip men of all rights and call it a day. What the actual fuck? This honestly makes me a bit angry even since the majority of feminists are women and they aren\u2019t talking about this. It makes you lose all trust and respect for them.
tbcqmd	neutral	How to prevent hornyness related pickmeness on dates: Let's say you want to date, amazing! Then one day you find a interesting fella, but you're unsure how to keep yourself from going full pickme sexually, jumping on him after a particularly hot date. He looks SO HOT. Butt on point, delicious chest, you can't wait to jump on him! AAAAAAA!!! Alas, the horny mind is hard to fight against, it can easily override rational decisions. \n\nMy own personal solution is to schedule something else after my dates, like some appointment, or I already made plans to finish my evening with my friend, or I already made plans with my parents or brothers. \n\nIt sounds super simplistic, but it keeps a mental check on your horny energy, because you don't want to deceive a loved one or a professional. And it keeps a check on the time; you don't want a date to extend for hours upon hourrrrrrs, like your time is valuable and should be respected and won't be given out freely. \n\nIt also adds another layer of vetting: assholes will try to guilt you over skipping other engagements so they can siphon in more of your precious time, and increase their odds of a \"happy end\" (gag). Those that pass this vetting test get +1 point, simply by respecting that you have another engagement and (bonus) reminding you of the time, because they don't want you late.

si47pa	neutral	Puritanism, authoritarianism and radicalism are killing us (both the Radical Right and radical Left are at fault for this) and there's nothing wrong with swearing or expressing darker emotions in art forms (drawing, painting, etc)...: Cultural authoritarianism and language/artistic expression policing have to stop. It's killing countless men, women, girls and boys every year and it has to stop. There are factors that cause and perpetuate those issues, such as radical Left ideologies (like Feminazi ideology aka Feminism) and radical Right ideologies (like Right-Wing FundaMENTAList ideology). \n\nThe radical Right (the Right-Wing FundaMENTALists) and the radical Left (the SJW Feminazis) are cancer on society and only make things worse for everyone.\n\nPuritanism and radicalism are killing us and there's nothing wrong with swearing and expressing darker emotions in art forms (drawing, painting, etc). Those are healthy and cathartic things, those are non-violent and harmless outlets. Sadly the Far-Right radicals and the Far-Left radicals want to ban and forbid those healthy and cathartic things, those non-violent and harmless outlet, and it's killing us, it's making society more violent and less safe for all of us. Swear words and darker emotions expressed in art forms don't kill or harm people. Physical violence does. One is healthy and harmless, the other isn't.\n\nAnd this guy has so many good points:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoDAzVK0p4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoDAzVK0p4Y)\n\nThis guy too has so many good points (applauses):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8XlMYe\\_2Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8XlMYe_2Lo)\n\nI came across this video today and the title and the whole video just pissed me off:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_7oYdjH8JP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oYdjH8JP8)\n\nAs if there was anything wrong with swearing or cussing. It's a non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet. No one ever drop dead from hearing a few cuss words. It's because puritanical people seek to ban profanity that there's more and more physical violence in our society which is a violent and harmful outlet. You have two kinds of outlet and two options; a non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet or a violent and harmful outlet. If you take away people's right and option to choose a non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet (swearing and cussing), they'll be left with only the violent and harmful one. They'll repress their anger and frustration until they fucking explode. Because they'll have no non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet. This is why there are all these school shootings and mass shootings going on. \n\nPeople are being abused, bullied, and ostracized in the worse ways imaginable for the slightest reason and often for things they can't control (being LGBT, being disabled, being a certain color, etc, etc), the teachers and school principals and cops and society do jack shit to stop the bullying and to help these adults and kids who are begging them for help, and then, these people, adults and kids alike, who are being victime and re-victimize are told that profanities are banned in the name of censorship, morality and puritanism and that their non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet is being taken from them, that they're gonna have to let their anger and rage fester inwardly until it blows up, even at the worst possible times. \n\nThen when a school shooting or mass shooting occurs (because they have been abused, bullied, and tortured for so damn long and no one ever did anything to help them and make it stop), we're gonna blame so-called \"toxic masculinity\" (a misandrist term created by male-hating Far-Left radicals who think that masculinity is a disease and that all the bad things in the world should be blamed on masculinity and that if males just became female then all the problems of the world would be solved, never mind that females too commit horrific acts of violence and abuse and do their fair share of crime and evil, not just males, women and girls are not sweet innocent little saints who can do no wrong) or \"white privilege\" (a racist term created by white-hating Far-Left radicals who think that whiteness is the source of all evil in this world, that if people would just stop being white then all of the problems in the world would just disappear, and that so-called \"white privilege\" is a thing even though dozens if not hundreds of thousands of white people are dirt poor, homeless, jobless, etc, and not part of the top 1%, and even though females and POCs too commit horrific acts of violence when their non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet is taken from them) or supposedly being a \"depraved sinner\" (some bullshit made up by the radical Right because they want to control people and they want to look the other way and wash their hands of personal responsibility when they drive people to suicide or violence). \n\nBoth the radical Right and the radical Left are at fault here, ALL radicalism is evil and cause so much harm in the world.  \nThe problem here is puritanism (Puritanism is behaviour or beliefs that are based on strict moral or religious principles, especially the principle that people should avoid swearing and physical pleasures, no wonder a lot of these people develop severe mental issues and end up committing suicide, they're denying themselves the non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet of swearing and any and all pleasure in life, that's harmful to mental and physical health, it's not healthy and sane). I say swearing and cussing should be allowed across the board with no censorship, both adults and kids should be allowed to swear and cuss. If I had a 5 years old son or daughter, I'd rather they drop F bombs than they bash their little sister's or brother's skull in with a baseball bat or stab the neighbor or beat the shit out of someone with a tire. Swear words don't kill or harm people. Physical violence does. One is healthy and harmless, the other isn't. Society should ban and forbid physical violence (except for legally protected self-defense), NOT swearing and expressing darker emotions in art forms (drawing, painting, etc).\n\nYou want a far lower rate of physical violence and violent crime in our society, then support allowing swearing and cussing for people of all ages (adults and children) across the board, which is a non-violent, harmless, victimless outlet. We don't need more physical violence and violent crime in our society because stupid people want to ban cathartic things and healthy, harmless outlets like profanities and art. It's stupid and it's costing lives. This needs to stop. As for myself, I will never apologize when I choose to have swear words in my fanfictions (Star Wars fanfictions and other fanfictions) or other such cathartic things, if you're not happy about it don't fucking read my fanfictions. People need to grow the fuck up. No one ever drop dead from hearing a few cuss words, it's harmless and victimless. People need to stop being immature dummies and they need to stop giving magic powers to words.\n\nUse the comment sections to discuss ways to end cultural authoritarianism and language/artistic expression policing in our society among yourselves.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\n About me:\n\nI always expose the radicals in all parties and hold them accountable (I don't care if they are Conservative, Liberal, Republican, Democrat, I don't care, I can't stand radicals and I expose them and hold them accountable no matter the party) and I'm quite proud of being non-partisan or independent, I don't have a political or denominational affiliation and I don't want one.

Or does that only apply to linking?\n\nI watched a video overlaid with text  like, \u201cWhen will you stop sleeping with men in relationships?\u201d and a conventionally pretty girl pointing toward the text, smiling smugly, and lip synching to something about how she would never stop.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before. I\u2019ll say it again and again and again: there is nothing brag worthy about any woman having sex. I guarantee that the least conventionally unattractive of us could walk into a bar, club, restaurant, gym, wherever, and find a hookup. Men are desperate. Some of them will take anyone.\n\nGetting laid is nothing to be proud of. There\u2019s no \u201chunt\u201d to f-ck a man in a relationship, no challenge. The ones who cheat are just waiting for an opportunity. These pickmes aren\u2019t winning at anything, and it\u2019s sad to see them strutting as if they did.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling bad because you feel you can\u2019t find someone while these girls seem to be getting it all over the place? Stop. That could be you, too, but you have standards. You have goals and priorities. THAT is so

o3efad	hostile sexism	What are some your worst OLD experiences? I have only used Bumble so I have a few bad experiences on there. (and I don\u2019t mean flat out ghosting) it\u2019s story time!: So I own a restaurant and I never put the name in my OLD profile. However, when I get a match, the job convo always comes up and I\u2019ll politely tell them I won\u2019t say the name of the restaurant till I get to know them better. \nThis is because I\u2019ve had a bad experience a few years ago, and have learned not to share my business too quickly now. \nSo years ago, I was more young and naive and told a match right off the bat (first time using OLD). We had a long conversation the night we matched and it was a good one, like we clicked. So I felt good after leaving our first conversation. A day went by and I didn\u2019t reach out because I was working a lot. But the next day I had planned to.. until I randomly recognize his face show up in our lunch rush line. Unannounced, was not open to an invite, and very awkward for me as I was working the cash. He comes up and introduced himself while I\u2019m trying to move quickly because we are in the middle of a rush! And I don\u2019t have a lot of time for small talk but he keeps going. Eventually I pressure him by asking what he would like to order and tells me he would like whatever I recommend. I do this politely and ring him up and then he goes and takes a seat while he waits for his food. Unfortunately, he chooses a seat that\u2019s facing me so he can stare at me the entire time at a two seater table. I was pretty creeped out and kinda mad at myself. Lol learned I should never do that again. I realize restaurants are public spaces but if someone owns and clearly works there I don\u2019t think you should bombard them with a visit. I get supporting them but... not in this context. It didn\u2019t work out I just didn\u2019t like his approach.... \n\nOne experience recently...\nI had a match on bumble, I didn\u2019t even start the conversation yet and noticed he friend requested me on Facebook. We didn\u2019t even have a conversation yet. I was like NOPE. Kinda creepy how he found me so quickly without a last name or anything. Maybe he was making sure I wasn\u2019t a catfish? But like that\u2019s kinda early in the game if you haven\u2019t had a conversation with me. \nI feel like the social media one is pretty common. \n\nGot any good stories?\n\nEDIT: wow, blown away by all the stories! Keep em coming! I\u2019m reading every single one! \nAlso, you are all champions for getting through what you have experienced.

s1ena4	neutral	Choose myself or my emotions to make her feel good??. Any suggestions: I have been liking a girl long time. She was good. I tried to go out with her sometimes and was successful thrice. She is a person who never eats out. Once I told I felt jealous that she is talking to another person. She said she is not interested in me . All good. I was normal and only texted her when something important as I was CR of the class. I asked her out on her birthday to which she readily accepted. I tried to make her feel special but she said it is same as other day but still I bought a card some chocolates and cake as I didn't had time. \nThen I asked her out for Christmas and she came. My bad it was such a wrong choice we couldn't find any where to sit atleast. I mean restaurants. I have given a book which she didn't liked. I ignorantly put it i want to know you and I love to know you more. To which she said that's not your problem but I said I Will try my best. I know how stupid I was. \n\nAfter dropping off her at home she texted me saying \" you please get a girlfriend for yourself\".to which I replied thanks for the suggestion but I don't want one. I would like to know you more.  I thought that was a bad day to take her out as I made her walk purposelessly for an hour in cold and nothing happened. So I texted her, I mailed her my apologies for which she didn't reply. On January 1st I made a good plan ( this time I planned everything remembering how bad Christmas went) and texted her an itinerary of that asking would she come out with me. She said \" I am not going and don't message me.\" This was actual reply. Later I had cut all.the communication with her. I felt okay with that decision. \n\nNow I am feeling atleast I should have taken out for a good dinner. Still I regret it very much. Now suddenly since morning all I could think is I should ask her out once again ( this time fucking my self respect) and take her have some lunch. I fucked my self respect many times when I was talking with her ( I hope you understand). Now I am feeling bad for her for the Christmas and I want to apologize at the same time make something to compensate it. \n\nPeople please advise me whether should I go for it? Thinking atleast this makes her good. Fucking my self respect. Or I just leave it thinking I don't care what she thinks or she might have forgotten. \n\nI really like her because she is very nice. Very nice. I am not saying this because of my tainted vision of my crush but to be honest she was nicest of all my classmates. I don't want her to feel bad
t17o21	neutral	I saw a post today made me mad: So in the post this kid , is about 16 , ask if he was the asshole because he gave his mom a book about cheating, because she cheated on his dad . The poor kid was a mess , because not only did she cheat on this guy but left him and the son for the man she cheated with. And everyone was saying he was the asshole because I shit you not , "she could have been abused " Then it comes to light she wasn't abused, was just living in the moment. Well apparently everyone still said he was the asshole because "he needs to respect his mom " But no one else sees how fucked up this poor kid is . I fucking hate stupid feminist for allowing that .

It is great if a woman truly supports our movement but they must be vetted and always be under scrutiny. Look at Roma Army for example. She literally only is in the MRA space to funnel men to her onlyfans. She exposed herself as when \"Think Before You Sleep\" made a video critizing her for this she showed her true colors and just called him a mysoginist instead of answering the criticism. Come on men stop falling for these grifters. The female chameleon MRA tradthot is a booming industry. A lot of smart women see they can come in here and larp making a lot of money. Please stop falling for these chameleons.

tdl3ug	neutral	how to ask to just hook up again?: I (24f) had a fun hookup with a guy (24m) who I had been talking to for a while over the weekend. We both have made it clear that we want casual and I still want that too but am feeling unsure over what to text him. I was on my period so we didn't have sex but I gave him head that he seemed to like and it felt like there was good chemistry so I would be down to make it more of a consistent thing (f\\*ck buddies). When I was leaving he said he liked hanging and that he had fun and that I should hit him up, I guess I am over thinking what to say. If you were in this position would you want the girl to reach out and what would you want her to say? Or should I wait for him to reach out? Or since this is casual does none of this even matter lol.

slkmg3	hostile sexism	Hi I just subbed: I found this sub mentioned in r/AgainstHateSubreddits and I had to check it out. Actually what drove me here is the fact that feminists have become so problematic that many of them are outright practicing misandry. You call them out on it and they tell you misandry isn't real which is just so wrong. Like sometimes I have a srs argument with these clowns on social media. Now one thing I wonder tho is why this sub is seen as a hate sub. Actually I'm not that surprised this sub would be seen as hate. I've gone through several posts and everything seems good. But just to be clear, we aren't women-hating men right? We're just exposing the idiocy of feminists right? Anyway it feels to have a community of ppl who feel the same frustrations as I do
t6jk2m	hostile sexism	Wikipedia wants to artificially increase the number of articles about women: Today Wikipedia is asking users to [help artificially increase the number of articles about women](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Celebrate_Women), in total contradiction of their principles of neutrality and being an unbiased source of information. As some body posted in their [talk page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Celebrate_Women): &gt;**Why must there be more articles about women?** &gt; &gt;The article says: &gt; &gt;"Not even 20% of those are about women. If Wikipedia wants to become the sum of human knowledge, this needs to change." &gt; &gt;Why? This isn't explained? WHY must there be more articles about women? For what REASON? Almost ALL important historical people have been men. If Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, shouldn't it reflect ACTUAL HISTORY instead of inventing a FICTIONAL one where women had more significance? &gt; &gt;If Wikipedia is going to embark on such a radical agenda - it needs to make REALLY CLEAR WHY so that people can understand the motivations behind what it's trying to do!
tcyo1p	institutional sexism	Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's rights is a \"significant barrier to gender equality: This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office.\n\nThere is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example:\n\n&gt;**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents \u201cagreed or strongly agreed\u201d with the statement that \u201cgender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account\u201d. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to \u201cagree/strongly agree\u201d with the statement that \u201cMen and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality\u201d, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace.\n\nThis section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report:\n\n&gt;**Male moderates are champions of men\u2019s rights**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men\u2019s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality.\n\nGot that?\n\nFeminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label \"equality\".\n\nOther stats cited include:\n\n* 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace\n* 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account\n* 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality\n\nThe feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a \"backlash\" against feminist initiatives and \"backsliding\" away from the goals which they're pursuing.\n\nOf course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.\n\n[https://www.broadagenda.com.au/wp-content/uploads/attachments/From-Girls-to-Men.pdf](https://www.broadagenda.com.au/wp-content/uploads/attachments/From-Girls-to-Men.pdf)
sbd05n	neutral	Boys, did a lot of self improvement and still at wits end, what now?: Am 19, have yet to land a single date but not for lack of trying \n\nSo far I\u2019ve asked out over couple dozen people over the years. Made honest attempts and tried my best to do it in an appropriate manner. There\u2019s also been times when I\u2019ve been an acquaintance with a girl but they\u2019ve made it clear they just want to be friends semi-explicitly before I had a chance to ask her out.\n\nI\u2019ve thought as each time passes that I need to improve myself. So I\u2019ve done a lot of work on myself. \n\nI\u2019ve worked out and gotten myself in pretty decent shape. Not huge, but defined and lean.\n\nI\u2019ve worked on my hobby, guitar, and am pretty decent now. I\u2019m trying to get a band together (can\u2019t find a drummer at the moment) but mostly I just jam out with whoever is available. Idk if this means anything I\u2019m just trying to show I\u2019m not completely boring I guess.\n\nI\u2019ve worked on my hairstyle and have always had good hygiene and fashion (I get compliments on clothes sometimes).\n\nI\u2019ve been quite social. In highschool I had three friend groups. Currently in college I have two friend groups and am in three clubs. I have no trouble getting friends I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so different with dating.\n\nI\u2019ve tried multiple dating apps, not many matches and none led to dates. Tried to take good photos and write a decent bio. Like seriously what the hell. Really don\u2019t want to try this route again it\u2019s depressing.\n\nI really am staring to think it\u2019s my appearance. I have a really bad underbite and my lower jaw juts too far out. Kinda ogre like. Went to an orthodontist about this. He says my case is too severe for braces alone, it\u2019s mandibular prognathism apparently. I\u2019ll need a year of braces to prepare my bite for surgery, then double jaw surgery and then braces for a couple of months. I think I\u2019m going to do it since it\u2019s covered by insurance. But of all surgeries, this ones is one of the most grueling ones. Takes 6 months for swelling to go down completely. And risk of permanent facial numbness. Unlikely but not super rare.\n\nAnyways, any advice? I don\u2019t see what else I could really be working on tbh. Like I think I\u2019ve just about every self improvement thing out there. Sorry for the rant.
tcqlqw	neutral	Can we ask HVM to change in smaller ways?: This is about losing weight in particular, but it's also about how we feel about our standards for the little things, and if it's fair to ask for change. \n\nI'm so tired of seeing so many gorgeous women in their 40's putting serious effort into their skincare, style, and health, and then they're shacked up with a beer belly disgusting husband. I feel like we've all seen it and we're all trying to avoid that guy. There's something misogynist about it: men who think they can get fat and still fuck their thin little wives, and it's fine, because men are superior enough that fatness isn't a real problem. But if the wife gets fat? Ohhh, the internet is ready to make a mockery of her and the world is prepped to invalidate her very existence.\n\nBut what about a HVM who puts effort into dressing well, taking care of their skin, eating well, and staying active...but there's some stubborn pounds around the middle?\n\nThis is where I'd love the advice of other FDS ladies. I've followed this sub long enough to learn the red flags of low effort and to run away *knowing they will not change*, but what about the things that aren't as black and white? *Can we ask the ones we love and respect\u2014who actually have done the significant work to deserve our love and respect\u2014to change for us in smaller ways?* Is that fair to ask of them? Is there a point where we say, \"alright, you clearly are putting in more effort than 98% of the other men, so that's good enough,\" or am I allowed to say, \"Look, conventional beauty standards have stressed me out my entire life to the degree that I've made myself a ten out of fucking ten, so you're going to have to hit the gym more often because your little gut there isn't to my taste.\"\n\nIf we reversed it, I'd be disgusted by any man who asked a women to lose weight. But men don't have the same all-consuming pressure that women have. Men aren't as lovely as women in the first place. Men don't have to try as hard. \n\nWhat I don't want: I don't want to cause emotional damage by picking out the flaws in my partner when they work so hard to be a stellar partner. I don't want to sink into the capitalist and unfair beauty standards that dictate how people's bodies should look, because we women know the physical and emotional damage that has plagued us with those standards. I don't want to lower myself to the level of a porn sick neck beard who asks his gorgeous wife to lose 10 pounds so they can keep it up. Gross.\n\nBut there's a little piece of me who sees that gut and I know I'm never going to like it. It feels unfair because *I'm* extremely fit and attractive. I look like every man's wet dream, and when I walk around in public with my partner, he gets the status and looks of approval from having a sexy lady on his arm.  Don't get me wrong, I get to be with a well-groomed, physically active, and well-dressed partner, too. This is someone who is putting in real effort. But shouldn't a man with a skincare routine be like...the bare minimum? Shouldn't someone who curates their closet with decent style be the norm? Shouldn't someone who styles their hair with product be expected? Shouldn't someone who eats their   \nveggies and goes to gym a couple times a week be what we expect of all men?! BECAUSE IT'S WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM WOMEN.\n\nSo how do we do this? Once you're in a relationship, do you get to have opinions about their weight? Do you get to ask them to change, like ever?

t8h8z8	hostile sexism	One thing I want from life is to be treated like man: Okay. I don't deny there are positives to being a man, however I will say that both genders have it awful, and I would take what you have over what I've got any day.\n\nHere's what being treated like a man will really feel like.\n\nYou don't get to show genuine emotion around your friends and family without being ridiculed. You will not be able to make female friends or even engage with females without 99% of them assuming you want sex or \"bitches\". You no longer get the comraderie you previously had with your female friends and family because society brings us up to see men as potential threats. Your sexuality no longer matters, no demisexual, no pansexual, no bi, no queer, you are either gay or straight in the eyes of most men(and plenty of women) you'll encounter. While it is to a degree misogynistic that society brings us up to see women as weak and men as potential threats, it causes a general level of hostility towards us from society as a whole. Because men are seen as sex hungry animals and potential sexual predators and child predators, you cannot interact with children in any way without being questioned or judged. While a woman can see a crying kid on the road and go comfort him/her/them a man has to walk on so that we don't get arrested or harassed over trying to be nice. Male teachers, male coaches, men in general who work with kids are restricted in their ability to interact with the kids because of this. For a simple yet awful example, a female teacher could hug a student while a male teacher could not. A simple, innocent hug. At the same time, we deal with more misandrist shit than you think. Women using the \"independent woman\" and \"you're an incel/misogynist\" cards to win arguments in situations where they're at fault is relatively common. Not only that, men are the gender which faces the absolute worst form of objectification, being forced to fight and die horrifically in a war you don't understand, for a pointless cause, for leaders you hate, and for the majority of women who won't truly appreciate your efforts.What I've said so far is barely scratching the surface, but if you still believe you want to be be treated like a man, if you still believe we're at the top in society then I'm not going to say your wrong. If everything I've said and more is worth it to you then hey, you do you. As they say \"it's lonely at the top.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk

I have been using a dating app called OkCupid, I have been matching with a lot of women but none of them want to fuck me in a motel room. I was talking to this black woman earlier and I told her I wanted to role-play, I wanted her to be a slave because 1. she's black and 2. she's a woman. It's common sense that women are inferior to men, since they are weak and have vaginas but she really got mad and called me "racist and sexist". Man I hate these feminists, they are so stupid, they take everything so seriously. Obviously I was just joking, I thought roleplaying would be fun (I like roleplaying, I hate vanilla sex). As you can see, feminists hate men for existing. I didn't do anything wrong. All I did was ask her to come to a motel room and role play as a slave, I wanted to hit her with a whip too, and feed her pigs knuckles. Oh well... maybe one day I can find an anti-feminist woman who will do that with me. Women are disgusting.

rn99d2	neutral	Maybe the best dating strategy is no dating: The truth is, we are moving towards a post-relationship society. Women have decided by-and-large that they do not need men. So stop trynna pressure sell. They don't want it. It's not your fault. It's just how things are in 2021. So forget about relationships. Enjoy your single life. Focus on your hobbies, work, health, family, and friends.\n\nPeace to all my bros.
t2wj7m	neutral	The results of applying FDS to my dating since having moved.: In 2021 I moved to a new area, near a major city in the US, and I was open to dating. I had met a bunch of guys, and began vetting them. The vast majority of them couldn't pass just having an initial conversation with me - they would ask to to drinks at the last minute, or want me to drive 2 hours from my area to go on a walk in their \"favorite place\". There were plenty of other drink date offers, usually last minute AND wanting me to drive over an hour to their area. Block. \n\nThe men that I did meet that passed basic vetting seemed to be good on paper, they made effort when talking to me, and genuinely seemed interested. They seemed to have their own friends and normal hobbies. They all asked me to nice restaurants and did the legwork.The first dates were nice. They paid.... at the end of the date they all made it clear they would like to see me again.... and the common theme was that then for the 2nd date they all wanted sex. It felt like I was blindsided as there were no red flags that I could see. \n\nMany others never got a first date. Some tried stringing me along and when it was going past 2 weeks of talking or seeing each other at the place I would frequent... and they still hadn't made actual date plans... I was already moving on and distancing myself. Some of these men were irl (and I didn't want them to stalk or go nuts). Distancing myself has been the safe and effective way so far when you see these men irl. \n\nAnother man had a good first date with me and I traveled for a week we kept in contact, and then came back, and still kept chatting. But before I knew it, it was almost month since the first date and he was making no moves to have a 2nd date. So I blocked. \n\nFor OLD Let's mention the large number of men that were blocked because they would try to play texting games: not responding to me past 24 hours, any man that uses the abbreviations of \"hru\" and \"wyd\" or spells it as \"how r u\", men that would just vanish from a conversation and then reappear the next day saying they \"fell asleep\" there is no reason they can't say good night or that they're gonna get going. It's rude and I block for that. \n\nOn OLD there was also a ton of less obvious negging. They get smarter as they get older. When I was like 19 and 20 at least the guys would directly say \"here for a good time\" but now they're sneakier. But I learned a lot and blocked them. \n\nOne weird on on OLD was the dude saying he loves kids and hopes to be a dad one day. Out of curiosity, I lied to him saying I can't have kids (truthfully i most likely will have great difficulty. But i dont want kids so) and wanted to let him know so not to waste each other's time - to which he cussed me out and blocked me before I could block him! Psycho!\n\nAnd exes from preFDS (that had not been blocked) all tried hitting me up around Thanksgiving and Christmas, another did it right around his birthday. They all were blocked! I still have snapchat which I only use with my siblings and many of the exes from preFDS tried adding me there and one kept trying to add me on every social media he could find - all getting blocked. Since that scare I have everything private and do not add anyone anywhere. \n\nIn the past almost year of being open to dating, I had never gotten past a first date. Around Christmas I stopped, and am now focusing on my health as I had an issue come up. So that's my detailed field report of a mix or meeting people /being approached and some OLD.

t4li8s	benevolent sexism	welp i got banned from r/dating: women date men with similar status to them or higher. if she is around 22 then she is at her peak dating value and is likely looking to date an older guy who is at his peak dating value. the only thing that men should cook is likely breakfast or meat(admittedly im into intermittent fasting and keto so there are a few ways you could take that). women tend to have stronger lower bodies while men tend to have stronger upper bodies therefore running and kickboxing are better suited to women. " gentle and caring by nature" my first reactions were commie, red flag, vegan. everything you mentioned is an issue unless you are significantly above average in those things aside from martial arts and when paired with the rest of the stuff you said it was like hearing that someone was taking a self defence class rather than learning krav maga or something. You have been banned for participation in a subreddit that is dedicated to either redpill, pinkpill, incel or generally sexist content. If this was a mistake and you wish to be unbanned, please reply to this ban message. All other replies will be ignored. thought that was relatively chill of me considering ive been up for longer than is reasonable
t7v2a5	hostile sexism	I honestly feel like male spaces no longer exist anymore: I used to frequently visit r/Mgtow, r/redpill when these were available. It used to be a place where you could ask any question and get a blunt unfiltered view from a male audience. There was also aspects of comedy and mocking of social issues but generally it was all in good fun.\n\nI feel spaces like this no longer exist, the communities have dissipated and sure there are alternatives but these seem to be slightly more watered down or censored. Yet sub reddits like female dating strategy are allowed to exist.\n\nMy question is\u2026 where have all these men gone. Does anywhere exist anymore to exchange self improvement ideas in a locker room environment.
te78ai	neutral	How to have a strong mindset and a frame?: 29M i have no strong frame or mindset, and i have no strong role model i can look up to. Im simply a dude who fit any shape and agreeble with any guy even if it cost me or loss me. I cant have an eye contact or i cant confront anyone, even if someone pull a shit on me i let it slide cause i have no energy to fight or confront or stand for me. And people know this when they look at me by a simple glance they know im a unsure wimp, and they dont hesitate to take advantage of me. Im tired of this, i wonder how other men have strong frame they dont take anyones shit, im literally afraid of every male i met, im basically smile being a nice guy and let them know im not a threat to them, rather having a competition i take myself out. In dating career in day to day life i withdrew my self while belittling myself by a lame joke of myself. Im insecure asf. I have no strong mind i simply get tears when someone yell at me or rude. Please i need to change this. Please help me

t4il1f	hostile sexism	Mgtow??: I have been reading and seeing YouTube videos about mgtow (men going there own way) some call it migosnistic or anti feminist.\n\nBasically it's about men being free from women and potentional abuse.\n\nNow to be clear I am not saying it applies to all women as it doesn't. \n\nIt mainly seems to be aimed at dont get marriaged as women will take everything in the divorce or you will have to pay alimony for years to come etc\n\nI personally see mgtow as being free in a relantionship sense but still able to have women in life as friends, Co workers etc.\n\nAnother point made was the triditional roles\n\nSo one thing that came up was how women expect men to fix a car, earn money, change a tyre etc.\n Yet the women want men to stick to there triditional roles but the women won't stick with there's. Cooking, cleaning, looking after kids etc. As for a functioning unit dont need two people with same skills.\n\nAnother point was how children raised by single parents tend to be mistreated more. Then if it's not dealt with in a healthy way it gets carried into adulthood. The whole Control through fear.\n\nLike if you disagreed you get hit. So as a adult if someone disagrees with them, there reaction is to lash out because that is how they were raised to deal with such issues \n\nThoughts??

t8vbqh	neutral	What are your personal examples of internalized misandry?: I've recently been exploring free fitness apps as requested by my therapist. I found two reasonably well-designed ones that I like but they both happen to show many images of beautiful women exercising.\n\nThe tai chi app is okay because it shows the women quite modestly dressed in their tai chi uniforms.\n\nThe other fitness app shows them still dressed of course, like how many women might dress when working out at the gym, but much less modestly so than the ones in the tai chi app. That one even includes a photo gallery!\n\nSince both apps are quite well designed overall, I decided to keep them both in my phone for now but started to look through the gallery in the second app in the hope of finding an option to maybe choose the images I see to switch them to a more equal mix of male and female models or at least more modestly dressed female models, but found no such option, and even the photo gallery itself (or at least the first twenty slides I saw before giving up) were 90% female models all minimally dressed.\n\nI started to wonder what my therapist might think if I show him that second app. Worried about what he might think, I've even looked at other apps to replace it, but must acknowledge that, the images of women exercising and the photo gallery aside, I do prefer that app's design over the others that I've found.\n\nI then started to wonder why I should even care what my therapist might think;  and that's when I had to admit that it was my own internalized misandry telling me that the only reason a man would choose an app with immodestly-dressed female models would be to gawk at those female models.\n\nSince I am strictly heterosexual and refuse to lie to pretend that I'm gay, I can't hide behind the gay card. This led me to wonder whether a therapist who knows I'm straight and who sees such an app would start to presume my motivation for choosing that app.\n\nI then felt anger that I should even care what my therapist might think and so decided while typing this OP that, since it is a well-designed app and I didn't choose the images for it, I'll show him that one anyway. What he believes of my motive is his problem.\n\nBut this made me realize just how internalized our misandry can be, that we as men must question our own motivation for making certain choices and, even once we decide that our motivation is legitimate, still question what others might presume.\n\nWhat are your examples of internalized misandry?
t89jd2	interpersonal sexism	Looking for tips on how to move on, what have you got?: From a number of posts on here and my personal experience it seems compared to women, men tend to take much longer to move on and pursue new relationships. what's the deal with that?\n\nI was with my ex partner for 12 years, she was like my everything and I treated her the best I could and loved her with all my heart. I was there for her through her darkest times and at time was the only person she had. At one point in time she said if it wasn't for me she wouldn't be alive (she went through some really horrible stuff early on in our relationship)\n\nThe relationship ended over year ago now. We were still living together for a short while after it ended while she found a new place. One time when she was out of the apartment I went in her room to grab something and saw an email on her computer, it was to her ex... she was trying to reconnect with him after 12 years!\n\nThat was a few months after the break up, and I'm here a whole year later still trying to process my feelings. (also she wasn't the one that ended our relationship either)\n\nI guess the question is why does it take men longer to move on and what's worked for you guys?

sowomm	hostile sexism	My Hate-filled Confessions (These have rants on some people with feminists included): Hello, my name is Ty. I have told these beliefs I have to family and some friends. Some people (not going to name who) are not pleased about my beliefs I have. However, my best friends and most of my family members agree with them. For the sake of privacy, people's names will be left out. Now without further ado, I feel like I should get into the real meat of this post. I have always been a very open-minded person and am a believer in equal rights for everyone and free health care and basic human needs. I have nothing against the LGBTQ community, but when I first heard of this thing called "non-binary", I was extremely confused but didn't want to say anything out of fear of offending people. However, I realise that way of thinking is wrong for certain things. Non-binary, for the small amount of people who don't know, is when a person doesn't identify with a gender and go by the pronouns "they/them". I heard of celebrities like Sam Smith and Demi Lovato coming out as non-binary even though they lives their lives as male and female. Though this argument is cliché, what genitals would you have if you were non-binary? If you have a penis, you're a man, if you have a vagina, you're a woman. **PERIOD.** Zero fucks given from me for having that mindset. It is beyond me why people get so angry over basic biology. Let's make up a scenario: me, a male, am dating someone who used to identify as female is now non-binary. We have sex and a have to insert my penis in her vagina and I say the word "vagina". She gets mad at me saying that she is not female, but what else am I supposed to call it? I have no clue how non-binary people get dates. The LGBTQ community is trying to convince us that there are more than two genders, even saying that there are 58 genders! Don't even get me started on that. A few months ago, I heard a female friend of mine talking with her other friends about something that interested me, so I joined in. She was talking about how there should be bathrooms for people who don't identify with a gender. I explain some of my feelings, stating that there are only two genders. However, she tells me that gender is a social construct. After that, I tell her that gender is biologically determined. I don't remember how the conversation went, but me and her are still good friends. I support the idea of a bathroom for trans people, but I think that there is no bathroom for non-binary people because society has common sense! You can get surgeries to change into a man or a woman, but you can't get a surgery to not have a gender. If that was possible, I would feel way different about this matter. A few weeks ago, I was talking about this with my friends and they agreed with me. What happened next shocked us. Someone who I knew who was very well female, heard the whole conversation. She told me that she was non-binary. However, she was laughing about it. Meanwhile, her friend was looking at me with a somewhat confused and shocked look on her face. Sometimes the two of them lightly tease me about my beliefs. Now, I know that not all French Quebecers are like this, but I hate the ones who hate English people and Quebec's government who allow the discrimination of English people. I think that the Quebec government needs serious fixing. They even want to separate Quebec from the rest of Canada. It is hard for English people to find jobs and get opportunities. When I hear the word feminism, my blood starts to slightly boil. Feminists are women who claim to fight for equal rights but generalize all men to be rapists and demonize them by creating the term "toxic masculinity". A lot of women these days have become selfish, entitled and cruel. Rape culture is nothing but a lie if you just do some basic research or probably have common sense. The #MeToo movement has allowed women to make accusations of rape which immediately ruin men's lives. Women are seeming to realize this and it is becoming more common. Domestic abuse and rape is not taken seriously when the victim is a man and the perpetrator is a woman. The Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case is a very good example of something like this. On TV, Women made fun of a man who got his penis cut off. Feminists have even supported a woman who killed her three sons out of fear they would grow up to abuse women. With violent women, they will attack men, but when they are hit back, they will cry and play victim. That way, people will blindly take her side because of that bullshit "If you hit a woman, you are not a man". We teach little boys to never hit girls, so girls think it's okay to hit men. Whenever people are opposed to men hitting women in self defense, the only argument that comes up is strength not being equal. How about we teach girls not to hit boys, or better yet, don't hit anyone! Dr. Phil is someone who I lost respect for because he has this mentality. I saw a debate with men's rights activists and feminists where the feminists claimed that they were doing something about men's issues including the biases in the court systems. One of the men said that they have never done anything like that. I honestly could not agree more. Feminists have only been talking about women's issues when they preach "equal rights". However, here is something I will say, men's rights activists are not much better. All they seem to do is cry, whine and scream "Feminism bad!! Feminism bad!!". Ironically, they have done nothing about their own issues in society! Lastly, what the fuck is with this quote? "The Future is Female"? That right there is crystal clear evidence of how inept and backwards the feminist movement is and that they only want equality in their favour. It endlessly angers me when at my school, they call discussions about domestic abuse "Violence against women" or "Gender-based violence". Stop acting as if domestic violence has something to do with gender! Please! My last confession is my feeling on certain tribes in the jungles. Now, most of them are just different societies. However, I am disgusted by the ones who still practice cannibalism for any reasons. I think the best thing to do is the leave these people alone to avoid a hostile encounter or show we are not a threat if we were to discover a new tribe and get information about them. I can't understand a society that normalizes cannibalism. I felt uneasy watching an interview with a tribe member and a reporter where the tribe man threatened to cut his head off for talking. So those are all the thoughts I had to share. I might catch hell for this, but getting it out is worth it. If this is bigotry, I am willing to own up to it. What are your thoughts?
snt7e6	hostile sexism	Just tried watching Peacemaker. My sexist caveman brain made me quit at episode 2. A rant.: The very first scene, when he is discharged from the hospital and a 135 lb male janitor gets in his face and tells him he's a garbage loser had me backing up in my chair. I don't mind the sarcasm, I would have a guy like that janitor as a friend, but he's about to get [John Leguizamo'd](https://youtu.be/5NsNBMdZhq4?t=99) by a guy twice his size. When the cops show up at the apartment, the ones in charge barking orders at everyone are *of course* strong women. Later when the Asian female cop goes to Peacemaker's father's house to ask him some questions, he immediately starts insulting her with anti-Asian slurs. Almost the first thing out of his mouth. Contrast to the [piece of shit child-abusing, wife beating, racist homophobe father in American Beauty.](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3040/3106451809_56d38f3b84.jpg) That guy is so evil he makes my skin crawl - but he's a real character, not a cartoon of what a 2022 bad guy is supposed to look like. Before Peacemaker kills the magical werewolf bar chick (or whatever she is, didn't stick around long enough to find out) that he hooked up with, he is lip syncing into her cum-stained vibrator with it an inch from his mouth, then later after she's dead he crams his face into her panties and sniffs. Gross dude, she's a bar chick you don't even know. She almost certainly has the semen of many bikers is drying in her nasty underwear. Vaginas are "self-cleaning" magical Georgia O'Keeffe flowers that can never be gross, is that the message? When he meets for lunch with his teammates everybody is rude and disrespectful to him, including the petite woman and the fat computer guy. Then they school him on his faux pas calling the waitress "sweet cheeks" because he's too stupid to know it's referring to her butt. Speaking of All Men doing implausibly mustache twirling things, when the petite 120 lb agent goes to a bar to drink a beer and not be disturbed, within seconds *of course* three 250 lb teamsters start catcalling and harassing and groping her and she beats them all up because she took karate or something. Why do boxers and MMA fighters even have weight classes if 120 lb + training is all you need? I was sure it was written by strong female scriptwriters, but nope, James Gunn according to wikipedia. I think that explains both small nerdy guys fucking with a giant dude and getting away with it *and* strong tiny females beating up teamsters and bossing men around. Remember James Gunn was canceled for a while for an old tweet, then got un-canceled (because he was making Hollywood money?) so maybe he's trying to build an alliance between small nerdy guys and woke-fems to show he's down with the struggle? I am disappoint. I wouldn't have minded a decently budgeted show that could roam around the DC universe with some of the street-level heroes, but I believe they're making Peacemaker into nerdy men's and feminists' [Bob Dummy](https://i.imgur.com/nnJ0MTi.jpg). John Cena does not care. He wants to make The Rock money. By the way the opening dance number is the cringiest thing I've seen on TV since [Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars.](https://i.imgur.com/P0UrfQb.jpg) Humiliation for $$$?

qxocbk	hostile sexism	All women are predators until proven otherwise. Period.: This is going to be a hard pill to swallow. The majority of women don\u2019t value men as people. And I mean the VAST majority of women. Even the women who are in our daily lives that we cherish. I have come to accept that all women are trash until proven otherwise. I have found that keeping ALL women in ALL situations, at arms length until I have substantial proof of their character, to be very beneficial . (This goes for family too. I have many female family members that I keep a need-to-know business style relationship with) How a woman treats ANY man in her life is indicative of how she views men. Period. Here are some key examples that I have noticed, that should be assumed baseline until proven otherwise:\n\nYour female friend likely keeps you around for hopes of sex and then dogs you behind your back.\n\nYour so, shared your nudes to her group chat and mocks your body. Most of your girlfriends do this too.\n\nThe mother of the picturesque nuclear family down the street, cheats on her husband. Then brags about it to her friends. Who she can trust will never tell him because GAL CODE.\n\nYour female co-worker buddy, is talking trash on you to your supervisor. Partially to get ahead. Partially because she resents having the same professional status as a man. Partially because she wants to sleep with you.\n\n*keep it going

ovujui	hostile sexism	Are you tired of being invisible?: Being socially invisible can be very true and is the reality of many people. This is the kind of invisibility that is not usually beneficial in any way and makes your life a very sad experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is being socially invisible?**\n\nIt means that you don't have much if any social capital and people are not interested in talking to you. It's when a group of people hang out together and there is this one guy who doesn't talk to anybody and if he leaves then nobody really even acknowledges it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe interesting phenomena is though that a lot of groups have a guy like this. I know because I was like that. I am like that even now with one group of friends but fortunately I don't meet them as much anymore. \n\nIf you have \"assigned\" a \"role\" in your group then it's really hard to break out of it and change your position in the group. People don't want you to stand up when you have always been the quiet one. It will break the groups dynamics and makes people question their own place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why do people befriend the quiet invisible guys though?** \n\nI have thought about it and my best guess is that the invisible ones are good listeners and people LOVE to talk to you about their stuff. \n\nWhen you are socially invisible in your group then you come in play when one of the dudes in the group starts walking home drunk and wants to talk about all his life problems. \n\nThat's your time to \"shine\".. or well.. just walk with him and say nothing.. because the other person just wants to talk and to be listened. And as you are the quiet one you will most likely not talk the things that were told to you to somebody third.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why being socially invisible is the worst?**\n\nI don't think it needs to be explained that much as everybody who are like that probably hate it and know why they hate it. But for the sake of this post I will tell you why I hated being socially invisible:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **it's boring** \\- most of the time you will be just listening what people say and if you don't find it that interesting then you are bored out of your mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **people don't care about your opinion** \\- even if you have something to say people will ignore it (it's funny that oftentimes it's like they don't even hear you and when some other person says the EXACT same thing then everybody will react to it and say it's a good idea or smth even though you just said it before).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **you get no attention from women** \\- if some new girls were to come to the group then at the start they acknowledge your presence because they don't know the dynamics yet but after some time they will treat you the same way the whole group treats you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **you will rarely make new friends in the group** \\- if the people in the group interact with new people then you will not be part of the widened group anymore unless you step up. You might get a new friend if two groups collide and there is another socially invisible guy there though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\- **you don't form strong friendships with anybody**. There are usually one or two guys that you interact with more because you have something in common and they like to talk about their problems with you but with others you will barely talk outside the group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, this has been MY experience and I am sure there are several different forms of being socially invisible. My examples were based on a group of friends but you can be socially invisible in a choir, in your class or you might have no friends at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok, got it, it ain't awesome, how can I turn this around?**\n\nThe best advice would be to start all over with a new group. It's very hard to change your role in the old group. It might be possible if you haven't seen the group for a long time and then start interacting with it again but if you spend a lot of time together it's hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't blame the group though, always remember that at the start, nobody knows your social status and it is YOU who is responsible for the way people treat you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It's a bold statement, what do I mean under it?**\n\nIf you act like you are invisible then people will treat you as if you were invisible. \n\nWhat is funny is that if you act like a rock star then people will treat you as one as well.\n\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to make yourself noticed:**\n\n\\- **talk what's on your mind** (don't filter your thoughts to find what's the best thing to say).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **don't try to please everybody** (if you want to be liked by everybody then people will lose all respect for you. They know that you are trying to be liked and it feels like somebody is sucking the life out of you).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\- **think of yourself as an equal** (This is a big one. One of my biggest mistakes has been when being introduced to new people in the group that I act as if the new person is only the friend of my other friend and I should not interact with him. \n\nWRONG - assume that he is also your friend now and talk to him like he was specifically there to interact with you).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\- **take up space** (if your body language is weak then it will show. Try physically taking up more space. It shows people that you are not afraid to be seen).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*These are only a couple of thing you could do.. it would be awesome if everyone could add their own tips in the comments :)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BONUS...**\n\nIf you enjoyed this post then we **strongly encourage** ALL new members to **read our** [**Guide on How to Meet Girls**](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/kpnakg/guide_how_to_meet_girls_during_covid19/) to get help with the most commonly asked questions/problems such as:\n\n\\- how to set up your profile on dating app\n\n\\- what to text\n\n\\- how to get girls to meet up with you\n\n\\- where to meet girls IRL\n\n\\- what to talk about\n\n\\- how to flirt etc. \n\nIt has **ALL** the basics you'll need to **get you approaching and setting up dates** straight away so I **highly suggest** reading that!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thank you for reading and comment down below what you though about this topic :)*

nzfxvn	neutral	DISCUSSION THREAD: what is the biggest obstacle for you in dating?: I'm hoping this thread can serve as a way for us to actually talk about dating strategy and discuss not only our problems, but also potential solutions. So what is your biggest challenge in dating? Have you tried anything to overcome it, and if so has it worked? Why or why not?
t9yydk	benevolent sexism	stripping / OF aren't actually \"empowering\" no one genuinely wants to do them: \"Gas prices need to stop going up, I'm not built for only fans\" people are joking on social media. It's a problematic sentence, because of pandering to the model body type, but it's also deeply honest in saying that no one actually wants to strip or do OF. \n\nThe women that do these things have often been groomed or come from abusive situations where they see it as their last resort. More and more young women are being groomed into it by society now preaching that it's empowering and woke and feminist- when really it's nvm hoping they can get a crumb of pussy for free or extremely cheap/extremely low effort. \n\nIt's not empowering when you have to use a fake name to protect your safety. It's not empowering to have to have bouncers around and have them walk you to your car because the lvm want to stalk or attack you. Stripping and OF isnt helping make the world a better place or helping future generations. It's enabling depraved pornsick scrotes to keep objectifying women. It's why so many scrotes want to instantly snapchat or Netflix and chill instead of actually properly dating and courting a women. They all want free sex or very low effort to get sex fast... because OF type of things are so easily accessible and free/ cheap. \n\nNo woman can actually confidently put on her resume that she did OF or stripping or the like. Likewise, her job \"expires\" because scrotes loose interest when she naturally starts getting older. When OF or stripping is no longer something she can make an income off of, what actual professional skills or career does she have to fall back on? \n\nLikewise, of doesn't get deleted. Likewise, people especially in small towns don't forget faces. \n\nThere's nothing empowering about it. It's degrading and often takes the self esteem issues the woman already had and often makes them worse. Men respect you even less. Society still truthfully sees it as a shameful thing. Truthfully, dancing naked for some dollar bills and being ogled at is degrading. You wouldn't want your own daughter or little sister doing it. Men wouldn't want their daughters or little nieces doing it either. \n\nIt's just feeding into the abundance of lvm and nvm and why so many continue to keep objectifying us and trying to get sex so quick for cheap.

t67y5i	neutral	i was raped at a party: to start off, i am non binary, but male by birth, my preferred pronouns are they/them, please be respectful \n\nbut here's the thing that you don't see in statistics, a girl was also unfortunately raped at that party under the same circumstances as me. both times had the same reaction, everyone thought that i \"got lucky\" and it was the same with the girl. there want an outrage about either, because people didn't see either as rape. so basically stop posting rape statistics that day this and that. its not a competition, rape is a problem for all people and as far as im concerned i dont give a fuck if a rapist is a man or a woman, theyre just dirt. so stop for the love of god trying to one up saying \"men get raped more\" it doesnt matter.
t3uymv	neutral	An status report on sex discrimination in draft registration: First, let me say that I have been meaning to do this since the beginning of the year, and it is not related to current events, so no one should panic about something that is not likely to happen. \n\nI thought it would be best to break up this post into a section dealing with Congress and a section dealing with the courts.\n\n**What to watch for in Congress**\n\nAs you may know, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved amendments last year extending the registration requirement to women. The full House approved a version of the NDAA that included gender neutral SS registration, but the Senate delayed consideration of the NDAA until December. Due to this time crunch, Congress decided to forgo the traditional conference committee process for the NDAA, with the final bill being negotiated by the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate armed services committees. This final bill failed to include several amendments that had been approved by the armed services committees, including the requirement for universal registration.\n\n[Politico: Lawmakers drop proposal to add women to the draft as defense bill headaches mount](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/06/ndaa-women-draft-dropped-523829)\n\nAfter the amendment was dropped, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand had this to say: \n&gt;\u201cTo say, \u2018Only men are needed,\u2019 in that moment of a national emergency, is outrageous and obscene,\u201d Gillibrand said at a December 8 news conference. In a statement she said she\u2019ll continue to pursue \u201call legislative routes to implement this policy\u201d through annual defense spending or a standalone bill.\n\n[NPR: Despite a defeat in Congress, advocates say they'll keep pushing for women to register for the draft]\n(https://www.tpr.org/military-veterans-issues/2021-12-15/despite-a-defeat-in-congress-advocates-say-theyll-keep-pushing-for-women-to-register-for-the-draft)\n\nThe time to watch Congress closely on this issue will be when the NDAA markup process begins again, which should be early summer. \n\n**What to watch for in the courts**\n\nAs you also may know, the Supreme Court declined to take up *National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System* last June. The denial of cert was accompanied by a statement from Justices Sotomayor, Breyer, and perhaps notably Kavanaugh explaining that cert was denied to give Congress more time to consider the recommendation for universal registration from the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service ([ACLU: National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System](https://www.aclu.org/cases/national-coalition-men-et-al-v-selective-service-system-et-al)).\n\nNoting this statement, ACLU Women's Rights Project Director Ria Tabacco Mar wrote in *The Nation* after denial of cert: \n&gt;Though Congress has proved stubbornly resistant to change, a prod from justices across the ideological spectrum provides reason to hope that this time will be different. **And, if not, we\u2019ll be knocking at the Supreme Court\u2019s door once again.**\n\n[The Nation: It\u2019s 2021. Why Are Only Men Required to Register for the Draft?](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/women-draft-registration-congress/)\n\nThis article was approvingly retweeted by ACLU National Legal Director David Cole, so this is a good sign for future ACLU involvement in litigation around the discriminatory draft registration law. The fact that Congress failed to fix the problem last year after being given a chance by the Supreme Court should give an opening for a new challenge.\n\nThere is also another case pending in federal court in New Jersey initiated by a young woman who tried to register but was denied. It's being handled by a lawyer from the prominent New York firm Boies Schiller Flexner. There haven't been any filings since the woman's motion opposing an administrative stay after the Supreme Court's denial of cert in NCFM v. SSS last June, but nothing has been granted and the case is still live. I will periodically check Pacer for updates on this case.\n\nI will also periodically post updates here when new information becomes available.
t7d749	neutral	I'm tired of being punished with the complete removal of any affection. All I've ever wanted and the only thought that kept me going in life was getting into a relationship and finally having someone to hold me and give me attention. Now after I can see because I'm a man that's never going tohappen: I've been neglected,  talked down to,  destroyed mentally and emotionally. My mother was a whore that just liked to fuck around and party and never wanted children. She never said that out loud of course but in the way she raised me it was obvious. I've suffered since I was born and almost been killed more than a few occasions because of her neglect and abuse of me. My life was hell and the only thought that kept me going was one day,  one day I'll meet someone who loves me for me. One day I'll meet someone who cares about me and likes to be with me and will hold me and love and all this suffering will be worth it. Heart break after heart break I managed to finally meet someone.  I've been with her a couple years now. I can't remember the last time she touched me.  I asked her for a hug and a kiss last night.  I can't even get that any more.  And it destroys me inside.  I can't remember the last time she voluntarily touched me. On her own accord. She won't admit it but i feel like she hates me. Like she's disguted by me. We're in separate bedrooms now too. I just want attention. But I was born a man. If I don't provide, if I don't do chores if I don't do everything perfectly right to make sure she's happy and satisfied I get nothing and even then it's just a chance. I don't know what to do anymore. Love is all that ever mattered to me but as a man I don't think I can find the kind of love I want and need anymore. I just feel broken inside these days. I go to work I do the chores on my list and whatever else I'm asked besides that I just watch TV and sleep. Because I really don't see any point in anything else. Anything fun i see and want to do I think oh that'll be fun to share that with her but then I remember oh that's never going to happen. I just feel like I've lost my will to love sometimes.
t8ooqm	neutral	Does anyone else find this question (or a variation of it) annoying: \"What would you do if an extremely strong man hits on your girlfriend and slaps her ass?\: This is why I find this annoying. What am I supposed to do even if he does that besides moving far away from him with my girlfriend? If he doesn't respect the boundaries of a girl regardless of she's single or in a relationship, he wouldn't respect the guy who's with her. I'm most likely to get a beating if I confront a guy like that.\n\nBesides, unlike what the media shows, men are not violent at all. When it comes to situations like that we prefer to cool it down with words more than our fists. We avoid violence at all costs. Yes, there are violent men (same as women) but we hate them as much as anyone else in the world. \n\nThis is not a Stone Age era where it's the survival of the fittest and you can only stay in the \"pack\" if you show dominance. We are way ahead of that time and we don't have to prove our manliness to anyone.
o6lh5e	ambivalent sexism	My Male Dating Manifesto: Make no mistake, I am not interested at all in RedPill, MGTOW, etc. philosophy, and it is well-advised not to make this sub some collection of PUA garbage. I put this little treatise together with a singular intent: we need a realistic, earnest, and insightful alternative to the harmful dating advice that floats around the Internet for men. The mirror image of FDS is vastly preferred.\n\nLike it or not, FDS is *on to something* with their ideology. They fit it into their own worldview, they have their own hot take, their ideas are for the express benefit of women in general. This does not mean that they do not articulate certain problems with clarity and accuracy, because they do so. However, as a man, you should take what is of value to you and leave the rest. I will not go into detail on what they have wrong, as this is not a diatribe against one idea or another. We can be more efficient by honing in on a couple ideas that I think provide the fundamentals for a healthy male mindset in dating.\n\nThese will take the form of several dos and don'ts, which breaks up the material and lets you evaluate each part of this separately.\n\n# Get a hold of yourself\n\nMen thrive on purpose. Your purpose is not contingent on some vague notion of success, it is not tied (directly) to money, it is not wrapped up in what women think of you, it is not elevated by the number of women you bed, it is not quantifiable but rather felt by you and by all around you. **This thing we call purpose is a sense of direction, momentum, a vision for your future, tangible goals, and integrity**\n\nMen get caught up on the specifics of what *purpose* means. They think this entails getting a thrill out of HVAC repair or firmly believing the fulcrum of your world pivots on your being a professional chef. Purpose might also be called principle or potential. Your value as a man pours out from a *je ne sais quois* which defies conventional explanation but is best embodied in what it gives back to you.\n\nThere is some element of how to attain such a thing in philosophies like Stoicism, but attempts to really grasp this thing fail utterly. Evolutionary biology probably has a good explanation, as a Christian I have my own views, but it goes beyond outcome independence and good judgment. Soren Kirkegaard in his work *Fear and Trembling* discusses a kind of man he calls the Knight of Faith. This is a man always fulfilled, unshakeable, believes in impossible things, and shows gratitude for just his very existence. Every sunset is as beautiful as the last, and if he gets off work early or gets stuck in two hours of traffic doesn't matter. I think that as a man gets closer to this sense of purposeful living, he will demonstrate these qualities.\n\nThere is no secret or shortcut to getting to such a point. It requires your own self-reflection on living intentionally. When you are by yourself, in silence, you start to assess yourself and your decisions. Do you really own your decisions, or excuse them for this reason or that? Have you thought your life through? Do you actually know what you want or let others dictate your life? Do you believe in something, or have do you have a patchwork quilt worldview made of what other people have said?\n\nSpend some time going over your life choices and really consider if they make sense. Men think having an answer is the same as having a good answer. Example: Taking a job because you \"need a job\" is not a good reason; you could have worked under the Queensboro Bridge giving head for $15 a man, but you didn't, even though you \"need a job\". Chances are that the job did not seem challenging and paid above your current living expenses, and the fear of not being employed put you in a state of panic. You probably found the job on Indeed instead of working directly with a recruiter or being hired by a friend or relative, the latter two putting you more at risk if you fail and require more effort. Did you really put forth enough effort to become gainfully employed, or were you lazy?\n\n# Some rules for dating\n\nI don't feel like explaining each and every point, you either get it or you don't. If you really, really don't understand why I listed something here and aren't here to argue, comment and I'll clue you in.\n\n1. If at 8-10 months in, you have ANY doubts about a lifetime commitment to this woman, break up with her.\n2. Ideally save it for marriage, an engagement at minimum. Honestly dude, it's just not worth it to mess with this beforehand. You are engaging in a primal, hormone-steeped act. It is not safe, it is not casual, it is not fulfilling.\n3. Don't be a sap. Be authentic with women, if she says something stupid don't hold back, you can tell her; I'm sure she can handle it like a big girl.\n4. Don't run game, it's transparent and doesn't work. Negging and all that will probably trick really dumb or ugly girls but the ones you would want as a wife know all the Doctor Love tricks already because they've seen it their entire adult lives.\n5. Don't jerk off, ever.\n6. Vast majority of women are not worth one date much less dating for a period of time. Don't let her attraction to you trick you into being attracted to her. Unless she made you heart drop at first glance and it makes you physically sick to be away from her, not worth the time or money investment. Don't waste her time either.\n7. Don't let her move in with you, ever, unless you are married.\n8. Be firm with your boundaries, be vocal when they are crossed, and leave her if she does not respect them.\n9. Pay close attention to your woman and what she says. You will never run out of ideas for dates, gifts, conversation topics, etc. if you follow this basic premise.\n10. Don't reorient your entire life around your woman, but don't stiff her out either. With proper judgment you will know the difference.\n11. Date other woman freely until she either asks for commitment or she commits to you.\n12. Put a lot of effort, intention, and thought into everything you do with a woman. Carelessness and laziness are not what make you valuable.\n13. Date within your age range, no more than a few years younger or older.\n14. You take some massive risks with women who have a body count higher than 1. There are outliers but it's better to just avoid it altogether. She WILL lie to you about this. Unless she has only ever been in one, long-term relationship, or says outright that she is a virgin, assume her body count is greater than 10.\n15. Get married. Best bet is in your early or mid 20s.\n16. Find a family-oriented woman who prioritizes having one of her own. Career-oriented women should have such a job that offers them the freedom to work infrequently or work from home, otherwise I hope you're good with never having kids.\n17. Your relationship should make your life easier, not harder, and make you feel better, not worse.\n18. Talk about things you do at work, family trips you had as a kid, ask her lots of questions. Save Warhammer lore and e-celeb drama for your buddies.\n19. Choose a woman who will be a good mother for your kids. All other considerations fall below first.\n20. Trust your instincts. You will not find the secrets to a happy and healthy marriage from some Internet personality like Jordan Peterson. You have about 50,000 human generations in your blood that know better than Internet grifters.\n21. Pre nups won't save you, courts toss them out all the time on the basis of it being conditional of your marriage. Nor should you EVER get married to a woman unless you were 100% convinced a pre nup would be unnecessary.\n22. Take care of your skin, your hair, your health, etc. because there is a male wall if you fail in this regard. It's not just familial genetics. If you're white, you are more at risk of this happening because you will get ashy and not know, have a high risk of balding, and have the worst testosterone drop off after age 35.\n23. Work your ass off at your job, people can tell if you don't, especially women you are dating.\n24. Get a hobby like writing short stories or translating books from other languages, something you can do on your nights by yourself, something to fall back on and focus on outside of work. Even better if it pays passive income. It rounds you out more, and gives you something to talk about that is mildly interesting bedsides Bionicles or the 1000 hours you put into New Vegas.\n25. Know your area well. Makes date ideas way easier and you won't embarrass yourself by getting lost somewhere in town.

He ends up shouting \"I wanna break up\" and says things like \"you're always making me do things I dont wanna do\" and she just looks at him like she has been wronged in the worst way possible. At the and of the video when they get off the roller coaster she says to him \"youre a dick and you know it\".\n\nIt's good to see half of the comments are defending him but some are siding with the woman and calling him a \"little bitch\" and sympathising with the woman because \"she got dumped on a roller coaster\". Some people are using the excuse that \"he shouldn't have gotten on the roller coaster\" which is true but it's evident that he was forced to get on by some means.\n\nIf you swap the genders you can imagine how hard a dude would be bashed for forcing his gf out of her comfort zone and then encourage breaking up with him, which is by no means wrong but to see a different reaction when it's the woman forcing her bf out of his comfort zone is just sad.

tcasgp	neutral	Here's some love and encouragement for women leaving or thinking about leaving their LVMs: I say this with a lot of love and encouragement, *leaving him is in your best interest.* It's better to choose the short term intense pain of leaving rather than the long term pain and regret of being deeply unhappy with this man. I think the hard part here is that you're used to him. We all get used to our partners in long term relationships. People always underestimate how scary and gut wrenching it can be to leave when you're just so used to having this person in your life. It feels like someone died when you leave. But I promise you that leaving is choosing happiness. You are only human so it is normal to feel deeply hurt and grieve this relationship. Your feelings are very valid. It is really important to understand that the pain part of the healing process and  doesn't mean that you must go back to him. Before meeting this man, you probably lived many happy years without him. And you will live the rest of your years happily without him.\n\nI know FDS advocates for the ruthless block and delete. I do agree with this but in practice, I acknowledge that it's extremely difficult in long term relationships. The feeling of being used to someone is  so often underestimated. It's  actually a pretty powerful pull to stay in a comfort zone and tolerate the BS. Leaving your partner and cutting them off can feel as gut wrenching as cutting off a  parent or sibling. Again it's the powerful pull of being used to a person. Working towards being HV is really hard work. \nYou just need to find the strength not to waste anymore years of your life on LVM. Your time on this earth is finite, then you're dead. That time is priceless. Don't give him anymore of it. \n\nA question to ask yourself is do you really still love him or are you just used to him?\n\nSending all my fellow FDS ladies virtual hugs and love \ud83e\udd17\u2665\ufe0f
ta33z1	hostile sexism	Since Me Too has erupted on October 2017 women's issues occupy the headlines daily and are constantly in public awareness. On women's days it's becoming men-bashing-women-self-victimization day, and I'm tiered of hearing about that.: It's  safe to say that since October 2017 every day is women's day. This  might sound as a hyperbole, but in fact this is more or less the case:  February 6 is international day of zero tolerance to female genital  mutilation, February 11, the international day of women and girls in  science, week of March 8, international women's week, March 8,  international women's day, March 10, international day of women judges,  April 3, international day against victim-blaming, April 24,  international girls in ICT day (information and communications  technology), May 24, international women's day for peace and  disarmament, June 23, international widows day (there is no widower's  day, hence this is mentioned here as a special day only for women),  August 1, world breastfeeding week, October 11, international girl's day  (again, there is no boy's day, so the day is mentioned here as a  special day only for women), October 15, international day of rural  women, November 19, women's entrepreneurship day, November 25,  international day for the elimination of violence against women. These  are the official days announced as international by the United Nations,  and each country adds to those national dates. For example, [the Canadian list](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/women/important_dates.html)  adds eating disorders awareness week, the Canadian sexual and  reproductive health day, national day of action - girls action  foundation, invisible work day, anniversary of N.B. women's right to  vote, sexual assault awareness month, mother's day and mothers' week,  national ovarian cancer awareness month (Canada is not listing in its  national dates a father's day or a prostate cancer month so these are  included here as special dates only for women), the 3rd Friday in  September is take back the night week, October is simultaneously women's  history month and breast health month, and includes first nations  women's day, and November 25 to December 10 are 16 days of activism  against violence against women which include December 6, national day of  remembrance and action on violence against women. Other countries have  similiar or different women's issues national dates added to the  international ones.\n\nSo, there are  13 women's days on the international calendar and 7 more on an average  national calendar, the international ones becoming 24 when weeks for  women's issues are included and the national reaching 131 days when  women's weeks and months are counted (I didn't examine the overlaps  between the international and national days, weeks and months, so this  number might become a little smaller when it's women's day twice a day).

o7bo6v	neutral	How to meet people without using dating apps: Even though many people use dating apps and I have nothing against them, I still prefer meeting people organically / in real life. \n\nOne good way to do this (and also how I\u2019ve met friends as well as some people that I\u2019ve gone on dates with) is by going to the same place repeatedly. \n\nFor example, I would go to the same fitness class or a certain cafe weekly and I would start to notice the regulars. I will then become more comfortable introducing myself and they are probably more comfortable introducing themselves too because we\u2019re doing this shared activity regularly!! \n\nAlso if you think about it, that\u2019s a reason why you see many people get together in college or from a workplace because you\u2019re all going to this same place at the same time every week!\n\nAlso it\u2019s great because you\u2019ll find likeminded people, people who share your same hobbies so you have that common ground already!
sruk1k	ambivalent sexism	Is it serious ? Is it how women: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/smrhd9/im_finally_dating_a_grown_ass_man_instead_of_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share So I read this post and I am still in disbelief about what I see . Let's make things clear. The problem is not the man taking care of the woman . But the problem is the "reversal" of the traditional role . Maybe what I am going to say will sounds sexist but despite the fact I know how to cook(because since I cook since 16), I will never do it for a grown woman, unless she is sick . But if she is doing well, I will not. "Mental charge" because of the chores ? Is it an american thing ?

t3rgqg	neutral	What\u2019s the reason for men being considered disposable?: Yes I know that the historical argument was that for example 10 women and one man can repopulate much quicker than 10 males and one female. However I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very valid point in this day and age since there\u2019s something like consent and a husband. I seriously doubt women would would agree to have children with a random man and that\u2019s completely okay. It\u2019s normal to want to have children with your husband and not just being used as a baby-making machine.\n\nNow that the biggest argument has been refuted let\u2019s move onto modern ages. Men and women are supposed to be equal according to the law, it even says that in our constitutions around the world. Not only that but it\u2019s also the general consensus which I don\u2019t have anything against. Gender equality is great but it shouldn\u2019t be thrown away when shit hits the fan. That makes it not trustworthy at all and therefor it wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nI understand that in war situations children get evacuated since they can\u2019t fight. That\u2019s all good but why can all women of all ages and regardles of if they have children leave? I for example am an 18 yo guy who hasn\u2019t experienced life yet opposed to for example a 40yo woman who has no children and has already experienced life. It seems wildly and inherently sexist to say that I\u2019m somehow a disposable trash while she\u2019s important. \n\nWe have refuted the first argument and not all women of child bearing age will die since parents with children would be allowed to leave. Also if theoretically all military age men were killed it would mean that women would have to sleep with old men but this whole scenario is pretty much imposible anyway.\n\nI live in a country nearby Russia and have lately thought about a scenario where Russia kept going and my country trapped all of us males. All of these points have made me sure that I would defintely not stay and fight for my country. I would be the first one to leave but I\u2019m not quite sure how it woild be done. Would probably get my mom to drive our car and smuggle myself to the otter side of the border in our trunk under a bunch of stuff.\n\nSorry for the long post but I just had to get this off my chest
t0xfy7	neutral	Falling off of the mask: I\u2019ve been in touch with a guy who I met on OLD some time back when I was active on the apps (and now I know better) and we hadn\u2019t met owing to the pandemic. However, I was recently travelling to his city and thought it would be a good time to meet up for a dinner after months of being in touch. For background, he had shown a lot of interest in how much I earn and how he was \u201cso impressed\u201d with my career prospects, and how he really liked me. He\u2019d been after my life to meet and was fairly decent in his behaviour, but I could feel the pressure that he imposed to meet up. I was also not very serious in terms of any commitment with him. \n\nWhile I was planning this dinner with him, to my utter disgust, he actually suggested that we should skip the date and just \u201chook up\u201d which first he suggested would be at his place but later, suggested that I should book a hotel room for us (because I earn more). This is a guy who I\u2019ve never met leave alone for a date, and the sheer entitlement shocked me. I have never removed someone from my life faster. The audacity has just left me wonder whether he just couldn\u2019t wait for his mask to fall off. The number of red flags (as per the Handbook) that were hoisted just because he thought that we were finally meeting and that he could get what he has been putting up for is unimaginable. I\u2019m glad I avoided the mental agony of even having to meet him, let alone go on an actual date. Makes me realise the value of vetting, boundaries and not giving in too easily in more absolute terms.

t8ynmq	neutral	Men finding \"love\" with AI chatbots - Horrifying Black Mirror episode, good alternative to sex workers, or both? - 'I fell in love with my AI girlfriend - and it saved my marriage': TW: Mention of su*cidal thoughts.\n\nI was very horrified by this article but wanted to have a discussion here since even though it made me physically shudder to learn this man is having cyber sex with this AI it also seems like a much better outcome for women to have undateable men be pacified and entertained by bots than actual human sex workers. Especially since they provide unlimited affection, affirmation, and attention it really seems like a great tool to neutralize incels and no women are harmed or trafficked unlike the disgusting advice to \"just get a prostitute\". In this case I find the fact that his wife doesn't know he's literally having an affair with a computer to be despicable and tragic but for men who will never be able to get a consenting human woman to look their way I can see the value? Basically I think if a man is willing to waste his hours on AI like this he's doing us all a favour by weeding himself out of the dating and gene pool. This also seems far less radicalizing than watching violent p*rn and socializing online with other incels. OTOH I can see the argument that this just plays into their fantasy that a woman should acquiesce and cater to them 24/7 and is damaging and not a net benefit.

t6cexk	hostile sexism	A reminder to support women who stand with us.: It has come to my attention recently that there are women who are supportive of men not being abused and standing up against the current feminist movement that is so popular with young women today. I recently came upon a woman on YouTube shorts firing back at women who make fun of men's height and bodies. Can't remember her channel sorry about that. \n\nWe can't win our rights or make progress without these woman as it has been made clear any opinion the average man holds means nothing. I think there will be more and more women in the future and we have to support them as they are often called derogatory names and labels. \n\nI just attribute women standing up to men as essentially Russians protesting the war although it is an exaggeration .

sz6rte	neutral	Shitty Scrote Bus Driver: I commute three hours to work due to my epilepsy since I\u2019m not able to drive. This morning my card was declined so I had to go reload it. The machines at my station glitched twice. I had to to run to the next pay station which was at the end of the other station and the bus was leaving in less than ten minutes. The driver apparently told me that he tried to help me, but I ran away and called me a con artist. Both machines were glitching and I managed to load my fund through my phone,  by then, my metro pass was frozen. He called me scam artist and know that \u201cpeople like me\u201d purposefully like to do this to get a free ride. I tried to explain to him that both machines were frozen, but he said, \u201c I don\u2019t believe you \u201c and was prepared to leave me stranded in the middle of nowhere at 8:30 am. Thankfully, I when I checked the balance on my card again, and my metro pass worked again.\n\nI have tried filing a complaint, but I assume this is going to be \u201cburied under paperwork\u201d. When I went home, the place was heavily guarded with spare inspectors. I have a feeling he lied to investigators, or the city is choosing his side of the story over mine. The station the event happened was at the end terminal station in a small city. I have the route number, the time I boarded the bus, and my transaction history. I\u2019m going to follow up until I\u2019m less angry. The reason why this scrote got away with treating me like this is because he\u2019s gotten away with it before. I intend to make it so that he no longer drives the route or is a bit nicer to passengers.\n\nI have to take the morning route alone for the first 15 minutes with alone him every morning for my new job. This is a thirty minute bus ride. My mother is worried for my safety. I told her I\u2019d record myself as soon I get on the bus. She said that I should just drop it. But for some reason, I can\u2019t let men get away with stuff like this especially when they\u2019re probably unionized, and have the support and backing of their company.\n\nWhat should I do?\nHow can I have a better impact or work effectively towards men like this?\n\n\nI\u2019ve already explained my predicament in the complaint form, and gave him a one star rating. How do I further escalate this? I plan to call them after 72hours as stated by their policy after filing a compliant. But how do I further escalate the situation to get my voice heard?
t9hbpb	hostile sexism	Alternatives to International Men's Day?: Some misogynistic men have tarnished International Men's Day over the years and some misandrist feminists have successfully appropriated that same day to their own ends. In my opinion, IMD has been damaged beyond redemption and it's time to shop for alternatives. I'll present some of my proposals below.\n\nI'm not suggesting that every MRA should observe everyone of these days; but I think that if each MRA tried to observe at least one, this could be an opportunity to educate the public about sexual injustices in our society.\n\nI. 19 February: Pizzey Day:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey\n\nMisogynistic men wouldn't want to observe her day because she's a woman. Feminists wouldn't know how to appropriate it because she's a woman who stood for the rights of male victims of domestic abuse in the face of death threats. Feminists wouldn't know how to demonize her because she started the first refuge for abused women in the West.\n\nII. International Women's Day:\n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day\n\nYes, you read that right. If feminists can appropriate International Men's Day for their ends, why can't we appropriate International Women's Day for our own?\n\nIt can be a day for MRA's to celebrate the women we admire for their contribution to society (like Erin Pizzey among many others)while also disproving the feminist assertion that we all just hate women.\n\nIII. 24 October: United Nations Day:\n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/observances/un-day\n\nFor all its flaws, the UN is still the best international body we have at present and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (one of it's most important documents) states in its Article 2:\n\n'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.'\n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\n\nWhile feminists certainly have tried to appropriate the UN for their own ends, we can do the same; but we'd have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on our side.\n\nIV. 15 December, Zamenhof Day:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamenhof_Day\n\nDr. Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof had made a significant contribution towards promoting brotherhood and justice between the peoples of the world. While feminists like to portray men as bloodthirsty warmongers, an MRA observing Zamenhof Day would fly in the face of that feminist stereotype.\n\nWhat other alternatives can you propose?

t9tc7c	interpersonal sexism	Women are always held to a morally higher standard than men. Men can coerce women into sex by paying for dates or even guilt trip them on 50/50 dates but God forbid women \"use\" men for a free meal: I'm starting to realize that a lot of libfems hold so much internalised misogyny. They're lifems on social media but anti-women in real life. One example is, my cousin started shaming two women who apparently joked that their meal tonight is covered by their dates. She was seething with disgust at them and accused them of being users. But nobody bothers to caution women that so many men are predatory and use paying for dates to bully and coerce women into sex. Even 50/50 scrotes have the audacity to guilt trip and harass women for sex. We're literally risking our lives and safety by going out with men. The least they can do is cover the bill. \n\nI think Pickmeishas resent women with standards. A man paying for a date is the bare minimum. Notice how society resents and shames women more for expecting a man to do the right thing and cover the bill more than they would shame anyone for doing something wrong, like expecting a family member or friend to pay every time they go out. \n\nAnyway, I wrote a previous more in-depth post on the subject if anyone is interested. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/pkfgxe/i_cant_get_over_how_society_shames_women_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=sharej

t4i599	hostile sexism	Yesterday's Post...: I can honestly say that the post was out of frustration of seeing dudes be fearful of their significant other in a "my girl will beat my ass" type of way. Though I still stand on what I said, I feel as if I could have worded it better. Part of my frustrations come from seeing men on social media playing a simple joke/prank on their girl and dudes in the comments saying "he's risking his life" Or "he choose death" but I never see those comments when its the other way around. That goes to show that women can do whatever they want to men and we have to deal with it and only women get to overreact, get physical and still not be held accountable.
pjya6y	hostile sexism	New ways to guard against False Accusations.: Apologies if it has been covered before. But in view if the string of false accusations against men in workplaces and real life, men's rights and interests have to be protected. I think this checklist takes prevents most men from facing false accusations: as it collects a trail of evidence and avoids a situation where the man might be vulnerable. \n\n\n\n1. Don't meet them. If you must meet them, meet them in public, or in the office with other people present. Prevents fake accusations. \n\n2. Keep a one touch recording app in your phone. Keep that app button in home screen record every convo with them. Learn how to start the recording without looking at your phone. Record your convos with them when speaking 1 on 1 in real world. It records what they said, and can help you if falsely accused.\n\n3. Record every outgoing and incoming calls on your phone. Tons of apps for this out there. Android does it automatically anyway in updated versions.\n\n4. Keep a Webcam working (or even non working webcam) in your office. Keep a notice by its side \"I record all conversations in this office e for our mutual safety.\"\n\n5. Do NOT keep a social media profile under your own name. Your posts in social media are frequently the ones that are used to frame men.\n\n6. Do not promote them or mentor them or help them in any way.\n\n7. Do not speak up with other people on their behalf. Support the men.\n\n8. If there is workplace discrimination against men, raise it politely with your HR, citing your concern and mentioning the words \"i am concerned about workplace discrimination and i request you to remedy it.\" This will form a basis for future lawsuits and HR will know it. But write in asap. Don't wait. They may already be writing in about you.\n\n9. Keep 60% of your cash overseas in another country's bank account. Its not easy to touch it. There are lots of info out there on this. Or keep in bitcoins. Keeps it out of reach of your gf or ex, if relationships go sour.\n\n10. If you can't do point 9, keep cash with your parents if possible (I'm assuming you can trust your parents).\n\n11. Get a second passport based on ancestry. Did you know that in case of a family court judgement against men, getting g out of the country may be impossible with a regular passport as it may be freeze? Second passport comes in handy.

Instead they have \"profiles\" on someones else's website created BY MEN.\n\nIf girls aren't begging for validation or attention they are just window shopping because men are just accessories to their dating game don't be an option in their retarded chess game where they move you around like their pawn.\n\nmen of strong character and confidence let women come to them. \n\nYou aren't an animal you practice stoicism and self-control.

s45p5e	neutral	Real advice: Stop coming to this subreddit or FDS, it's all misandry or misogyny. So many perfectly healthy relationships have been ruined by these subreddits and the people who could never hold an actual relationship. My guess is that they're so toxic that they always blame the other patner for their own toxicity. They wanna ruin relation-ships, so they give bad advice on purpose. I may just be an author for a small book series, but please trust me when I say that these subreddits are not good for actual dating advice. Sure, there's some actual good advice, but that's often being overshadowed by the toxicity. My suggestion is go to a friend or family member who you 100% KNOW have a good and healthy relationship, and ask them for advice, not these toxic pieces of human garbage.

I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re going to judge me because I can\u2019t hold this in anymore. When you ghosted me in January, I felt really bad about it. I\u2019ve never been on a lot of dates so it was kinda a big deal for me to go out with you alone. Out of everyone I coups go out with, I chose you because I really really liked you. I legit told all my besties and even my mom that I\u2019m finally going out with a guy after a 2 year long hiatus and then you do that. I was almost gonna book my Uber when you stopped replying to me and I was so heart broken when the realisation hit me that I\u2019d been ghosted. I\u2019d have understood if it was me who was behind you but you were the one that asked me out 4 times until I said yes, and you then you do that. It was so embarrassing and hurtful when my friends would text me \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d because they assumed I was there. I didn\u2019t sleep that night, I was so hurt that I cried the whole time and I\u2019d check my phone at every buzz thinking it was you. You didn\u2019t talk to me until the end of February and I\u2019m mad at myself for even talking to you after you came back without even apologising.

nv34n2	ambivalent sexism	Preferring big boobs and thic ass should be as normal as liking eyes or a nice smile.: So this is my first post about objectivism of women in a while. I hope you don't get sick of me. I just wanted to address the issue of making men feel bad for their preferences. You might not notice it if you haven't been on a post about breast/ass size, but its pretty bad. I've already said in another post about how must men don't even know what a phat ass or a set of double G's are. Because you need a thicc attractive girl to receive them. Even when men on a post like that are like say they like big butt's or sexy curves. They are made fun of, like they don't know anything about their own anatomy. When a man rejects a girl because she was fugly, or wasn't packing the tits or ass (he prolly didn't wanna give her false hope and let's her down politely) the other women say \"he didn't deserve you QUEEN, you were lucky you didn't end up with him\". How is it a bad thing to politely reject someone if you don't like them? And also women, even ugly women would probably only go for men with supermodel faces, big dick skinny waists and with a flat stomach. So if they have \"standards\" for looks how is it bad if we *prefer* sexually attractive women? They don't want average men but we should have no problem with even no titty pancake chests with zero arse? Someone might like them, and thats okay too, they should get a women with no titts or ass. Everyone should be allowed their preferences whether its about how slutty a girl is  how shaven they are or if they have big or small boobs.\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ntt4n4/preferring_a_big_penis_should_be_seen_as_being_as/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

tdq9w8	neutral	What is attractive? Women want to know: Ok this is a question I have to ask. This is not my normal account because both my husband and I are active on Reddit. \n\nBackground: I am a mom in my mid 30s and in my second marriage. I have been in a very abusive relationship in the past, and also dealt with neglect. My current partner tells me often he finds me attractive but I see the fact that I was a smoke show when he met me (single mom of 1 in my early 30s and in my best shape) and now I am not by my standards (he wanted more kids and we had 2 in 1.5 years). I am well educated and a military veteran, I came from nothing and have worked hard all my life. I am a good mom and an excellent cook and was the sole bread winner in our family until the most recent munchkin was born and I had to stop for a while due to physical complications. I am over 6\u2019 tall, and i was once a model (although those days are well in my rear view). \n\nI say all that to ask this: what do guys ACTUALLY want?? I see the NSFW stuff on here, im not averse. But I see the women on there and I don\u2019t look like that. At least not at the moment. I\u2019m not complacent or lazy, but 2 c sections in 3 years will mess you up. I see all these videos now of men saying the mom bod is sexy and I want to believe it. But when I was coming of age that kind of talk was NOT popularized. So is that real? Are men just as into the person as women are and are conditioned not to say it? Are you really looking at us women who are not perfect? I really need to know this. I\u2019m not unhealthy but i can\u2019t cut weight like I have before since I\u2019m nursing. I appreciate the guys perspective on this!

nvqwha	hostile sexism	Your self worth: As the title says. Men always run after women to get their attention and recognition. We invest an insane amount of time and occasionally money into dating a woman who's not even worth it.\nWe have to stop doing that. We live in a modern society where men come with a full package. We earn money, clean the house, repair everyting around the house, and thank you we can make our own food. \nWe have our values and we know our self worth. Why would we waste money and time on somebody who hasn't shown us anything so far? Especially on the first 2-3 dates?\nIn these modern days women with their own income and a meter thick make up think their time should be enough for us. It is not. I am not talking about dtfs, or ons. I am talking about long term dating.\nUnless she shows interest in you and invests the same amount of time and money as you, you shouldn't consider giving her your attention. It is 50-50 in the beginning. \nYou are more valuable than them. You are expected to support the family financially, emotionally and while she tries to make sure that you have these traits, you almost always come to the realisation that she is just another materialistic whore, whith zero character.\nYou are a pillar who has to be hard working and focused full time. You work to earn money for your family. You get home and do what? Work. You repair your home, you do the chores and make food.\nWe have become self sufficient, we can only provide in a relationship and put the entire family's wee being abouve our happiness. What is their worth?\n-YoU doN'T HavE tO gIvE biRTh tO a BaBy.\n-Nobody wants a baby from an all expectations zero effort person, sweetheart.\n\nTo the lurkers: You have to show something other than your assets sweety, because we have those too.

t6f1f6	institutional sexism	In one-hundred years women have moved from being a minority during the 19th century to being in equality between the 1970s and the 1990s and then to being a majority today - in banking, law, psychology, media, literature, academic qualifications, medical schools - feminism never says "alright here it's enough" but after reaching supremacy of 75% (psychology) or 87% (literature) it continues with "women need a push, men need pushing out", and it's also forbidden for men to protest as feminism will tag them as "misogynists, against women's equality". Feminism has took over once-liberal, one-democratic cultural institutions such as newspapers and governmental and inter-governmental offices and uses them for propaganda that "women in a liberal society are the ones in a position of inferiority and men need to be pushed out", but when women in such liberal societies are already in a position of superiority this means only widening an existing gap. One percent of men are at the top of business and politics, feminism focuses only on them because women see only successful men and the rest are transparent to them. If 100% of women are equal to the top 1% of men and the other 99% of men are beneath all of them - is this equality? If in England of the 1980s at the top there is a woman as a queen and a woman as a prime-minister, then "all other women are strong enough" only because women are at the top?        Feminism in not "supporting equality" and objecting feminism is not "being against equality". Supporting equality is called supporting equality, and feminism has been supporting inequality for quite some time and generates radical inequality.

When we first met, I sensed he wanted to spend some time alone with me and he\u2019d invite me to things one-on-one. But my friends always tagged along and he\u2019d be kinda distant when we weren\u2019t alone. At first, I didn\u2019t want anything romantic with him, but the more I got to know him, the more I like him. \n\nIn the first year of knowing Adam, we went to a few parties together and I think his perception of me changed because he stopped wanting to hang out on one one. He\u2019s a quieter, more conservative guy and Im more of a party animal.\n\nAnyway, whenever we\u2019re out at parties, he always watches out for guys hitting on me and makes sure I\u2019m safe and comfortable. I wonder if he\u2019s just being a decent guy and a protective male friend, or if there\u2019s more to it.\n\nAlso, he makes comments like \u201cevery man is after you\u201d or \u201call the guys in this city want you\u201d. After a long long time, he asked me to go out with him(first one on one in a couple of years) and we talked a lot about relationships and sex and whatnot. But he didn\u2019t made a move on me and talked about other girls he had a crush on. \n\nSo I\u2019m confused: do you guys think he\u2019s into me or he\u2019s just a friend?

tcymld	institutional sexism	Australian report by feminist organisation claims support for men's right is a \"significant barrier to gender equality: This report summarises a survey of Australians with regards to attitudes towards gender equality and was conducted by a feminist organisation which is, as they all are, solely focused on things like getting more female CEOs and more women elected to political office. There is some good news in the report and the feminists must have burned in anger at having to write it. For example: &gt;**Men have been forgotten in the struggle for gender equality** &gt; &gt;Our survey reveals a worrying statistic in this regard: nearly half of all male respondents “agreed or strongly agreed” with the statement that “gender equality strategies in the workplace do not take men into account”. If we disaggregate the data by generation, we find that while millennial and builder males were most likely to report feelings of being left out, all generations exhibited similar sentiments. Millennial males were also significantly more likely (48 per cent) to “agree/strongly agree” with the statement that “Men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality”, followed by Gen Z males at 44 per cent. Gender equality measures are not the only interventions that are perceived by men to deepen, rather than fix existing inequalities. The highly contested concept of freedom of speech also reveals significant gendered differences, with men far more likely to say that political correctness benefits women in the workplace. This section is surprisingly revealing of feminist motivations. I'm surprised they would include this in a public report: &gt;**Male moderates are champions of men’s rights** &gt; &gt;The moderate perspective combines an egalitarian set of views around gender equality in the workplace and at home with rising concern over what they understand as the growing impact of political correctness in Australian society, as well as a strong desire to see men’s rights equally represented in public discussion of equality issues. Given that 62 per cent of Australians align with the moderate position and its value system, this represents a significant barrier to gender equality. Got that? Feminists think that concerns for men's rights and a desire to see men treated equally to women are an obstacle to feminists achieving the goals that they dishonestly label "equality". Other stats cited include: * 41% of Australian men believe that political correctness gives women an advantage in the workplace * 46% of Australian men believe that gender equality measures do not take men into account * 42% of Australian men believe that men and boys are increasingly excluded from measures to improve gender equality The feminist authors fear that these popular and growing attitudes could result in a "backlash" against feminist initiatives and "backsliding" away from the goals which they're pursuing. Of course, any time that feminists are unhappy or even hysterical it is good news for men and for progress towards true equality. I see this report as quite positive.

Besides, having an ego isn\u2019t healthy. They should shed ego altogether and learn to be self-validated without being coddled and lied to by a woman who in turn has to dim her light to keep him from feeling threatened and \u201cunneeded\u201d. \n\n\u201cIn order to get your partner to commit, you simply have to convince him that this relationship is something he needs.\u201d\n\nNope. Women don\u2019t need to convince men to commit to them. If he wanted to, he would. Men already have made up their mind within mere seconds if they want to pursue a woman or not. Or else a woman would just be a placeholder if she is the one who pursues. \n\n**\u201c1. Praise him.**\n\n**The Need:**\u00a0To hear your approval and admiration\n\n**Satisfy It By:**\u00a0Complimenting him regularly\n\nMen have surprisingly vulnerable egos so let your praise loose. Take time to remind your partner what you like about him and reassure him about all his qualities.\u201d\n\nUhm, no. Just no. Like I said before, he shouldn\u2019t have a fragile ego in the first place. He has to learn how to be self-validated, not rely on others\u2019 approval and validation to fill in the void. Walk away if you meet a guy like this. This type of guy tends to be hateful and jealous and expects you to dim your light not to threaten his ego.\n\n\"**2. Make him feel like a \u2018hero\u2019**\n\n**The Need:**\u00a0To feel needed.\n\nShow him that you\u00a0[value his opinions](https://hackspirit.com/ways-keep-a-man-interested-after-sleeping-with-him/)\u00a0and cherish his advice. Always express how much you look up to his competency and never humiliate him when he doesn\u2019t live up to your expectations.\"\n\nWomen shouldn\u2019t be in the position where they need a guy. Independent women shouldn\u2019t make men feel emasculated. It\u2019s not healthy to foster co-dependency. Also, it shouldn\u2019t be humiliating to receive constructive criticism on making a mistake. That\u2019s how we learn and grow. Coddling and lying to keep them from feeling \u201chumiliated\u201d and emasculated is a huge turn-off. It\u2019s hard to be attracted to a man like that. It\u2019s such a low value trait. Feeling any form of emasculation is a low-value trait. Full stop. Period. Because it requires women to diminish herself to keep men on the pedestal in order to not make men emasculated. \n\n\"**3. Allow him to be vulnerable.**\n\n**The Need:**\u00a0To have a safe space for his emotions\n\n**Satisfy It By:**\u00a0Being there for him and helping him heal\n\nAs a partner, you have to nurture him when he lets the cracks in his armour show.\n\nYou have to learn how to help him work through negative emotions such as sadness or fear without pushing him away.\n\nOtherwise, you will never be able to bridge that emotional gap.\"\n\nWomen are not rehabilitation centres. Go to fucking therapy and learn to build healthy emotional self-regulation skills. Stop with this nonsense. Women are not equipped to do emotional labour work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a mess of an article. It was too much to unpack, so I'm gonna stop there. I can't believe how normalized these stupid advices are. I constantly see these advices from men and women everywhere while growing up. It's literally everywhere. In media. In dating spaces. Every-fucking-where. \n\nI'm grateful for FDS for making me feel like I'm not crazy for being against these harmful messages where women should bear all the responsibilities while men don't have to do shit while expecting to be praised.

I've had a few short term relationships and one multi-year. However I haven't dated since the start of the pandemic. I have an objectively really solid life and I've been taking online courses that I'm interested in. However, I still feel a bit empty. It's hard to describe and at this point I'm just venting, so I'll stop.\n\n\nIs the next step wife and kids (I love kids but don't feel like I'm ready)? I'm not really sure.

You need to find a woman that has open business, that she isn't bringing drama to the table (nor only sex to the table), a wman that can take decisions when **you** aren't there, and that acknowledges your role, and that is a two-way street relationship, not a one-way street with alleyways (kids).\n\nYes, men have always been provides, and men shall continue to be, that's our role. That being said, don't be in a hurry, if she's in a hurry, she's a problem. If you're in a hurry in a relationship, she will be in control.\n\nAnd to finish and explain a bit more lets tell a story that I've heard, and so woman can understand too.\n\nYou are a mom and you have a son named Mark, Mark is in his mid 20s and has finished University, has a job, and a house, and able to take a loan for a car. Now, 2 girls are the \"wannabe future wifey\". We shall call them girl A and girl B. \n\nGirl A, is in her mid 20s, finished University too, has a car, is beautiful, and an open future, she is in her prime. \n\nGirl B, is also in her mid 20s, has 3 kids, from 2 different fathers, and look like her prime as been taken away 'cause of her children. As a mom, do you want you son Mark to be with girl A or girl B, and be honest, the freedom and future ahead, or the drama and weight of being a step-father when Mark still can work his way up in his life?

I like living with friends who are in their 20s - 30s. That is who I can relate to better than people that are my own age. But I've noticed that almost everyone buys a house after age 30. Am I expected to own a house? Will women stop dating me if I do not own a house? I have not dated since I moved into my friend's house by renting a room from him. That is because I have been so busy with transitioning to a new career field and studying when I am not at work to get certifications that I need. I will soon be going back into the dating market. But I am also considering getting a house before the interest rates go up. But the prices are so high that it has to really be worth it for me. If a house is something that women want from me then it is worth it for me to get a house. But if they really do not care, then it might not be worth it. I've always dated girls in their 20s to early 30s. I've never dated a woman in her 40s and cannot relate to them at all. Should I buy a house? Is a man not a real man if he does not own a house? Tell me your thoughts on this matter. You are all wiser than I. Thank you.

No cool looking group, movement or philosophy on the internet is going to make you transcend yourself or get you laid like a rockstar. On the unlikely event of it happening, its probably due to reasons concerning you or your context and not due to their teachings.\n\nThe advice you'll get here as alternative to red pill is nothing but (mostly) mundane stuff, common sense, or advice you may get in other places, because there are no elaborate easy answers in life. People may give you contrapoints, guide you in your detox process, give some advice, point in certain directions, like certain more down to earth dating coaches like Mark Manson, Howie Reith, Dr Nerdlove, The Mating Grounds... but that's about it.\n\n\n\"But, if this sub won't teach me how to get laid or to transcend myself as some super intellectually-cool-boss human being it's kinda pointless to be here\".\n\nPRECISELY. This sub is nothing but a gigantic slap of reality in the face telling you that all of these internet dating movements are nothing but an odd hedonistic treadmill that simply won't take you anywhere. Because nobody will.\n\nBut people seem to gravitate towards mental masturbations of elaborate concepts like AF/BB and deep philosophies of \"feminism, masculinity and western world\" because it gives them an illusory sense of control, knowledge and meaning. And so they can't think of a solution that doesn't seem to revolve about being a TRPer, or a MGTOW or whatever else. And when these groups fail to deliever they search for their next \"group high\": Johnny starts as a TRPer on Monday, becomes a MGTOW on Wednesday when he can't get laid or get's tired of women and ends the week as a \"Black pill\" because that's the \"real aweking, after all\". \n\nExredpill is a mere sub on reddit saying fuck all those groups and philosophies. Nobody needs no fucking internet guru to tell you how to live your life. Just do what you want and try to figure what works for you.

If he says 'no', she will mentally and emotionally abuse him with language such as 'You think I'm ugly' or 'Are you gay/impotent'? If a woman forcibly starts doing sexual acts to a man, and he pushes her away, he's suddenly abusive in society's eyes instead of someone who's stopping a rapist. Consent doesn't exist for men; men are told they're only supposed to want sex all the time, and can't be raped/taken advantage of.

srlh4h	ambivalent sexism	A message I wrote in a comment, I am pasting it here...: Please read the book Sapiens... It's a clear fact, that women took on the boss work, and being the silent, sweet housewives, as men were sent to work outside to get food... No man decided to do it... It was women for whom we men worked, otherwise, if we would have pissed of women, then that guy would have died a virgin for sure, as no woman would have wanted a weak male, but men always had the basic desire to get only 1 mate, but women had the privilege as they were the center of the clan, men only made decisions and plans to get food on the table. We still do the same... Feminism never destroyed the Patriarchy, it just modified the old system (so called Patriarchy) so that it could keep the female privileges, and destroy the male ones... They are supremacists, they never wanted equality, they are slow poison for the world... This old system had made men fighters, and women as housewives, yup that's the biological truth The first wave feminism, or rather, the female rights movement, only stressed about getting women some rights, and they never wanted to work actually, see even today, all they do is sex work... No feminist has ever reached Scientific working potential... It's all drama, it's their selective propaganda, women were the benefitters of the old system, men were always oppressed It's just that biologically, women have more sexual value... As males release millions of sperms in a short time, and it gets regenerated quick... But a woman only gives out one egg in one menstruation cycle... And she can get pregnant only once at a time, and she is delicate after she's pregnant, thus they wanted men to provide.... I am against feminists, and against the Tradwife antifeminists I only care about antifeminist women who are equally hardworking as we men are, and demand and constantly raise voice for us men, otherwise, that woman is a bitch (a waste of time) It's the truth... It's what I believe in... I was once a male feminist (from school) and now as I feel betrayed, I wanna destroy all feminists (not all women) And nope, we won't stand only for equality, women's rights have gone too far, they need an equal reverse force to bring it back to neutral, then only we will be equal But, we won't snatch away a woman's career rights... Nor their sexual (rape protection) rights All we want as MRAs is that male rapes get acknowledged, men should not be falsely accused, and the freebies given to women shall be snatched away, we won't give money to them anymore, they are smart enough to work themselves... We won't take care of women anymore, feminism might have made them stronger anyways... And all the false accusers shall be hanged to death, or jailed And the bitches raping teen boys, or even in fact those 8 year old kiddos, yup, those bitches shall be hanged to death and publically shamed... 80% sex traffickers are women now... Happy ? No right ? Why is this ? It is because, feminism made male predators scared, but they encouraged female predators instead... Is feminism raising this issue ? We talk about FGM, do we talk about MGM ? Why not ? Botched circumcision kills 1000s of male babies too, that son also took 9 months to come out... So in short, do you support killing of your sons and brothers, or your dad/husband/uncle ? Yup, that is what feminism is doing... Feminists are monsters... They wanna kill sons... The same sons, a woman took 9 months to give birth to having immense pain... Leave men's rights aside for a moment, here infact, a woman's rights are also violated... What about the sis/mom of that son who got falsely accused and shot himself ? Do these women also get justice ? No right ? If you think feminism is Equality, then you are a monster too... (Unless you are brainwashed into it, well now you know, now if you wanna become a MRA/antifeminist, you are most welcome)

t9om06	neutral	Tips on how to educate the younger generation of women: So I made a comment asking about how the ladies here at FDS talk and educate the young women and girls in our lives through the FDS standards and practices. It was encourage I make a full discussion post where the ladies here could comment on how they\u2019ve been nurturing those in their lives about what we discuss here. \nOn my end, I have a 7 month year old niece, and 3 very close girl cousins (ages range from 8-11.)The way I\u2019ve been trying to set a good example is:\n1: Becoming a high value woman through actions. Besides my sister and her husband the little cousins I have do NOT have a good role model in their life. They see everything so if I can act like a HVW, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll see it. \n2: Always letting them know they can talk to me if they don\u2019t want to talk to mom. My aunt was a great advocate for me growing up and I know I can trust her with anything. So I want to set that example, but let them know they don\u2019t have to come to me \u2014 it\u2019s entirely their personal choice. \n\nSo ladies of FDS, what are your tips and techniques for promoting the standards and practices of FDS to those in your life?

ogut70	neutral	Men\u2019s advice. The centered, chill guy always wins: In whatever scenario arises, whether it\u2019s with women, career, confrontation, conflict, or adversity, the guy who is in control of his emotions and stays calm is the one who always comes out on top.\n\nThink of the men in your life who truly impress you\u2014 the ones who have great people skills and are successful in most facets of their life. Are they hotheads? Do they get emotional when they encounter rejection, or do they handle it and move on like a fucking man without dwelling? Are they insecure, controlling, and rigid? The answer to these questions is likely a resounding \u2018no\u2019.\n\nBeing calm and centered doesn\u2019t mean avoiding conflict, it\u2019s just approached differently. It\u2019s being confident enough to state boundaries without anger, to de-escalate confrontations with other men without ego because you know you can handle yourself physically.\n\nIt\u2019s being able to encounter a beautiful women and maintain the same level of composure as you would talking to the elderly lady working the register at the grocery store, because you treat all women the same, and don\u2019t put some on a pedestal.\n\nStay cool, maintain your composure like James Bond, throw in some humor, and at the same time don\u2019t take yourself too seriously and you\u2019ll come out on top.

As you may all know, this sub is completely unmoderated. I don't think the mods even look or care about the sub, and it's constantly brigaded by trolls, often saying very questionable stuff to make it get banned. And unfortunately, no one even removes it. The main reason for me creating this sub is, to serve the main purpose which anti feminists was originally created for, and to stay course on the main message. This sub will be moderated, and it will ensure that we stay high quality and make it easier for the people to see the hypocrisies of feminism. Trolls will be banned. Hate against women or anyone will be removed and after repeated warnings, that user will be banned. When I get time, I will slowly add content to the sidebar educating people regarding all these "myths" whether it be the pay gap, or whatever, which feminists love to use as their prime arguments, but what the real statistics show can destroy their arguments in seconds. This will be an educational sub to wake people up, and if you want to contribute, please do. If anyone has mod experience and will stay an active mod, you can DM me and I'll make you it. I will slowly add more stuff to the side bar etc. Thanks.

so9v67	hostile sexism	Feminism is poison.: That is all.
t4wkpq	hostile sexism	Men who hide their political views from you:Due to many events in the past years, political debates regarding certain issues became more intense and polarized. In professional contexts, it might be necessary to keep your opinion to yourself to keep the peace. And while we shouldn't isolate ourselves in an echochamber of people who have exactly the same opinions, we need to surround ourselves with people who have similar moral values as we do. This is particularly important in dating.\n\nSome of you ladies already pointed out that you should vet for men's political views. While some disagreement on tax politics might not be a red flag, men who don't want us to have safe access to basic human rights are certainly not compatible with us (or any HVW). I am sure that this is no news for most if you.\n\nI want to point out to you that LVM / NVM will often disguise their political views, especially in early dating stages to lure a woman in. He will claim to be \"apolitical\", he will refuse to talk about politics because it \"creates unneccessary conflict\", it's not important to him yadda yadda. I can assure you that he does have political views which he doesn't share with you because he knows you would be running for the hills if you knew. Sometimes they slip and tell on themselves at later stages, sometimes their lack of compassion or behavior shows their attitudes. But it's never harmless.\n\nEspecially covert narcissists who don't have the guts to directly show their hatred for women will often excuse the actions of real and wannabe dictators. They will talk about \"both sides\", complain about media \"villainizing\" those who start wars. They might refuse to talk to politics with you altogether and avoid questions in that direction. They will stupidly \"ask legitimate questions\", denying / questioning historical facts. They might straight up lie about their political views and do a 180 turn out of nowhere.\n\nMy NVM ex was very interested in politics but never talked about it with me. He always read and discussed it in his native language which I don't understand. He ended up being an antisemite, denied the Holocaust and was an avid supporter of a Middle Eastern dictator. He was also an anti-feminist, a covert narcissist and psychologically abusive. Another guy who tried to date me claimed to be oh-so-tolerant, then went straight into a racist road rage after he was slightly unconvenienced by a man of colour. I later on realized how many men will stay vague about their political beliefs or flat out lie about it in the early stage of dating. They will claim that they don't have an opinion about it or mirror your political attitudes. Particularly right wing guys know that they can't get laid if they blurt out their political views from the start. Leftist guys might be better at hiding their misogyny but very often their words to not match their actions.\n\nIf something a man says or doesn't say gives you the ick, trust your gut. Keeping his political views from you is a massive red flag.\n\nDid you have similar experience?\nHow do you vet for political attitudes? How to find out if he lies about his views?
t65da7	hostile sexism	Kind of mad I wasn't born 2-3 generations later so I can experience \"enlightened\" men: I'm 22, Gen Z, and already the differences between my generation of men and my mother's is enormous. My dad's generation is even worse \ud83e\udd74\n\nBut it still feels like the trenches out here lol. I find that lots of men my age WANT to get it and want to be educated about women/feminism but they just do not understand. Add in their fathers complaining about the way women are \"these days\" and the constant stream of misogyny from media, and it's like we've only taken one step. They still haven't unlearned their biases and still aren't understanding towards double standards. \n\nI try to be thankful because I have met a lot of guys that I can talk to, and make them see things in a slightly less biased way. Its nice when they are open minded and don't get offended or hostile! But i dont want to train a man to see me as human !!!! Yes, I'm glad that they are even open to learning (some), but I dont want to be teaching them lmao. Not to mention those are the good ones. The normal ones are just like their dads. \n\nI sometimes wish I could've been born 40 years later when men are hopefully raised to more receptive and human like as children. At least I can feel excited for my daughters! I have hope for myself too, but definitely excited they won't have to fight to find someone who sees her as human. (Hopefully)

tac1j3	neutral	I\u2019m the girl who exposed him to his long term girlfriend. I believe he has more victims.: So about exactly a year ago, out of sheer helplessness and confusion; I came to Reddit looking for answers. It was you ladies who saved my sanity by telling me exactly what I needed to know (and hear) then. \n\nA little bit about me if it helps: Journalist. Currently studying Politics at a prestigious uni. Travel a lot for work. Have major issues with my dad (I\u2019m sure this must be the most relevant tidbit.) \n\nQuick backstory: Met a guy online (not a dating website) when I was away from home. Works in military intelligence. \u201cSoulmate\u201d connection. Told me I was the most perfect woman ever (I know better now.) Was flying to meet him over Christmas holidays and found out that he had a long term gf of 5 years back home. \n\nThat he lived with. \nFor 3 years. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t come to this subreddit and asked you why he was acting strange, I would\u2019ve *NEVER* found out about the secret girlfriend. He\u2019d started ignoring me and ended things and would still tell me he loved me and always would. It didn\u2019t make any sense. It was within an hour to so of posting here that I found out about his double life. Of course, I confronted him, found the girlfriend and told her everything. Turns out she already had caught him once talking to me and he\u2019d lied and told her I was just a friend (he was away on deployment and she\u2019d found a screenshot of our chat.) \n\n\nI definitely owe you wonderful ladies gratitude for giving me the strength. \n\n\nNow\u2026.the reason why I\u2019m here. I need your help. After posting here and finding out the damaging, not to mention, deeply traumatizing details of his double life, I deleted my post on here and was unfortunately sucked back into a relationship with him. He tried convincing me that she\u2019d emotionally abandoned him whilst he was deployed, and that it was my love and character that kept him going out there. I was still in love with him and in what I now understand to be a \u2018trauma bond\u2019 so it was quite hard to fully let go of him. We decided that we\u2019d meet up in the UK when we both returned and start fresh. I definitely didn\u2019t trust him but I so badly wanted to see good in him, and really valued our connection, so I tried to be gentle with him. \n\nUntil he flipped on me again. Would tell me he loved me still, but would act distant all of a sudden. He tried to get quite sexual with me on text and video calls and I wasn\u2019t in the same place so I\u2019d recoil. Once I\u2019d set a boundary, he\u2019d get mopey and upset. So I started getting sexual just to make him happy or\u2026keep him I guess? And he\u2019d basically just use me and go back to being weird and distant. \n\nThis went on for a while until I suspected he was talking to other girls. Then the gaslighting started and he ended things again. At this point it was clear to me that he always wanted to be the one to \u201cend\u201d things between us. And any time I wanted to or even thought of creating some distance between us, he\u2019d get incredibly sad and make me stay. And I was stupidly trying too hard not to be like the \u201cunloving, selfish\u201d ex girlfriend who emotionally abandoned him when I didn\u2019t even consider what might\u2019ve made her become that in the first place. \n\nSo this went on for a few more months and I made it clear to him that before we met up, I wanted to feel safe with him and that meant that I didn\u2019t want to feel used or as though he was planning on seeing me just to sleep with me (he\u2019s very sexually intense and dominating online - constant video calls, sexts, requests etc). I was quite clear that I still wanted to start dating him officially and hoped that things would go back to normal. He\u2019d jump between wanting me, being extremely sweet to me and totally abandoning me, then claiming that he just wants friendship! This would always, ALWAYS make me question everything and definitely made me take a step back because it was a maelstrom of confusion and chaos. I finally ended things and told him I deserved way more, that this was beneath me. What happened next still haunts me to this day. \n\nThis man comes back, accuses me of being a \u201ccat fish\u201d, accuses me of faking/stealing my identity, tells me my body is fake, my job is fake, my past is fake, my face is fake, even, I kid you not, my voice is fake. I remember being so rattled and SHOCKED at his words (I\u2019d attach a screenshot of these messages if it\u2019s allowed in here) that I was SCRAMBLING to defend myself! At this point my sister and friends were practically forcing me to block him. But I felt so insulted that this serial cheater, this manipulator was now accusing me of the most preposterous things. \n\nHis abuse had been so insidious, so deeply traumatizing that I started question MYSELF. I was definitely already quite fragile due to his previous actions, and so I started defending myself. Sending him proof, begging him to see me??? Looking back on it I feel disgusted with myself. But in retrospect, everything was so chaotic and calculated that even though I\u2019d been the one to end things, I was now almost coerced into proving my love and worth to him. While I was having literal panic attacks, I found out that shortly after sending that message, he was on dating apps and talking to younger women. I figured he looking for impressionable 21 year olds (we\u2019re both 28) and started understanding his game a little bit better. \n\nDuring this period I\u2019d turned down many wonderful men because of my emotional connection with him\u2026and he knew that. So he asked me that if he was so important to me, why couldn\u2019t I just meet him? He didn\u2019t seem to understand that I wasn\u2019t interested in something casual, I couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want a casual, friendly relationship with him and the more he insisted on having one, the more it made me want him and \u201cprove\u201d my worth to him. We ended up getting in a huge fight and upon the request of my girlfriends, I stopped talking to him completely and started healing myself. \n\nDuring those two months away from him, here\u2019s what happened: \n- Went back to making art \n- Started singing again \n- Began meeting friends again \n- Began working on my business \n- Finished my dissertation \n- Worked on healing my mental, physical and spiritual health \n\nSo a few months ago, I guess he sensed I was improving and healing\u2026.so he started talking to me and we started getting friendly again. We both admitted to still having complicated feelings for each other and I admitted I still had romantic feelings for him. We got intensely sexual again, and he immediately asked me to book a hotel. Which, in retrospect, feels fucking idiotic to do as a woman. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem: I immediately said yes, and agreed to spend time with him alone at the hotel for a weekend. So a few days before we were meant to be meeting up, he asked me if I was okay, and that he wanted to make sure I was happy because our \u201cdeep connection\u201d and \u201c long history\u201d mattered to him. I told him I wanted to build something real with him and he suddenly flipped and said, \u201cbut I just want to be friends who sleep together and gossip about other relationships.\u201d\n\nAnd that made my blood boil. This man spent an ENTIRE week misleading me, deceiving me after months of toying with my emotions, manipulated me into staying when I was strong enough to, made me beg for his attention when I was too weak to let go, and was now doing this AGAIN. A day before our weekend together. So that night he was online until the wee hours of the morning, and the next day a pick-me girl who looked like a teen dedicated a Spotify to him. So it was confirmed - he had been talking to other girls. Definitely lovebombing them. \n\nI tried warning the girl and she said she didn\u2019t care who he slept with. She also looked like she had an OnlyFans based on her photos. \n\nI confronted him and of course, he ghosted me. I think what worried him was that I told him I WOULD be exposing him this time. A week later I found a 17 year old on his Spotify as well. I believe that he\u2019s a dangerous predator and I\u2019m concerned that one day he\u2019s going to push some poor girl to suicide due to his selfish actions. Because he certainly pushed me to the darkest place I\u2019ve ever known. \n\nI believe there are more victims and want to expose him. I want to make it clear that I realized (through therapy) that I wanted my control back, and the way he behaved with me made me feel violated and used, and discarded. A friend of mine suggested I reach out to his superiors and inform them about his online predatory behavior. \n\nSo I felt like he used me and was simply going to keep using me under the guise of connection and history. My therapist says he used me for an ego boost, because it felt good to be loved by a woman \u201clike me.\u201d He often told me he couldn\u2019t believe I loved him, that I was \u201cmentally and physically perfect\u201d and it still made me feel worthless and devalued. He knew I was onto him and he\u2019d want someone gullible and impressionable, hence why he was going after younger girls. \n\nI\u2019m devastated. I feel worthless, devalued, violated and used. I\u2019d made it clear to him that I\u2019d want nothing to do with him if he was even speaking to other girls (because I know he\u2019ll most definitely be sexual or emotional in any online interaction)  and he reassured me that there were no girls just so I\u2019d sext him and agree to sleep with him. \n\nA psychologist I follow on Instagram said that \u201cwhen someone leaves out information that influences you into making a decision that you wouldn\u2019t have made if you had all the information, that is coercive controlling manipulation and there\u2019s no justification for it. It\u2019s abuse.\u201d

t2mkry	neutral	Therapy lines that are used for manipulation: I've seen people mention on here that sometimes LVM will attend therapy and use the language and rhetoric they provide them to further manipulate women. I thought of this recently when I saw the exact same thing being done in a different relationship subreddit. What are some examples of this? I figure listing common techniques we've seen explicitly might be useful. Here are a few I've noticed:   \n1) Using the 'it's toxic if a partner cuts you off from their friends' thing to justify keeping a way-too-close female friend around. My friend's LV ex did this to her and surprise surprise he cheated on her multiple times in the relationship before gaslighting her and dumping her.   \n2) Using the 'it's healthy if a breakup ends without animosity' or 'it's healthy to not harbour resentment for an ex' thing to harbour existing feelings for them. I *know* this one's bullshit, because the only time I bought into this rhetoric was when I was still deeply not over my ex and straight up having dreams about him (god just typing that make me cringe).   \n3) Using concerns about the toxicity of jealousy to justify coercing your partner into tolerating an open relationship. I'm pretty sure this is how most poly people do what they do to their unsuspecting victims.

t53deh	neutral	I\u2019ve been taking notes to learn how to trust myself: I\u2019m a pickmesha and codependent in recovery. I grew up being neglected by two very disturbed parents and that in turn gave me a disoriented understanding of what my feelings even were. I also struggle putting words together and speak about what I\u2019m thinking. It\u2019s a result of my upbringing. \n\nMost recently I had a very brief romantic encounter with a man. I wasn\u2019t even trying to date. I\u2019m working on myself and up-leveling. I have no business being in any relationship. He came at me like a sledgehammer. After a few dates I cut it off quickly because my gut was in knots around him. \n\nI wanted to learn from this brief relationship. After it was over I wanted to process this encounter and what my brain was trying to tell me. I started to take notes. While I believe in intuition I think it\u2019s valuable to discover what leads our \u201cintuition\u201d to kick in.

You both do the deed, get dressed and never speak to each other until the next hookup. It's not as abusive.\n\nNow add friendzone to this and you have a guy who **actively** **denies** you romantic connection. He could have left it at just f\\*cking, but no. He has to see you, however unromantically. He texts you, but he never flirts with you. He dines with you, but it's Ubereats 50/50. He takes you out, but only as a pal. \n\nThe friendship part serves only for telling you you cannot have him THAT way and he's not gonna be your boyfriend. He's so uninterested in you, he's not really fond of spending time with you. \n\nHowever, if it is just f\\*\\*\\*ing, he's not really rejecting you. Because you cannot reject a candidate who never applied. There's no place for rejection. \n\nSo, in order to have the upper hand, abuse you and feed on your misery, he has to make you apply for the job. You would never consider being in a relationship with him if he was just a warm flesh, a late night snack. \n\nAnd there he is inviting you on a dinner. He's no longer just a dick. **He becomes a person.** A person who invites you on a dinner. A person who could possibly invite you on a real, restaurant date. However, he chooses cheapest chinese and makes you split the bill. Now YOU start to wonder, why doesn't this guy like me enough. And it's his game from then on. \n\nThey make sure you know they **could**, if they wanted to. And that's gonna hurt you. Knowing that they could, but somehow they won't. It's a dangling carrot. If you two have never texted, never talked and there was no 'friendship', just benefits, there would be no carrot to dangle in front of your face. \n\nHe needs this 'friendship' as his main tool to abuse you and get off on his abuse. Men don't value friendships with women. It's not like he just likes spending time with you. It's not benevolent.

Continously women on their \"Prime\" (20s), usually go out on parties, festivals, they just want to enjoy life when they are single AF (and Fucking), and some men included. But when they reach the 30s, they have realized to settle, because the body physique won't stay the same, and the go for the nice guys (\"the safe guys\") those who have work hard on their 20s and now have settled in a single lifestyle on their 30s. \n\nWe as men need to realized this and be able to analyze what they want, and most importantly where we came from, where we are, where we want to be, and is this woman capable of staying with me in good or bad stuff? For you to realize this is to start the relation slow, learn more about them as friends, and see how they act or acted in their past, they can say \"I'm a changed woman\", yes but not because you wanted, your age and unstable life is putting pressure on you, honey.\n\nSo be careful, acknowledge what you want in a relationship, and if it shall be a woman with good morals, good social relations (family and friends \\[**watch out for toxic relation or actitude from them**\\]**)**, life goals, opinion on real world issues, and **past-relationships and how they ended**, and many more things.   \n\n\nP.D.

t7jpq3	neutral	My take on abortion: So life isn't recognized (by law) when sperm fertilizes eggs, but when the brain of a fetus forms a child. This happens around the 6 month point of the birthing process. If there is a 6 month window between sexual intercourse and the creation of a child, should termination be allowed (Abortion, legally = currently yes).   If women are entitled to the right to abortion prior to the formation of life, why aren't men? The typical answer comes down to \"my body my choice\" however the same can be said for the man \"my sperm my choice\" which creates tension on the issue.  \nFurthermore, and In the very least, if the woman decides to proceed with the pregnancy and the man does not, why must the man be forced into an 18 year long contractual obligation to provide child support for said child he wishes not to have? \n\nGiven that life doesn't begin when a woman creates her eggs. A woman's eggs are not living organisms but are shells for a man's sperm to fertilize and grow and thus becomes the child of both the man and woman. So to infringe upon the rights of child creation/termination during the birthing process would mean to recognize life does not begin where a cell to grow begins. The common conservative belief is when the sperm beats all competition and fertilizes a woman's egg that it has the right to life. Why does said sperm not have a right to life prior? Following this rabbit hole would mean the legalization and governmental demand of forced sexual intercourse between men and women to provide the highest chance of spermcell survival. Masturbation for men would also be illegal.  Modern  law states that life is recognized at around 6 months into the birthing process. This is around the time the brain is done developing and the fetus becomes a child. Without a brain we are but flesh and bone. So modern law is right in the regards to child birth. Abortion should be outlawed at this point and the child should have a right to survive. However the woman should have the right to continue to live with said human living inside her. If her choice so chooses to remove said human, then careful extraction of the child in the best possible manner via c-section, vaginal birthing, or other manners that maintain optimal safety of both patients.\n\nPrior to the formation of the brain, the man and woman should have equal rights and claim to this child, with the woman having slightly greater claim as it's her body involved.   If a man or woman does not consent to having a child, then sole custody, Financial responsibility and all claims to said child must fall on the parent whom lays claim to the child. If the woman does not desire to birth the child then termination of the fetus must be done prior to full brain formation.

tato2w	interpersonal sexism	A simple trick to combat negging...: There has always been a lot of talk on FDS about different ways to deal with negging, but here's a really simple one I've found recently when dealing with consistently derogatory scrotes/others who mask negging as \"jokes\" or \"advice.\" \ud83e\udd22 We all know the type, right?\n\nTurn the exact topic around back on them. It works because something about the topic they've brought up in relation to you already has the person feeling insecure. Remember, NVM's and NVW's best friend really is good ol' PROJECTION. Whatever they picked to neg you about, you can truly assume is a strength of yours that makes the scrote (or pickme) feel threatened. Because of this, I see negs as a complement now whereas they used to knock me down a peg and make me feel insecure. When someone throws a neg or unwarranted advice my way, I realize right away that I have the upperhand, which gives me some confidence in dealing with it. Be very neutral in your tone, not angry. Be unbothered and practice a neutral face. Be straightforward and clear. This eliminates anyone saying you are \"crazy\" or \"mad.\" If they see you bothered or mad, they won. \n\nExamples of ways I have used this recently with a multitude of different types of relationships which I can't exactly escape (familial, professional, scrotes, pickmes, etc.):\n\nScrote: Your hair is looking a lot darker today. \nMe: It's much better than looking like my hair is thinning, don't you think? \n\nPick any physical attribute in the same category to use here. It won't matter what it is, really, and it won't even matter if said attribute looks perfect on the person. Remember, it's an inner problem they are having with whatever they brought up. This particular scrote is bald as hell, so it's easy to see why he might be knocking my hair. \ud83e\udd23\n\nPickme: Why are you always SO happy?\nMe: Hmm. Weird you would think happiness is a bad thing. Why? Are you not happy? \n\nCo-worker scrote: You must have been so wild back in the day. I can't even imagine!\nMe: Yeah living is wild in general. Was it boring to not experience things?\n\nThis one was a stretch, but so is what the scrote said in his attempt to paint me in a certain light around colleagues which needed to be shot down. If you'll notice, it doesn't really matter what you say as long as you stay on topic and flip the question/comment around back on the person. After this, the scrote was explaining \"wild\" times of his, etc. and coworkers looked at him like he was just a clown. By the end of it, they forgot what he said about me, it didn't turn into office gossip, and he became known as a braggy bro instead. LOL. \n\nFamily member: You really should just *forgive* person who did unspeakable things to you.\nMe: That's weird because you still haven't forgiven ______, for doing _______ to you? Why is that?\n\nIf you'll notice, I generally end my response to a neg or unwarranted \"advice\" with a question. This turns the whole situation around and leaves them clamoring for reasoning, excuses, mumbling (instead of it being you who is in a tough spot, it's now them) and in turn they get the picture of what your stance is which should always be, \"I'm not tolerating this, so don't try it on me again.\"\n\nWhat I've seen since I've really implemented this in just the past month or so, is they forget what they even said to you and they find themselves tripping all over their own set up to defend themselves, which is originally what they wanted you to be doing. Remember this point. They WANTED to put *you* in the tough spot of having to defend yourself and looking/feeling humiliated. Remembering this can help with the guilt of feeling like you are \"mean\" etc. They had no problem putting you in that position. So, I beg the question... nice for what?!\n\nSometimes you have to go for the jugular if they are going for yours, sometimes it can be a little bit more subtle. For extra flair, laugh at the end of your response if they were trying to disguise their neg as a joke. \n\nI've also seen situations where this is not the best advice sometimes, but I'd say 99% of the time this is going to work in your favor. Don't do this too strongly or make it obvious if it is a dangerous, uppity male/pickme whom you have to be around or they will seek revenge in some format. \n\nWalking away can be beneficial at times, but if it happens in a group of people don't let yourself be humiliated. Everyone around you is taking note at your reaction and it will give others ideas on thinking they can treat you the same.  I think it's really important to make your stance clear as day that the game won't work on you, and unless they want to be the ones defending themselves in the end, they won't try it on you. Remaining neutral in tone reduces others seeing you as combative, crazy, whatever, which is especially important in a work setting. \n\nAnd one last helpful end all example that I've used time and time again with scrotes or anyone else who thinks their input was wanted or needed that might be useful to you:\n\n\"It's a good thing your opinion is of absolutely no value to me.\" Cue the neutral shrug.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThis one always makes it pretty clear, and the looks on their faces at the end of it tell me they've received the message. Think about it... what can anyone say in response to that? \n\nYou don't have to carry the burden of people's insecurities. I think women are sociteally trained to do so. I was always told to play \"nice,\" be \"nice,\" as a woman. Weird because very few play nice with us? They don't come around and see your side? They don't apologize or feel bad? Negs and unwarranted, underhanded advice are very intentional, are meant to put you up against a wall, and are meant to make you work to defend and prove yourself. \n\nIts not your issue to hold, so try handing the problem right back to them where it actually belongs. They can stick it back in their nest of LV shit behavior and let it incubate. \n\nCalmly confront it, then brush it off and keep moving.

You\u2019re oh so happily married (and also a major cuck.)\n\nWhy is this *still* a day? Especially right now?
t0fzzi	hostile sexism	Inventing Anna and Tinder Swindler Comment Hypocrisy: After watching both Inventing Anna and Tinder Swindler and seeing comments in various places it's clear that women (and white knight feminist men) believe that the TS should be in prison for far longer... that he somehow "forced" the women under duress with claiming he's in trouble (how DF is that duress?)... but for course for Anna she was swindling the patriarchy... men that should have "known better"... so are these women's comments hypocrisy or are they admitting that women don't "know better" than men (oh, when you bring this up with a woman, expect the standard vitriol and "incel" label when you call out the illogic of their Hypocrisy... had a heated comment sesh in other sub).

tdph29	neutral	What is the most uncommon thing that attracted you to your partner/former partner?: As you all know, it is usually personality, appearance... In my case, it was her handwriting. I walked into a coffee shop, and I saw this stranger writing something. For some reason, as I was walking past her, I looked down and had an unintentional brief skim over the paper she had in front of her. I did not see what she wrote but I could see that the handwriting was like seeing a pretty woman in a sunflower dress and a straw hat. It was a \"wow\" situation.\n\nI walked back and said, \"sorry for the intrusion, I was walking by and as I looked down, I saw your handwriting and loved it\". I asked her whether she was doing some work and she said that she is studying to be a writer and was doing it for fun at that given moment. I asked her if I could sit with her, she said yes and packed her stuff. We sat there and talked for three hours straight. She is Canadian and was studying in London. A breath of fresh air. One of those women whose presence alone motivates you to be a better person. We dated for 6 months and she had to go back to Canada. We decided to call it quits as we knew the long distance would not have worked at that point in our lives. If she ever moved to London (or me to Canada), I would do my best to get back with her. By far the best woman I ever dated to this day.

t3ki1z	benevolent sexism	What we can learn from model Paulina Porizkova (the latest Aba &amp; Preach video): In the latest Aba and Preach video, they discuss Paulina Porizkova, who is now in her 50s and single. If you are old enough, you will remember she was married to the lead singer from The Cars, and a famous model who did campaigns for Estee Lauder in the late 80s/early 90s.                                                I feel this is actually the perfect couple to examine because they are sort of the very ideal of RP thinking: he was the rich, confident, charismatic rockstar and she was the innocent, beautiful 19-year-old model. After watching the video and reading more about her story, some thoughts:\n\n1) Looks fade. We all love a good glow- up journey but levelling up should include mental health, self-love, friendships, education, marketable skills and hobbies. **You need a create a solid foundation for yourself that does not revolve around being objectified for your beauty.** Don't get me wrong, I think she is still beautiful; however, I imagine that as a model it was hard for her to accept the reality of aging. Particularly when you career was based on being young and attractive.\n\nDo not take for granted the advantages that beauty and youth can provide if you choose to play the game. Rather than expensive gifts such as handbags, you should be seeking those financial investments for your future. School, IRA, savings, etc. Her rich rockstar husband died and cut her out of the will. She got used to a high-end lifestyle but did not prepare for the wheel of fortune to turn unfavorably. Which brings me to point two...\n\n2) **Never let a man have full control of your finances, regardless of marriage status or his income level.** So, apparently, they were estranged, but still living together (the story seems to be muddled here) and before he died, he cut her and his two sons out of his will. No money, and I believe she lost the home as well. She claimed she was \"broke for over a year\" until she settled for an undisclosed amount in court. It appears this may have been much less than what she would have been entitled to if her husband wouldn't have changed the will, or if they would have legally divorced before he died. I believe she only got 1/3 of the estate after being married to this man for 30+ years. Insane! \n\n [Paulina Porizkova settles with Ric Ocasek estate (pagesix.com)](https://pagesix.com/2021/10/25/paulina-porizkova-settles-with-ric-ocasek-estate/) \n\nHow sad that a grown woman who travelled the world and made money on her own could be reduced to this kind of humiliation because of a man! Have your own savings, have your own investment accounts, sign a prenup!! If you are \"estranged\" \"separated\" or \"considering divorce\" don't delay and get it done, get it legal! \n\n3) **Wife goggles ARE NOT REAL** and you better have a Plan B. Do not delude yourself into thinking that as long as you stay pretty and \"co-operative\", you will be taken care of. Nope, nope, and nope. Men still cheat, abuse, neglect, and divorce attractive, submissive women. According to Paulina, as she aged in the marriage, he started becoming very neglectful and would even roll his eyes and yawn when she tried to talk to him. \n\n [Paulina Porizkova reveals why her marriage to Cars frontman Ric Ocasek ended while stripping down to lingerie | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paulina-porizkova-reason-marriage-cars-ric-ocasek-ended) \n\n4) Men are delusional. This is more related to the comments section of the Aba and Preach video than Paulina's situation itself. RP claims that 40/50s men are getting 20 yr olds. Maybe in some instances but living in a nice suburban town I see the majority of middle-aged men with women their own age or maybe a few years younger. The average 50-year-old dude is not dating or married to 20somethings!                                                                                                                                                           **RP confuses desire with reality** and feeds men rhetoric that doesn't play out in real life. No doubt, men may desire younger women, but that isn't what the overwhelming majority of them get.  We all age, men included. \n\nFunny, how even when she did the right thing according to RP (capitalize on her beauty, marry while young, find an older man with a stable future, remain faithful) she still got screwed and they blame her :/\n\n [\"IM INVISIBLE\" - 50 Year Old SuperModel... Guess Who's Fault It Is. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z1Dho8Wh70&amp;lc=z22tt1iamrmifz2s4acdp43bx3blmltg3a3ssd42x0pw03c010c.1646061011418610) \n\n**Do not believe in the lies men tell.** Marrying a much older man as a young woman can lead you to feeling used for your beauty and left without solid resources of your own.                                                    Older man often become controlling and insecure over their younger wives, because they know deep down, they are insecure about aging themselves. This happened to me (our age difference was 26 vs 35) and he became very controlling about me going out, making friends, even returning to college.      Be careful with older men-they want to possess you and often do not see younger women as actual human beings outside of the bedroom!\n\nDo not believe the rhetoric \"letting the man lead\" you or being submissive to him, I don't care what religion you believe in. Sorry, to say that but you should never neglect a Plan B. And have a life outside of your status as a wife. Once he cheats, divorces or dies, then you are starting at ground zero.
opgdr5	ambivalent sexism	Reasons women say no to second dates after a \"good\" first date: I see this question posed a lot on various dating subreddits: We had an amazing first date, why did she say no thanks to a second one?\n\n\nWell, besides the obvious answer that it just wasn't as amazing to her as it was for you, I've complied a list of the most common reasons that my friends and I have decided to pass on seeing a guy again. \n\n\nObviously every woman and every date is different, but these are some common things I hear women complaining about:\n\n1. Gross teeth/bad breath\n\nYour smile is important.. and I'm not talking about it being perfectly straight. Please fellas, use mints/gum. And brush your teeth before a date. Plaque is nasty and if your date notices she is not going to want to kiss you. Teeth whitening kits are $30 at most supermarkets.... If you need one, use one.\u00a0\n\n2. Clothes\n\nWear CLEAN clothes that fit well.\u00a0 Wear Nice pants or shorts ( no basketball shorts or cargo shorts on a first date). You're trying to make a good first impression. No holes unless the clothing is made that way, and absolutely no stains . And fellas, if your date is at 6 p.m. do not come wearing the same shirt you put on at 6a.m. Even if you're a clean and hygienic guy, it's not going to smell like downy anymore and she's going to think you have B.O. Bonus points if you're wearing something that isn't in your OLD pics.\u00a0\n\n3. Shit talking how hard dating is. \nDon't complain about OLD apps, the women you've met on them, or your other exes. It comes across as bitter AF and misogynistic.\u00a0\n\n4. Negativity\n\nIf you spend most of the date complaining about your job, your family, your dating past, your friends, the pandemic, etc... It's going to be a major turn off. Very few women want to date or fuck someone that they feel sorry for. Save all your drama and bullshit for your therapist, close friends, or for future dates when you've built an emotional connection\n\n5. Being too complimentary.\u00a0\n\nYou don't need to shower your date with compliments the entire time. If you do, it comes across cheesy and disingenuous.\n\n6. Getting too deep too fast.\u00a0\n\nDon't ask about her biggest regrets, sexual history,\u00a0 break ups, ten year plan, etc. Avoid topics like religion and politics. Don't mention money at all.\u00a0Even if you're a dark humor type person, avoid making jokes that are offensive. \n\n7. Getting too invested.\u00a0\n\nJust enjoy the moment.. the only plans you should discuss on the first date, are the plans for the second date (and honestly I wouldn't even do that. So many times I see posts where OP is confused about why she would agree to a second date during the first and then ghost/cancel. Truth is most of those times she just agreed because you were in front of her when she asked\u00a0 it's just super weird and awkward to reject a total stranger to their face on a date). Even if you're joking, do not talk about future dates, holidays together, vacations, and God forbid what your kids would look like or what you'd want to name them.\u00a0\n\n8. Being too sexual or touchy feely\n\nFellas, I see this topic thrown around and discussed a lot on dating subreddits. It is 100% better to not physical enough than to be too physical. I've never said no to a second date because the guy wasn't physical or didn't go for a kiss, but I have said no because he acted in the opposite way (and I fucking love sex and have a high sex drive). Truth is, too many guys only want sex and even if you are not one of those guys, if you lead with that she's just going to assume that you are.\n\n9. Making it too long/Trying too hard\n\nFellas, keep it short, sweet, and casual. Leave her wanting more! She shouldn't think that she knows your entire life story after the first date, and if she does, she might not be in a huge rush to see you again and learn more. Don't plan a date that will last hours and don't take her to a fancy expensive restaurant. Meet for a couple rounds of drinks, one cup of coffee, play one game of bowling. The goal is to get to know each other and have fun, not impress her or make her fall in love with you the first time you meet. \n\nAnd lastly...\n\n10. It wasn't fun\n\nMake it fun and light hearted!\u00a0 You are on a first date, not trying to determine if she's going to be your wife and the mother of your kids. Have fun and try to make sure she has fun. Don't ask the same generic interview type questions we all get tired of. Even if we generally got along and had things in common, if I go home after a date and it was boring I'm not going to be in a rush to see the guy again.\u00a0

sxreqt	neutral	Spontaneous start or awkward pass: Yeah I really have no better way to put it. I have a couple friends I'm rooming with next year in college. One day me and another friend met up with our other roomie at lunch who was eating with their female friends. I didn't really know either of them but nonetheless we just had casual small talk. I'm literally saying 10 minutes tops here. Now as of last night I got that one roommie asking if they could pass my snap to one of the ladies... No messaging has happened yet. I'm just not sure where to take this. Like I said I've probably talked to this person for 10 minutes max so I am a little unsure where to go with this. If this does turn into something where they might want to relationship and I don't how do I let them down without f****** s*** up? Sorry for the rambling it's 4:30 a.m.
t2r99s	interpersonal sexism	\"But hon, in this city no one will want to wait 2+ months to have sex with you\" -- female acquaintance: I was having lunch with a female acquaintance I met through a HV male work collegue.\n\nAnyways she asks me about my dating life and I tell her about my last encounter (I posted on this sub) basically the guy dipped after I didn't sleep with him for 2 months.\n\nShe goes silent and hints that, 2 months was already a long time -- even she wouldn't want to wait THIS long before sleeping with a guy because that's an important parameter for her to decide if they are compatible, it's a part of getting to know each other. She says, in this fast paced city, no one will wait that long for you (think a major city like NYC/ Chicago/ London etc) \n\n\nApparently men need sometime and sex to know \"the women has right intentions and wouldn't just take advantage of him\". \n\nI wanted to desperately introduce her to FDS but she is 5 years older to me so really didn't seem receptive to my thinking anyways  --- she said \"you need to be more open minded to date in this city\". (Rather condescendingly)\n\n\nOH and some background about her: She is getting married next month -- the guy and her started dating 2 months ago BUT they went to the same high school except he was \"too shy\" to ever ask her out until they met recently and she hinted at her availability. He's also very interested in having kids and they are in their early 30s. \n\n\nAnyways what would you think about this? I'm indeed new to my city and I agree this has a VERY fast paced western culture. Should I introduce her to FDS or reduce the time I spend with her?
t4912r	neutral	on being told (over and over) that I have \"walls up\": My entire life, I've been told by men, never women, that I have \"walls up\".

You push, you won't ever see these so-called walls come down. Keeping on pushing me to open up BUILDS walls.) Ladies, ever been accused of this? What's your go-to response, if any? \n\nLooking at this with an FDS lens, it seems more and more to me that it's code for \"why can't I have some pussy RIGHT NOWWWWWWWWWW wahh muh penis!\" and/or \"BUT WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY aren't you easy? Why are you a (sob moan) challenge? WAH WAH WAH\". I do think it's a not-so-subtle neg, a complaint.

t1y04h	neutral	Watching these brave people of Ukraine defend their country has reminded me that most of the men I've dated have been cowards.: Perhaps this is an odd thing to be thinking about during a global crisis, but yesterday when President Zelenskyy showed such defiance in staying put in Kyiv, after uttering the words \"when you attack us, you'll see our faces, not our backs\", I sort of half-jokingly said to a friend, \"wow this guy is really raising the bar for the standards I'd want in a future partner.\" But then it got me to thinking about a topic that I don't think gets covered enough: men and cowardice. Why is it that instead of being utterly repulsed by men who literally run away and refuse to talk about problems that women are supposed to \"communicate\" and give them multiple chances? Why does society tolerate men being cowards by giving them a pass to shirk the responsibilities of home and family life while their partners gets zero reprieve? Why are men given the anonymity to be cowards by being able to hide behind screens and ogle cam girls and Instagram \"models\"? Why can men have whole secret lives, and when those lives are exposed, not have to experience any shame? In other words, why are men allowed to be cowards when it comes to personal relationships?\n\nI really don't know where I'm going with this, but I've gotten to the point in my level-up journey that any hint of cowardice, particularly when it comes to communication or handling the normal responsibilities of adulthood, makes that man instantly unattractive to me, and if a friend is dating a coward I feel similarly repulsed. It's time to tell cowardly men that they are cowards and that makes them undatable. Put them in the trash can where they belong.
t528ig	neutral	Is it just me or do all your pickme libfem friends also just CHOOSE to have no ambition and low paying jobs?: I've just come to realise that all but one of my pickme libfem friends and cousins who insist on paying for dates and asking men out, have no ambition to do anything truly progressive with their lives or even better themselves financially. \n\nPlease note I'm saying choose because most of these women have had ample opportunities to stop wasting time on men and focus on bettering themselves financially. I acknowledge that it's difficult and even impossible for women in certain countries to be financially independent, I grew up in a third world country so I know the hardship. But some of these friends who got scholarships along with me to study in first world countries chose to go back and marry LVM. One is now living in poverty with a an abusive narc. She's not using her lucrative degree from an elite university to do anything with her life. \n\nThe pickme friends and cousins who were born and raised in first world countries are constantly broke with no ambition. But they  insist of paying for dates with men and asking men out. One of my cousins always dates tech bros but pays a lot or goes 50/50 \ud83e\udd21 Meanwhile these guys are earning anywhere from 100-350k per year and she's maybe at 18k per year or less \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI know everyone's situation is different and poverty is hard to overcome as I grew up poor. I'm specifically ranting about pickmes who grew up in middle class/ upper middle families and aren't in any difficult situations. They know better but don't do better. Everyone makes mistakes  that they need to overcome. But these pickmes are actively choosing to keep repeating their mistakes instead of learning from them. I'm now in a situation where I'm starting to reap the benefits of all the hard work,  blood and sweat that it took to be in a good financial position. But none of my friends or cousins can afford decent restaurants or even going on nice girls trips. I'm always going to budget friendly places with them which I don't mind. But once in a while it would be nice to go somewhere classy. I'm used to going to high end restaurants or taking nice trips in my own but it would be nice to have a fellow ambitious HV female friend to share it with.

t0ujbz	neutral	Male highly driven predatory sexual appetite &amp; drive VS women\u2019s easily controlled, &amp; sometimes non existent drive. Is this nature or nurture? Is there any coming back from generationally being hunted for sex from childhood?: This may be all over the place, but I need to hear others opinions. probably more appropriate for (afraid to ask) but I\u2019m not interested in mass Reddit opinions.\n\nI am the only child of 4 who was not sexually abused by a man. There are huge signs that I was, but I don\u2019t remember it happening so I won\u2019t count myself. \n\nWatching a doc on on \u201cnon offending\u201d pedophiles. Put simply, these men are plagued, by the minute, second, non stop obsession level thinking about having sex with a child. It overwhelms everything, they can\u2019t think of anything else. The UK research is showing 1 in 4 girls under 18 are molested by family or extended family and 1 in 6 is reported. Knowing my own family that tracks. Plus, none was reported in my family. \n\nSimilarly, most men feel this same way and think about it just as often, only about women around 18 or (gasp) of their own age. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m wondering what the hell is going on. Why and how is this so pressing on them? What is the biological or learned mechanism that is driving men to need to get inside of women and children. They know the damage it causes and it makes no matter at all.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been conditioned to believe this is the natural state of males from childhood. Fathers sexualizing daughters even when not abusing them, knowing that every male they meet is hell bent on nothing but getting inside their body. Mother\u2019s excusing abuse because \u201cthat\u2019s how men are\u201d I\u2019m fearful of them obviously. But also, why? Is this a hormonal thing? (And no I am absolutely not on with the \u201cit\u2019s their nature\u201d BS) more wondering if there\u2019s a solution we\u2019ve missed or an antagonist we as humans have allowed. \n\nThe only way I can try to understand is remembering my drive during puberty. I did have An actual physical and mental urgency, it was a lot and fun but by no means something I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m wondering if the problem is hormonal. Plus that chemical castration is hormonal and that seems to have helped the problem a bit with sex offenders. \n\nWhat really is going on here? I know we are so jaded by the depravity of men that we accept this is how it was, is &amp; will be. But the huge chasm between women and men\u2019s sexual control and appetite is concerning &amp; it has been putting children and women at a staggering disadvantage for all of our existence. \n\nWhy is science focused on helping them keep it up into their 80\u2019s &amp; not addressing that 1/4 of men around children can\u2019t help but rape them because there is a vulnerable &amp; helpless person who doesn\u2019t know how to say no? Not to mention the pain caused to women of age manipulated, raped &amp; abused  because the man wanted sex out of them. \n\nI don\u2019t really expect anyone to have this answer but there is something very wrong &amp; it has been way before porn.

svr7tz	hostile sexism	I wish men would stop harrassing women: Last night, my mom and I were walking back from dinner. There were two men walking towards us (probably drunk) and one of them stopped, looked me up and down, and told the other "Woah, look at this". I was wearing a dress. I turned around and told him to fuck off. Mom shushed me because she got scared. The man stayed quiet for a few seconds, then started yelling, calling me a bitch the whole time as we walked away. I felt so disgusting and dehumanized and cried the whole bus ride home. This morning I woke up and the first thing on my mind was the encounter from last night, which made me burst into tears again.

I've gone on a lot of first dates, a few seconds dates, and the longest interaction I've had with anyone has been ~4 weeks. \n\nAn overarching theme in pretty much all of these dates has been both of us gauging whether or not we want to date right away, evaluating if we want to be boyfriend/girlfriend. Sometimes I know right away that I wouldn't want to date them long term, and I've been on the flip side of that too where they tell me that I'm not what they're looking for. Often times we agree that we'd be good friends, but then we never hear from each other. \n\nThis weekend though I had a different experience. I went on a second date with a woman that ended with a super real conversation about us wanting to continue hanging out, but without the pressure and expectation that we'd be boyfriend and girlfriend or having the pretense of \"dating\". Not that we aren't attracted to or mentality stimulated by each other, or that we want to put the other in the friend zone, but rather an honest go at building a foundation of friendship that can grow into whatever it will be, without excluding the possibility of a relationship. That's a really refreshing take for me. \n\nI've never actually dated someone that I didn't already know, and in each case there was a long build up of feelings that turned into dating. I hadn't registered that in comparison to how I've been approaching online dating, where I've been expecting to dive deep right away since that depth is what I'm craving, but I suppose I can't have that depth without having a foundation first. I could go get laid if that's all I wanted, but I'm craving more meaning than that. \n\nAnyway, I don't have any clue as to where she and I will end up relationship-wise, and I'm not really attached to the outcome right now, but I just wanted to share that shift in perspective somewhere so that I might get some feedback or help someone else look at their own dating methods through a different lens.
s4hgmz	neutral	Genuine question: do people think FDS is bad?: Hey everyone, topic is in the title. Do people actually find FDS to be bad and toxic somehow? I find myself agreeing with almost all of the posts there, and they have actually helped me to understand the difficulties women face in dating and life in general. \n\nI figured there might be a similar subreddit for men, but turns it there's a lot of backlash and negativity directed at FDS. What gives?

t84t7h	internalized sexism	I've had enough of all the transphobia.: I think of myself as an anti-feminist because I think feminism is not something positive and is skewing the balance to one side. I do replay to posts somewhat frequently and believe that anti-feminism is necessary.\n\nHowever as a trans woman I can no longer stand the rampant transphobia on this sub. Please don't give me the dictionary definition of phobia to disregard my point because ***\"Feminism, the belief in social, economic, and political equality of the sexes\"***. I am not asking people to start discussing trans issues here but just to use the correct pronouns. Guess even that's too much to ask. So I'm leaving this sub where my existence is ridiculed and I am not even afforded the basic respect. I still believe in the cause but the negativity is getting to me. Basically a rant. So goodbye. \n\nMods please feel free to delete if you think this is trivial. Don't care anymore
owrznl	neutral	A beginners guide to textual seduction: So I've been reading this sub and it's mostly people asking for advice with not many responses so here's what I have come up with after analyzing most of my texts and conversations with different girls over the past few years:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Copy the girl.** Copying is one of the biggest things you can do, everyone likes somebody whose like them. If she takes an hour to reply, so should you. If she uses emojis, so should you. If she texts in separate bubbles do the same. Mimicry is flattering when you don't notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DO NOT ASK to make plans with her.** Bring up the idea in a fun flirty way and just tell her, if she doesn't want to go she'll reject you the same way, at least this way you're being assertive and showing confidence. \"Come be fun and grab a drink with me tonight!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The name theory.** Instead of the usual \"hey\" or \"hi\" start the conversation with her name, \"Alexis!\". 9/10 she'll answer back with enthusiasm and you've subtly set yourself apart from the other dudes hitting her with the daily hello texts. Setting yourself apart is everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Let her know you're interested but don't be obvious.** Flirt with her by pointing out things in her personality, not her looks. Girls love a guy who they think looks past appearances and at personalities, it makes you look \"intelligent\". \n\nFor instance if she over reacts to something randomly I'd say \"lol you get so sassy, i like it\". When she asks why (she will) say something about how it makes her unique or interesting, etc... it'll drive her crazy.\n\nThat being said, don't over use this. Sprinkle it in there, make her work for these compliments. If you ever don't know what to say then just say \"interesting\" and change the conversation. Not knowing what was so \"interesting\" will drive her crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLAY THE CHASE.** It does not matter who it is, everyone loves the chase. Don't be afraid to pull back and not respond to everything immediately with enthusiasm. You want her to know/think she's not a priority in your eyes. If you struggle with how to do this, just put the things you have to get done throughout the day over texting her. So if you're busy, don't stop what you're doing just to text her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lastly, try to be texting at least 2 girls at a time.** Now I know people will say that sounds douchey or insensitive but it's really not. Think about any attractive girl you want to text, you weren't the first to find her attractive and won't be the last, she's texting at least 1 other dude consistently, so why can't you? \n\nIt's not like you're going to sleep with every girl you text. But like anything in life, you need practice to get better, so girls who result in platonic friendships can be practice to learn where you went wrong and do better in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enjoyed this then we encourage all members to read our, unimaginatively named, [**reddit post \"how to meet girls**](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/kpnakg/guide_how_to_meet_girls_during_covid19/)**\"** as well where we share even more tips on how to build out your profile, what to say, how to get girls to meet up with you and more :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps and good luck out there boys.
tabc7f	neutral	Why are so many MRAs anti-feminist?: Cards on the table, I don't love this sub, I prefer other subs that push for the liberation of men. However, I'm not posting this in bad faith. I genuinely feel that Men's Rights and Liberation benefit from feminism, and I don't understand why so many MRAs disagree.\n\nFirst of all, as a victim of sexual abuse (from a woman), the feminism-led #MeToo movement was beneficial to me, a man. This is because a culture shift allowed victims to speak up more freely, even if the abuser isn't famous or well-known.\n\nSecond, feminism seems to try and break down the stigma around sexuality. As a bisexual man who is versatile in the bedroom, the idea that women are inherently submissive does not benefit me. Openly exploring my sexuality with my partner's is a bug step, especially considering that I was ashamed of my kinks growing up.\n\nThird, I am unwavering in my cisgender male identity. However, I am somewhat feminine, at least compared to the \"average\" guy. I have no desire to become jacked, I am openly emotional, I go to therapy and take antidepressants. Feminism worked to get rid of the idea that each gender is \"supposed\" to act a certain way or do certain things.\n\nI'm not denying that there are ways in which feminism devalues the issues that men go through, at least in comparison to women's issues. However, there's a lot of benefits I, as a man, have gained from feminism. I don't know why \"feminist\" is used like an insult by MRAs so often.

su4cg6	institutional sexism	Why do women’s rights bother you guys so much?: I can’t believe this sun hasn’t been removed yet. You incels are really here complaining about women having rights. Feminism exists because women’s rights still have a long way to go, they are still not equal to men. Statistics show that women get paid less than men and women serve longer prison sentences for less severe crimes than men. We don’t hate men, feminism is not about hating men, you guys are just ridiculous.

so1dvj	neutral	How do you know if you have a crush on someone?: hey guys, dumb question here. How do you know if you have a crush on someone?\n\nYour probably thinking this is obvious, so lemme give you some context.\n\nDon't wanna reveal my exact age, but I'm  getting into college after going through an all male high school. Have always kept a low profile, never been in a serious relationship. I'm still pretty low profile, but I've met a girl who I get along with pretty well. My thoughts are all over the place thinking about them, all that fun stuff. Thing is though, I really don't know if this is because I have a female friend after 6 or so years or if it's a crush. I don't know the questions I gotta ask myself to figure that out either.\n\nThoughts?
sizq2p	hostile sexism	What feminists told me about women when I was younger: \n\n\"Women don't marry for money, they marry for love!\"\n\nThe truth? If you get a University degree, women will fight over you. You can treat them like garbage, demand anything out of them you want sexually and they'll treat you like a king regardless. \n\nIf you only have a high school education, even if you have a good job, you'll still be treated like your nothing special because you didn't get the degree. You get to be the Plan B for the woman who doesn't get the Uni guy she competed for.\n\nFucking feminism telling boys growing up that women don't go after money and status, but \"true love.\" A generation of men listen to this bullshit, they don't pursue education to get money and status to get women, then they find out late in life that money and education status are extremely important to even be considered for love. \n\nAnd now? Feminists complaining that there aren't enough highly educated men to go around for all the highly educated women, and how it's fucking MEN'S FAULT.\n\nIf you had told me when I was a young, that women pursue money and status, guys with great jobs acquired from University degrees, so study hard so you can drown in pussy, I would have done that. \n\n**Every straight boy would be studying their ass off** if they were told this. But we're not. Our feminist dominated media keeps telling the bullshit that money and status don't matter to normal women, just gold diggers, but it isn't even remotely true. \n\nFeminists said this bullshit when there were more men going to University than women. Feminists, always downplaying whatever men accomplish, told men that their education didn't matter, because women didn't really care about it so they shouldn't be full of themselves for being educated and upper class as a result. A generation of boys grew up listening and believing this bullshit and now they're fucked. \n\nThey're still getting fucked. [https://youtu.be/Qi1oN1icAYc](https://youtu.be/Qi1oN1icAYc) because our entertainment/news/talkshow media is still repeating the \"pro-woman\" bullshit that attractive women don't throw themselves at highly educated men during their prime years because women are perfect non-superficial angels who would NEVER debase themselves that way. \n\nI don't see the boy crisis ever being resolved as long as we allow feminists to indoctrinate boys with their bullshit. Becoming a University grad, requires a focus on such a goal at a young age. Preferably puberty, when they want to know how to get the attention of the girls they so desire, so that their endless desire will result in endless drive to do their best educationally so they can benefit from it one day.\n\nThe only thing I can imagine that will solve this, is now since women are competing so hard for University educated men, thus the Uni men get to treat women badly, is that feminists will believe  it's more in women's interest to tell men to get as educated as possible so they can be seen as more attractive. After decades of feminists telling men that money and status doesn't matter to women, they'll actually have to tell the truth because women are actually suffering the consequences of feminist bullshit for a change. Even if that \"suffering\" is just from what women do to THEMSELVES to get one of the educated men who, thanks to feminism, are limited in supply.\n\nNobody gives a shit how this has hurt men and boys, but that's just par for the course isn't it?

sjk189	institutional sexism	Most extreme example of male vs female privilege: So was just thinking about the concept of gender privilege and thought it would be interesting for everybody here commenting with the biggest male and then biggest female privilege you can think of! So I just start of with my thoughts. I live in Austria and here it is mandatory for all men to either enroll in military for 6 months or do 9 month of some kind of social work. The worst part about it is that like the normal workers rights dont apply here and there is no minimum wage. So I needed (BY LAW) to work in a hospital getting about 300€ per month while many of my female friends either worked a normal job (where you get around 1300€ a month with no experience) or started to study one year earlier. So effectively the government is robbing young men about 9000€. Ok so regarding male privilege, I think its obvious to me and I dont know why I never heard that from feminists.

t9n5i3	hostile sexism	The Cancellation of International Women\u2019s Day and What it Means: \n\nInternational days are announced with the noble goal of stimulating the public to pay attention to a subject which affects society, yet is mostly ignored throughout the year. Issues that receive this kind of support, as with the World Autism Awareness Day, have relatively consistent characteristics: the media almost never covers them, the public shows lack of knowledge, and this leads to unfounded stereotypes, that worsen whatever ill-treatment the issue is already receiving. Cynics argue that such days are sales events, and calculated marketers undoubtedly jump this wagon on Women's Day, but on an international day the media is encouraged to put as a top story what is normally left for the bottom of the page in a hidden sub-section if mentioned at all, and many outlets and newspapers would publish in-depth articles that reveal figures, statistics and personal stories, that replace stereotypes and ignorance with an appreciation of a pertinent, acute issue.\n\nThe first problem with International Women's Day is that none of this is true regarding women. Since Me Too has erupted approximately three and a half years ago, women's issues occupy the headlines daily and are constantly in public awareness. If we are to be  sincere about the objective and outcomes of international days, it's safe to say that since October 2017 every day is women's day. This might sound as a hyperbole, but the fact of the matter is that in the case of women's issues this would be an unsuccessful example for a hyperbole, because this is more or less the case: February 6, is international day of zero tolerance to female genital mutilation, February 11, the international day of women and girls in science, week of March 8, international women's week, March 8, international women's day, March 10, international day of women judges, April 3, international day against victim-blaming, April 24, international girls in ICT day (information and communications technology), May 24, international women's day for peace and disarmament, June 23, international widows day (there is no widower's day, hence this is mentioned here as a special day only for women), August 1, world breastfeeding week, October 11, international girl's day (again, there is no boy's day, so the day is mentioned here as a special day only for women), October 15, international day of rural women, November 19, women's entrepreneurship day, November 25, international day for the elimination of violence against women. These are the official days announced as international by the United Nations, and each country adds to those national dates. For example, [the Canadian list](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/women/important_dates.html) adds eating disorders awareness week, the Canadian sexual and reproductive health day, national day of action - girls action foundation, invisible work day, anniversary of N.B. women's right to vote, sexual assault awareness month, mother's day and mothers' week, national ovarian cancer awareness month (Canada is not listing in its national dates a father's day or a prostate cancer month so these are included here as special dates only for women), the 3rd Friday in September is take back the night week, October is simultaneously women's history month and breast health month, and includes first nations women's day, and November 25 to December 10 are 16 days of activism against violence against women which include December 6, national day of remembrance and action on violence against women. Other countries have similiar or different women's issues national dates added to the international ones.\n\nThe second and much more grave problem is that when every day is women's day, what will the media, including influencers on social media, do on women's day to highlight women's issues more than they are already stressed every day? The sad answer is that solely out of the need to find a way to say something over and above the regular headlines, the covering and references reach such levels of hyperbolic statements that it seems more than anything as incitement against men as a group. One example I encountered on women's day last year was a \"poem\" expressing the writer's decision never to marry, \"in order to not be murdered,\" which implies that every man may kill his wife. This is equivalent to a racist implying that every immigrant may rape, or to a supremacist implying that every black person may kill - but because of the atmosphere created on this date this \"poem\" was received with cheerful applauds by the same people who would reject such incitement if directed at other groups (and in fact, at the very same groups when labeled differently - 'Immigrant' instead of 'men', 'blacks' instead of 'men'; we must pay attention to the fact that such feminist calls, and racist hate speech, are the very same statement directed against the very same humans - the same faces and names - only labeled by a different tag, \"men\"). This is not a new phenomenon, \"kill all men\" is a viral trend on TikTok among female teens, but aggravated on women's day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Intentional Women\u2019s Day march, Paris, 2021 \\(photo by AP\u2019s Francois Mori. Source: Publimetro\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/h4ejdgglb7m81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae5129690fae7c0295b9028ca5c1f39b9bd3179)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite March 8 becoming battering day, many feminists argue that a day only for women is justified, claiming that men occupy the headlines around the year, because of their roles in public affairs. It's not certain at all that in the past years men have been mentioned in the media more often than women (reliable assessments are hard to find, since those trusted with such measurements repeatedly express ideological fervor and may skew results to arrive at per-determined conclusions, as when presenting the earnings gap as a pay gap), but even if the feminist claim that men occupy the headlines around the year was true, it's crucial to keep in mind that these are rarely men's personal issues that are being discussed, but rather general social and state affairs relevant to both sexes. We would not accept just the mentioning of women's names as position-holders, as discussing women's issues. We don\u2019t count a report citing Nancy Pelosi commenting on taxation as \"covering women's issues\", because her role is what's at focus and not her personal issues as a person occupying that role. In the same way, \"men mentioning\" is not the mentioning of men's issues. If so, then the continuous representation of women's issues in the media around the year need to be compared not to \"men mentioning\" but to discussions of men's issues. In that case, why after women's issues occupy the headlines all year long and men's personal issues are almost never mentioned, is it justified to have another day for women's issues? More than balancing something, this would seem as deepening an imbalance. \n\nFeminists tend to neglect this state of affairs and divert the discussion to the claim that men are being mentioned in the media, that this is because of public positions they occupy, and that these positions are taken by them because of a \"patriarchy.\" As this assertion tends to obscure the question at hand of whether women's personal issues need more representation because they are not being covered, before continuing it's worth digressing for a moment to humor the feminist diversion, to make way for the acutely-needed discussion about exposure of women's and men's issues.  Men do occupy public roles disproportionately and are therefore mentioned in the media in certain contexts more often, and this should indeed be more balanced. But the reason for these proportions doesn't seem to be a conspiracy between the male members of society. When a public program was launched to attract women to municipal politics by offering them free funding for their campaigns - their male counterparts had to find their own sources while taking considerable risks - the program had to return almost all of the allocated funding. It was never claimed. One former Member of Parliament from the UK, a woman of the generation of Margaret Thatcher, argued that the low participation of women in public affairs is because [feminism taught women to sit and wait for a helping hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cSrX2FJ-Q8), whereas to win a competitive or an elective position one has to be prepared to fight against odds. However, if waiting for such help was indeed the reason, we would expect that providing this help will be met with women's higher participation, while as shown here with the funding example, when the helping hand is extended, women still don't show up. So waiting for help doesn't seem to be the correct explanation. My own speculation is that another feminist message was much more detrimental - the message, \"prioritize yourself\". For generations, feminism has continuously propelled among women the idea that they come first, they should think of themselves, make time for themselves, and prioritize taking care of themselves. While women embraced the massage wholeheartedly, it may have caused many to regard the immense altruistic personal sacrifice that public affairs demand, which can be radical and leave almost no time to oneself, as an offense against them - they have been told that their duty is to think of themselves, and take care of themselves. While half a century ago, men may have been accountable for the low participation of women in public and state affairs, it may be the case that currently, men are not responsible for the low numbers, it seems much more likely that feminism is. \n\nRegardless of how we choose to explain female absenteeism, blaming men for it does not answer the question: If men are seldomly discussed as humans while every day is women's day, why does the \"men mentioning\" needs balancing with more discussion of women's issues in an international day, when women's issues are in the headlines all year long? This is probably the appropriate opportunity to mention that there is no international men's day. When the United Nations received a request to declare men's day on a certain date marked by a few groups and small countries, [the United Nations declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day) the request and announced their marked date [Toilet Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/toilet-day). Those who are aware of discussions held among men's rights activists might get the impression that a men's day does exist, as the activists do mark that day, on November 19. But on that date no newspaper or channel mentions it, Google doesn't change it's logo as on women's day, it is discussed by no educational system, and almost no person knows of this day on that date or in general because it is not recognized by the UN and hence nor by any concern. To make this clear, in 2021 the UN has relocated [Women's entrepreneurship day](https://www.womenseday.org/) which was [previously marked on November 15th](https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/womens-entrepreneurship-day-slated-for-november-15/), to  November 19th, and whatever little effect the activists attempted to generate independently will be run over by yet another women's day, one that is formally recognized and hence will be marked by various concerns and overshadow any attempt by those activists to address attention to men's issues.\n\nWomen's issues are currently an example of the very reason for announcing international days, but not as you would have expected. Some issues so persistently occupy the headlines that they make it necessary to declare a day to allow some other subjects to reach awareness, and women issues are currently part of those occupying headlines consistently - from menstruation to masturbation, through complaints and difficulties at work and throughout life to every imaginable aspect of women's being. There are less and less women who think that Women's Day is needed today, some are calling it narcissistic. There are also some feminists who object it (naturally through blaming men for something - I ran across the idea that it's wrong because \"men use it as an excuse to ignore women's issues the rest of the year\", you probably encountered funnier feminist ways to blame men for participating in a day dedicated solely for women).\n\nAll this while, there are very few people, especially women, who have the slightest idea about men's lives. Men as the ***person*** occupying a role rather than the role itself, are very rarely reported or even described. Men are also affected by the relations between the sexes. They are also facing difficulties such as working and raising children. Some are [harassed ](https://lovists.com/2021/01/23/example-post-3/)or assaulted sexually, [mostly by women](https://lovists.com/2021/02/20/women-are-as-sexually-violent-as-men/). Others are discriminated against because of their sex [by some of the feminist norms and culture](https://lovists.com/2021/01/28/what-does-equality-look-like-in-the-feminist-society-we-live-in/). Many men are gradually developing stress and depression disorders as a result of the Me Too atmosphere and the[ hate speech](https://lovists.com/2021/09/28/letter/) that was [legitimized and mainstreamed](https://lovists.com/2021/10/26/metoo/) with it. This does impact human beings and society,  but is never discussed. As if men are not part of society as humans, only as functions, as \"roles occupiers\", or \"human tools\". These lives are stereotyped, by feminism, through the emphasis on a small minority of powerful figures or of culprits. The media almost never covers issues that affect mostly or specifically them as it does for women (homelessness, suicides, prostate cancer) nor their nearly equal share of issues afflicting women (treatment from employers when combining work and children, violence from partners, personal or institutionalized discrimination by sex), the public shows lack of knowledge, and this leads to unfounded stereotypes that worsen whatever ill-treatment the issues are already receiving - this is the very description of the type of subjects for which international dates are used. However, the very battering, stereotyping and de-humanization - created because, among other things, of what women's day had become for all the reasons described here - are specifically what is preventing any regard to these issues as shown in the echoing of this battering and de-humanization in the UN's inhumane action of declaring the date some groups attempted to use for helping society become more aware of these transparent human issues affecting tens of millions, as toilet day.\n\nI am not proposing to replace Women's Day by Men's Day. Nor is it a good idea to have a day for each - this perpetuates a women's day which has become, for lack of higher pitches available by now in the vocal tones to out-shout the daily reporting, men-battering day. There should be one day for both - Human Day. It should be declared as dedicated to both sexes equally. \n\nThe cancellation of international women's day simply means equality. Crucially, for it to fulfill such a goal, the male side of Human Day must be voiced not only by the men who internalize a feminist narrative and when talking about men's issues discuss only how men are affected by other men, hiding their life experiences created by women as to not upset the feminist women who allowed and permitted them to speak about men as persons; but also through the voices of men who are brave enough to speak about their lives among women, women being just as significant to men as other men are, and I believe much more. Just as women are not restricted to speaking about how other women have affected or harmed them, but are free to talk about what concerns humans most - the relations with the other sex - a society devoted to equality must refrain from infringing this freedom of men and acknowledge their freedom to speak, as women can, on being harmed by the other sex including by [organized political actions and incitement by a minority in the other sex against them. ](https://lovists.com/2021/05/10/why-i-am-not-a-feminist/)\n\nYou don't receive freedoms, you realize them. You don't need to wait for anyone. You can start marking Human Day as of now on March 8.  \n\n\nPermanent URL: [https://lovists.com/2021/03/09/the-cancellation-of-international-womens-day-and-what-it-means/](https://lovists.com/2021/03/09/the-cancellation-of-international-womens-day-and-what-it-means/)

Look it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, when you come across something that you\u2019re not familiar, just know that you\u2019re responsible for your own research as there are free wonderful studies online, so don\u2019t ask me to do the burden of finding the resources for you. You\u2019re smart enough to google. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep your logic crystal clear as you go through these questions. Don\u2019t click on the spoilers until you\u2019re done with questions if you want to do this honestly. Let\u2019s begin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Do you often have sexual desires for attractive women. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!That\u2019s an objectification, mostly likely caused by porn rewiring your brain as proven in the study. You see them as a sex objects rather than a person with feelings. Look it up on why it\u2019s problematic. It definitely kills genuine connection between you two.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Good. Make sure not to watch porn as it reduces your grey matter and rewires your brain into seeing women nothing more than sexual objects as study shows.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Do you think covert sexism such as microagressions found in work, school, etc against women is a lie? Google covert sexism for more details if you don\u2019t know what I mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes &gt;!Yikes! You gotta go educate yourself on those matter and be aware of your privilege. Don\u2019t invalidate nor silence the voices of women because of your \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d because that will never trump factual findings. End of story.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Okay, good. Even if you believe in covert sexism, you must be proactive by standing up for those voices, who are muffled by those who perpetuate covert sexism.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Do you consider it a good thing that men finally listen to the pleas in order to empathize with women by using their female relatives as an example? Example: \u201cHow would you feel if it happened to your mom, sister, daughter, etc instead?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!Uh-oh. That\u2019s bad. It just shows that women aren\u2019t humanized unless it\u2019s their loved one or they have to retort to this type of questioning. Look it up for further information.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Good answer. It shouldn\u2019t take a lot to convince. Empathy is key to hearing the voices that need to be heard, even if it\u2019s not something that we can relate.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Do you think most shows and movies by large portray women properly and show how complex their characters are?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!Nope. It\u2019s known that women are written terribly and pigeonholed in archetypes. The writers, who are responsible for this, are often men. Women, who contribute to bad writing as well, have internalized sexism. Many shows and movies contribute to internalized sexism in little girls and young women, which leads to feelings of incompetence and powerlessness. This along with their upbringing where they are exposed to sexism affects their decisions and self-worth.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Good answer!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Do you believe that men and women cannot be friends?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!The fact that men struggle to see women as a person and that sex is always on their mind makes them less than desirable as a candidate for friendship. Most men would sleep with their female friends as study indicates. Friendships between men and women is possible as long as there are genuine intentions. That can only be done if men rewire their minds into seeing women as people. Study shows that men, who have genuine friendships with women, see women as people, thanks to their upbringing. They are more likely to have healthy romantic relationships as well.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Good answer! Unless you have certain intentions where you\u2019re open to sleeping with your female friends at a drop of hat, then that\u2019s not really a genuine friendship. So, move back to \u2018yes\u2019.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. When you go on first few dates with women, do you navigate the conversation towards sex or get far more excited on the topic of sex than any other subject that you guys have so far? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!If it\u2019s been established that the dates are supposed to lead to a potentially serious relationship, then you have a problem. It\u2019s sad that you cannot get more excited on getting to know her as a person than having sex with her. Please miss me with the whole \u201cI\u2019m a hot blooded man who needs iNtiMaCy\u201d bullshit. Studies show that both men and women equally have sexual desires, not one more than another, but media and upbringing change all of that, especially with men being hypersexual and treats women nothing more than sex objects. Besides, that\u2019s not genuine intimacy, that is just straight up casual sex. Emotional connection is what brings intimacy, so look up on emotional intimacy for further information.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!That\u2019s quite promising. Women struggle to find men who take them seriously and genuinely get to know them as people. Keep it up.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Do u think the way the guy in locker room talks about women is not problematic because he\u2019s just joking?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!It\u2019s problematic. Stop normalizing it. Jokes or sarcasm at the expense of women is problematic as studies show that men aren\u2019t entirely joking when they make jokes in general and that there\u2019s always a bit of truth in it. Making sexual remarks about women isn\u2019t okay either, and look up on why it\u2019s problematic. It\u2019s up to you to change the tone in the locker room. So, speak up if you want to become an ally.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!Okay good. Make sure to speak up! Don\u2019t stay silent or else you\u2019re normalizing it. Be a good ally by speaking up.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Now onto the famous FDS rule on having men pay for us on first dates that many of non-FDSers hate and even go as far as equate us to red pillers and incels who have coerced women into sex or murdered women, do you think it\u2019s a fair comparison and we are justified to have that level of hate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na. Yes. &gt;!Welp! Not only you have destroyed basic logic and common sense, you have pretty much used every fallacy argument tactics if you believe this. There are so many reasons as to why we follow this rule, which by the way isn\u2019t hurting anyone unlike redpillers and incels. This rule only applies to those who are more than willing. \\*\\*Just know that you don\u2019t have to date a FDSer.\\*\\* Studies show that men like to hunt for women that they are very attracted to and go at great lengths to earn our love. Studies also show that women fall in love in 15 days while men fall in love within 8.2 minutes. Also, it\u2019s easy for us to vet men who try to manipulate us into having sex by expecting them to put money and high effort into our dates. Not to mention, it helps us filter out men who are stingy with their money, which will cause a lot of distress when they decide not to provide for us on necessities such as diapers when we become vulnerable after pregnancy and raising a baby without little or no pay. It\u2019s happened to a lot of women. Financial abuse is rampant. This type of vetting is so necessary to find a hv.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. No. &gt;!If you believe it to be an unfair comparison but disagree with the rule, then go back to yes and read the spoilers for a bit of information. If you agree with the rule, then congratulations, you\u2019re on a right track on becoming a hv. Make sure to thoroughly educate yourself on women issues as well as the FDS handbook. You will make a woman happy someday.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your answers are mostly \u201cyes\u201d, then you are unmistakably LV. If you have mostly \u201cno\u201d answers, but the number 8 answer is \u201cyes\u201d, then you are also LV. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have all the \u201cno\u201d answers, including the last one, then you are, for sure, a HV, but keep on educating yourself and unlearn any problematic view that you may have of women and relationships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, the \u201cnot all men ...\u201d rhetoric silences, invalidates and derails the conversation that needs to be heard. Women are living in such a life that you\u2019re privileged not to have to experience, which is why it\u2019s hard for you to relate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if you don\u2019t do these things to women, then stop getting offended and start listening instead. Or else you\u2019re a part of the problem. The only thing you can do is to ask how you can help. I can tell you right now. You can help by not looking away and start telling dudes to stop. Don\u2019t normalize it no matter what. Don\u2019t have this issue? Good, just keep being an ally and listen. Don\u2019t be complicit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey ladies, if you wanna contribute to this, you can do by putting down questions in your post for male lurkers. :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: some errors and added the last bit.
t6n5gb	institutional sexism	It's Your Round, Girls...: The Equal Pay Act became law in 1970 in the UK. Equal pay is all very well, but, there are unequal social demands on men, as pointed out by Allan Millard in 'Equality - A Man's Claim'. These are some of his words, from circa pages 478 - 510. *'There is a sexist expectation that a man must first approach a woman, running the risk of rejection, then consistently apply unequal effort and monetary expense on one who is supposedly his equal. Male ego?? A woman will go on a date and won't even bring her purse (despite Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action). So -who has the larger ego? Who has the greater belief in their intrinsic self-worth? If male ego were larger, would he tolerate the rejection, sarcasm, humiliation, pressure, frustration and financial expense?'* As pointed out by Adam Leonas in 'The Empress is Naked', it's not the male ego which is larger than that of the female, but his sex drive - which places the female in the driving seat of sexual negotiations, trading their asset with a view to ultimately gaining control over male resources. But, their lower sex drive has made them susceptible to the lure of feminism, where they also seek control over male traditional roles, keeping only the best parts, at their discretion. Affirmative Action makes it more difficult for a man to get a job, easier for him to lose it (through sexual harassment accusation), when he may actually be behaving in an entirely normal social manner. *'Women intruded into man's place in society - then found fault for him being there.'* So, come on ladies - before beginning yet another round of bleating about some non existent earnings gap, a deficit arising solely through your own **choice** for less stressful, less dangerous, less physical work, and your preference for part-time hours, perhaps you should consider digging deep into that equal pay packet and buying a drink for a thirsty man (no pun intended). *Vive la difference!* Cheers.

tc7unp	neutral	Left my fianc\u00e9e today. Here is the letter I left him.:Notes:\n\n-I rage wrote this\n\n- I left the option open for us to get back together because I need/want them me to process all of my feelings. \n\n- please excuse grammar and any horrible mistakes because back to the first point I rage wrote this\n\n- I\u2019m in safe place and I\u2019m not worried about him becoming physical or not allowing me to get the rest of my stuff when the time comes.\n\n-Nikko and Ace are our dogs Ace being more his and Nikko being more mine.\n\n- I make over twice what he does and he took a pay cut for a \u201cnew and interesting\u201d job that might make him more money in the future. I said I would pay for more of the bills(over 75%)\n\nDylan,\n\n    I am writing this to you on Thursday afternoon. I have spent the entire morning working while you are sitting in the living room staring at your phone and watching BS on youtube, while the smell of dog shit waifs in through my open window. I find myself getting more and more annoyed as the weeks go on of just seeing you constantly getting absolutely nothing is done that you need to do while the list just keeps getting longer and longer (off the top of my head while typing this out medical bills, therapist, doctor, bank login, ace grooming appointment, toilet needs to be fixed, courtyard still hasn\u2019t been done, the dog shampoo bottle is still sitting on the kitchen counter, ). Some things, (like getting your medical bills taken care of) have gone over a year without you even taking a ten-second effort to get them done. I also feel myself turning into that nagging girlfriend/wife who has absolutely no faith in her partner. The worst part is you get so huffy when I say I\u2019m going to do something and I forgot like the sheets last week I seriously wanted to laugh in your face when that happened. Or how much you got on me when you wanted your taxes done. I guess things are only important when you deem them to be. When I want something done I\u2019m just a nag. I guess we know who the reliable one is. At least you can get huffy because if I do, we all know how that ends up.\n\n    I have also learned a lot about who you truly are over the last few weeks and the kind of husband you will end up being. Your attitude towards paying bills and making late payments has absolutely appalled me. Because of this I already feel more and more of the mental load in this relationship being dumped on me. Mental load that I don\u2019t have the capacity of taking on right now and you have absolutely no shame of just dropping that on me. I already have to take care of my own work, but also manage meals for the household, budget for the household, set up grocery lists, make sure the dogs have food and treats and exercise, manage the bills, manage the mail, take care of pretty much everything for the wedding (like seriously you haven\u2019t even offered to help in the slightest). I could probably continue typing this list for the next twenty minutes and it still wouldn\u2019t end. I pretty much have to oversee and manage everything in this house. The management work you do and the way you complain about your servers is what I see much of at home. I am the manager and you are my employee that won\u2019t do anything without me directly telling you to do it. What do you take care of? Cleaning the house once a week? You can\u2019t even bother picking up the dog poop more than weekly and it is a struggle to get you to take the dogs out at night half the time. Where do you realistically think you are contributing to this relationship? What value are you adding to my life? I know what I bring to the table here and your platter is looking really pathetic. \n\n    Love isn\u2019t enough for me. I think you have always known this about me. I will never be in a relationship where walking away isn\u2019t an option. It's not an easy one in this case. I do love you so fucking much. The thought of leaving is what has been making me sick over the last few days. It's the reason I have been feeling ill all day. I have a decision to make.\n\n    Have you ever heard the phrase \u201cIf he wanted to he would?\u201d I\u2019m sure I have said it a number of times. I want you to keep that in mind for this next part. I can\u2019t change you. I can\u2019t force you to be the partner that I need and want. These things that you put off affect both of us and the future I envision. Not taking care of your medical bills affects our ability to buy a house. \n\nI don\u2019t want you to go thinking well I\u2019ll make the changes now I\u2019ll do it on my own. It doesn\u2019t work like that. We have tried that before and you get better for a week maybe two at the most a month  going right back to your old habits. You lose motivation or you think you are just out of range of me leaving that you think it's safe for you to go back. This decision is going to be left entirely on me and there is nothing you can do or say that will change this. I have to decide if I am willing to act like your nagging mom for the rest of my married life or just do it for you. No, it isn\u2019t fair to me, but I have to make the choice is this something I can live with. Is this a person I am willing to become to stay with you? \n\n    There are going to be many factors going into my decision. I will be reflecting on many parts of our relationship. Your trust issues which I still honestly think haven\u2019t disappeared like you pretend they are. Your anger issues. You might deny this, and maybe you have only treated me with your full rage a few times; I have seen it come out many times against Ace and Nikko. The way you would pick Ace up by his neck while he yelped in pain and throw him into the shower haunts me still. Those brief flashes of rage scare me. Also, there is the factor in when we used to split everything you would NEVER zelle me my half of anything. Me always selling you right away for any purchase. You would let it build up until it was over $1000 sitting on the board that you owed me. Even recently with Ace\u2019s vet appointment, I paid for it. I know you were never going to send me half so I just made you pick up dinner and called it your half. \n\n     While watching Joe vs Carole, there was a part where Carole and her husband were talking. Her husband was talking about how when he would ask married people if they were happy they got married, most would hesitate. Only 13% would say yes right away. He didn\u2019t want to get married unless he thought he was going to be in that 13%. This has stuck with me. If we got married tomorrow I don\u2019t think I would be there. I would only be there if I decided I was willing to take on everything you are leaving for me.\n\n    I have packed my stuff up that I will need for the next week and gone to my mom's house. I am going to think and reflect on everything and decide.  Make my list of pros and cons. Figure out what I am willing to tolerate and what I won\u2019t and if the whole thing is worth it. Maybe it's time for you to do the same as well. I know I come with my host of issues. Maybe you need to see if I\u2019m worth all of the work too.\n\nPS I was going to leave Nikko so I could have a full break but I don\u2019t trust you to actually take care of him for the week. How sad is that?

tdy6l8	neutral	When did you do a 180 in terns of wanting a relationship?: Apologies in advance for formatting. I'm on my phone. Bit of background. Matched with an old acquaintance and dated for a little over 4 months. Daily text messages, occasional call. Lots of I miss you and wish you were here. This past weekend I decided I would ask the \"what are we' question. I was met with some artful dodging and was basically ignored. When I pushed further I got given the I'm not ready for a relationship spill. \n\nThis was long distance and we would see each other 1 to 2 times a month. Person was telling me they want our kids to meet then did a complete 180 saying they want to travel and set themselves up. I ended it as I know that the two missing words from that statement is 'with you' and I know my worth.\n\nSo my question is... what made you do a 180. Was it because you got scared or was there really nothing there and it was just convenient. Just seems like such a waste of everyone's time.\n\nAnd yes I have tried to ask the question but I got nothing really back.\nThanks
t9vc52	hostile sexism	To the girl who sent me to hospital and will likely get away with it, fuck you, bitch: I’m sorry I’m just so angry. I had one of the most humiliating experiences this week I was in a bar Monday night with some friends and there was this very obnoxious drunk girl. She spilled a couple of our drinks and I got up, very gently put my hand on this girls shoulder and tried to coax her back to her booth. She kicked me in the balls. A hard kick. I fell to the floor and she staggered off laughing as other people laughed. A couple decent bros came over and helped me up, asked if I was ok if I needed ice or anything. They blew up to the size of like elongated golf balls. They hurt. I had to go to the emergency room and have them drained (apparently this is caused by some build up of fluid during swelling). All I can remember is that bitch staggering back laughing as others laughed with her You hurt me. You sent me to HOSPITAL. I’ll just say it. If I could do that night over again she’d get a punch. I don’t even care if I went to jail. Don’t care what y’all say. She sent me to the fucking emergency room and found it FUNNY EDIT: I wasn’t going to pursue anything since the pain had subsided and I was happy to put this behind me given the embarrassing nature. The copious number of women who have told me I deserved it because they’re under the belief that putting your hands on someone’s shoulder to walk them back to their booth is “assault”. I’m going after her. I am going to get the video ASAP, I have photo evidence of my swollen balls and witnesses. Fuck you for telling me I deserved this, specifically because of you I’m going after her you utterly contemptible misandrists. How would you feel if a girl told me she was raped after touching a guy and I said she deserved it because touching is assault? EDIT 2: yes, my bad I shouldn’t have compared rape to assault, I’m sorry. How would you feel if a girl put her hand on a dude’s shoulder and he punched her in the tit?
t7iycp	interpersonal sexism	At the risk of getting banned: are the Moderators slacking off on the job?: I'm a anti feminist and men's right supporter. I have to ask this question. If I'm banned, I don't care but I want the moderators to ban anti feminist posts for the greater good. I've reported several times on a particular feminist pos posting here. Bluebellpeppers or Buleballsu*kers. Something like that. Her posts are pro feminist or questioning anti feminist posts. All posts in this sub has to be anti feminist: that's one of the rules of this sub the last time I checked. I've reported her, but no response from the mods. So what's going in here?

syi3bb	neutral	Dating has no second chances. Stop giving them!: Dating is a one-strike-and-you\u2019re-out situation. Never give any man the chance to hurt you again. Take an immediate U-turn at the first sight of a red flag and damn the social traffic laws! Once a man has shown you that he doesn\u2019t respect you, it should be over. HVM don\u2019t need to be taught how to respect, cherish, and honor you. \n\nOne of the worst cycles I see women fall into is the volatile on-off relationship. The guy does something disrespectful (usually cheating) and she breaks up with him, or he freaks out over something stupid (usually something she can\u2019t change or control) and breaks up with her, but they always \u201ctalk it out\u201d and \u201cpatch things up\u201d and get back together, but this time with a ~new understanding~ of each other. Rinse and repeat. The men never change, it never works out long term, and I watch good women throw away months or years of their young lives with a man they already know is wrong for them. They are lying to themselves about this failed partnership and are ruining any chance they have with any potential mates in that time frame. It\u2019s a grueling exercise in futility. \n\nThe first breakup should be the last breakup! After all of my breakups, I essentially removed my exes from my life and it\u2019s made my life a billion times simpler than many of my peers. I have exactly ZERO regrets about it. My sensitivity to rejection has actually been a powerful tool because once it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over forever with no exceptions. Seriously, grieve the loss of the man you hoped he was like a death, and then bury it and move the fuck on. Your ex has NOTHING of value to say to you and reconnecting with an ex is ALWAYS a recipe for disaster. Even for the amicable breakups, you CANT be friends after; it will only complicate things down the line. There\u2019s billions of people on earth and you can be friends with someone else. You gotta be ruthless, like a shark- only move forward, never look back. \n\nLadies, stop rooting around in the trash. He\u2019s in there for a reason and no amount of cOmMuNiCaTiOn will ever change that. All failed applicants must be swiftly and permanently rejected if you want the best chance of ending up with the right HVM for you.

t6b50j	neutral	Today I made a scene whilst telling a scrote off and i've never felt so in love with myself: There is particularly oafish manchild in my workplace that I made the mistake of being politely friendly with when I started the job three years ago. Thanks to FDS, I clocked him nearly immediately and it wasn't long before I started pulling back and grey-rocking/stonewalling him completely. Thankfully I can do my job fine without interacting with him, 95% of the time. So i've just been silently observing him over the years and watching prediction after prediction come true based on FDS principles. \n\nAnyway, today he pissed me off in a big way. I need not bore you with details but he did something dumb that involved a loud unexpected noise that was inappropriate and scared the shit out of me. Now, I am known to be even-tempered and slow to anger, and have struggled with expressing anger for most of my life. I have walked away from many situations berating myself for not speaking up when I feel angry. This morning, however, my wrath was induced. And I tell you, it felt absolutely incredible.\n\nLadies, when I tell you I spat fire at him... I cussed him out at full volume, no-holds-barred. I wasn't even thinking, it was purely instinctual. A great many of us struggle with this, and this is why [The Gift of Fear](https://u1lib.org/book/1238618/83926a) is required reading. As Gavin de Becker says, when you sense danger and you let your instincts lead, they know exactly what to do. I say that specifically cuz this frightened me and got enough adrenaline going for me to just let loose with a tirade of expletives on this dude.\n\n It was **truly** empowering, and not in the bullshit faux feminist use of the word. I mean, I was showing my fucking power and willingness to fight. That's power, the kind that is denied, obscured, and forcefully removed from women for millennia. As far as my own story is concerned, this was a **huge** step for me. \n\nA little while later, this dude tried to talk to me apologetically with his tail between his legs. Didn't even look his way and stated, loudly and coldly, \"Don't talk to me.\" \n\nThe real icing on the cake is that today is his last day at the workplace so those will be my last words I ever spoke to him   \ud83d\udc96 I just feel so warm and fuzzy \n\nIce queens, make-a-scene-queens, swear-like-a-sailor queens - let 'em have it.

I saw them again today but she didn\u2019t recognise me (I used to have long hair and clean shaved when I first met them. Now I have a beard and very short hair) Next time if I meet her, I would say \u201chi\u201d and what should I do after that? I find one of them really cute and wanna shoot my shot.

oa1mz8	neutral	Helping a bro out that's being questioned about his height: So this is something I actually had to deal with a couple weeks ago. I was hanging at the park smoking as I usually do and this guy brought his date along and I was listening to her nag him about his height saying things like no, you have to be 5'7 at most. I get fed up and get into my car to find a tape measure, and she's still nagging away by the time I find the thing in one of my boxes. Approach and offer to resolve the issue. Unfortunately the tape is only 5 ft long, so I just said hey, I'm 6 ft and this guy is taller than me, so just put it to rest ya know. Now while I actually am 6 ft, something I tend to keep to myself, I realized I could actually lie about my height to make another guy's height whatever I want it in relation to mine. My dude needs a couple more inches? No prob, I'm 6 ft 2 now. As far as the tape measure goes, I was planning to hide the excess under my foot to make him taller if I needed to but I forgot how short it was so it didn't quite work out like that.
t22cea	neutral	I used to think there was something wrong with me...: ...because I kept 'attracting' unavailable / dysfunctional / fuckboy / batshit crazy men.\n\nThere couldn't possibly be *so many* around that every single guy I met was like that, right? They had to be a tiiiiny percentage of the population. So it couldn't just be a coincidence that I met them all like that.\n\nEnter tons of toxic internet / life coaches advice: 'you attract what you think you deserve', 'people are drawn to the energy you put out in the world', 'you must have (insert psychological issue) and be attracted to dysfunction', 'if everyone you date has a problem, it means \\*you\\* are the problem', 'stop trying to diagnose them to protect your own ego and accept that obviously you're just not good enough for them to want you as a partner' etc.\n\nBut I was like, what the heck. I'm balanced, I'm well adjusted, there's nothing drastically wrong with me, and honestly they seemed *normal* for months before revealing their true colors. I analysed myself in every possible way trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. And every time another guy revealed himself over a couple of months to be a basket case, I got annoyed because *what the hell,* ***another one?!?*** *How's this possible?* ***What am I doing wrong?!***\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons why FDS has been such a game-changer for me. Reading about hundreds upon hundreds upon *hundreds* of unavailable, dysfunctional, fuckboys, batshit crazy men (also browsing other subreddits provides a blood-chilling constant stream of this). Knowing that there are hundreds of wonderful, smart, well balanced, amazing women who *also* keep meeting guys who are too dysfunctional to appreciate them. And on other subreddits, hundreds of wonderful women who are in relationships with men who, instead of appreciating how lucky they are, treat those women like absolute garbage and don't value them or the relationship at all.\n\nOh. So **it's not just me**. It's not uncommon. I'm not exceptionally unlucky or secretly have some horrifying flaw that keeps attracting these men or makes men not appreciate me.\n\nIt's been several months now, and especially in the last year I've been observing the guys I interacted with with an objective, critical eye. As I detailed in my post [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rxez52/scrotation\\_report\\_20202021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rxez52/scrotation_report_20202021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) the seemingly healthy, normal ones I could count on one hand.\n\nIt's been sort of disheartening having to accept how dire the situation is out there, but very much comforting and reassuring to not feel like I was somehow cursed or to blame for the disproportionate amount of dysfunction I encountered. And of course, I'm ever so thankful FDS is teaching me ways to minimize the amount of time I waste on such people by identifying them and weeding them out much faster.
or1klc	benevolent sexism	What are your physical preferences when it comes to girls?: If the ladies on FDS can do it so can we, right guys? It would be cool to see what other men prefer and also to show that we have preferences, since according to FDS we wanna stuff our d\\*\\*k in every hole there is.\n\nHeight: 5'2-5'5, taller than that is attractive too but only if they are slim and they like my height.\n\nDon't care about hair color or eye color.\n\nI am usually attracted to paler skin tone, but not super pale. Nice skin is important too.\n\nFace bone structure is very important to me. Nice jawline and nice cheekbones. From the celebrities I really like the bone structure of Phoebe Tonkin and Hayley Williams. \n\nI don't think I really care about nose shapes since I've been fascinated before by girls with big manly noses and it gave them a unique beautiful look so it depends on how it fits with the face.\n\nI don't like short hair and I've never been attracted to a woman with short hair. It's not really something I can control it just is what it is. By short I mean less than 2 inches long. I really love haircuts that are a bit different than what everyone has at that certain time since I also like tomboyish-hipster girls. Something like bangs or hair in unnatural colors.\n\nOne of the most important things for me is the shoulder-waist-hip ratio. I don't want anything insane, just the usual ratio or maybe a bit more pronounced hips or more slender waist. Wide shoulders looks very masculine to me and hips slimmer than waist just looks kinda weird to me and wide hips also means easy birth so it's very beneficial. \n\nI don't really care about boob size. I think both big and small boobs have their advantages so I'm not picky there. \n\nDon't really care about ass much too. I think if the girl is relatively fit and has a nice ratio then the ass will almost certainly look good too. I've seen some butts that are like WOW, but it's not really something that important to me and girls can be just as hot to me without it.\n\nI like a girl that is slim. I don't think I've ever been attracted to an overweight girl, especially since the high body fat percentage distorts the face and looks chubby and without definition. I workout everyday so it's not unreasonable to want someone that at least stays fairly slim and takes care of their health.\n\nAs someone with a very wide d\\*\\*k, I would actually prefer a \"wider\" vagina or a girl that can easily take it, since it can be uncomfortable for both parties if it just doesn't fit or if it's super painful.\n\nAnd also style is very important for me. I don't like sweatpants and almost anything sportswear. I like kind of a rock-punk-alternative vibe and usually something like boots or converse, jeans, a simple t shirt and leather or denim jacket looks good on anyone. It has to fit well to their body too.\n\nSo that's it for my preferences. I hope you'll feel free to explain yours too, maybe not is so many words though. And again, this ISN'T a parody of FDS. :)

pp17xe	neutral	It doesn't matter if you are perfect for someone - they can still turn you down: **Rejection doesn\u2019t always mean that you did something wrong!**\n\nA person can find you attractive, thoroughly enjoy your company and see that you are a fanciable person, but for one reason or another just not have feelings for you. \n\nMaybe they aren\u2019t emotionally available at the moment, they aren\u2019t ready for someone new, or they met you at a rough time in their life.\n\nEmotions are weird and the people your dating are people too, who like you live a complex world where not everything makes sense. Them rejecting you isn\u2019t because you did something wrong or that you aren\u2019t good looking enough. \n\nIt\u2019s going to hurt and *feel* like you\u2019re missing out on someone who in another universe would be your perfect partner. But just know it *really* is not you, it\u2019s them. \n\nRejection isn\u2019t always about not being good enough, it can just be about meeting in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nSo give yourself a break, and don\u2019t let yourself get too bummed out about rejection.\n\n*If you liked this post then consider getting our* [*limited time free eBook*](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/p0qc45/ebook_how_to_date_any_girl_free_for_limited_time/) *\"How to Date Any Girl\" to boost your success in the dating area!*
taj8jd	neutral	A lovely UK advert about Men and Prostate cancer. Worth watching.: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzgB-nS9kY\n\nI honestly think this is such a refreshing and well needed advert.\n\nSimple, heartfelt and sincere.
tdfehe	neutral	What Is A Career Or Job You Would Pursue If You Wouldn't Be Considered Creepy For Doing So?: Mine is the wedding industry. Top to bottom, I love the whole thing. \n\nWomen picking out wedding dresses can be a beautiful thing (outside of the sometimes chaos and indecision), working with florists to pick floral arrangements is just peaceful to me, and weddings are almost always happy events that end with a sappy, happy connection between two people. \n\nI know that there's a significant amount of work that goes into wedding planning/coordinating; and that I've only outlined a few pieces of the process, but I find the whole thing endearing.
p536i3	hostile sexism	The Single Most Attractive Trait in a Person: Picture young children dancing to music in a public place. The children often act spontaneously, freely, and without fear of judgement. The child's mind is fully in the present moment as he expresses his true honest feelings. Seeing such a child's performance most likely left you with a positive feeling inside.\n\nSomewhere between childhood and adulthood, many of us lose the ability to express ourselves as freely as we once did. However, deep down inside we all still yearn for the freedom that the child embodies and for his unbridled spirit.\n\nIn a world where most are bound by rules and restrictions, there is nothing more attractive than a person who retains the ability to act freely with unapologetic authenticity.  \n\n\nIf you liked this post then consider joining [r/datingadviceformen](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/)
ss5oo4	hostile sexism	How to respond to a feminist woman asking "Are you saying this because I'm a woman"?: So many times when a feminist woman is denied or criticized by a man they respond with "Are you saying this because I am a woman?" and the obvious answer is "No" (or nope) but they keep on insisting that the man is saying it because she is a woman, so what's a good (and logical) response to that?
sn5lzf	neutral	I’m leaving this sub.: I’m sorry but this sub has became a shit show. Ever since the MGTOW ban(which was a good thing) I’ve been seeing more and more disturbing and flat out black pill post on this sub. I’ve seen so many rad trad post on the sub and I’ve even seen a lot of transphobic post. Some of y’all have forgotten that Rule 2 exists, transphobia is literally the THIRD form of bigotry listed. I don’t know why this sub has became such a shit show but this sub use to be a place where you could have learned something or have a good laugh but now I’m seeing post about “rising female promiscuity” which is literally a black pill/incel talking point. I literally saw a post talking about how feminism can affect your sex life…. Wtf. Being anti feminist does not equal being anti woman and a lot of y’all have forgotten that. I have been an anti feminist for almost 7 years but I’ve never supported or believe rad trad,or black pill ideology and I don’t know how any one can. Lastly a lot of things I’ve seen being posted are literally from satire sites/blogs. Stop falling for bait.
tdildp	neutral	Why don't footballers just beat up the goalkeeper?: Like the guy would just get a red card and sent off, but you could just volley the ball into the goal from the other side of the pitch? Stupid game. Genuine question btw.
taorx0	hostile sexism	I don't believe a woman should be president until women have to sign up for selective service.: No woman should have the power to send soldiers to war unless women can be forced to go to war too.
olynt1	neutral	I fell for a girl, and I want her to like me back, is that selfish?: I think it might be the first time I\u2019ve actually fallen in love, it might not be the case, but I really like her. And I don\u2019t know what to say or do. I\u2019m lost. Any advice is greatly valued.

t85fz6	neutral	Dating a bi girl: Bisexual, not bipolar.. thankfully. Anyways, my gf is bi but other girls definitely notice she\u2019s gay. Is that a bad look for me? She\u2019s good looking and even guys hit on her but do you think other girls who look at me might think \u201che strapped up like a dike\u201d or am i just trippin?
t87rx9	neutral	What is your take on being active or passive as a straight or homosexual man?: Every man straight or gay  is different. That's the first thing to understand. Gay men are that set of men who find other men sexually attractive. Within that set exists much variation.\n\nSome gay men are kind of turned off by men who look effeminate. Some are not, or actually prefer it. Some gay men are attracted to the hyper masculine. Some are not.\n\nAs to sexual practice, it varies probably more than attraction itself. I know a lot of straight guys are surprised when I tell them that a significant percentage of gay men don't practice anal intercourse at all.\n\nOf those who do, some strictly prefer one role over the other. But many couples are flexible.\n\nOf the percentage of gay men who strictly limit their sexual activity by role, can it be said that their attraction to type of men correlates highly to their role preference?
