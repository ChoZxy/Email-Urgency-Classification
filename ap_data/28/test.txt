t1e5eo	neutral	It is up to MEN to prove they are feminists, NOT women: MEN are the ones who have oppressed us all throughout history. MEN are the ones who need to pay up for past wrongdoings. MEN are the ones who need to step up to the plate.\n\nAs women we do not need to prove we are serious about feminism by paying 50/50 for our meals or by not wearing lipstick or whatever \u201crules\u201d there are for being a true feminist.\n\nThe onus is on MEN to prove themselves. \n\nAs a women I should not need to PROVE to a man that feminism is a serious issue any more than a person of color should have to prove to a white person that racism is a serious issue.\n\nSo whenever you are feeling down or guilty about being a \u201cbad feminist\u201d, just remember that it\u2019s not on you to prove your worth.

sjqc8m	neutral	Men's rights coming from a feminist: Just wanted to clear some things up. As a feminist, I believe all people should have equal rights. Men aren't usually oppressed in a systemic way, we can see this throughout history as women have had to fight for their rights for pretty much all of history, and men have never had to. That aside, men can still face oppression. Today, it's the toxically masculine standard to "be a man", express no emotion besides anger, and be the sole breadwinner of the house. As a feminist, I want to deconstruct that, as these toxically masculine standards are detrimental to both men **and** women. It means that male suicide rates are higher, it causes incel culture, it creates legal inequalities and so many more issues. You as a man deserve the right to feel emotions and to express those emotions. You deserve to choose typically feminine jobs. You deserve to dress in the way you want to. You deserve the right to look after and care for children if you so choose, ect. Feminism isn't anti-men. It's supposed to be about equality for everyone. Maybe some women are interpreting feminism in a way that focuses on women, but that doesn't mean you get to demonize feminism itself. Both men and women should get a choice in which roles they want to have in the family, workplace or society in general. Thanks for listening, downvote if you want and have a nice day.
syflbd	neutral	Stick to your boundaries: I went on five or six dates with a man over the past month, and it seemed to be going great. We had similar values, both wanted something serious, had great conversations and there was definitely attraction on both ends. A lot of green flags, no red flags (a couple yellow so I was being cautious).\n\nDespite the potential I saw in him as a long term partner, I stuck by my boundaries the entire time. And he was totally respectful of that and never pushed. Like FaceTiming before meeting, driving my own car places, and not getting physical right away.\n\nOn our final date I went to his place for dinner, and when we made our way to his room I made it clear I didn\u2019t want to have sex. He obviously would have liked to but didn\u2019t push and said he understands I\u2019m not there yet. We had a hot make out sesh and even cuddled a bit. He walked me to my car, kissed me and said to let him know when I\u2019m free this week to get together again.\n\nSo I was FLOORED when he messaged me that he doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re compatible because he needs a \u201cless traditional\u201d partner. Which is a euphemism for \u201cyou didn\u2019t put out\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly hurt that he used me to try to have sex and was disingenuous the entire courtship... but I\u2019m so thankful I didn\u2019t sleep with him. I know I would have felt even more crushed when he would inevitably kick me to the curb and I\u2019m glad I could weed him out early on by not giving him the one thing he was ultimately after.\n\n\nMen who truly want and respect you will wait. Just because a man says he will doesn\u2019t mean you can believe it. Make them PROVE it. Men who only want sex tell on themselves so fucking fast.\n\nDon\u2019t rush into it. Wait to have sex. Wait until you\u2019re absolutely ready and comfortable. Only you can determine what that point is and where your boundary is. Once you find it, stick by it and don\u2019t waver. Stay safe out there, love y\u2019all.

Great to know isn't it?\n\nTo be honest I don't really understand why this rather random subreddit (r/offmychest) automatically bans people for being part of certain subreddits. Do people that are part of nsfw subreddits also get automatically banned? Do people that are part of conservative subreddits get banned as well? And what about people that like Spaghetti more than Lasagna??? \n\nMy point is: Being part of a certain group has absolutely nothing to do with the main theme of the subreddit and I'm somewhat thrown off by the ban.\n\nWe can't be strong and dominant because that makes us toxic men and if we show feelings and aren't perfect we are fragile men.

t5tz7z	hostile sexism	Most men are so touch starved, and depraved of basic human contact, that they no longer feel full humans.: As men, we are raised to be mere cogs in the grand machine that is society. From the oldest of our memories, we remember girls being kissed, and loved, by the teachers, whereas, we boys, used to get all the detentions and sometimes even physical abuse at the hands of teachers. From the youngest of ages, we men have been told to shut up and not cry, to instead bottle it up, and thus lead to depression and isolation. Front the youngest of ages, we men have been treated as \"potential rapists\", to be feared and stayed away from.\n\nWhat does this do to a human mind? It causes depression, isolation, and loneliness. Combine this with the general apathy of society to male issues, and the general hostility strangers have to men (compared to women) and you can see where this goes.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent of these issues is touch starvation. Most guys rarely if ever have physical contact with anyone apart from handshakes. I as a guy in college, have not hugged anyone in almost 3 months, the last time I did was with my dad when I left home for college. This isn't just me, it's basically almost every man.  We are so touch starved and depraved of basic human (non-sexual) intimacy, that we no longer know what it is to be a human. All we know is that we have to earn money, and provide for our family.\n\nI look with envy and sadness whenever I see girls hugging, kissing and touching each other platonically. I wish sometimes, how must it feel to be treated with care and love? For all I know, I've never been treated like a human by the fellow humans that I am surrounded by. Why? Because I was born with the \"wrong\" genitalia.

I had a bit of a breakdown about a year and a half ago when I was at work and realised I was turning 30 and had never been on a date in my life. I broke out in a cold sweat, projectile vomited at work, and went home in a shock response unable to speak.  \n\n\nI scoured the internet like crazy and actually joined a men's coaching group where men from different walks of life met up, talked, and just shared their experiences.   \n\n\nThis helped me like crazy and I lost 52lbs, went from 0 to now 9 dates, and changed a lot about myself. I am still healing, growing and learning how to become a better man. But my outcomes are improving. Slowly, painfully slowly actually, but they are getting better.  \n\n\nPart of me is very hurt by the changing climate and the emergence of what seems like impossible high standards for men in 2022.   \n\n\nI remember before smart phones, I remember before social media, I remember how girls were friendlier and the average guy COULD get a girl. The work I did on myself just to be able to go on dates, get the occasional match and basically just survive the dating market was insane and I went full out for 9 months of sheer brutal work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made this video to share my experience and perspective on what I feel is an increasingly harsh and dehumanising dating market.   \n\n\n[https://youtu.be/Abl\\_MUY0he0](https://youtu.be/Abl_MUY0he0)  \n\n\nI do not know of any solutions, I think the self improvement the men here are doing is great, but nonetheless I did want to talk to other men about it.  \n\n\nMany thanks,  \nEarthbound Mystic
t23yw8	internalized sexism	I wasn't asexual, nor aromantic, I was just really put off by LVM: So as the title says I used to identify as aroace, I identified with the term myself after noticing my lack of desire to date men, were in reality for a long time since childhood I've been so put off on the inside by everything men did, though I didn't exactly treat men badly, I still saw them as my equals and still treated them normally.\n\nI took the term aromantic after noticing how much I hated romance, I didn't know this was the embodiment of my disgust, to me it was like a stupid nonexistent fantasy, there's no way the love was real, though I thought I was only for judging women for a normal desire they have, my only explanation was there's something wrong with me that denies me from seeing any charm in it, so I searched found the term aromantic, and it made sense to me I would hate something I didn't understand.\n\nI took the term asexual after noticing women around me getting excited after seeing a hot guy around, I didn't realize my lack of interest was deeply ingrained with how I was raised to view attraction and intimacy in general, since I lived in an extreme purity culture that even having a bf made you a \"wh\\*re\", and any form of physical intimacy including sex was this disgusting animalistic taboo subject, I thought people had sex only to have children, my parents have never been intimate besides an occasional hug in front of me, which made me believe that's true (i now realize my father hates my mother).\n\nThe only place I learned about sex was from the porn I came across, so the idea of attraction given to me was from a depraved man's pov, the objectifying kind, and I didn't want to look at another person in this way, whenever I looked at a guy I found good-looking I felt a strange uncomfortable emotion, like feeling subtly suffocated despite breathing normally a moment ago, i didn't pay much attention to this, and the term asexual gave me that explanation to why again I had no interest in another normal human desire.\n\nIt wasn't until I found fds that I came to know that I wanted a romantic relationship, I just didn't think I could ever be loved by a man, because nothing about them made me believe they have the ability to love women and only lusted after them. I also didn't have any way to vet a man to know if he wasn't \"settling\" for me, I was incredibly taken aback by the audacity and ego of these less than mediocre men that I didn't want to find anything appealing about them (how does it feel like to be rejected by my \"ugly\" inferior being?), and I never came across someone I was actually interested in romantically, I never looked in the first place because I was taught a LVM was \"the best I can get\" and \"that's the way all men are\", if that's what men are, then I don't want them.  \nNow, at last, I formed a healthy image of a good man with the help of fds.\n\nSeeing the way women talk about sex here gave me a whole new perspective, I thought there was something wrong with me if I didn't want to be degraded while having sex, and I was slowly ridding of the purity mindset I grew up with, also I looked up porn that was specifically made for women and I was astonished by it, I've never seen anything like that before, and after watching it I couldn't get the desire to be held and looked at that affectionately out of my head.\n\nI can feel attraction, but it's tied to romantic attraction as well, so it starts as really subtle and becomes nonexistent if I didn't like someone's personality, that's why I didn't believe I could feel it. after realizing this I felt broken and betrayed, but I'm glad I was able to recognize this and start healing, I didn't know I even had a problem before, I love you ladies for giving me the opportunity to do some self-reflection \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlso if you can recommend some media I can consume to have more perspective of a healthy sexual and romantic relationship so I can replace the filth I've been consuming and rewire my brain again, I would be immensely grateful.

tc8yop	internalized sexism	Feminists shame and guilt people (especially men) for their romantic/sexual preferences and accuse them of having an "Asian fetish/yellow fever", "an Indian fetish" or a "whatever fetish" for being into certain ethnicities more than others when it comes to dating... : This is just a few examples: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0ZoQAasqxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0ZoQAasqxs) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn\_emNrF4m0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn_emNrF4m0) I myself have been attacked by Feminists, especially Feminist fanfiction writers. They attacked me and other fanfiction writers/readers like me because we have a preference for Asian men and women (their beauty, charming personality, wisdom, culture, language, etc) or because we ship two people of the same sex, so the Feminists accuse us of having an "Asian fetish/yellow fever" or accuse us of "fetishizing gay men and women", even though some of us are members of the LGBT community, and even though as I pointed out multiple times "So fucking what if it is a "fetish", which I don't think it is? Everything and everyone under the sun is fetishized! There's even a shoe fetish and a leather fetish for fuck sake! Doesn't matter what race, skin color, gender or sexual orientation you are, everyone has a preference for certain ethnicities, genders, traits, etc! It's fucking normal and human! It's a romantic/sexual preference, not a "fetish" or "sexual racism"!" But of course, they don't fucking listen to anything I have to say and they always try to shame us for whatever preferences we have. Also, for the record, labeling a physical preference one might have (the physical preference that one has for an ethnicity or certain physical features found more commonly in certain ethnicities) as a "Fetish" harmfully objectifies and devalues the relationship of both the girl and the guy (or guy and guy, or girl and girl) in said relationship. People are being shamed and humiliated for having a preference for Asians, Indians, or latino, men, women, you name it. Heck these Feminazis will call Asian women who are into white men/western men of various nationalities (Italian, Irish, Canadian, American, etc) and "internalized racism" and "yellow fever fetish" and "white worshipping", so they also attack Asian women and people of color who are into whitemen/western men of various nationalities. There is no end to what they are willing to do and how far they're willing to go to shame and humiliate people for their romantic/sexual preferences. There are men who might be into Asian women, but it's a two-way attraction. For sure, it isn’t about being exotic and aesthetic only. Every race has its advantages and its very special beauty. But just imagine, Asian girls were observing the Asian boys since the moment of birth. They attended the kindergarten together, fell in love with each other for the first time, had the first kiss together and so on. How tired they should be of the same type of men? Dating a Westerner is very refreshing and breathtaking to them! Just like it's very refreshing and breathtaking for westerners to date Asians or people of any ethnicities other than their own. There is NOTHING wrong with that. And if you like reading male/male or female/female fanfictions because you love the characters and the pairing and their dynamics and alchemy, you're accused of "fetishizing gay men and women" by the Feminazis, even if you are a LGBT person yourself and a member of the LGBT community, thought straight people get even more backlash for reading male/male or female/female fanfics. If LGBT people read straight male/female fanfics they will be accused of having "internalized homophobia". And so on and so forth. You cannot win with these Feminazis. Whatever you say or do it's always going to be wrong, triggering, and problematic. I'm so fed up with that bullshit. I am LGBT person (I'm a bisexual woman) and a member of the LGBT community, I have always had a preference for Asian men and women, and I have always like same-sex ships in fanfictions especially male/male, because I find them more interesting, more well written and better than the female/female fanfics (it's as if most people don't put much efforts in their female/female fanfictions and there are very few female/female ships that I like enough to binge read fanfics with said ships, and I just find male/male relationships far more interesting, fascinating and heart-warming, so I read a lot of male/male fanfics, and also quite a few male/female fanfics, but very few female/female fanfics. Because of that, Feminists attack me and call me an "internalized misogynist" and a "lesbophobe". I am neither of those things. It's not my fault if most female/female fanfics don't have much quality to them and the male/male ones are far better and that the female/female ones are not interesting enough to keep me reading and that the characters in female/female fanfics don't have interesting personality, and that I prefer reading about male/male or gay male love relationships (also known as BL or Boy's Love) because I just find them more interesting, more fascinating and more heart-warming overall and I find the dynamics of male/male relationships more interesting than the dynamics of female/female relationships. It's a literary preference and I as well as people in general should not be shamed and humiliated and attacked for our preferences. I don't bash and shame other people for the ethnicities they are into or not into, for their favorite ships or pairings' gender(s) in books and movies and fanfictions, for whatever preferences they are, but the radical Left won't leave people alone. They will even try to destroy people's lives and reputations over their harmless and normal preferences, I fucking swear. Girl 1: "I don't want to date an Asian man because it's not in alignment with my dating preferences." Radical Left Feminists: "You're racist!" Girl 2: "I only date Asian men because I find them very attractive!" Radical Left Feminists: "You're fetishizing Asian men! That's wrong!" Guy 1: "I don't want to date a trans-woman because they have a penis and I don't like penis." Radical Left Feminists: "You're a transphobic bigot!" Guy 2: "I only date trans-women because I am very attracted to them." Radical Far Left Feminists: "You're fetishizing trans-women! That's wrong!" I only date Asians/I'm almost exclusively attracted to Asians = Fetish I just don't like dating Asians/I'm not into Asians" = Sexual Prejudice Radical Left Feminists. You can't win with these people. With the Right-Wing "Christian" FundaMENTALists (the radical Right) and the FemiNAZIS (the Far-Left) you can't win, you can never win, no matter what you say or do you'll always be a vile disgusting piece of shit "sinner" in their eyes and what you say or do will never be good enough in their eyes, damn if you do damn if you don't, so fuck the radical Right and the radical Left. I'm proud to be a Center-Left person who is progressive in her values but for the most part is non-partisan or independent. Yes that's what yours truly is. And I can't stand the radicals/loonies in both parties, I want nothing to do with them. Remember that folks, the radical Right and the radical Left are cancer on society. All radicalism is evil and must be condemned.

By the end of it all I really thought I was asexual. \n\nAgain after the break up I went back to dating and did the loyal thing. Find 1 guy I liked and invest my time with and like always within a few days/weeks it would all fall apart. This happened a couple of times.\n\nSo finally I said fuck it.

Now he\u2019s stuck in the cold mountains and I\u2019m elsewhere \ud83c\udf89: Near the end of 2020 my ex and I were still in contact trying the whole friend thing. It had been over a year since the breakup. We went out for food and I can\u2019t remember how we ended up on the topic but I ended up telling him about my plans to move to another state for grad school for the following school year. I was so excited about it and the opportunity to finally be on my own in a new city. A fresh start! After I finished, he gathered up all the emotional blackmail phrases that he used especially near the end of the relationship about how we\u2019re meant to be together and how much he values me blah blah and finished it off with \u201cCan I go with you\u201d. And in that moment I saw red because how dare he after I just gave a whole speech in how excited I was to do this solo?? In that moment I realized that in the 2+ yrs we we\u2019re together, he probably never truly cared about me (thank god for FDS for getting me out!). I kept my composure and simply said \u201cno\u201d with the blankest expression I could muster. For ~5 seconds his face scrunched up in disbelief and anger that his sob story didn\u2019t work. \n\nA couple days later I had this intense gut feeling that I needed to cut all contact. NOW. And I listened. The next day I told him I didn\u2019t want to talk anymore or have any contact and blocked him.\n\nDuring the first couple months of 2021 my mental health plummeted (it had nothing to do with men/my ex/love). By August I had gotten treatment and finally felt well enough to resume my plans to move. I ended up not applying to the school that I had originally told my ex I was going to move to because I realized that even though I loved the location, the school program was subpar. I was accepted into one of my top schools and it\u2019s over 16hr drive (or a pricey flight ticket) from the subpar school. \n\nFast forward fall 2021, I hear from his brother that he moved to another state for his career and bc everything around reminded him of me/ the relationship. I\u2019m shocked at the State my ex chose because it\u2019s not known to offer any good opportunities for his very popular career choice. I whip out my phone to see where this school is\u2026.ITS 2 hrs away from the place I said I would be going. I am 100% certain that if he could have found a job closer he would have moved closer\u2026And because he told his family he wanted to get away from me, if I had moved there it would look like I had followed HIM.\n\nBecause I cut contact when I did, my ex had no idea that I was ill and that I didn\u2019t apply to the subpar school. Had I kept talking to him, he could have moved to my grad school. And now he\u2019s too broke to follow for at least another year \ud83e\udd73 \n\nTrust your gut ladies. I\u2019m so happy I did.
te6vo7	neutral	How do I help out my friend without making it seem like charity?: My friend is 2 months away from welcoming a baby into this world and he is stressing about the financial strain a baby puts on a household. \nI recently had a baby and we were just discussing baby related things and it turns out he is not prepared at all.\nHe's panicking about the cost of diapers, clothing etc etc. \nHe has a fairly decent job - he makes enough but doesn't have the disposable income to save or outlay for stroller, carseat, cot etc. His family are all on welfare and she is from another country with no family in this country.\n\nI'm in a position to help out. I started a business at a young age and its doing well. I would love to outright buy him the stroller or the cot, or a year supply of diapers. Hes very proud so I think there's a good chance he wouldn't accept it. I know I wouldn't if the shoe was the other foot.\nSo, how do I help without being a white knight or patronising?
t1831t	neutral	it's the phrasing that matters: Truth bomb time: I cannot stand being asked, only by men \"IF\" I work. There is so much difference between being asked \"Do you work?\" versus being asked \"What do you do?\" I'm also 54, and that for most Americans is still the age to be in the career world. I just find it odd how this question has come up recently quite a lot, and I suspect age-ism. I mean, it could be the Great Resignation, but I have my doubts and suspicions.\n\nI've found over the years that the only people who ask me IF I work are traditional, conservative men. I highly suspect that the rest of that question is left unspoken, since actually voicing it would mark them as traditional and conservative. The full question is, \"Do you work, or are you a housewife?\" \n\nThis outs them as seeing women in an extremely traditional role, and on some level, they know this. I despise this perspective. I cannot say how much contempt I have for any male who thinks this. \n\nI tend to push back by asking them the same question, but going a little further: Do you work? Have you ever worked? Quite often they don't catch the implied condescension they've just shown to me. Yep, a shit-test, but one that works. They out themselves as being traditional, conservative, AND insensitive. That's my cue to block, delete, and move on, very little time wasted.\n\nLadies, what other questions do men ask that show you who and what they are? I'm interested.

Fairly good looks, good physique, momma\u2019s boy, his idea of a date was getting food, then going to my place for \u201cdessert\u201d.

ta1dpj	neutral	Men who hide their child???: I\u2019m about to block a dude who\u2019s mutually followed me for years now because I noticed something very off. I remember two years ago or so, he got married to a beautiful lady and had a beautiful baby with her. \n\nFor the first few months he kept pictures of his family up. Maybe half a year to a year in, the posts of his wife are missing and there were only a few pictures left of his baby on his Instagram. He tried to message me and I asked what happened to his wife, he claimed they were on a break or separated \u201cbecause of her postpartum\u201d. I left him on read and never replied because I did feel low value energy from him even before I joined FDS, but I wasn\u2019t assertive enough at the time to just block/delete.\n\nA man abandoning his wife during postpartum made me think he likely couldn\u2019t wait to get his dick wet again or was just generally unsupportive with her depression. So it made me worry a lot about how much she\u2019s probably doing for their daughter all on her own. I don\u2019t use Instagram very often so when I logged on today and was looking through stories, I noticed his profile pop up and realized I should remove him from myself for good. \n\nLooked at his Instagram feed before doing that and all pictures of his precious baby daughter are no where to be found now. Undoubtedly archived\u2026 He exclusively posts photos of cars and thirst traps of other women he took in the name of his \u201cphotography\u201d. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s back on dating apps and likely not mentioning he\u2019s separated/recently divorced and a father\u2026 just living this same old sad \u2018bachelor life\u2019 in his 30s, avoiding responsibility and thinking it\u2019s totally cool to hit on women while deceiving them about his past. \n\nHave other women here subtly noticed things like this happen with men they once thought were decent?? I hope the mother of his daughter and his baby are doing well and that he\u2019s at least paying child support. I just think if it were a woman who archived all photos of her child, she would be getting way more heat for it. I don\u2019t know why lvm think this is okay.
tccdey	hostile sexism	Women's lives are more precious than men's: I live in a small European country in the Mediterranean sea. We get thousands of illegal immigrants from Africa. We just cannot handle the huge influx as our country is small and its infrastructure and support systems just cannot handle thousands or even hundreds of immigrants every year.\n\nBut our international obligations plus our ethical and moral rules do not permit us to let people drown in the Mediterranean sea while they are crossing from Africa to Europe.\n\nWhat I find strange is that on every boat of illegal immigrants there may be 50 or 100 men PLUS one or two women. Many of us do not want our army to go out and 'save' these Muslim illegal immigrants and bring them here. But news stations always report that there are some women (usually a tiny percentage) on the boats and that is where people have a change of heart. It seems that for our people in general it is OK to let a boatful of African men drown but if there is a woman - we get protests and demonstrations may be urging the government and the army to rescue and bring to our country the illegal immigrants.
t0t6ao	benevolent sexism	Waiting for Sex: Not a Zero Sum Game: There have been a lot of posts recently about LVM pretending to be HVM and then bolting when they realize FDS Ladies are serious about no sex upfront. We all acknowledge this is a good rule because it mostly scares off the users. But here's the thing. In the comments several women have shared the stories of men who did wait the requisite time period, be it three months or longer, only to hit it and quit it, dipping immediately after sex. Why? Well, while it is true 99% of the time, if you sleep with a man right away, he won't respect you, double standard notwithstanding. But I think many of us have been taught or led to be believe if you do the opposite by making him wait, he \\*will\\* respect you. FALSE. \n\nMen are weird. Sex is not a zero-sum game to them. They do all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify their double standards and nonexistent standards for themselves.  Just like men know right away whether or not they would ever marry a woman, they have decided how much \"respect\" ,for lack of a better word, they are going to give her right upfront. Note: this has nothing to do with your actual value as a human being or any real character traits. It's not like \"oh, I see she's a polygot with a Ph.D, better mind my Ps and Qs.\" It's more like, \"she's my perfect anime waifu! Better hide my bad habits.\" While you could theoretically do things that would make him treat you with less \"respect\", you can never good behavior your way into him treating you better or respecting you more. He may ACT like he does, but it is only an act. When he gets what he came for, he'll be gone without a decent excuse. He was just masking his contempt. In fact, guys who don't respect you take a perverse thrill in \"waiting you out\". They're pissed you, person who they don't think is worth their \"respect\" because your waist isn't the size of Cheerio or something equally stupid, think you deserve good treatment and they want to punish you for it by psychologically torturing you like Lucy with Charlie Brown and the football. They hold the good treatment you want up and just when you think it's yours, they snatch it away after sex. \n\nSo how can you win? First, keep that vetting period. Most men cannot hold the mask up that long. Second, vet intensely! Get specific. Listen to what he says about you. If it's a bunch of generic bs, you're nice, you're sweet, you're pretty, he doesn't know who you are and doesn't care. He's marking time, waiting to get in your pants. Run. Third, listen to what he says about other women. Maybe he's savvy and praises you with specific compliments. But if he's a misogynist, it will leek out. Some men just cannot say anything positive about a woman. If he sees a gorgeous celeb and all he can say is, \"she looked better when she was younger/before the baby/ with a different hair color/she's pretty but can't act/ she's an 8/ etc.\", that's a sign. Men who pick apart other women aloud are doing it to you in their heads. Men are basura, thank God for FDS. Stay strong, yall.

sr70nw	internalized sexism	Feminist turned anti-feminist (rant): I’d say if anything I’m now egalitarian. I used to be a huge feminist that wanted to feel so empowered and do anything a male could do better. This is partially due to my upbringing, I was raised by an entire family of males so since I looked up to all men I thought why can’t I just do what they do instead of adhering to gender norms? I’ve always played hockey and baseball growing up taking after my brothers and now I’m in the military following in my Dad’s footsteps. I wanted to be just like them. I would surf the internet looking for ways that I could feel empowered as a female and realized that a lot of them were putting down men, so that’s what I started doing as well. I’d put men down for having preferences about women such as not being overweight, big butt, big boobs, small waist, big hips, thigh gap, hairless, etc. i soon realized, these unrealistic expectations that are nearly unattainable were basically started by females, such as the Kardashians. Then I thought, what about women having preferences for a male? Super tall but also built like a short stocky man would be, sharp jawline, nice eyes, wide shoulders, facial hair, loaded wallet, etc. I realized that while I wouldn’t be having kids, (I’m infertile but I don’t really want them anyway), and I am interested in having a career while being married to a man with a career since I enjoy luxurious things, I enjoy cooking for my fiancé and cleaning the house and all around just being hospitable and doing acts of kindness for him. Obviously he isn’t a baby and if the trash is overflowing and I’m not home he’ll take it out or he will wipe off the sink after he shaves, but overall I do most of the housework and basically all of the cooking and I do not mind it. I always try to hold myself to the best possible standard for him, working out in the gym, keeping my weight down, keeping my skin clear and soft, making sure I’m always hygienic such as brushed teeth, scents that he likes, washed hair, and shaving because his preference is no body hair or bushy eyebrows. I don’t dye my hair crazy colors or pierce up my face or tat up my body because he finds it unattractive and so do I but that’s not relevant. I think it is important for women to understand that we can have a dream to do a job other than just being a mother, while not pushing it in mens faces. I think as people we should all have back up plans in case things fall through and I’ll always know how to change a tire or know self defense or how to do work outside of the house in case I lose my fiancé in any way. But for now I leave those things up to him unless I have to utilize them myself. I always wanted to be in the military, and I was never interested in being a mother. I’d never shame a woman for wanting a traditional family like that but it isn’t for me. Even though I guess you could call me untraditional because I do not have or want kids with my fiancé, I am still not a feminist. I think if a couple has kids and one isn’t working or does not have to work to support the family, the mother should be home with the child and the child shouldn’t just be stuck in daycare with random ass people. That is so detrimental to a child’s development. If you aren’t gonna raise the child, do not have the child. I said mother above, obviously that is the first resort but if that isn’t plausible obviously the next one is the father. I believe in two parent households and only having children with someone you are sure will be there for the rest of you and the childrens life. I’m tired of the feminist idea that it is somehow empowering to breed kids and then just send them to daycare so that when they turn the age where they start forming thoughts and opinions, they don’t even know who you are. I view everyone equally, but that does not bleed into preferring one group of people overall over another. I think mens mental health needs to be talked about more and also let men know that it is okay to have emotions, and it is okay to come out about sexual assault etc. too often we are so blinded by womens issues that men are stigmatized for these things. I will advocate for mens rights until the day I die. Especially in divorce and child support cases where the mother isn’t letting the father see the child because of a relationship issue even though he wants to, and still demanding he pay. But that’s a whole other rant lol.

t3idzp	neutral	Women's Body Savior: I'm fat. I've been fat my entire life. I'm also beautiful and have been beautiful my entire life. I have zero body image issues. \n\nBack in undergrad, almost 20 years ago, I dated a guy that was LV. It did not work out obviously. So here we are all these years later and he still randomly texts me to tell me I'm beautiful. At first I thought he was fishing for compliments bc, shocker, he did not age well. I never gave compliments. He would still send texts and memes telling me that my body is beautiful and that I should love it. I would ignore it, but I was also annoyed that he assumed I didn't love my body. This weekend I got another text and I finally wrote back and said that I love my body and have zero issues with the way I look and he didn't need to keep telling me that I should love my curves, etc. He went off! And the more I didn't engage the more he texted. I ended up just blocking him. So me telling him I didn't need my body policed triggered him that easily? We used to follow each other on social media and almost all of his followers are exclusively plus sized women. I am not here to be a fetish. I truly think he believes he's the fat female body savior. I'm sure he texts multiple women daily telling them how great their imperfect bodies are, as if his opinion matters."

Not one person thought men's life is harder.\n\nBut I still think men's lives are harder. I will give you the top reasons why.\n\n1) If you are a man you have to work all of your life. In most cultures men are seen as the main providers in the family so it is difficult to be a homemaker if you are a man. You might also work yourself half to death. According to ILO, there are millions more male child laborers.\n\n2) Men's work is usually more difficult than women's work. Women's work, apart from pregnancy, is not that dangerous. Doing house chores, nursing children, being a school teacher isn't that dangerous. But men's work like being a construction worker is much more dangerous. In most countries, the majority of people who die from work are men.\n\n3) If you are a man, who cannot depend on others for money. If a woman finds her job too hard, she can depend on her hubby's financial support. \n\n4) You are less likely to get support from community if you are raped/victim of domestic violence/homeless.\n\n5) You are less likely to get help for mental health issues. You are more likely to commit suicide.\n\n6) Your health is probably worse and more attention is given to women's health which leads to men living shorter lives.\n\n7) No one cares about your problems as much. You are more disposability. For example in Ukraine men are dying so much but the focus is just on women. \n\n8) You are more likely to get murdered. Men's safety is not taken seriously and so even if a man dies, no one cares but if a woman does they care.\n\nAre there any more reasons? Do you think women have it harder and why?\n\nP.S I am a woman and I don't think I have it harder.

tcox5c	neutral	A father recently described a potentially false claim of harassment from his child's day care provider who is a good friend of the mother after he requested documentation via child care verification form. If false, the harassment claim could be an attempt to cover child care expenses fraud: A father recently described a potentially false claim of harassment from his child's day care provider who is a good friend of the mother after he requested documentation via  child care verification form\n\nThis was my reply to him. I've included it here in case other fathers or parents face a similar situation, in the hopes that it may help them to obtain justice:\n\nI am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.\n\nIt is possible that a child care provider may file a false claim of harassment when asked to provide child care expenses information to a court. This is especially true if that child care provider is a close friend with the custodial parent, normally the mother.\n\nThis may be because mom is falsifying her childcare expenses and her friend knows it or is involved. By claiming very high child care expenses, mom can get a higher child support payment from the court and put more of her child's money in her pocket.\n\nThat may be fraud:\n\n&gt; Fraud\n&gt; Fraud is both a civil tort and criminal wrong. \n\n&gt; In civil litigation, allegations of fraud might be based on a misrepresentation of fact that was either intentional or negligent.  For a statement to be an intentional misrepresentation, the person who made it must either have known the statement was false or been reckless as to its truth.  The speaker must have also intended that the person to whom the statement was made would rely on it.  The hearer must then have reasonably relied on the promise and also been harmed because of that reliance. \n\n&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fraud\n\nThat is illegal and it's theft from the child and the father.

nw0y1m	neutral	\ud83d\udea9 Red Flags? Follow your gut: I (34F) wanted to give folks an update on a recent dating situation for which I asked this community advice. \n\nTo summarize, I was dating a new woman (31F) who demonstrated some red flags early on \u2014 behaviors I interpreted to be controlling and jealous, pushing for a quick commitment and making me feel guilty for setting boundaries. Some of the commenters advised that there were no major red flags and that I should give this person a shot\u2026 others encouraged me to trust myself and move on.\n\nI ended up following my gut and ending things. I was gentle and explained that we were moving at a speed I was not comfortable with and I did not think we were the right match. I kept my end of the conversation short and to the point. I didn\u2019t think going on half a dozen dates warranted a long drawn out battle or negotiation.\n\nLow and behold, she exploded when I told her I didn\u2019t want to continue dating. Full gambit: called me names, raged/yelled, and generally put me down \u2014 saying contradictory and manipulative things like that I \u201cpretended to be serious \u2014 lying and leading her on\u201d while at the same time I \u201cwasn\u2019t serious enough \u2014 didn\u2019t try hard enough or pay enough attention to her.\u201d Most disturbingly, she told me this was not my decision to make, and that she deserved to have a say in whether or not we kept seeing each other.\n\nSo in the end, I feel affirmed that my concerns were valid. I believe I was well on my way to entering (yet another) abusive relationship if I had stayed. \n\nReally, this story is just to say that the best advice I\u2019ve received in this community is to always follow my gut. I think it\u2019s really important that we remind each other of this \u2014 that it\u2019s okay to trust yourself.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear about a dating experience you had where you followed your gut and it paid off.

tbac45	hostile sexism	Feminism - Fundamentally fantastic | Historically glorious | Currently despicable: The feminist movement was initially found to give women the same rights as men/have women be treated the same way as men under the law. Women fought the war against the male patriarchy for absolute ages and have finally achieved their victory. Equality under the law.\n\nBut as we all know things did not end here.\n\nWhat we currently call \"feminism\" can hardly be considered feminism when you look at the initial goals and fundamental concepts of feminism. The current movement is mere men hatred and toxic female empowerment. \n\nIrresponsible behaviour and lifestyles are being promoted. Men that don't make serving women their sole life goal are being called out for \"toxic masculinity\" while men that don't serve women efficiently enough are being shamed for \"fragile masculinity\" \n\nMy mother raised me and my siblings all by herself during tough times and we're a strong loving family now. That's a truly strong woman. Whenever I tell her about the \"new\" feminist movement she simply shakes her head and sighs. She says this is not real feminism and she is completely right. \n\nYour boyfriend broke up with you? No need to hop on Twitter and tell every man on the planet to kill himself. You're a fat and ugly woman? There are ten times as many fat and ugly men out there and they don't hate the opposite gender just because of their own appearance. \nYou prefer to have sex with women. Okay cool no need to tell men that their existence is obsolete because you can make \"children\" in laboratories without men.\n\nThis post was supposed to be neutral but it turned into a full rant, apologies.
t467r8	neutral	Successful dating experience: I just ended things with a guy I\u2019ve been seeing for a few months. While I am a bit upset I\u2019m not broken. Even though it didn\u2019t lead to a committed relationship I am very appreciative of the experience. I wish I had the balls to date this way in my 20s - I could\u2019ve saved myself a lot of time, tears, and heartache along the way. \n\nAs someone who came up in the olden days of the online dating era (I\u2019m 36) **I am very much over it**. The concept of meeting men on the internet both scares and bores me at the same time. I didn\u2019t realize how bored I was until I got on hinge and bumble last fall and just felt totally deflated. As someone who has an online business and a social media following for said business, I am wary of too many buzzwords and I feel that is all OLD has to offer. So I made a mental and conscious effort to flirt more in person and to be more receptive to men who I knew in passing or had already been connected to via professional or business circles. \n\nI ended up going out with two men who I knew through work/professional connections. One was a man who I had met in a class I took about 5 years ago and the other was a fellow crew member on a gig I was on at the time. I feel like OLD has socially crippled me in a way because I felt like I was relearning men all over again. This time around I was more focused on determining if these men were worth my time over trying to impress them at all. My internal monologue was - \u201cI\u2019m pretty impressive my damn self, I have a nice life and I am happy with where I am. I deserve to be adored.\u201d \n\nSome issues that I can see better in hindsight:\n\nTry to find men who are on your level (emotionally, financially/career wise, physically, etc) This can be a challenge if you are a very multifaceted person and/or if you\u2019re highly ambitious. At the very least don\u2019t date down. Ever. You determine what \u201cdating down\u201d is for you and do your best to avoid it. I made the mistake of dating a crew member who was in an entry-level position, which isn\u2019t bad in and of itself, but after getting to know him I realized we had been in the industry for about the same length of time and he was still entry-level. In my industry, a lot of us who had entry-level positions typically had more than one hustle cause the day rate is barely enough to live on. This man was content making what he was making and after dating him for a short time I realized he just didn\u2019t have too many aspirations besides growing weed and smoking it. Instant attraction killer!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou control the pace but let the man take the lead. He should be the one pushing to see you, making time for you, initiating contact, paying/planning the dates, etc. If you like a man without any investment on his part it is easy to exploit your feelings for him. Get clear with yourself about how you feel about this man and what you know of him to justify these feelings. Simply being attracted is not enough! A lot of men may find you attractive but how many of them are going to put in the effort to get to know you while respecting your boundaries? That is very important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, don\u2019t get caught up in constant communication. Don\u2019t be on the phone for hours on end if you aren\u2019t in a committed relationship. Your attention is everything! Your time is valuable! If he wants to speak to you that frequently he should be taking you out. Y\u2019all can have lovely chats over dinner (not coffee or drinks). Don\u2019t get caught up in constantly texting either. A quick text to say thank you for a lovely date or to just check in to see how their week is going is fine. Save the constant communication for your friends and loved ones. These men aren\u2019t your friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, porn is really the biggest elephant in the room when it comes to dating. I hadn\u2019t been sexually active in almost 2 years when I started dating these two men. I hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for close to 4 years either. Date #1 and I got intimate a few months back (before I was super turned off by his lack of ambition) and it was horrifying! It was so bad I had to have a conference with him the next day to ask \u201cwhat the fuck was that?!\u201d He did all types of BDSM shit that I never consented to, he was super rough, I felt so cheap, and honestly, I was terrified. I had never had someone treat me like that in bed and it made me worry. His explanation? \u201cMy ex let me do everything to her so I\u2019m sorry but that is what I\u2019m used to.\u201d **I WAS DISGUSTED.** I don\u2019t doubt there are women who enjoy BDSM but it sounded like a lie and felt like I was being gaslit. It gave big-time porn-sick vibes. I do not need to be slapped in the face, spoken to like a porn star, spit on, none of that. I\u2019ve been sexually active since I was 15 - I have never needed any of that to get off and I have never had a man pull no shit like that with me. Ever! I refuse to believe this is what\u2019s passing for sex out here. Fuck that. \n\nDate #2 spent more time courting me but sadly, the end result was the same. While he was very gentle and attentive to me in bed (after almost 5 months of dating, we only kissed 4 months in) when it came time to \u201cdo the do\u201d he couldn\u2019t finish. He finally admitted that he had been abstaining from porn since we had started dating but had recently started watching it again. I was this close to telling him that he couldn\u2019t watch porn and sleep with me but a week later we ended up breaking things off because he said he wanted to continue to date and sleep with other people. He admitted to being very inexperienced and feeling insecure about this. I do believe if he wasn\u2019t watching porn we could have had a better time together but that\u2019s not my problem tbh. Porn is ruining men's brains, their sex drives, and their ability to see us as whole people. I kind of feel sad because I know that porn is so normalized that looking for a man who doesn\u2019t watch porn is damn near impossible these days. \n\nAll in all, I consider both of these experiences to be a success. Why? I was able to observe myself and my dates critically and objectively. I had vastly different encounters with them (one was my usual \u201ctype\u201d and the other was not). I didn\u2019t let fear or loneliness control my dating experience; when I realized I wasn\u2019t getting what I wanted/needed I fell back and ended things. It was also good for me to re-evaluate what I was attracted to, what I enjoy about dating, and what I truly would like in a partner. Even if neither of these men made the cut, it is still good field data and I did not internalize their shortcomings as I used to. Growth and self-esteem, for the win!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that spring is coming I'm. really excited to tackle my 2nd quarter goals, continue improving myself, and possibly meet some more potential dates while doing activities I enjoy. \n\nI will not be returning to OLD.
slm1hz	hostile sexism	They must keep men as enemies to justify staying in power.**: Once you realize that Feminism is fundementally a lie, it's easy to understand Men's Rights problems: If men managed to oppress women for thousands of years, as feminists have always claimed, then how come in the past 40 years, without firing a single weapon, women have managed to devastate boys so completely? Every metric of young male life has plummeted.  You know the stats: \- only 40% of boys now getting college degrees \- massive unemployment/homelessness/incarceration of men \- Almost total destruction of men in divorce courts \- etc. If men are such powerful oppressors, why have we seemingly, "given up" so easily in the past 40 years?  Feminists think it's because they are so darned powerful, or so righteous, or because of technology.  However those arguments are laughable. A much simpler argument is this:  Men never WERE oppressors.  The entire Feminist trope of "Male as historic oppressor" is pure nonsense.  In fact, the history of the human race is the history of men fighting and dying to *protect women from oppression*.  For every example of a male in ancient history oppressing a woman, we can find 10 examples of men sheilding women from oppression.  Essentially all of society, from police departments to technology to housing to medicine, was created by men to serve women. **Feminism fundementally, at it's core, is based on a lie.  It isn't true.  It was never true.** Here is a nice summation by Bob Lewis in the book "[The Feminist Lie - It Was Never About Equality](https://www.amazon.com/Feminist-Lie-Never-About-Equality/dp/1546926097/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522690011&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+feminist+lie+by+bob+lewis&amp;dpID=51XCrojyZzL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=thepowermov06-20&amp;linkId=7f955bf46b10fca1b3c965488388e626)" https://preview.redd.it/kdiymhe034g81.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=712b5982f141497fdae23fef420cd66f9a41bc91 His point:  women have ALWAYS had more rights than men.  They had the right to "not get killed in war or hunting" which is the biggest right of all.  Feminism simply ignores these big rights and pretends, falsely, that men have more rights than women.  Feminist is designed to fight inequality, but there is no inequality.  They just pretend there is by ignoring the big juicy benefits they got for millennia. How does all this destroy Men's Rights?  Once you realize that all of society was created by men to serve women, then it's obviou what is happening:  boys are naturally the weakest members of society.  They are the first to die, the first to be sacrificed to protect women.  In our modern "feminist-driven" society, boys have been pushed back even more.  Their needs have been pushed back even more. **In a society based on the Feminist Lie, it is inevitable that men and boys become a subservient disenfranchised class, while women demand ever more, more, more of the social pie.** Feminism has no "off switch".  There is no way for the Feminist movement to admit (or even recognize) that they've already destroyed men.  Every man in the world could drop dead and the Feminist movement would still keep ranting about male oppression - they'd create AI virtual men and convince their followers those men are somehow stiill the oppresssors. **Feminist leaders make $$ for leading Feminist organizations.

Wouldn't it be better instead of just asking are you feminist or antifeminist to Just ask me what stance do i have on certain topics as our stances can very likely allign and Using identity manipulation really useful connection might never be created. F those terms group we allign with doesn't define our whole viewpoint Humans are more complex than that. While discussing stuff like societal issues of Each gender everyone participating in should be judged on their opinion not their group. Identity games are i think single biggest thing that Blocks us from cooperating.

tco07j	neutral	Has anyone ever felt compelled to stay with a genuinely sweet guy they're kind of bored by because they know damn well almost everything else out there is absolutely horrible?:Trying to frame this so it's not a personal question even though it's my current situation. I want to hear about others' experiences. I've been in a relationship for two years with a guy who's legitimately the nicest, sweetest, most earnest guy I've ever met. He absolutely adores me and would do anything to see me happy. Even when I gained almost 40 pounds, he was still obsessed with me (even though I wanted to die). He's so patient despite my having been depressed and emotional a lot. I'm just not as attracted to him as I used to be. Sometimes I think I'm just conditioned to get bored or scared by intimacy and reciprocated feelings, you know\u2014like when a dodgy guy who's not really into you texts you once every 5 days and gets you hooked on intermittent reinforcement. Like, I think I'm too damaged by shit like that to appreciate what I have. Sometimes I miss the excitement of flirting with a stranger or having an orgasm-void hookup (ha). BUT at the same time I know it's easy to romanticize that shit now. And when I was in the throes of that, I was absolutely miserable and felt like straight trash. That's how I was treated. All I wanted was to be loved, and now I am, and I feel like something is missing.\n\nI feel like my relationship is already without spark, and at 25, it feels too early to give that up. But I feel like if I end things I'd be chasing something that doesn't exist AND ruining something special. Is it really possible to be in a longterm, stable, sweet relationship that is also exciting and passionate? Have you ever worked hard to reinvigorate your own relationship with a \"boring\" guy because you knew it'd be best for you, realistically? \n\nSorry if this question is cynical af. I'm depressed just typing it

I was shocked, but in that state; he asked me if I intend to see a change in what he does; to which I refused to answer (He demonstrates change when he sees logical). A lot of them are regular people and not even influencers which made me feel odd. Its kinda odd, I dont think so lot of them are people that he even knows personally but there are 20,000+ of them. I dunno\n\nAre there some boundaries that should I keep or make him keep? Is this what all boys do?

Out of the blue, this girl that i had hung out with for a few months but haven\u2019t talked to in awhile messaged long paragraphs accusing me of making sexual advances on her and said i had no right to speak out on SA. The funny thing is, i just lost my virginity to my now girlfriend of a year and a half at the age of 25. This girl and i hung out when i was 23. When i called her out for it not being true, she said that when  i was giving her a kiss, she felt very forced to kiss me back. How was i supposed to know that when she seemed like she wanted to kiss me to say hello and goodbye? Not to mention, there was a time i was trying to sleep and she tried to stick my hand down her pants to finger her (which i never touched a vagina til my current girlfriend). \nI don\u2019t understand why this is bothering me so much.

All forms of Feminism hold the following premises as self-evident: * Society is Male Dominated * Male dominance privileges men over women * While some men can sometimes be harmed by this system, the system itself is set up to privilege men and subjugate women for mens express benefit. * Men are in power and the system operates to benefit and serve mens' needs, drives, and interests at the expense of womens' needs, drives, and interests. This could be described as "class warfare between men and women, with men winning". If these are true, then society is this way because men want it to be so. Since society is (supposedly) male dominated and serves to benefit mens' needs drives and interests, the subjugation of women must be in-keeping with mens' inclinations. Therefore, it is in-keeping with mens inclinations to oppress, subjugate, beat, rape, and violate women, including their own mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, girlfriends, and every other women they claim to "love". If a man does not do these things to the women in his life, he is complicit and tacitly supporting the system that allows other men to do this to the women in his life. Women, being the subjugated class, cannot be held accountable for this, in the same way one cannot hold slaves accountable for their own slavery, even if they perpetuate the system through their actions and personal beliefs. Further, even the immense influence a mother has over her child - one that shapes and moulds the child's adult personality, values, and sense of belonging - has been unable to raise men that won't oppress them. Women are singularly incompetent in the face of male monstrosity. And men are foolish too, because they leave their offspring in the care of those who are seen as lessers. *** **Misleading feminist statistics that reinforce these beliefs** The information needed to confirm this belief of male monstrosity is often brought out by feminist academics injecting their bias into their methodology. and creating and disseminating inaccurate statistics. Two such excellent examples of where this has happened are in the areas of rape and domestic violence. On the topic of the feminist approach to domestic violence. We have the Duluth model. the Duluth Model is the most common batterer intervention program used in the United States. (it's also the basis for a number of other programs across the world) The **feminist theory** underlying the Duluth Model is that men use violence within relationships to exercise power and control. However, Ellen Pence (the creator) herself has written, &gt;"By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find."[22] This is further debunked by Professor Murray A. Straus. who is best known for creating the conflict tactics scale, the "most widely used instrument in research on family violence" In the following study [Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment) It summarizes results from more than 200 studies that have found gender symmetry in perpetration and in risk factors and motives for physical violence in martial and dating relationships. It also summarizes research that has found that most partner violence is mutual and that self-defense explains only a small percentage of partner violence by either men or women. The second part of the article documents seven methods that have been used to deny, conceal, and distort the evidence on gender symmetry (Often by feminist groups) Now. On top of this being more recent evidence. We have also known about this as far back as the first domestic violence shelter. founded in 1971. By Erin Pizzey. Who had the same findings as Straus and all of the studies he cites. But she was chased out of her home and country with bomb threats from feminists when she expressed interest in opening a similar shelter for men Now. Let's move on to rape. Feminists are also responsible for stopping male victims of female rapists from being recognized in [India](https://archive.is/5bP77), [Israel](https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape), [Nepal] (https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities) and [the USA](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/119784319421/influential-rape-researcher-mary-koss-claims-male) Now, Let's focus on that last one. For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. You should listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.) She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. And is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man. This also means that all of those stories you hear about a female teacher raping their underage students, according to the official government rape statistics, are not rape. BUT [if being made to penetrate someone was counted as rape—and why shouldn’t it be?—then the headlines could have focused on a truly sensational CDC finding: that women rape men as often as men rape women.](https://archive.is/jZ85Y#selection-1073.16-1073.217) When you actually do the work to include male victims. The idea of "patriarchy" and male monstrosity towards women evaporates. So why is it that the idea still endures? Well aside from the notion that feminist academics are building their entire careers on the backs of these beliefs and as such have a vested interest in continuing to propagate them. there's *** **Innate human biases that feminist advocacy weaponizes.** Feminist advocacy also weaponizes a number of innate and studied human biases that subconsciously push us to promote women's protection and their issues over men. Human beings are a gynocentric species – this means that we prioritize the needs and wellbeing of women over men. This is an evolved instinct that came about as a result of women being the limiting factor in reproduction – ie. women have a much lower ceiling on how many offspring they can physically produce – and in small communities that are subsisting this makes them highly important because they potentially hold the key to whether or not the collective will survive at all. This is why we traditionally send only men to war, this is why we have the “women and children first” Birkenhead Drill, this is why people are more likely to put themselves at risk to save a woman in danger than a man – and it’s why we have feminism. Feminism has taken our gynocentrism and weaponized it. And here are some studies to reaffirm that. * [Men lack an in-group bias based on gender](https://archive.vn/AHfJo) * [Men are more willing to sacrifice men than women](https://archive.ph/kf6f2) * [Men and women have a negative reaction to studies that show sex differences favouring men. But positive reaction for the opposite.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334751470_Reactions_to_Male-Favouring_vs_Female-Favouring_Sex_Differences_A_Preregistered_Experiment_and_Southeast_Asian_Replication) * [Stereotypes have changed over time and now more people think women are superior to men than the other way around.](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf) * [Men are more likely to be altruistic to women than to men.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020583425623) * [People are particularly concerned when men are violent to women.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19746441/) * [People are less concerned about male suffering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597820303630) * [Male and female adolescents feel more empathy for female peers.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/) * [People are more supportive of women in male-dominated professions than vice versa.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103118304633) * [People who classify groups as oppressed and privileged cannot make unbiased judgements about privileged groups even when they think they should.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325033477_Equalitarianism_A_Source_of_Liberal_Bias) * [People underestimate men's support for women.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112) * [Male victims of sexual coercion against men is not taken as seriously as against women](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552600.2016.1159343) * [Male sexual harassment victims are viewed as suffering less than female victims.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666518220300061?via%3Dihub) * [People don't like affirmative action but especially for men.](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/asap.12236?campaign=wolearlyview) * [Female chatbots are seen as more human than male ones](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.21480) * [Male teachers who have sexual relations with students judged more harshly than female ones.](https://www.academia.edu/5855265/The_Reverse_Double_Standard_in_Perceptions_of_Student_Teacher_Sexual_Relationships_The_Role_of_Gender_Initiation_and_Power) * [Both men and women are against double standards that favour men, but support some double standards that favour women.](https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/bitstream/handle/1993/20367/Fortune_Double_standards.pdf?sequence=1) *** **Finally. To address the "no true feminist" argument.** As feminists, many feminists harm others because of their feminism. In fact, the worldview and belief system that drives the most powerful and influential members of the feminist movement is a worldview and a belief system that thrives on pedestalizing women as a group and demonizing men as a group. Your support for the harm they do derives simply from you describing yourself as feminist and therefore projecting an impression of unity of purpose with them. There is no way for a lawmaker or public policy maker to know that you, as an individual feminist, disagree with a specific change demanded by a feminist group or organization. Because you call yourself the same thing they do, the unity of purpose is implicit. Your voice is added, with that of every other feminist, in support of what those people, speaking from their intellectual authority as feminists, wish to enact or change. That lawmaker or policy maker is not interested in getting to know every feminist as an individual. Even if he/she was, they wouldn't have the time to do so. There is very little of what I would call "policing the movement" coming from within feminism itself. NOW and other groups get up to some seriously fucked up shit, with very little criticism directed their way from other feminists. That silence, combined with your entirely voluntary labeling of yourself as a feminist means that you, in effect, are supporting them in their efforts to, say, erode father's rights even more, or to block the establishment of domestic violence shelters for men, or whatever bigotry they're up to this week. While you may adamantly oppose them in these efforts, within the privacy of your own thoughts, or within the context of who you are as an individual speaking to other individuals, you are still, in a very practical sense, supporting them. Unless you are there in the room with them saying, "Wait an effing minute! I don't agree with these people! This is wrongheaded and harmful!" it is only natural for lawmakers and policy makers to assume that the feminists in front of them who are speaking as feminists are also speaking for you. And although it is your luxury to define what feminism means to you, it is the most active, powerful and visible members of feminism that get to define what feminism means to the rest of the world. You can't revoke their membership (it's a self-applied label), and they hold the political reins of your movement. There is no way for you to kick them out. The only way to unequivocally dissociate yourself and your beliefs from them and their beliefs (and the harm they do) is by calling yourself something different.
t6y8fy	neutral	I don't know if I did the right thing.: So..... I was talking to someone who I fell head over heels for and someone who I had a major crush on in middle school. Years passed and eventually I became single. We started talking and things were great. We had good sex and good chemistry overall. Then out of no where, he ghosts me. I was confused and already being broken, the little strength that I had in me, was crushed. At first, I thought he was just occupied with work and he was going to get back to me. But he never did.\n\nAfter that ended, I have accomplished so much ...I would've never thought I would get this far. I still have so much to work on myself, but I am proud of what I have done throughout these times.\n\nToday as I was getting ready to go out, I hear someone knocking on my door. I look into the camera and I see a man. This man looked like he was about 40 years old, and he did not seem recognizable. At first I thought it was one of my dad coworkers trying to contact him, so I knock on my uncle room to see if he can talk to him instead. But he didn't hear me. So I look at the camera once more to see if this man was still there and...I look closer and my blood starts boiling. This is someone who is my exact age (I'm in my mid 20's)  and looked completely deteriorated. It was the same person who ghosted me.....two years later. As soon as I open the door, he immediately starts apologizing to me. I looked at him confused and said \"Okay?\"  and slammed the door at him. He starts walking to his car with a walk of shame and starts to cry in his car.  I immediately notify my whole family and they will be keeping an eye out incase he returns.\n\nI feel like I should've never opened the door because at that very moment all  I felt was rage. But a part of me also feels that I finally stood up for myself and didn't give in. I don't know.

orblba	hostile sexism	FDS logic: \"We can be picky as we want, even if it means we spend all of our life alone, but GOD FORBID an average looking guy wants to date a pretty girl\"!!: They list insane list of preferences that don't even make sense and no one really has all those traits. They say it's totally ok and justified for them to be as picky as they need because they don't even NEED to be in a relationship and wouldn't mind if they don't find someone like that and end up alone. But they talk about how average looking guys shouldn't have even basic preferences. They are so delusional, they don't even see that it isn't really about what is realistic and \"fair\", but it's only about them winning at everything in life and men getting nothing. It's all just about their unrealistic love for themselves and feeling like they are entitled to everything and about their hatred for men because Jason from high school chose the big boobed Stacy instead of them.

Internalized racism here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to understand the cognitive dissonance that many men, similar to Shake, get into marriages with women from their own culture that they don\u2019t even sexually desire! In my case, my ex proclaimed he would first of all, never want an arranged marriage and second of all, not get married to a woman from his own culture (and he especially did not like \u201clight skinned\u201d women from his ancestral heritage.) I do know he liked petite women and he was always going on about how hot I was (and i don\u2019t doubt that, the physical chemistry was there.) I genuinely believed he did not want an arranged marriage; at his own wedding, he was Shake to the NEXT LEVEL, totally not looking at his new wife, averting eye contact, not initiating nor reciprocating physical contact such as embraces, and scowling like McKayla Maroney.   \n\n\nHow do these men live with the cognitive dissonance? Do they ever \u201cgrow to love\u201d what they aren\u2019t attracted to?

t9768m	institutional sexism	When men in professional settings treat you like sh*t when you don't wear makeup. I'm sorry, was this supposed to be a date?!: I've experienced BS like this before in academic, workplace, and even general settings. Obviously the dating realm speaks for itself.\n\nToday I had a seminar, and I only put on some mascara and under-eye concealer. I noticed that whenever I spoke, the professor would brush me off, interrupt me, or ignore what I said only to look to someone else for an answer. An answer that I had already correctly provided.   \nAt one point, this man calls on me out of the blue, and my thoughts weren't very collected. I spoke a bit before apologizing for rambling, which was a huge mistake on my part. He flat out said \"ugh\" and looked away. \n\nI've always worn makeup to this class before this, and ironically, he's always been very encouraging, listens closely, and uses my points to open new discussions.   \nWhile I was essentially being ignored in a class that **I'm paying for**, I noticed that he focused on the women who were wearing makeup. When I saw that, it just confirmed my whole makeup theory in this instance.\n\nSo it got me thinking about everyday interactions. I generally get ignored and overlooked if I'm not wearing makeup. The joke is, I only use makeup to enhance my natural features - it's not like I showed up looking like a completely different, hideous person. And even if I did, I'm here to learn something, not be some sort of eye candy for some creep that's not much older than me.\n\nIt's crazy how much weight shitty people place on appearance in LITERAL professional/academic settings, to the extent where anything you say is largely discredited. Tear the whole system down.

t34wd4	neutral	Puberphonia and how I believe it may affect male psychological help: Hey, guys, I know that men's rights already is such a big subject, and that I may be a little egotistic to try to talk about such a problem that affects such a small quantity of men throughout the world; but since I suffer from this condition, I believe that I should do my best to talk about it to other people, since we are simply considered invisible or just treated as someone with a funny voice.\n For those who do not know, Puberphonia is a rare condition that affects 1/100000 men, it's also called Mutational Falsetto, since our voice gets locked into the falsetto range. In other words, we are basically men who didn't get their adult male voice after puberty. \n One thing that I've perceived is that many people believe this problem isn't in any way serious, and that we can just live with it without any problem; however, these people usually ignore the social and psychological implications of this condition, especially in the case of people who suffer from persistent Puberphonia, which cannot be treated just with Speech Therapy, and one needs to submit himself to an expensive surgery so he can have a normal voice. Our relationship with the world, especially nowadays with this gender craziness we're living through, is quite rough, but even before it, there was extreme pressure for men with this condition to become forcedly gay by many LGBTs through bullying and beatings. I myself have suffered several attacks from gay bullies during High School and before for simply saying no to entering in a relationship with them (while making sure to say that I was straight); but this also happens with women who believe they can blackmail you into doing things you're not comfortable to do in exchange for not having fabricated stories about you to everyone (this was my experience and also one many other guys with this condition have told me they had to deal with). In my case, Puberphonia was also the reason why I wasn't able to marry, since her family believed that I was a gay guy trying to use their daughter to look straight. The bullying and this extreme pressure to prove myself was so big that I ended up carrying on and not caring anymore about anything people would say, but, since I'm a teacher, it's obvious that this isn't going to stop anytime soon.\n Differently from what many people think, Puberphonia is not a positive trait for singing. A lot of guys I talked with ended up saying that they would have loved to have this condition to sing, when, in reality, I know too well they wouldn't like to have it. Since my voice is locked into the falsetto range, my actual voice range is way smaller than the one common men have. As a linguist, I cannot even dare to learn any tonal language (such as Mandarin) due to the relatively small control I have on the tone of my voice (before Speech Therapy, I couldn't even control it's intonation very well, to the point it was all over the place) and I have to live with chronic neck and throat pain due to the fact my neck muscles are always stressed, having to speak the fewer as possible to not strain my vocal chords and having a relatively large silent time in which I cannot talk for a long period of time (even if I want to); for this reason, I way better at expressing myself through writing than by talking with people, and it's also the reason why I'm thinking about pursuing a career in Sign Languages.\n To be honest, I was worried about posting this here, since I thought that, maybe, it wasn't the place to put it, especially since it affects such a small number of men. But I have been talking to many guys throughout the world who also suffer from this condition, and I would just want more people to know about this and how it can affect someone negatively in both psychological and sociological realms. Luckily, most can treat Puberphonia quite easily with Speech Therapy, but others who have the persistent kind cannot.\n The causes of Puberphonia aren't thoroughly known as of now, in most of the cases there's a lack of developmental issues with the vocal chords, and my case is like that, the doctors saw no issue with my vocal chords (they developed normally as the ones from any common guy), however the problem still persists. We now that some cases can be psychogenic, while other cases may have many different possible causes. \n I hope that this post has been useful for you to learn about this condition and how the life of men who suffer from it may be like. I hope that this post may also be enough for you guys to at least also try to talk with people about this issue if you find a guy who suffers from this condition. I know that many guys do not even know what's wrong with them; and that some go as far as believing it was all in their imagination (I sure did think my problem was only something from my imagination for a long time). Thank you for reading.

She said it's no big deal and that she'd make me work with that woman so I'd \"get used to her personality.\" I talked with me family about how the interview went and my grandmother said I need to take it as a compliment, not harassment. I ask her what if it was a man whistling to a woman in professional attire, she agreed it would be harassment. But doubled down on me needing to be flattered, not upset over being catcalled.

tb58u6	neutral	Confused about our relationship - DESPERATE for help:   \n\nHello dear ladies,\n\nI have been feeling very unhappy in my relationship for a few weeks now and need advice. The text may get a little lengthy, I ask for your understanding. Also, English is not my first language, so I apologize for any grammar mistakes in advance.\n\nIn March 2021 I (21) met a 20-year-old guy on an online platform called 7cups. It\u2019s an app/website where you can anonymously talk to strangers to make friend or vent to. Mentally I was doing very bad and needed someone to talk to. At that time, I had no real friend to vent to and I wanted an unbiased opinion to my situation back then. The app randomly matched me with him, and we got along very well. He was fun, caring, sweet, etc. \n\nIn the beginning I didn\u2019t think much of it but over time we build a strong bond. He lived in Serbia and was about to enter his 3rd semester of IT studies. I am soon to start my 5th semester in economics in Uni.\n\nAfter a few months we got into a relationship. It went great, we facetimed every single day for hours and always made time for each other. Falling asleep without him on the phone soon became impossible. As the time passed, we started having fights.\n\n**Here are a few examples:**\n\n\\- I send him a self-made box filled with gifts, candy, books, paintings, stuffed animal, a personal letter etc. on his birthday. it arrives a day later because of the shipping company, but I still sent it out 1,5 weeks early (shipping from Germany to Serbia takes around a week max) -&gt; he orders me small gifts from Amazon that he knew I always wished for, but he ordered them too late, so they arrived like 2 weeks later. He also sent a letter but like 1 month later because he \u201cdidn\u2019t think of it, the time passed so fast that he forgot\u201d -&gt; I\u2019m upset because I think he put too little effort into it\n\n\\- in the beginning stage of our relationship, he asked me multiple times to send him an explicit picture of me because he was so much in the mood. when he realized I got pissed off, he immediately apologized and called himself a man pig for it\n\n\\- he quit Uni and wanted to move to Germany to start working there and start a new life (people in Serbia live under poor conditions and the Uni fees were unaffordable for him). When I told him to start learning German, he refused and said it\u2019s unneeded because the progress won\u2019t be as far as if he starts learning it Germany. My statement that a small step is still a step, he did not take seriously. after a while he started doing small lessons on Duolingo (which show no effect until now).\n\n\\- him putting little effort in job search, only after me attacking him countless times, he starts searching and applying.\n\n\\- it happened often that I felt very insecure while he was out clubbing with his friends, and I started arguments even though he didn\u2019t do anything. I ruined his time while he was out with his friends, but I just hated the feeling of not knowing who he\u2019s talking to and what he is doing\n\n\\- yesterday we are arguing, I hang up because he raises his voice at me, he gets angry that I hang up, we continue to discuss in the chat, his friends call him, he leaves me waiting and crying for an hour -&gt; his excuse: the time passed so fast with his friends he didn\u2019t notice. my opinion: he should have postponed the call because he was in the middle of an argument with his gf and its not nice to leave her alone sad\n\n\\- in the few times that we met, he never brought me flowers or just something small. I told him about it and he said he \u201cplanned\u201d to get some but didn\u2019t because he intended to buy them at my station (buying them earlier would make them break) but he had no time since I was already waiting for him at the station\n\nLong story short, 3 weeks ago he moved to Germany with 8k in savings. To my city, half an hour away from me. He rented a shared apartment but has no job yet. I told him to not pick the most expensive city, especially because he has a limited amount of money and no job. Also, it put an incredible amount of pressure on me that he moved so close. (Important to mention is, that he already has EU papers, so he\u2019s not doing all that just for having them, both of us talk in fluent English with each other)\n\nSo, during that entire contact for almost a year, we have never met in person. On our first meet we got along well, with the exception that he grabbed my face and kissed me without asking first. It was my and his first kiss so it would have meant a lot for me if he asked first, especially because I know I would have refused because I was not ready for it. I confronted him about it and his response was that me saying \u201cI love you too\u201d was the permission for him to kiss me and also, he did not want to ruin the romance by asking. I didn\u2019t move and didn\u2019t kiss him back because I was frozen.\n\nWe met up three times in total, we went to the mall and to Ikea together. It was nice, we hold hands, we kiss, but I just have this feeling that something is off. My Greek parents are very strict, and they only want me to date inside my nationality. For now, they want me to focus on my studies and on myself. Also, in their opinion I need someone who is older and experienced since I am mature in their opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this feeling is only there because I\u2019m doing something \u201cforbidden\u201d (my whole life I have always listened to my parents, I believe they just want what\u2019s best for me) or because I\u2019m not ready for this relationship. He always tells me how much he loves me but I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nWhen we went to Ikea, he reminded me of my promise that I will do my best in this relationship. He wants me to slowly bring him and my family closer to each other. I said that\u2019s not possible in the near future because my parents don\u2019t react well to me seeing him and to be honest, after yesterdays fight where he just left me alone crying I\u2019m not sure if I want to introduce such a person to my parents. \n\nA person that doesn\u2019t make me 100% happy and where I am questioning my love for him the whole time.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I really need help on this situation. Tomorrow we are meeting up to talk and I don\u2019t know with what mindset to approach the situation. He \u201cannounced\u201d that he\u2019s gonna bring flowers and chocolate, but I absolutely hate this, I told him I don\u2019t want them because you don\u2019t announce a gift, you just give it. I don\u2019t know if me being annoyed is justified or I am spoiled and entitled. \n\nI am eternally grateful for any advice and again, apologize if my text was hard to read, I can\u2019t really sort my thoughts at the moment.
tc42n2	benevolent sexism	Red flag - A man who likes to pit women against other women.: \u201cI wish more women wore their natural hair like you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why so many women wear makeup, it looks so unattractive, and I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t wear any.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really like how much you maintain your figure and how you haven\u2019t let yourself go like all these other mothers who do so after they have even just one child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t nag or give us trouble when we\u2019re just having fun or joking around, I wish more women would just chill - it\u2019s all in good fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour food is delicious. So many women nowadays don\u2019t even cook, and then they wonder how they\u2019re going to be able to keep a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you understand the importance of sex in a relationship, my past ex girlfriends would never give me sex consistently. So of course I cheated.\u201d\n\nHave you heard any of these phrases or something similar? Have you noticed the increasing trend of men who like to bitch and whine about what women choose to do with their own bodies, their hands, their vaginas, their money and just their own lives? \n\nIf you don\u2019t already know what they\u2019re trying to do, I\u2019ll tell you. They are trying to incite female competition and envy. By encouraging a woman to join them in talking negative about other women, this is how they influence internalized misogyny and increase women\u2019s competition for male validation.\n\nBy giving you \u201ccompliments\u201d within what is basically a whiny bitchfest sandwich, it makes an unsuspecting woman feel \u201cspecial\u201d, like a one of a kind woman that\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d than all these other women who seemingly don\u2019t have the same kind of male approval that she does. You start to judge other women for their choices because that male validation is like a illicit drug. However just like most illicit drugs, once you partake, it will eventually come back to bite you in the ass.\n\nEspecially because now you\u2019re seeking the approval of a low value man. One who desperately tries to build his value by positioning himself as someone who women should modify their behavior and appearance, in order to win his approval. It\u2019s a sleight of hand, to hide his own insecurities, inadequacies and failures at becoming a man that women want. He cannot compete with other men, so he slinks among women, like a slimy reptile, to whisper nonsense that\u2019s ultimately for his own selfish gain, and for the gain of other low value men like him. Men do not like to see women coming together to form strategy or women refusing to compete with or speak negatively about other women, because then it means that they aren\u2019t worth enough to be fought over. This tips the scales away from them, and positions them as having to fight over women and to win women\u2019s approval.\n\nIt is why it\u2019s so important to nip this kind of behavior in the bud. A simple phrase like, \u201cThank you, but I think her hair/makeup/body/opinion/preferred hobbies/choices are beautiful. I like mine because it\u2019s beautiful, and so is hers.\u201d A very effective tool to diminish his confidence with this tactic, make him feel ashamed of his judgmental behavior in your presence, while positioning yourself as someone who does not need to bring other women down to feel beautiful. Because the ultimate source of your beauty and your confidence is internal. Given that men who say these negative things about other women in your presence will say negative things about you in your absence, he would know that since your source of confidence is not external, his opinion of you is irrelevant.\n\nFeel free to dump/ghost/discard/abandon/next him. Because that flag isn\u2019t just red, it\u2019s crimson.

tainv2	hostile sexism	I think getting women equal power was a mistake. But that's government should be a country run by men who allow women to have equal rights: You think about all the damage women do with uncontested accusations and false accusations. Taking advantage of their privileges.. it makes things worse for everyone\n\nBut that doesn't mean I want them give me some Serbian. Or not to have freedom of choice.. Or the way I completely crossed can't. But then and particularly white men are the only group in the history of the world to voluntarily give up their own privilege. No other group can say that.\n\nAnd while I completely agree that in olden times men took advantage and white man took advantage and depressed other groups I think they evolved Beyond then. For the most part. I think the best form of government would be white man in charge with all the power to delegate what happened but they allow everyone else to also have equality and freedom. But not the power. Everyone gets freedom and equality. But only the men get the power. Because they're the only ones who have proven proven to know how to be trustworthy\n\nInvestigate every claim of sexual assault. But never believe a single woman. If they're telling the truth and it will be proven through investigation. They won't need you to believe because it would be prove it. Create structures to help protect women from being harassed but don't give them extra privileges. And don't take away protections from men to do it\n\nA woman who feels uncomfortable around a man shouldn't be allowed to ruin his life over it. If she has a problem with someone she can leave just like if you have a problem with anybody it's on you to leave the area. Not them.. If a woman feels that she was harassed he has to prove it. Just like you have to prove any other crime. You don't get to say that you feel like you were robbed and therefore your annoying neighbor should be rested. You don't get to make false accusation somebody stabbed you. And have them go to jail even if you don't have a single stab wound..\n\nWomen have been proven to be untrustworthy. Too untrustworthy to Simply take their word for something and without evidence. That's because women truly are equal to men. And everybody would lie if it benefits them. There's no group that wouldn't lie. Every political racial and gender demographic has members who would lie for their own benefit. With that said that's the options. That's the solution. Have the power with the people who are trustworthy. White men. And they can delegate equal privileges to everyone else. For the most part nobody's life will change. Women would still be paid the same. Black people would still be allowed in every restaurant and it would be illegal to discriminate against them. They also wouldn't be able to abuse that power on their own behalf.\n\n\nGiving women equal power along with equal rights was a mistake

te4dzi	neutral	How do you overcome an allergy to being told what to do?: I'm not a crazy rebel or something. I like following most rules, love learning, improving, being corrected (when it's pragmatic), and I often prioritize the big picture over myself.\n\nYet there are a few scenarios (or sometimes specific people) where I get annoyed, or push back, or get entirely turned off from a person/activity if they tell me what to do, or how.\n\nI assumed (maybe incorrectly?) that this was an immature trait. Like the cliche kid telling the parent DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO IDOWHATIWANT. I thought with age everyone completely grows out of this, and stops caring being told what to do by anyone. Like the cliche yes-man husband. But it hasn't. Instead it feels oddly ingrained
tbgo4g	hostile sexism	Facial Attractiveness Matters A Lot More Than Women Say It Does: I think it is important to be realistic with regards to dating women and establish the situation we are dealing with before we proceed with a strategy.\n\nAttractiveness mainly has to do with facial bone structure and has very little to do with muscle on somebody's body. Only minor improvements can be made to somebody's face by having overall low body fat, and doing years of facial exercises to improve maxilla protrusion, like mewing, which has only a theoretical effectiveness in adults. \n\nThe only major improvement can come from bi-maxillary surgery which is both expensive, rare, and risky. Facial attractiveness from good bone structure is so important that in some cases I have even seen fat men be considered attractive and allowed them to get with women, because they had a \"good\" face underneath that fat and were \"forgiven\" for being fat. \n\nIf you intended to get surgery this would be the pain that you would have to go through in order to get women to be willing to be with you. And even then, you are modifying a fully grown adult face rather than simply having a natural, well structured face from youth.\n\nThis is of course very disheartening for somebody who has put years of work into improving their bodies, their wallet, their humor or any other quality. Women are hypergamous and are willing to share a single good looking man. When you\u2019re a good looking man, you can do no wrong in the eyes of your typically shallow, hypergamous female. \n\nSo why do we even want them?\n\nWell the answer is obvious. In a society in which women had very little rights, were dependent upon men for resources and security, and were less connected to other women prior to having mobile phones and internet - they were:\n\n\\-Cute\n\n\\-Willing to provide their feminine resources to a man like cooking, cleaning, giving attention, caring etc.\n\n\\-And of course, they could bear children and take care of them\n\nFor that last reason, if we didn't need women to reproduce, we could afford to ignore them a lot more than we do now. But without women we cannot have kids, which is the biggest insult to a decent, intelligent, but unattractive man.\n\nI think when you are talking about a \"strategy\" for dating women, it is important to note how the current situation of today compares to that of the past. We are at a disadvantage because women can and will find the nearest \"acceptably\" attractive man on apps like Tinder, and are able to communicate to that person DIRECTLY from wherever they are. Its like a good looking guy who hangs out at the bar and steals women, except now he is omnipresent due to technology, and this has all happened in just a few short years.\n\nAnd in the past few years Women have settled into this lifestyle. We are already getting a new generation of connected Zoomer women who are being raised to promote themselves via TikTok at very early ages.\n\nOlder millennial women enjoy the power as well. When they reach their 30s and 40s they won't even stop then. They will go after young college guys for that one last experience of \"feeling hot\".\n\nIt is frustrating to know this is the disadvantage we have and this is the situation we are in, but if you guys want to talk about strategy, this is where we should begin.

tduxg3	neutral	Crimson Pill vs Black Pill: Top 5 Reasons looks matter very little (Part 1): **If you like this post follow me on** [r/Crimsonpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crimsonpill/)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI   wanted to contribute my thoughts on the looks debate. I will add much   more depth in future articles. However, I wanted to make my stance   clear. I believe looks matter very little. I have seen how average   looking guys can get laid with only game. While good looking guys get   nothing. I would say \"looks\" are more like your \"opener\" for most   chicks, they'll say, \"Oh he's alright.\" and it will be the opportunity   to approach. I would say that you can get the same result by using,   \"Perfume.\"\n\n**1-Game matters 80%**\n\nIt   is your game and confidence that matters the most. You can be the most   good looking guy and act low value and most chicks will get  immediately  turn off. I was hanging out with a male model and he would  stand there  and do nothing. Sooner or later the girls got bored of him  and left.\n\n**2-Looks are only 10-20% of the equation**\n\nWhy   would you spend so much time obsessing over something that's more like   the \"icing on the cake.\" Looks might give you a bit of an edge at the   beginning of the interaction, however, for the most its your game that   will determine how the interaction goes. If your game is tight you will   be able to move the interaction forward. For instance, once you are on   an instant date most chicks are not going to care about your looks.\n\n**3-Most chicks are more interested in your confidence  and skill**\n\nMost   chicks are going to care if you approach them and if you can move the   interaction forward. Looks won't do any of that to you. How are your   looks going to help you when you need to strategize how to move the   interaction forward. Or how are looks going to help you when you have to\n\n**4-Good looking guys get more attention from other guys who want to be like them than from girls**\n\nThis   is both funny and ironic. However, most of the guys who become  obsessed  with the gym as well as maximize their looks soon realize  this. These  guys end up getting more attention from other guys who want  to look like  them. I've seen it when I was hanging out with my  personal trainer.  Guys would come up to him to compliment his looks and  wanted advice on  how to get jacked. Meanwhile, most girls would see  him as a co-worker  and treat him like everyone else.\n\n**5-The guys who obsess over looks do it as a excuse to not approach**\n\nI   have met a few guys who believe in the blackpill as well as guys who   were obsessed about looks. The main pattern with all of them is that   they all believe that there's nothing to be done and it's \"hopeless.\

t3v2yx	neutral	Don't tell him what red flags are a deal breaker for you: My friend keeps ending up in horrible relationships with slippery little creeps, so I would like to share my observations of where I think she's giving them an advantage over her. \n\nThere is a difference between setting boundaries and teaching him how to toe the line. For example, telling him \"If my best friend doesn't like you I'm out\" or \"If your idea of a compliment is to put down other women that's a big red flag for me\" is going to result in him performing an inauthentic version of himself to circumvent those safeguards. If he knows exactly what things set off alarm bells for you to leave his ass, he'll just innovate a way around your security system. Set boundaries, but don't go into details. \n\nEven months into a relationship, telling him where previous exes lost your trust and what their red flags were will lead to him avoiding those specific activities he otherwise would have done (which you would have easily recognized). This does not mean he will be a better partner for you, he will just be more original at being a bad partner. If you've got a bad partner, it saves you so much time if his red flags are unoriginal/something you've dealt with before.

okg6rl	hostile sexism	How to avoid fds chicks: This post isn\u2019t meant to bash women who partake in fds because people should be free to do whatever they want and date whoever they want, based on whatever criteria they want. That being said if you\u2019re looking to avoid fd strategists because you don\u2019t subscribe to the same values, here are the best ways to do it.\n\n\n1. Ask them to plan a date. \n\nThis only works if you take them on a nice date first. Very few women will put the effort in to plan a date if they think you\u2019re not worth it. So take them somewhere nice and impress them but on the next date ask them to plan it. FDS women will say no.\n\n\n2. Mention hanging out with a friend that\u2019s a girl.\n\nNothing crazy, just say something like, my good friend Jane from high school is in town and wants to grab lunch. This sets up healthy boundaries and expectations of you. It\u2019s healthy to have friends that are girls. An FDS will object or get jealous. \n\n\n3. Take her on a hike.\n\nAn FDS will not like the idea of going on a hike. For one you\u2019re not spending any money. Two it\u2019s not exactly a typical date. Instead of you both looking nice you\u2019ll likely be in a t shirt and shorts and working up a sweat. \n\n\n4. Don\u2019t disclose any info on how much you might make in the first couple of dates.\n\nIf you\u2019re a doctor, say you\u2019re in healthcare. If you\u2019re an accountant, say you help people with their taxes. You get the gist. If she really cares about who you are as a person she will be willing to go on multiple dates before knowing the details of that.\n\n5. Be honest about casual sex.\nAs men we tend to keep our hookups hush so that we don\u2019t make women think we\u2019re fuckboys. This is the wrong move, especially when you first start dating. Now don\u2019t bring it up on your own either. That just comes off as arrogant. But if she asks be honest. You\u2019re not exclusive yet and so you don\u2019t owe her anything. You\u2019re also being upfront about your expectations. If she\u2019s not into casual sex she\u2019ll likely avoid another date.

You people just slut shame women for wearing clothes that shows there skin or cleavage. You guys are the reason why feminism exist and demonize us. Maybe stop making jokes about wishing that it was the 50s-80s about husbands hitting their wives for burning dinner. If you disagree with my post then YOU are the reason for feminism to exist and why they’re so against you.

t7vkbu	hostile sexism	No one cares! Let's get over it.: Feel free to dislike my opinion)\nYes, you heard it right. You probably knew this beforehand. So why don't we just get over it? I've been deep down the rabbit hole of MGTOW, and other movements regarding liberation of men. We as men, have always been like this, in history if you go back, we never had \"rights\". I certainly believe, that in this world only the strongest survive. To always rant and complain about how unfair life is, how unfair the relationship game is, how women \"use\" beta for financial gain after years of riding the cock carousel, is not a good thing. It's represents weakness, not of the body, but of the mind. I know some people here who genuinely help distressed men, men who're possibly dealing with terrible things. But 90% are just complaining, wanting \"equality\". This is weakness. Why do feminists ask for rights? Because they were weak. We as men should not follow their path, instead follow the path of self-mastery. Our bodies are living war machines. Instead of wasting time on reddit, ranting about \"rights\", you should invest the time to master self. Stop watching po*n, by doing that, not only you deviate far away from your masculine core, but also you let women grab your leash and control you. By doing that you hand them this power. Let's be real here, no one would possibly care even if you die or destroy your life, by indulging in immoral, mind weakening activities. Most men are just obessed with women, just look at channels like \"Fresh and Fit\" and others. They will hurt your self-esteem for keeping women on the pedestal, but just look at their channel, 1000 vids on them, and yes! it's all about women! At this point I feel it's worthless. We as men should retain our lost masculinity and achieve physical excellence. Love you, uummaaah\ud83d\udc95.

oxygog	neutral	Health Issues are a no-go: Unpopular opinion:\nYou should avoid dating anyone with health issues.\n\u00a0\nThis goes for both mental and physical health. My premise is that the majority of the dating pool is young-ish. At this point most people don't give too much consideration as to what your life is going to be like when you live with someone that has a major health issue. Of course I see the how people see this as a selfish and inconsiderate stand. But I don't see it any different than people that don't date someone with children, or that are short, or are overweight. Does this mean that we would end up with a world of single people with disabilities? No. There's always someone for someone else. But my point in saying this is that you should try to AVOID someone with health issues. Maybe she's got IBS, but she also has a Master's in Biology. Well, maybe we'll deal with her IBS because she seems like a high value person. But if her mom and her grandma died of breast cancer... Well, maybe I'll be looking somewhere else. Because even if she doesn't have issues now (or ever) our kids might not be so fortunate. Apply this same stance to any number of mental issues. If someone has any kind of mental problem, just ask yourself if you would like to have your kid have the same issue.\n\u00a0\nAnd if you are someone that has a health issue, try to work on it as much as possible. Be upfront about your issue as soon as practical when you start dating.\n\u00a0\nSometimes we can\u2019t help who we fall in love with, but if possible, I would add this to my list of things-to-consider when we are going through the interview process called dating.

sj1nnz	interpersonal sexism	Where do some women get this idea that the men they date are doing “the bare minimum”?: Is it not the men who usually drive, pay for the dates, and try to be chivalrous? I feel like most of the time the only thing the woman gives up is her time. In some ways it’s not even a sacrifice because dates usually involve fun activities or delicious food. (again usually paid for by the man) the thing is I was supposed to go on a date with a girl on a dating app and then she canceled on me last minute because her parents surprised her. I figured it was reasonable so we rescheduled for today. Yesterday before the date I reminded her about our date today. She said “yeah, but can we just meet there instead of have you pick me up?” I figured it was no big deal so I agreed. Then she asked “can we make it a double date too?” I felt a little annoyed cause the date is in a public place and I wasn’t going to pick her up. We’d never be alone together. But I tried to be patient and agreed. I asked “who would be the other couple?” We ended up agreeing to set up a blind date with two of our friends to be the double. I called one of my best friends and felt really bad and hoped that he had an open schedule. Luckily he did. I let her know that I get why she is a little nervous cause it’s a dating app and some men are nasty and horrible. Today she texted me to tell me that she was sick. This was in total the 5th canceled date I’ve had this week. So I told her that Im not interested in taking her out now, because I usually give girls 1 chance if they cancel a date. I was just angry cause I even got a friend for the double. She then continued to write a mean and sarcastic text thanking me for doing “the bare minimum”! How was that the bare minimum??? I texted her a day before to remind her. I planned the date. I had plans to pay for it all. I even put up with her nonsense requests cause she was paranoid and found another guy to make the date safer. I’ve never with any girl and never planned on doing anything bad to her. Where is this bare minimum she is talking about? 😂 where is the gratitude for the free food and date?

tb3wbc	interpersonal sexism	How can you tell if \"My ex was controlling, abusive, crazy...\" etc is the truth from a guy?: We hear it from men who talk bad about their exes. \"Women are crazy.\" \"My ex was so controlling and toxic.\" \"My last girlfriend was a psycho.\" \"My ex was abusive to me.\"\n\nA lot of women, including myself can attest to the fact that a lot of men manipulate the situation into making them look good... without acknowledging the fact that their abusive actions have made someone go nuts.\n\nBut I'm struggling with the other end of this. Let me explain. TW: abuse, suicidal thoughts (skip to TL;DR if you'd like) \n\nGrowing up I've seen nothing but abuse in my family with both genders being the abuser. No kidding, I have not seen ONE healthy relationship in my family.  My brothers now ex-wife has emotionally and mentally abused me, my brother and my mother ever since she entered the family. My brother for most part is a HVM... except for the part where he is a doormat and lets people walk over his kindness and generosity, and as a result he never stood up against her when his little sister and mom became victims as well (mainly out of fear of her) During their marriage she:\n\n\u2022 try to ruin my reputation at 10 years old by telling my south asian family that I'm gonna grow up to be a whore and pregnant at 16. Shamed ME for my MOM buying me underwear that said \"I \u2764 you\" on the back, saying I was wearing it for boys. \n\n\u2022 brainwashed my mother and brother into sending me to their home country (Bangladesh) for a year because I was apparently too \"westernized\" and not cultured enough (I was very much cultured at that age despite being born in a western country). I thought I was going there for 2 weeks... little did I know this was their plan to also try and get me MARRIED over there while I was a child. (Didnt end up working because I exaggerated my brattiness to an extreme until they got a plane ticket back to MY home country)\n\n\u2022Grounded me for using the printer. Told my family I dont deserve my stuff and that I was too spoiled. Weaponized her sons (my nephews) into destroying my stuff and things important to me. When I called her out on it at 17- she shunned me from my nephews and they stopped speaking for me for over 5 years. Emailed all my family members playing victim... just because I stated a boundary for my nephews not to steal my stuff. I became suicidal when she turned my entire family against me.\n\n\u2022 made me her therapist at 10. I would have to hear and calm her down from her jealous tyrants against my brother working late at the office. \n\u2022 She threw hot tea at my brother while he was driving. \n\u2022Made my mom sleep on the sofa whenever she would visit without any warning and make my mom babysit her child while she slept in my moms room. \n\nThe list goes on with this woman. \n\n- my half sisters physically and mentally abused my mom despite the fact that she took them in as her own and took them out of Bangladesh. One of my half sisters punched my male cousin (he tried to call 911 on her husband hurting her) and eventually he moved out because he didn't any association with her and their dynamic.\n\nI've also been in abusive female friendships where I was manipulated, controlled, Isolated, catfished for six months, clung onto and spam called 30+ times a day, and had them turn other friends against me until I transfered schools from heightened social anxiety. It's fucking crazy to me how horrible friendships I had growing up, I never caught a break.\n\nRecently I hear news of my aunt choking on my uncles in his sleep and she isolated him from our family. My cousins confirmed she became abusive during the years we haven't spoken to them and asked us for help.\n\nThen I hear a story about my other cousin in Bangladesh who I used to think of as my role model... we found out she is pushed her dad (my other uncle) down the stairs out of anger and now hes concussed and has to pee through a catheter and he's in REALLY bad shape. No one in my family can visit him in the hospital because she is keeping his location a secret and threatens to hurt anyone that looks for him. \n\n\nTL;DR HERE: \nNow here is where I'm struggling: When I would hear guys say \"my ex girlfriend was clingy/crazy/psychotic\" I would remember my ex bestfriend and my ex sister-inlaw and think \"Gosh, I totally get it.\" Because i've seen the women in my family and friendships so UNHINGED that everytime I believed when men would say \"women are crazy.\" Because I can relate based on the women in my life.\n\nThat being said, this is not to paint women in bad light, but I do think toxic femininity is real af and hurts other women as much as it does men. It's more than just being a pick me chick. My ex boyfriend was also emotionally abusive - not to the extent that my family is... but enough to make me feel upset about wanting the BARE MINIMUM. I bet in his mind I was crazy for wanting him to go on dates and have phone calls instead of texting convos. \n\nThere's been a lot of guys who open up to me about their sufferings  (not the women hating ones, but actual abuse victims) most of them I believe... but I wonder if I'm being naive?\n\nSo this is my question: when a guy mentions his ex being abusive, crazy, controlling etc... how can I tell if they are telling the truth and faced similar circumstances like myself, brother, uncles and cousins vs a man who is actually the abusive one and manipulates the situation? I go back and forth between believing a man because I know based on this sub and other women that men do be out here abusive as fuck. Any vetting strategies and questions I could ask? Any else relate to this?

She kind of kidnapped them by just not performing custody exchange when scheduled. She played all the games many of you already heard. I'm not going to impress you. \n\nFast forward.... We had a hearing about parenting time. The referee said follow the rules and return to original parenting plan. We were going on vacation that day.

My 16 yo step daughter ran away to her grandparents home when her mother died. They instantly went for guardianship and DH granted it to save his other children because his daughter was acting out.\n\nThese grandparents hate him and he hates them. They filed for grandparenting time. They can fuck off. They were mean to my husband. Enabled her for years. They knew she was abusive but wouldn't believe it. \n\nI'd like to help compose a letter to grandparents saying go fuck yourself but in an eloquent way.

tb0sub	neutral	Why I don't think South Korea's new president is good for men.: I saw some men on this forum praising this new president and saying he will be good for the men in SK. And yes he was supported by a lot of young men in SK but here is why I don't think he will be ultimately good for men. Please note that this is just my opinion and even if you disagree, it's fine but be respectful.\n\n1) He wants to remove minimum wage. In SK, they have a male-provider culture, which means that men are seen as the ones to bring money in to the family even if the wife has a job. This could make it harder for men to support themselves and their families if they are paid below minimum wage.\n\n2) He wants to abolish 52 hour work week.  As a men's advocate, I know many men struggle from being overworked. Again, since it is men's job to provide in SK, many men could work even more hours, making them more stressed. He even said people should work 120 hours a week if they want. So what if a man is forced into working much longer hours for his family?\n\n3) He is a conservative. Now I'm not judging, but if he believes in traditional gender roles that means that he expects men to work, go to war and die for women. He is an anti-feminist, but that might just be that he believes in traditional gender roles.\n\nWhat do you think?
t19szl	neutral	\"Safe\" Men to Date Part 3: Jasmine and Gino (Spoilers): (Disclaimer: I realize 90 Day Fiance is a reality show and may be up to 100% scripted. This is simply an analysis of the behaviors presented on the show, for educational reasons). \n\n\nFollowing my last two posts about Jasmine and Gino, we observed some concerning, disrespectful behavior from Gino. In the latest Before the 90 days episode, Jasmine snatched Gino's hat (lol) and appeared drunk as she cursed him out.  A lot of people, including myself, were triggered by Gino acting like a \"kicked puppy\" all the time, like he is this \"wholesome,\" \"loyal,\" Mickey Mouse lonely guy, when this passive-aggression was lurking underneath. Even before these events happened he gave me the \"ick.\" \n\n\nBut, we need to strategize here to maximize female benefit and safety. Again, I am not condoning nursing a bottle of white wine alone, yelling at a man, and/or trying to strike him after his disrespect. Jasmine's feelings of outrage, betrayal, anger, and hurt are understandable, but for our protection legally/in terms of dignity, it is best not to react in such a way. \n\n\nWhile it was queenly of Jasmine to say she will be \"stronger\" for this experience, sadly things turned for the worse. \n\n\nYou would think this couple would be completely over after this betrayal, right? I mean sending someone's nudes without a permission, especially to an ex-sugar baby to make her jealous, is beyond depraved and non-salvagable IMO. Even Jasmine questions herself  and says she realized she loved who she imagined Gino to be, not actually Gino himself. \n\n\nSadly for Jasmine and the viewers cheering on her queen moments, she took Gino back. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It seemed anticlimactic, as Jasmine was tearing up in the interview saying she knows Gino really loves her. Meanwhile Gino seemed... flat? Monotone? Barely hugging her back when he almost lost her? I have seen men shut down to an (appropriate) emotional reaction like that, and offer a lukewarm comfort, but deep down he is thinking \"this bird is crazy.\" \n\n\nOf course, the season isn't over yet, but hopefully she eventually gets away from Gino. One thing we can take home as a lesson is you can be beautiful, intelligent, multilingual, etc but low self-esteem can take you to dark places. I wonder who or what happened in her life and told her she wasn't good enough for someone respectful, and who or what told her she needed to act controlling to \"get\" a man to act right. It's very dysfunctional. Maybe Jasmine has a high self-esteem but has experienced a lot of trauma thinking she has to \"put up\" with men acting like this. To me it looked like she had a \"fight\" turned to \"fawn\" reaction, because she wants so badly to be loved fully by a man. I hope it gets better for her. \n\n\n\nWhat else can we learn from this scenario? Has something similar to this happened to you?

tbk3im	hostile sexism	Heres why castrated/single males are a laughing matter.: Take it from the 26 year old virgin loser himself who has nothing to lose, nothing to offer,  and nothing left to gain in this world.  I don't claim to be an expert I'm just speculating and speaking from expierence. Its been commonplace to mock men for their ability to not be masculine, perform, and be competitive amongst men. This is how the human species just functions and  is consistent i assume from every country with men. This is probably no different than women who didn't act in a certain predefined mold either. It just so happens that women can give birth and that makes them automatically useful regardless of anything without actual effort ,and of course feminism is now treated as superior anyways in the west. \n\nMen do this to men and women also do this to men. Men or certain men just for whatever reasons find it funny to humiliate weak men and men in general. I guess it makes them to feel good to know people are worse off than you but even funnier when it's a man that you can dehumanize and exploit. I guess you're supposed to be able to take it and are meant to be a sacrifice or punching bag  I really don't know. You just don't see it with women or with the same vitrol. Men are basement  dwellers, virgins, nerds, effeminate, pussies, weak, etc.   I honestly don't want to know but being powerless is something I struggle with and is really hard to cope with constructively.  It's humiliating not to be able to get something you desire or crave while others can satisfy it and brag about it. Something as basic and organic as relationships not something extravagant. You likely  get all this rage and anger but nothing to do with because you're paralyzed with impotence. That's why it's an effective taunt. Because there must be something wrong with you to not achieve basic milestones that other normal people can. You're a failure or worse and because of that I'm better than you.\n\n I suspect this is just the way us monkeys went about conduct when it came to the tribe and how we viewed gender roles. Men are supposed to be strong,  provide, breadwinner, protect, fight, emotionless, hunt, find a wife, be a father and have kids. Failure to do this is a worthless man and a worthless man or those who don't fit in need to be shamed, shunned,  bullied,  to either correct their behavior or face further punishment like death.  Humans  are cruel creatures  and it will always be like this because someone will always be  trying to gain social or physical dominance over someone  to feel better about themselves or gain advantage. \n\n  It's just tribalism at the end of day. You don't fit in you get mocked, humiliated, and exiled; but with men it's  being basically  viewed as disposable fodder machines that must provide.   The easiest way to look at is it is virtually impossible for women to be virgins in the first place when looked at  in comparison to men. Even in the worst case scenario I'm talking disabled literally their is a man for her or atleast has a better chance than  male in the same breath. \n\n Somehow someway there's a man who is  willing  to go out of his way for her. Nowadays an average male even with average success in life  is going to struggle with rejection. Women don't like hearing this because they will resort to saying things I wish someone wouldn't like me for more their body and worse that they want someone that is out of their league clearly. Yeah well I wish a women would like me for something other than what I could provide for them  but here we are. Because we all know women inherently provide things for men and men are willing to support them for it.  I don't know if it's supposed to be this hard to find a mate historically for some losers like me either.
t2p4a7	neutral	How to approach friend about her new relationship: One of my closest friends for like 15ish years has recently started going out with a new guy. The whole relationship has been rather mind-blowing to me but it\u2019s apparently super serious now and I\u2019m legit afraid for her. \n\nShe just recently ended her 11-12 year long relationship and started going out with this new guy. They\u2019ve been going out a little less than 2 months. Since then she\u2019s been basically non-communicative with me, even though I\u2019ve reached out like we always have. She rarely answers now. From the tiny bits I\u2019d gathered along the way I\u2019d been suspicious of this new guy but never let on anything to her. \n\nI\u2019ve now found out they\u2019ve already moved in together (they did after about 2-3 weeks) and she\u2019s planning on marrying him. However, I see so many red flags, and after things I\u2019ve recently heard I\u2019m honestly afraid for her safety.\n\nThis entire time I\u2019ve been a bit hurt that we never talk anymore. Now looking closer I feel like he\u2019s cutting her off from her friends. She has never been this way about a guy and I don\u2019t know how to approach it. I\u2019ve seen her response to others that make her mad and she cuts them out. I don\u2019t want her to do that to me as I\u2019m afraid she needs a friend now more than ever. But I also feel like I need to ask if she\u2019s honestly sure of all of this.

ta9tzz	neutral	The Bite-Size Guide to Vet a Potential Suitor: What is he SAYING?: When he opens his mouth - is he saying things that will portray him in a certain light?\n\n\"I am a feminist\"\n\n\"I believe in equality between men and women\"\n\n\"I am kind\"\n\n\"I am a nice guy\"\n\n\"I am a good, hardworking, honest man\"\n\n\"I love you and can't wait to be a loving husband and great father for our kids\"\n\n\"I am not like the other guys\"\n\n\"Not all men, I don't act like that\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe opposite kind of light counts too:\n\n\"I am not a good man\"\n\n\"You deserve better than me\"\n\n\"I am a bad influence to you\"\n\n\"You are too good for me\"\n\netc. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The basic rule is this - if he can't help but talk about things that** ***push*** **you to think of him in a certain way? Like a politician keep saying to supporters that he is a \"good honest man with family that works hard\" - he has an agenda. And not a good one. Get up and leave.**\n\nOR he says the opposite - that you \"deserve better than him\"? That is him telling the truth about himself. Get up and leave.\n\nA *genuine* HVM won't talk about things like that - if he tells a story involving him - he will highlight the funny situation, the peculiar anecdotes, the participants in the story. He will focus on the *details* of the story where he just happens to be a participant. Just like how your good friends will share a funny story with you.\n\nBut beware, while some scrotes will be very obvious in their portrayals - but a more seasoned manipulators will subtly insert his portrayals here and there after getting you hooked up to his stories. \n\nIf you notice that you start thinking of him in a certain way after a period of talking to him/calling him/texting him - and that is due to the things he say rather than you very own conclusion after observing him? You are falling for the portrayals. Get up and leave.\n\nStay safe ladies.

tafa4q	interpersonal sexism	How do I help my friend to stop hating men?: So I just found out that my friend is a major feminist. And she is really far gone, to the point where she hates men. Some of her quotes are but not limited to: "I have no pity for men because they have ruled the world", "men abuse woman" and "men oppress women". She doesn't want to see my side but I will admit that I don't make good arguments via chat. So what can I tell her to open her eyes. I feel sorry she lives in a world where she believes that a half of the population are potential abusers. I want to add that my goal is not to make her stop being a feminist or bring her to the side of men's rights activism, I just want to make clear that we don't live in 50's anymore and that men have it hard too. That they are not all bad guys who live in a villa while their slave wife cares for the children, cooks and clean while they whip her if she is too slow.
t23w1g	hostile sexism	Women look out for other Women in a world that doesn't have our backs: It was on this sub a few weeks back I first heard of the untimely death of Lauren Smith-Fields.\n\n**Lauren was a gorgeous and vibrant 23 yr old** aspiring to be a physical therapist.  She was on a Bumble date (first date) with a 37 yr old man who came over to her apt. The next day she was dead and this man was not even held for questioning?!?!?!  The family weren't notified and found out from her landlord!  When they confronted police they were told  about the \"nice man\" who was with her in her final hours. So nice that they didn't feel compelled to hold an investigation, just took his testimony as the truth, that she died of a self induced drug overdose.\n\nYouTuber Kendall Rae did some more digging and it turns out this story gets **more and more demented**.  You can see [the full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrFqOD-lnxA) and I'll summarize below.  This is basically a story about two women in the same town dying mysteriously on the same day in the same city.  To be clear the deaths do not seem to be related.  What is significant is that the police did not feel the need to investigate either death nor notify the families of their loved one's passing.  The media coverage has been underwhelming even with Cardi B drawing attention to Lauren's death.\n\nThe other woman, 53 yr old Brenda Lee Rawls went to go visit a male friend.  When her sisters didn't hear from her for a few days (unusual as they were very close) they went looking for her.  They learned that she had died while staying with this friend.  Again, no investigation and no notification from authorities who were already aware of her death.\n\nThe complete negligence on part of the police in the handling of their deaths is criminal itself.  The grieving families are forced to ensure a proper investigation is held while holding police accountable.\n\nIt is not clear if their deaths were homicides (accidental or not).  Though there is some damning details that contradict the 37 yr old man's story of his time with Lauren.\n\nWhile I believe racism is absolutely at play in the mishandling of their cases by police, Gabby Petito shows that being white doesn't mean you can count on police either.  The officers who last saw her alive believed Brian was a \"nice guy\".\n\n**I have so much respect for Lauren's mother and Brenda's sisters.**  These women are fighting for the truth and for justice during one of the most painful times in their lives. Cardi B stepped up where media coverage failed.  And now YouTuber Kendall is drawing more attention back to the case.  Kendall also posts the GoFundMe accounts for both families to afford private investigations and lawsuits against the police dept.  I saw she made a generous contribution to each.\n\n**Long story short, this is a sad reminder that women are not granted full protection in our society.  We must be diligent to protect ourselves and look out for one another.**

t7q84o	hostile sexism	Why do feminists complain about men hitting on them in the gym, at work, in the street, etc? If they simply advertised the fact that they're feminists then men would leave them alone.: This seems like such a pointless complaint to me whenever I hear feminists going on about it. No guy with any self-respect wants to date a feminist. So if they simply showed that they are feminists, say by having a #KillAllMen coffee mug, wearing a feminist t-shirt or doing the brightly-colored (aposematic) hair thing, then men would all steer clear of them. Well, apart from rapey male feminists that is. But they're feminism's problem, not ours. They're barely even men, after all.

oz9u0v	neutral	PTSD FROM A PREVIOUS ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENT.: I found out somethings about the guy I was in love with (?) and it outright broke me. He was not the monogamous sort, and was clear about it. Not exclusive too. Sometimes it hurt a lot. \n\nCan someone tell you they love you and make you feel like their one and only while still sleeping with multiple women? (we hadn't slept yet then, I need to disclose that bit) or was it just lust for him?\n\nHe used to blow hot and cold, sometimes he'd be all over me, sometimes he'd be brutally indifferent. One time he ended things out of no where and this was 2 weeks after he told me he loved me.\n\nOn to the thing that I found out, so a little back story, I ended the courtship with him sometime late last year because of him blowing so hot and cold, and at the time I was mentally strong enough to stick to the decision. Why this back story matters we will get to that. \n\none of my exs pulled up a comment thread where the fellow talked about this missed connection of his and how he thought she'd be the only person he'd be monogamous with and how he felt utterly broken about the fact that it could never work w her because both of them had significantly changed. He met up with her when we were no longer talking, after telling there'd be no way he'd even consider being with her. \n\nThis gut me. Because the language he used to describe his affections and longing was the EXACT BRAND he'd use with me.\nAll of this would have been fine. But, on the very same night, he published that comment, he texted saying he missed me. At the time I was overjoyed, because goodness did I ever miss him. Now that I know the details it feels like he only ever texted me because he was reeling from the heartbreak of that girl, and he was just seeking an emotional rebound from the one person who loved him unconditionally.\n\nI feel so used and abused emotionally. I was fine with him sleeping with other women casually, because he kept saying he felt an emotional connection with me, and I was secure in that. But now it feels like all this time he just used me as tool for validation to make himself feel better about not being w that woman.\n\nI am wondering if I was ever loved.\nWe tried sleeping together, it didn't pan out, I had a break down and I remember  he told me \"so don't be vulnerable\". WHILE. WE. WERE. IN. BED. This was after he ended things over nothing, and we got back ptogether again? There was a strong tendency to gaslight me. I see it now.\n\nTowards the end when he had our last convo and I was crying he chose to talk about the Woman he had real feelings for and told me when they met up it felt like coming back to a place to find his home gone. This was while I was crying over the phone about us and he chose to talk about her.\n\nI now know this was all some facade, and that he was just so lonely and hungry for affection that he couldn't even see past his own manipulation of himself. I also found out he has a history of trying to make women fall for him, while playing the this is just casual card. If you want to sex don't indulge women to such an extent they form this strong sense of feelings towards whole you stay unaffected. Odd still he refuses to see how manipulative it is. He refuses to believe or entertain that perhaps he is leading these women on. I've made excuses after excuses for him, and all he did was lie. And I still find ways to justify it. \n\nAlso^ One of the things that punched me in the gut was when I found out he follows and comments on my best friend's posts, (my best friend has no clue who he is and since he initially called it off he unfollowed me from my social media) and mind you I've talked about my friends and family extensively w him, I've posted my best friend on my stories and vice versa. If he were to say he didn't know that she was my best friend, I wouldn't understand what would hurt more; the fact that he never gave a damn about things that were repeated in conversation or the fact that he knew she was my best friend. \n\nI am currently in therapy and off of all social media except LinkedIn and very recently on reddit, because I can't bare to share the same space as him, and after seeing his comments on my best friend's post, I know for a fact he'll try to slide into her dms and hit on her. \n I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I have been prescribed medication for it. There were many things he did in the span of our courtship that just were plain hurtful. I've always had mental health struggles but boy, after finding out he only texted that he misses me because he was heartbroken over some one else has me questioning the person  he was.\n\nIronically his parting words to me were \"I don't think you have your shit together\". Funny, I wonder what kind of a person does what he did.\n\nSo this is me, months later trying to piece myself back together.\nAnd the idiotic question remains, did he ever love me or did he just want to fuck me?

t8jwqn	ambivalent sexism	Subtle signs of misogyny: Beautiful empresses, \n\nThis is an FYI post.   \n\n\nYou and I both know the obvious Scrote fuckbois that objectify women as sex dolls and instruments of pleasure. But let me tell you another version of men who may not necessarily have a porn addiction but they still objectify women. Here are some signs I can share with you: \n\n* Calls women he doesnt like bitches\n* Shit talks about his mom and sister(s) to you \n* Infantilizes your anger, ex: says that you\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry or they laugh when you get angry (I don\u2019t mean the condescending kind of laughter. he doesn\u2019t take your emotions seriously if he\u2019s patronizing you!)\n* he agrees with the statement that \u201cfor every hot woman, there\u2019s a man sick of her shit\u201d \n* claims that \u201call women are the same\u201d\n* talks about his Previous ex and what she did that he didn\u2019t like (then you try to not do what she did but the moment he perceives you\u2019re doing what she did, whoooo boy, he gets mad)\n* talks about previous women he was involved with (not sexually) but as a way to say how they did him wrong, how they were selfish\n* says you\u2019re perfect, amazing, \u201cyou\u2019re my angel\u201d, sweet talks the heck out of you but the moment you show your human side or don\u2018t give in to his whim, he will take out his anger on you. He might say that it is you who can\u2019t compromise, you who is controlling, you who \u201cmade him\u201d mad or sad or do something bad  \n* Jealous, possessive, and controlling of what you wear, where you\u2019re at, and who you see\n* big one: doesn\u2019t want anything to do with women from his own culture (he might call them \u201cdisgusting\u201c) \n* he keeps calling you hot (which is great, because you ARE hot) but then when there are obvious problems in the relationship, he might use intimacy as a way to get closer, unleash aggression in hopes of making the relationship better. adding to this, when you try to break up with him, he will agree that it\u2019s best to break up but AGAIN says you\u2018re hot, fun, cool but says he doesn\u2019t want you completely gone from his life (so which one is it, idiot?)\n* look out for double standards... if he\u2019s allowed to be angry and sad, and you show these emotions (I mean hey, we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t be happy all the time) too, he will get angry, internalize, and think he\u2019s unable to keep you happy when it might not necessarily have anything to do with him \n* when he really is being harsh, you tell him he is being mean. Then he responds that \u201chow come when I am being honest, which you want, you say I\u2019m being mean. Then I\u2019m the bad guy\u201d  (Gaslighting you, victimizing himself)\n* he says you\u2019re living in your own little world when he sees you STILL being affectionate, lovey dovey to him even after he has gotten into really bad arguments with you (you even tell him you want to feel chased and he says, \u201cim still supposed to chase you?\u201d) ; he says that life isn\u2019t a Disney fairytale because he thinks that once he\u2018s \u201cgot\u201d you, he won\u2019t need to expend effort anymore. Once he feels like he\u2019s expended effort on you but he perceives that you\u2019re not reciprocating or that you\u2019re still causing problems, he will resent you. (Remember, in HIS mind, he thinks you\u2019re being clingy, needy, unreasonable. Newsflash: you are the reasonable one. He is an ill person trying to manipulate you to get you to shut up.) \n* oh right, speaking of shut up, he might tell you to \u201cshut up\u201d And it doesn\u2019t need to be in an aggressive tone (he doesn\u2019t respect what you have to say if he has to say \u201cshut up\u201d even if lightly)\n* you ask him hypothetically, what happens once you get fat after having his child, he says that you\u2019ll work out \\[nonchalant tone or not, honesty or not, a lot of women have difficulty (emotionally especially) dropping baby weight.\\]\n* he Sneers when there are debates/arguments, he is utterly sarcastic too (then you get pissed off and say something you don\u2019t mean, then he goes ballistic and unable to restrain himself)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuch a man may not necessarily insult the way you look or the way you perform during intimacy. To him, you might be the hottest woman in the world and he doesn\u2019t fantasize about anyone else when he\u2019s with you. Heck, you\u2019re his dream girl! With conditions though \u2014 Until you show that you are your own independent woman, you are your own entity, and that you want to compromise but he feels entitled to have everything his way.   \n\n\nThere are some snake ass negative value men out there. Trauma bond is a fucking bitch and can turn rosey colored glasses to PITCH BLACK, and you still wouldn\u2019t be able to see his glaringly obvious faults. No smoke signals could get you out of this pairing until you make the realization yourself that this man is a piece of flaming sewer shit. Please. Journal. Document. Talk to your closest friend or family when these things do happen. Do not let the trauma bond become something engrained in your head that hes the only one for you in the world. If he makes you feel insecure, obsessed, or you feel an unexplainable sinking in your chest when arguments/fights happen, you need to talk to someone you can trust. Best yet, get out of there.

But he is not acting in a way that respects you and makes you feel safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo need to seek revenge on this man, if you\u2019ve ever dated or married such a man.

t9igpc	neutral	Met a creep and now motivated to not repeat. How do you motivate yourself to glow up when you've had nothing but bad experiences with men?: I gained a lot of weight in the last two years from a size 2 to size 8.  I'm not in a position to date HVM mentally or physically so I've been wearing my hair in a less flattering hairstyle to save money until I lose weight. I look \"cute\" vs the past when I looked beautiful. My self esteem has lessened a bit because of my looks.\n\nI recently had a very unattractive man repeatedly talk to me and have done nothing but tell him I'm not interested in him. I met him at his job and he approached me, I  was avoiding his job because of him, he convinced me that it was all a misunderstanding, that he wanted to meet more black people and make friends (I'm black) and perhaps due to isolation I believed him.\n\n He saw me and felt the need to explain that it was a misunderstanding. I've barely socialized for about 2 years and am saving to move to an area with more people, I think my lack of socialization and guilt I felt for potential misunderstanding made me agree to maybe be friends. Why did I feel guilty though? I didn't really want to know him though because he had no care for how he presented himself and gave me bad impressions previously. Before I agreed to share my number I told him I was ONLY interested in something platonic, I didn't want to be cruel and tell him his looks were the complete opposite of what I liked and he grossed me out.\n\n I feel dumb for ignoring my first impression and communicating with him when he said he was only looking for friends.  He had me convinced his flirting was harmless pleasantries, that I was misreading it. I'm not normally naive. The first thing he did when I agreed to give my number was text me how beautiful my features were, crazy emoji and see if I was up and ask me to text and tell me what he was doing and why I hadn't heard from him earlier. Bitch, I dgaf. I told him that I didn't appreciate him commenting on my looks, that I made a mistake and thought I had made my intentions clear but shouldn't have shared my phone anyway and not talk to me. I have blocked him and hope he actually respects me and avoids me.\n\nThe situation is making me want to glow up again because I doubt someone like that would approach me if I looked my best. Most of the time when I am hit on it's a decent quality man. It's not that my friends have to be attractive but put some effort in, when I first met him I would have assumed he was homeless if I had not seen him working. Before this bad experience I was thinking about my exes and guys who just didn't like me and questioning if getting skinny again was worth it if I just had to date more jerks. I'm not bitter but I am old and still single.

t6iirl	neutral	Men are responsible for high suicide rates in men.: I'm a male who got raped by my father female cousin for 6 years. She groomed and raped me almost every week started when I was 10. Every man I told they said I should enjoy it, and when I finally told my grandma she fucked her up and now nobody is talking to her. And every time I see a man who knows about this, they say if I were you I wouldn't tell anyone and just enjoy it. Now I'm the family joke no one sees me as a victim they all see me as a dumb idiot. Every time I thought about killing myself is because a man. We bully each other and hate each other and men are willing to literally kill you if they thought you better than them. I never felt safe around a man. So please stop fucking saying high suicide rates when talking about men. We created this environment we are responsible.
t59dm8	neutral	Advice on anxiety or am I doomed?: I have general anxiety, which is, for the most part, taken care of by medication and therapy.\n\nMy anxiety is usually not social in nature - I can easily attend gatherings and parties and meet strangers with no impeding panic attacks.\n\nI recently discovered that dates are a whole different ballpark. I am pretty fearful of romance and suspicious of men in general, which previously meant that I came on overly strong and liked to be in charge and basically act like the chaser. \n\nLast year I started turning all that around and leveled up my self esteem, my looks, my hobbies, etc. This year I decided to dabble in dating - and I thought since I\u2019m not desperate for men, have shiny new upgraded standards and so on, I\u2019m going to enjoy my time dating. If something happens, it happens, if not, then no biggie. Around this time I found FDS btw. \n\nAnyway, without further ado: I almost caught a panic attack on a date. I hope he thought I was cold and that was why I was faintly shivering, but god. How embarrassing. My teeth occasionally chattered so I had to keep quiet at times.\n\nThis is something that I don\u2019t think can be\u2026. pre-worked out? Like this isn\u2019t really something that can be talked out in therapy and then I just poof and don\u2019t have anxiety in the actual real life situation. I hope I can overcome this by going on more dates.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? How did you work it out? Did toughing it out and just gaining more experience dating help?
surjwe	institutional sexism	Something I have noticed: So I am talking about what I have noticed in my country (India) I'm not too sure about the rest of the world. Thing is feminists complain about women being less in the STEM area and I remember when I was in 11th grade and we were given the option of choosing what streams to pick STEM or business and commerce etc, only 9-10 girls picked STEM in my class where around 35 were boys. So you see, even when given choice most of them didn't take STEM. Why? Because it's arguably hardest to pursue a career in STEM in India and they just took the easy courses to get relatively easier jobs? Then the people who collect statistics say women in STEM are less. Well why are you complaining if most women themselves literally didn't pick STEM as a course?

She may have written a book too but I can't remember for certain.  She also seemed to have a big presence online talking about feminism and women's rights. \n\nI watched a short video of her talking about the class I'd be taking and there was one man in a room of about 20 students. \n\nThere were also units on 'gender equality in education ' in the course breakdown.\n\nNow I didn't read her papers so I can't say for sure what they actually say. But the whole scenario has really put me off. \n\nAt the least I'm struggling to take the course seriously now but at worst I'm fearful it would be hell....\n\nWhat do you guys think?

t6phr5	neutral	Men who try to trick you into coming over on the first date or early on: This was especially common for when I used OLD. Men who said that they \"love to cook\" or \"are great cooks\" would then also try to have the first date as me coming over to their house so they could cook for me - or have me walk around a park and then picnic to sample their food. \n\n\ud83d\udea9The thing is that many of these \"great cooks\" would often Try getting me to come over to their place for the first date. When I said no one of them then told me that his family would be home so it wouldn't be \"dangerous\". Still living in mommy and daddys nest at 30? Tricking me to come over too? Delete and block. Another dude was the same thing but admitted that \"its cheaper to just eat at home restaurants are too expensive so let's save money\" nope.\n\n\ud83d\udea9Another trick was a man that went on a proper first date with me and then started telling me he was a great cook\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73. It was close to st paddy's \ud83c\udf40day and he was texting me pics of his corned beef and cabbage. I said looks like he did a good job. To which he said he had some extra and I should come over for leftovers. I said no. Then he hit me up the next day saying that it was his roomates birthday\ud83c\udf82 and that I was invited over they'd all be \ud83c\udf7bdrinking. He then said that there's room in his bed, so I don't have to worry about driving home. He got blocked.\n\n\ud83d\udea9Another trick was an interesting case. The dude called himself a chef in his old bio. He started to tell me he worked a restaurant and prides himself on gourmet recipes. I asked what his favorite dish is and he said mac n cheese \ud83d\udea8 he started saying it was a \"gourmet mac n cheese\" \ud83e\uddc0and that I need to try it and used thus as his segue to propose the date: having me drive up to the restaurant he works at after it closes, and he will cook it for me, and we will eat in in the closed dark restaurant alone. Pre fds me said I wouldn't be comfortable and he assured me it was fine because his female manager, who was also his roomate, would be cleaning up in the back. I said I didn't know he had a roomate and he explained that she lives with him above the restaurant. I said no I still don't feel safe and asked him for this gourmet recipe as i would try it at my own place. He literally said it was kraft mac n cheese with some shredded cheese on top\ud83e\udd21. I laughed and laughed before unmatching him.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 this dude was telling he's Italian and his Nonna makes homemade pasta and how he wants to go back to Italy. I was asking him what traveling to Italy is like and he turned the convo back to his Nonna having amazing cooking skills and started bragging that he knew how to make homemade pasta as well. I said that's cool and he started saying that he wanted to make me homemade pasta and that he would make me a homemade dinner immediately started saying that I should come over for it. I said no and then he started saying his family has big dinners every weekend and his mom would love to meet me. We had not even been on a 1st date! I blocked. \n\n\ud83d\udea9one more was saying he would like to meetup for dinner and a movie. He asked me if I was free Friday, but my car was going into the shop. I said it'll have to wait to another day because I'm getting my brakes done. He then said no don't take your car in anywhere, just drive over to his place and he could do it because he did one class back in high school. \"It'll be so much cheaper we can go to auto zone together you just have to buy the parts!\" I said no and we could just choose another day for the date. He then insisted that I could hangout in his place watching Netflix while he worked on the brakes and then we could \"chill\". Block. \n\nYes fds supports a dinner date but don't let these clowns try talking you into coming over! Do not go over to a man's house especially with no commitment, especially on the first few dates. Beware of the bait and switch.
t7zbdy	neutral	Thoughts as I'm packing my things while he sleeps, drunk after going to bed at 7am (a normal night for him): I am writing this as I pack up my stuff and try to figure out a plan to move back to my home state. I've been thinking about leaving for months (probably a year...) but can never make the final decision. But right now, as I hear him grinding his teeth from the bedroom after going to bed at 7am after drinking around 12 drinks and playing video games all night (this entire situation is pretty much his norm Friday-Sunday) because he refuses to do the grind-guard mold I bought him in September, I just can't take it anymore. So as I figure out the stressful details of who can help me move, when I can leave, and how I'm going to manage working from home during all this, here are the red flags to remind myself I'm making the right decision.\n\n* Drinking problem - told me he's probably drunk every night for 10+ years (he's 30) and pretty much drinks 4-12 drinks a night. THIS WEEK he realized I'm serious about not wanting to be with an alcoholic, so he tried not drinking for 3 days and complained and was in a bad mood the whole time. He wasn't even having withdrawals, he was just grumpy. So I don't feel bad.\n* Acts like taking 2-3 nights off drinking a week, and then binge drinking the rest of the week, is normal and \"he's trying\"\n* Addicted to video games, probably spends 50-60 hours a week on them\n* Complains about gaining weight the last few years but refuses to go on walks with me, use our elliptical, etc. Just talks about how \"im going to start tomorrow\" and never does\n* Thinks having a good WFH corporate job means he's got his life together\n* Sometimes goes days without brushing his teeth, definitely has never flossed, hasn't been to the dentist since 2018, grinds his teeth all night and wont use a grind guard.\n* His glasses are 5 years old and broken but instead of going and getting a new pair superglued them. they look terrible, the red light blocking stuff on them is peeling off. \n* Talks to his family with an attitude 24/7, literally has no patience with them and talks bad about them even though they are difficult sometimes, they are generous and love him. They probably call him out on his bullshit and he doesn't like it.\n* Came home to stay with my family for christmas, but basically slept the whole time...not kidding. slept all day, had to wake him up for family meals, he missed Christmas morning. Blames it on being tired from COVID that he had a few weeks before, except he was able to stay up all night gaming on his laptop.....and drinking of course. He event old me when I woke him up on Christmas morning \"I wish I was home right now\" and I started crying and I said \"please don't ruin Christmas for me, you know how important this is to me\" and then GOT MAD AT ME! said I made it about me and I was supposed to sympathize with hime! Mind you, I have been on countless trips with his family in their home. This was his first time traveling to see hime and he couldn't even try.\n* Sent $60 to an ex so she could adopt a cat and didn't understand why I was mad - even tried to hide it from me so he KNEW it would make me mad\n* My friends and family don't like him\n* Our whole relationship I've had great jobs, but he's always made more - so he's never asked me to help him with his mortgage. But I recently got a promotion and now make a bit more than him, and he's started making passive comments about how I need to buy him gifts, maybe I should pitch in for utilities, etc\n* Wants to have like 12 kids, but also doesn't seem to keen on the idea of a stay at home mom...always says things like \"what if I want to be a stay at home dad?\" Ew. \n* We've been together 3 years and keeps avoiding the idea of getting engaged (not that I'd want to at this point, but I've expressed to him how important it is to me, and he doesn't really care)\n* Has never ever gotten me a gift for any birthday or holiday until I basically forced him to this year so i wouldn't be embarrassed in front of my family, and he ended up telling me how \"transactional\" and \"gift-obsessed\" I am becoming, and how \"expensive\" what he got me is. \n* He smokes weed in the house and I told him (WHEN I HAD COVID) to please stop and he got mad at me and said I'm high maintenance \n* Of course he is addicted to nicotine and is always sucking on a stupid vape, even in bed. Still smokes in the house.\n* If I didn't clean his 3 cats' litter boxes, he literally would only do it 1x a month. \n* Has driven drunk countless times. \n* before COVID, his only hobbies were going to the bar EVERY NIGHT after work, EVERY NIGHT, and just sitting around at some dive bar, and video games. now it's just video games. \n\nHe has convinced me he is normal, I am not. I am up tight and high maintenance, and his behaviors are fine.\n\nWhen I am concerned that he stays up till 3-5am even on work nights, he says I'm the weird one for going to bed at 9 or 10. When I don't want to sit in my 4 day old pajamas on Saturday morning and instead want to go to the gym, I'm health obsessed and neurotic. I just keep telling myself that if he was exactly the way he was now, but he had a worse job, I wouldn't even consider dating him. But somehow I've convinced myself that having a good job and house means he has a chance at being HV. but that's NOT TRUE. He's 30. I don't think he's ever going to change.\n\nSorry to vent. It sucks because I've started a new, challenging job - I wish I had left months ago. But that's my fault, and now I have to figure out how to get home. \n\nI've been reading FDS for over a year now, trying to get the courage to realize my worth. I don't know if I'm convinced yet, but I know I just can't do this anymore. I'm tired.
o4xoyx	ambivalent sexism	Reddit hates men who say tightness matters: I can\u2019t remember what sub this was on but an insecure LVF with a loose vagina was asking men if tightness matters. In typical female fashion she was whining (further contributing to her loose vagina energy) and blaming men for her miserable life. I knew the comment section was going to be full of pickmes but I didn\u2019t expect it to be that bad.\n\nAll the comments were basically repeating that tightness doesn\u2019t matter and that \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy tight ones anyway\u201d and that loose vaginas feel better. WHYYY do we keep doing this shit? Pickmes are making all of us look bad. One man wrote that yes he does prefer tight vaginas and she was literally downvoted and shamed. Why is that okay?\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high but I expected a little bit of honesty. They were literally jerking her off in the comments and treating her like some misunderstood princess. \u201cTight vaginas are overrated\u201d no they\u2019re absolutely not. \u201cTight women are awful in bed\u201d god shut up please. \u201cOnly shallow men will care about your tightness\u201d - I\u2019m shallow for wanting to experience great sex? And no, it doesn\u2019t matter if she can \u201cmake up\u201d for her loose vagina by giving great oral, I can literally just get a gal who can do that AND has a tight vagina. Why should I ever settle for scraps just to keep unattractive women happy? It\u2019s not my job to make their loose vaginas feel bigger than they actually are.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because women NEVER lie to protect women\u2019s feelings. They\u2019re brutally honest about their preferences and they don\u2019t give a FUCK what you think. They\u2019re selfish with their needs and if something doesn\u2019t make their vagina feel good they leave it. In stark contrast, us poor men will literally coddle grown women and put up with bad sex to protect their fragile feelings. The same pickmes screaming that tightness doesn\u2019t matter are getting told by their girlfriends to get hit the gym and get ripped.\n\nI absolutely will not lower my standards when it comes to sex. I am not \u201cstud\u201d or \u201chave a tiny dick\u201d for preferring tight vaginas, that\u2019s literally the #1 argument LVFs come up with. You can rock yourself to sleep telling yourself that but deep down you know it\u2019s all just a coping mechanism. I\u2019ve never had to use Viagra and don\u2019t plan on starting now.\n\nTightness matters and saying that should not be controversial.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o4s3pd/reddit_hates_women_who_say_size_matters/

Apparently I did something right, because last year I got married. \n\nRecently though, I've been struggling to come up with anything funny to say. My wife will do or say something, and I know that it's the time for a joke, but my mind is just blank.

Like wtf isn't the point of dating to literally see if there's a real connection? to me this translates to \"let me waste your time as a placeholder so I can have sex while I look for  someone I actually like\".  yeah good luck finding a connection when you are wasting so much time having \"fun\".
sqsbwz	ambivalent sexism	Why I no longer support feminism or women's issues.: I used to believe that men had it easier in life except when it came to dating/relationships/sex. Reason being that, because women deal with more sexual harrassment, sexual assault, rape, etc.  that meant their lives were more difficult to me. Obviously those things are not good, but I realized that despite that they still have it way easier. The main reason why I changed my mind is because of war. Millions  if not billions of men, since the dawn of man, fought in vicious wars. The survivors would come back miserable and mentally damaged, the others died horrifically. Why don't modern day feminist ever talk about these poor men who died brutally over meaningless squabble? If World War 3 broke out, I and several other young men could be drafted. Where would the feminist be? They'd be safe at home unless my country was invaded. They complain about the "patriarchy," when really it seems like the patriarchy benefits them more because they wouldn't be forced to go to war and suffer. They claim that men have it easier but never look at all of their own privileges.The wage gap has been debunked a lot and has become a myth (it probably has happened before but not enough evidence says this occurs frequently.).  They have the right to complain about sexual misconduct from creepy men and they have the right to feel unsafe in certain situations. They should invest more in self defense... But they won't because they believe they shouldn't have to use self defense in the first place. That's obviously true but we don't live in a perfect world, evil people don't think about what they shouldn't do. I will always support women in sexual assault, rape, etc., but absolutely nothing else. (Of course there's false accusations too, so the men should get a fair trial if he is accused.) Personally, I feel that it's mainly western white women doing all of the complaining. They live way greater than women in other countries, so what are they complaining about? Do they ever talk about those women? And if they do, why do they compare their issues to women who have it way worse. Modern western white women are some of the most privileged group of people in the history of humanity, women of color also have it far worse but feminists never talk about that. When I was a teenager I worked at a movie theater, some of the best friends I made there were white women. They were all promoted before I was and received higher pay despite me being employed before them. I believe situations like that a very common, they claim that men have it easier in the work place but I'd argue that pretty white women have it easier than anyone else. What do feminists say about situations like that? They say nothing and turn the other cheek. Feminism also seems to promote toxicity for women. They say it's okay for women to be toxic in relationships or in life, but if men are toxic all hell breaks lose. Personally I'm pro life and I think anyone who does not or won't take responsibility for a child that they created is a coward (male or female.) Feminist say "my body, my choice," I suppose that's true but I must admit it's very cowardly and immature to not take responsibility for your own mistakes. Modern day Feminists are very entitled and refuse to own up to their own mistakes. How could I support a movement that is so hateful and hypocritical? Absolutely will not! In reality, feminists just hate men and want more power over them. They want to be in more positions of power... That's absolutely all they care about. They just want to be more superior in men, therefore men's issues mean nothing to them. Obviously, first wave feminism was awesome... Third and fourth waves? Not so much. Now how does all of that make me feel? I don't care much as I used to. I believe a man can have an amazing life as well. I'm a minority man, I think I generally have it worse in western society. Despite all of that, I believe I can find deep happiness and fulfillment. Modern day Feminisms can complain all they want, but as for me I'm advance my life and support groups that are actually less privileged than the main demographic of modern day women.
