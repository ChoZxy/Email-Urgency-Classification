t8a7u4	neutral	Fellow men of reddit, how do you deal with feeling disposable and unloved?: This might all be too much info, but I feel like I need to speak up before I do something stupid.\n\nI was married to my high school sweetheart. We had been together since 2009. I thought she was my soulmate. I thought she was the one I'd spend the rest of my days with.\n\nBut then late last year, she decided that dropping her panties for some random guy that **WE** both worked with was more important than all the years that we spent together... all the work we put in. All the struggles we went through together. All the good times. It's all just meaningless now.\n\nI left her in November of last year because of this. And since then, I've been really struggling to find meaning in life. I feel suicidal regularly. She has somehow found the audacity to play the victim, as if **I** am the one who did something wrong.\n\nI've been going to therapy for a while, but I just don't know what to do anymore. It seems like all that awaits for me is a life of breaking myself working just to barely get by. There's no love, no kindness, no compassion in this world. Not for us penis-havers.\n\nFellow dudes, how do you deal with feels like this? How do you deal with feeling like no one will ever really, truly love you for you?
nvp49f	neutral	Setting things straight: I've been hearing a surplus of people across the internet saying \"I have money, I have muscles, why doesn't she like me?\". Muscles doesn't automatically make you a good person. A 6 figure job doesn't automatically make women drool over you. A good heart is the most important thing. And let's say she rejects your request; say ok thanks and move on. There's no need to complain about how bad women are and hate women in general just because one girl didn't like you, every girl is different. You'll find someone eventually, and dwelling on that one girl and hating the entire gender in general because she doesn't like you is just stupid.
te6tg5	neutral	Why are you for or against a soda tax?: I'm all for lower taxes, but processed sugar is a leading cause of kidney failure. 1 in 3 Americans are at risk of kidney failure and currently, 500,000 Americans on dialysis. This is important to tax payers because late stage renal disease (kidney failure) is the only ailment that the federal government indiscriminately covers. Whether you are Jane from accounting, a senior, a toddler, or just Joe from the office, the feds will pay for your dialysis. No insurance, retirement benefits, or military healthcare necessary. Dialysis is so expensive, 20% of medicare ($28 billion) is spent of dialysis. That's 1% of the federal budget. If a tax is not levied against soda, it will be levied for the health issues created by its accessibility. \n\nIf people want publicly funded healthcare, then the government must do what it can to reduce costs. That means that it must endorse preventative measures, like a soda tax. \n\nIn 2012, Mayor Bloomberg tried to ban restaurants from selling sweetened soft drinks in containers above 16 oz. It's important to clarify that this ban only applied to establishments that received health inspection grades, so convenience stores and grocery markets were exempt. Free refills were permissible and a customer could also request another cup. Violators would only receive a fine of $200. \n\nAt the time, the bill received intense push-back and that was largely due to a misinformation campaign carried out by food and beverage lobbying groups. I remember my dad was convinced that the ban would prevent him from buying 2 liter bottles of Coke from the grocery store. That was demonstrably false. Muddying the waters is a common tactic used to control policy. It was abused to stall climate change reform, tobacco regulation, and lead reduction in gasoline. People cannot commit to decisions without complete information and corporations know this.\n\nAs time has passed, I've become a bit jaded by how special interest groups have manipulated public policy. Big soda's main argument against the soda tax was that it removed consumer choice. Completely false. I find that ironic because the soda duopoly - Coke and Pepsi - have famously threatened drink vendors to remove competing brands from shelves or lose access to their product lines. It is true that Coke and Pepsi are pro-choice, but only when the choice is clearly theirs. \n\nConsidering recent advancements in public opinion, I am wondering if you'd support a soda tax.

t42x47	hostile sexism	Does people laughing on a man who got kicked in the nuts actually show our society lacks empathy towards men?: Well not just women, but men who know how bad it hurts, laugh on a person who got hot in his nuts That itself clearly shows that they are less empathetic towards a man Well in comparison to that, if a woman gets hit in her Uterus (which doesn't hurt as bad), people would actually start fighting the person, if they are a man, and be against him instead of laughing at him (and if a woman does that, they still see her in a negative way, tho don't start fighting with her) This shows clear empathy towards a woman from our society And now if a woman hits a guy in his nut, people go "he must have done something to deserve it" and laugh at it This really personally infuriates me, cuz not only it's painful, but also can put a man's life at risk if there is a testicular torsion caused by the hit Well, this is my opinion, i would like to hear your opinions too

t7hjlt	internalized sexism	Does anyone else feel the pressure to explain your single hood to partnered people?: This month I started new job and most of the women in my office are partnered. They\u2019ve started asking about my love life and here\u2019s how the conversations usually go. \n\n\u201cSo, do you have a boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n*Cue eyebrow raise\n\n\u201cOh okay. But you\u2019re like dating right? You\u2019re in the casual dating scene?\u201d \n\n\u201cMmm No, actually, not really.\u201d\n\n*Cue awkward silence. \n\nIt\u2019s usually at this point that I get the urge to explain how I got out of a long term relationship last year or how, I\u2019m actually too busy to date rn or how I love being single and have no interest in dating. \n\nBut I\u2019ve start to just bite my tongue and allow them to relish in their own uncomfortableness with my singleness. And I know it\u2019s there because they always follow up with:\n\n\u201cOh well I was single before I started dating my Nigel so don\u2019t worry, your time will come!\u201d - Actual quote. \n\nOr \u201cWell you know what they say, you fall in love when you least expect it, so it\u2019s actually good you\u2019re not looking!!\u201d - another actual quote. \n\nAnd I sit there, again, fighting the urge to justify my singleness or explain how actually no, me not dating is not some secret agenda to fall in love with another scrote.\n\n\nAs an attractive, social woman, decentering men and making no apologies or explanations for it has been quite the experience. Most of my adult life has been in long term relationships, so I never realized how much me \u201chaving a boyfriend\u201d defused other women. Now that I\u2019m single and not dating, I\u2019m baffled by how shocked and unaccepting of it other women are. \n\nIt\u2019s also like if you\u2019re single, they\u2019re desperate to hear all of your dating escapades to run home to tell their partners about. It\u2019s not to knock these women either; it\u2019s happened so frequently now that I\u2019m realizing how socially conditioned we are to be obsessed with partnering and validating ourselves with relationships. \n\nAnyone experience anything similar?

t0m14v	neutral	Being attracted to something you want to be / feel you're lacking: I've been doing some thinking and realizing that in the past, I've been routinely attracted to guys because I actually identified them as embodying something I wanted to be / some skill I wanted to have. It was invariably just me projecting that idealized image onto them, they always turned out to be a huge disappointment, but I think this attitude is worth analysing.\n\n1. When I was a teenager, I started dating someone 7 years older. I saw him as mature, stable, with a job, such a well-adjusted adult. Also I saw him as having this great loving, stable, supportive family.\n\nI realize now that I was so drawn to him because I *wanted* to be a mature, stable, well-adjusted adult. Also my family was in a shambles and I craved that stability, the ideal of a healthy, functional life and family.\n\nIt turned out that he was an immature loser caught in a dead end job, with a pathetic social life, no ambition, no education, fantasizing about becoming a rockstar someday. His family was also far from healthy. But I was so blinded by the ideal I projected onto them, that it took me *years* and a nasty shock when he cheated on me and behaved horribly to figure it out and be able to see and accept the reality.\n\n2. I've been a digital nomad and traveller for several years. Around the beginning, I was involved with a guy who I saw as such an experienced, skilled, adventurous traveller. He was so cool and confident. He lived in dangerous countries, travelled on his motorbike. I projected onto him the ideal of the self-sufficient, capable, confident, skilled, brave adventurer I wanted to be. By being with him, I could feel like I was like that myself.\n\nIt turned out that he was a good for nothing alcoholic bum, irresponsible, penniless, hobosexual, manipulative, disorganized, dysfunctional, irresponsibly zipping around in the throes of bipolar mania. This time, I clocked on quickly that I was just projecting onto him something I wanted to be and something I wanted to have - the confidence.\n\nSo I challenged myself to travel to more difficult countries, but in an organised, responsible, intelligent way. I learned to drive a motorbike and eventually crossed a whole continent on it by myself. Proving to myself I was skilled, adventurous and capable all on my own was a massive boost to my self-confidence.\n\n3. When I was feeling unsure and directionless about my career, I found myself attracted to a guy who seemed to be a determined, hard-working, skilled, busy go-getter, full of projects, apparently quite succesful, practical and business-oriented. Needless to say, it was mostly me projecting that onto him.\n\n4. when feeling insecure about my academic career, I found myself drawn to a guy who was a PhD student and seemed so involved and successful in research, publishing articles, working with the university, planning books to write, etc.\n\nIt turned out he was waffling along doing the bare minimum, constantly drunk/high, mooching off the university while doing no work, mostly bragging about how smart he was while actually getting nothing done in spite of all his grandiose plans. A total loser.\n\n5. Over the years, the lack of stability and loneliness of the nomad lifestyle started getting to me. So it's no surprise I found myself involved with a guy who seemed extremely stable and settled, well-adjusted, self-sufficient, independent, very stable and at peace with himself.\n\nIt turned out he was none of the above, just socially inept, stuck in an empty life without any drive or ambition or vision for his life and future, stuck in one place out of apathy and totally lost and unstable. I was, as always, projecting onto him a vision of something I'm attracted to and by being drawn to him, I felt I could get closer to what I want.\n\nSo, since now I'm aware of this tendency of mine, I immediately turned to look at what my idealised projection and attraction are telling me. They're telling me I want stability, I want to build something, I want to feel settled and satisfied, I want to be at peace with myself so I won't feel lonely.\n\n**In conclusion, there are two main takeaways:**\n\n1. I have to be wary of my tendency to idealise people by projecting onto them an ideal of something I feel I'm lacking and want to have / to be. They of course never live up to that idealization because I'm just projecting everything onto them, and by now I'm well aware of what I'm doing and can spot myself doing it at once. I use this to pinpoint the thing my subconscious is craving even though I wasn't rationally aware of it.\n2. And by now I have learned that I don't need to stay with a guy who (in my imagination) embodies those things in order to vicariously feel like I have them. I can and will get to work to earn these things / level up as needed, as I have always done so far.\n\nJust thought I would write this down in case it resonates with anyone. It took me several years to become aware of this pattern and the unconscious mechanism behind it.

t9gjak	ambivalent sexism	Anyone here ever consider just paying women you like to do the exact thing you want?: So many posts in theredpill and so on basically says women want money.\n\nAnd I think I agree. I was a simp my self. I kept thinking about how to make smart beautiful women like me. Then I met this women that fuck anyone that pay except me. And that happens after I spent like $2k for her to make her happy.\n\nIf women want money, many things make sense. Why women chose poor men? Because they are rewarded by welfare if they do. Why women divorce rich men? Because they get the rich men money anyway for leaving.\n\nThen it came to me.\n\nIf women want money, why not just pay?\n\nThink about it. Women has right to choose or reject any men she want. Men also have right, and I would say obligation, to make sure that his money don't go to women that don't choose him.\n\nIt seems that the simplest way to solve those two dilemma is to just pay.\n\nIf you marry you risk losing half your wealth\n\nI live in a country where prostitution is legal. Even though I am not interested in sex, I choose to pay for sex.\n\nWhy?\n\n1.  Well. Win win transactions build relationship\n2. I know women very quickly. I know how high her IQ is by paying women to do IQ tests. I know that she is willing to do sexy things for me. I know how much she will cost if I repeat order for life. \n3. I am not wasting money on women that doesn't like me. I can't pay them, whooosh, I am somewhere chasing others\n4. I can interview more women. More than 100. Hence, I am getting the smartest most beautiful women I can get.\n5. If I want more than sex, which is always the case, I just offer more money, or financial support if she gives me children.\n\nI did that and I quickly have another smart children. Another is in the oven. I definitely have more than women (something impossible if I marry). I spend at most 2-3% of my income for all those. My sugar babies cannot just leave me and take away half of my money.\n\nI am just thinking what people here think about it.\n\nWhy marry? Why let societies have any say on what is right or wrong? Why agree to lost half of your wealth in alimony? Why risk being forced to pay child support of children that's not even yours?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it's legally possible (I think it's legally possible but tricky), why not just make deals with women straight. Tell her how much she got for fucking, for giving you children, how much child support you are providing, BEFORE the child is even conceive.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nAll unfair laws toward men will matter less. None of it matter again if you make your own deal.

t00s9r	neutral	Grieving my former self: I\u2019ve been following FDS for a few years now after the end of a horrific situationship that had yet again left me with whiplash and my self-esteem in a free fall. I found FDS when I had hit rock bottom after being taken advantage of, unable to form or enforce boundaries, and totally unable to control my emotions. \n\nThrough the brutal advice given from the women here, therapy that focuses on boundary and trauma work, and deep self-reflection, I have emerged on the other side. I have practiced what is in the handbook (which interestingly enough has been eerily similar to what my therapist has been recommending even though I haven\u2019t mentioned FDS to her at all), uncomfortable self-love that included a complete break from dating and now not only understand my self-worth but have the tools to shut down disrespect, dehumanization, and abuse that extends beyond romantic relationships.\n\nThis work has allowed me to experience what respect, boundaries, and self-love truly looks like. I am currently dating a man who listens to me, respects me and my boundaries, can show attraction without degradation, and seems to truly value me for the person I am. And while I\u2019m happy (yet cautiously so) to finally understand what this feels like, I\u2019m also extremely sad. I\u2019m sad that the girl and woman I was raised to be tolerated and expected both abuse and disrespect. \n\nShe made so many excuses for the men who hurt her. She abandoned herself to make others comfortable. She absorbed the emotions of everyone around her to keep the peace. She disrespected herself to fit in. She let men decide what kind of woman she should be. \n\nI\u2019m sad that I am just now experiencing what should have been the bare minimum of decency in my romantic relationships. I\u2019m sad that my parents both forced me to be independent but didn\u2019t allow me to express boundaries or self-worth. I\u2019m sad that I was sent out into the world without the knowledge or tools to save me from abusive environments. I\u2019m sad that I allowed myself to stay in them for years. I\u2019m sad for the women I\u2019ve spurned and ignored who tried to help me, who told me I deserved better. \n\nI\u2019m sad for the woman I used to be, who didn\u2019t understand or know what respect and decency felt like. Who let others use her just because they could. The contrast between what I allowed, what I thought was love and respect, what I thought was normal is both stark and alarming. \n\nI grieve and mourn the woman I was. But I never want to be that woman again.
tbfjbs	ambivalent sexism	Are men in general more favor of traditional gender roles than women?: First of all I totally get it if you dislike traditional gender roles and don\u2019t think it\u2019s equal. But I also think it\u2019s ok to believe in traditional gender roles. And I think most men do as well. Actually I think most women do as well, but a lot of them say that they don\u2019t because they don\u2019t want to face backlash from feminists. But yeah, I as a man will prioritize my girlfriend/wife\u2019s life over mine. I do think that since women are biologically weaker, it is my responsibility as a man to protect the women in my life. Now, of course you don\u2019t have to agree with me, but this is how I think. And I believe most men and women do as well. But feminism paints this as some sort of evil narrative.

szrvr8	neutral	Confirmation of Female Dating Strategies + On Shy Men: Asian female who is open to all ethnicities and recently reentering dating \n\nWent on date with a Chinese-Malaysian guy today, he was half an hour late and then got cold feet, stated he was \"too shy.\" With tearful emojis. The cringe and lack of social skills...in retrospect, I realize it was a red flag that he couldn't lead a conversation at all. I learned that \"shy-ness\" used as an excuse to avoid responsibility, accountability, leadership is a huge red flag. I was basically ghosted because he was \"too shy.\" The man is 36. Even if it's a high quality date, if the guy is not high quality it's over. There's a reason why women desire positive, attractive masculine qualities of leadership, just because a guy is shy does not make him a more \"emotionally sensitive\" does not mean he is more thoughtful or caring partner. I am sure that the shyest guy will still go after women they're keen on and this is a painful lesson I learned in practice today. Reinforce the notion to never chase the guy.\n\nOn polar end, Chinese guy who aggressively pursued (even disrespecting significant boundaries) and pushy. Easily attractive, easily could have progressed relationship if he had half a decent human-seeming personality. It's probably the case that there are a lot of pick-me's out there tolerating and embracing this attitude and hooking-up, further enforcing his continued problematic behavior. Similar, on this end is the lovebombing. Comments like \"Marry me\" when I literally am just chatting with the person gives me so much suspicion. Do you block lovebombing-how do you respond to it?\n\nDisrespecting boundaries is a clear-cut no for me now. Pre-FDS me might have still considered this situation. I am so thankful for this subreddit and learning that some of the things that I didn't listen to was to my detriment. But by applying it, I did have some good dates too and open up more time for them. It's true, the saying: We accept the love we think we deserve. We settle too often for bad situations. Specifically, I just wanted to emphasizing avoiding \"shy\" guys who do not take the lead in the relationships and consequently make the women do all of the heavy-lifting emotionally in the relationship or use it as excuse to literally not show up for the women.\n\nI am still learning to apply, so feel free to comment more feedback on your experiences or if you noticed things about my interactions.

sp2r2g	institutional sexism	Why do you bother when the solution is so simple...: I guess it would probably defeat the purpose of this whole sub, but the solution to feminism is pretty simple in my view. 1. Don't date women in the west 2. Get married and have children in a patriarchal society The simple reason for this is as long as there is a democracy women will always vote themselves privileges, there's just nothing you can do about it and it's silly wasting your life waiting for the world to change. The only societies which will survive long term now are those which are totalitarian or patriarchal in nature, AKA no Democracy. Places like China, India, all the Muslim countries by and large either oppress their women or don't allow for democracy so that a patriarchal government is in charge, so they are the only nations with a growing demographic Sooner or later these nations will simply replace the native western one and the patriarchal culture will prevail while the west will fade into history as one epic failed experiment in "equality" in the mean time, why waste your life or fall on the sword having a family here? Just think ahead of the curve and go to the up and coming nations, support the patriarchal ideals there instead of wasting time fighting a losing battle. To end I'll just give you a strategy that I heard many Pakistani taxi drivers do here in Australia. Work half a year here to make their money, then spend half a year living like kings in Pakistan, supporting the economy there and having a large family with an obedient wife. These guys are some of the smartest people living here.
t2uuwu	hostile sexism	I'm having anxieties because of the coming women's day. In the past four years almost every day is men-battering day, and on the last women's day it became more of men-hating day, on social media and in newspapers. Have you been experiencing this anxiety these days?: I think it's a little like the reaction of a battered spouse to the hour when the battering spouse comes home. I feel a need to hide somewhere but after last year when the hate came out from everywhere I know there's nowhere to hide from this. I have been fantasizing a little on taking some kind of leave to somewhere where they speak a foreign language and there's no internet so I won't hear and read all the bashing and hating. I was lynched once, by feminists, badly (lost a job), just because of a post I published online, and I might be more sensitive than most, I don't know, I'm just sharing, in case someone also has these fears before women's day. I would love so much not be here on that day, and there's really isn't anywhere to go.

tbuhqn	neutral	Is he an asshole or is it Aspergers?: Disclaimer: I\u2019ve been wanting to make this post for awhile but do want to be sensitive to the topic itself. I recognize that Aspergers is no longer an accurate diagnosis and everything has been lumped into the category of Autism. Personally I don\u2019t agree with it being all under one umbrella term because the spectrum of Autism is so wide that having Asperger\u2018s as a differentiator was a valuable term. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAfter dating an engineer for 2 years and being emotional traumatized by the constant lack of affection, harsh words, and mistreatment I ended the relationship highly suspecting that he had Asperger\u2019s.  \n\nI went on a date last night with a guy who instantly gave me the exact same vibes as my ex. \n\nHe was incredibly negative, had a loud and unfriendly vocal tone, he avoided eye contact, was incredibly opinionated, stern, and had an overall grumpy vibe. \n\nI have been running into men like this for YEARS! \n\nIn general I am an intellectual and am attracted to intelligence. When I\u2019m dating online I tend to gravitate towards men who have a wide vocabulary and the ability to comprehend complex topics. So I gravitate towards men who text about their interests and hobbies and are clearly intelligent. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is I\u2019m seeing a pattern when I go to meet them. \n\nHave you ladies been on dates where you could describe the man is disgruntled. \n\nHe barely smiles, he comes across as an asshole but it\u2019s subtle. He\u2019s not necessarily an asshole to you but overall it\u2019s not a fun experience. The tone is heavy, he is mostly serious, not playful, etc. \n\nHere\u2019s an odd notice: He never validates what you say. \n\nI.e. The difference between him saying \u201cyes and\u201c (agreeing and approving of or validating what you said) versus \u201cyeah but\u201d (acknowledging you just said something but caring more about adding his thought then validating what you said.) Sometimes even to the point of literally saying what you just said but repeating it in different words as if it\u2019s different\u2026 while still not acknowledging your knowledge on the topic. \n\nHas anyone else run into this? \n\nHere is a list of Asperger Symptoms:\n\n- Inappropriate or minimal social interactions.\n\n- Conversations that almost always revolve around themselves or a certain topic, rather than others.\n\n- Not understanding emotions well or having less facial expression than others.\n\n- Speech that sounds unusual, such as flat, high-pitched, quiet, loud, or robotic.\n\n- Not using or understanding nonverbal communication, such as gestures, body language and facial expression.\n\n- An intense obsession with one or two specific, narrow subjects.\n\n- Becoming upset at any small changes in routines.\n\n- Memorizing preferred information and facts easily.\n\n- Difficulty managing emotions, sometimes leading to verbal or behavioral outbursts, self-injurious behaviors or tantrums.\n\n- Not understanding other peoples\u2019 feelings or perspectives.\n\nOr some other symptoms but these symptoms are directly related to how they can connect with or would effect other people.  \n\nAre there just a ton of men walking around with undiagnosed low-grade autism?\n\nI feel like the most unfortunate thing of all of this is that these men are not necessarily \u201cbad\u201d men they\u2019re just different. They\u2019re not Neurotypical people, and when you\u2019re neurodivergent without a diagnosis it can be an incredibly isolating and painful experience. \n\nThe biggest downside is people with these symptoms don\u2019t know how to socialize and often look for guidance or rules on how to behave. These men struggle with women and want to improve but when they go online they end up on forums like Reddit or listening to alpha male podcasts and following the guidance of predatory or manipulative men. \n\nIn some cases it ends up working out for them and they end up using these learned behaviours because it seems to work for them. They use the PUA and Alpha male tactics to neg women and get one to be their girlfriend BUT then they don\u2019t have a playbook on how to be a boyfriend so the relationship never works out. They get dumped, their confused, frustrated, and hurt because they DO ACTUALLY care but don\u2019t know how to show it.\n\nAll of this is just random thoughts that have been collecting in my brain for years.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nHow can men like this who are at their core, good people but end up hurting their partners get help?
t524p0	hostile sexism	Little tip for winning a debate against feminists: Just ask them what rights men have that women don't, I swear it has been like 7 years since I started debating political issues and they always fail to answer that question, they insult you or make up things like "the right to not being afraid" but never a rela answer, once they go berserk you won the discussion. Sounds dumb but it's simple and effective, they have no idea what are they "fighting" for. Try it and enjoy.
pdfjo5	benevolent sexism	My ex a single mom with kids.: I am a single male age 35 and I was dating a single woman age 32 for about 4 or 5 months who had two kids ages 9 and 7 both of them boys. While she was in college she dated a guy named Bradley who basically did a 3 and half year smash and dash and then he left her flat with two aforementioned kids. Anyhow I just recently came on the scene and fell instantly smitten because she looked totally hot in the gym in her workout yoga pants. So I asked her out and we started smashing within a few weeks after we started dating.\n\nShe was super great in the sack and could really do a number on me like you wouldn't believe. The only drawback is that she had two kids from a previous relationship with the aforementioned Bradley who is has had virtually no part in the kids life almost since they were born. Bradley is nowhere in the picture nor has really been in the past. So one day out of the blue after we had been dating for about 4 or 5 months she asked me to do something straight out of the left field that I really didn't anticipate. She asked me if I could take the kids to school that morning seeing as how she had an important presentation that she needed to make to the board of directors later that morning.\n\nI told her that I had to be at work too and that I didn't have time to drop her kids at school and get to my work location on time. She then said, \"please honey baby, I will make it up to you later on\". I asked her \"make it up to me how ?\" She said just do this one thing for me and I will do just about anything you ask. So I said to her how about making it up to me in the bedroom later on as she was a super hot chick who had all the right moves in the bedroom that would drive me crazy. So my little head was bigger than my big head and I agreed and drove the kids to school that morning. What a big mistake that was.\n\nSo I took the kids to school and got them into the car. We had gotten no more than about 400 yards down the street when these two little banshees started screaming and fighting with each other like two pit bulls fighting over a dog bone. One of the kids kicked a hole in the leather upholstery of the backside of the front side passenger seat. It got so bad that I had to pull the car over and to tell the kids to settle down because I could not concentrate on driving them to school if they were acting like this with them being totally out of control. That is when one of the kids looked me in the eye told me \"Eff you you are not my daddy you can't tell us what to do!\" I was flabbergasted had I talked back like that to my father when i was kid, my father would have cuffed upside the head and knocked smack talk right out of me on the spot muy pronto.\n\nThe next day I told my girlfriend about what happened and she cavalierly dismissed the whole thing by telling me that \"oh well kids will be kids, they just do that sometimes.\" When I didn't particularly like that answer from her she asked me,\"what would you have me do about it all\". I felt like saying to her how about you discipline your out of control kids for a change?\" Needless to say this relationship didn't last and we broke up shortly thereafter. I was wondering did I make the right decision because I still wonder about it now?  Since we broke up about 4 or 5 months ago she still keeps calling me wanting to get back together but I always politely refuse, I just don't think that I am up to the task of having a ready made family for me with two kids that are not my own but then again I miss how totally hot she was and how totally great she was in the bedroom. Should I go back to her, I don't know?

Please bear with me. I screwed up big time. We hadn't gotten sexual so I was still casually sleeping with other women and she was fine with it and I though nothing of it. (IDK if that makes me a fuckboi or not)\nShe brought up the fact that she never thought she could voice her opinions with me or even get angry at me. She says I have a tendency of talking to her everytime I need something. I can see why she'd say that.\nI hit on an ex. It was not innocent. And this ex and I have a lot of baggage. Writing it down I know EXACTLY what a deadbeat top tier toxic a-hole I seem like.\nWhen she found out it broke her.\nI can still picture her eyes. So much devastation. I wish I didn't hurt her.\nThis time around she completely losses it and tells me the following \"Isn't it ENOUGH that you're fucking four different women as it is?? Isn't it enough you make me earn your kindness, while I have to put hours and money and energy and so much love and leeway for yours? Do you even love me? Why did you go back to her? And this so fucked up because Samantha doesn't even care for you! And all I do is love you.\"\nThe conversation later down the line was not pretty. I feel numb and yet I feel all of the pain. Hers and mine. She blocked me. This was for the best.\n\nBut now I am here. Lost. Wondering. Did I just fuck up something with my soul mate and the best person I knew? Did I ever really love her.\n\nIs this fixable?
nqvfdz	hostile sexism	I admit, being an FDS woman would be tough: We all know who these girls are. Many subs poke fun at these type of women. They're all over r/cringe r/Tinder etc. They're the lonely women who significantly overestimate their value in the dating market. They're the 1s and 2s seeking 10s that everyone laughs about These are the women who are *way* past the point of ever being able to get a man they would think is good enough for them and they're in the process of reconciling with the realization that they'll be alone from this point on Their only other option is to accept that their male equivalent would be a man who looks like Ron Jeremy, living in a trailer park in Mississippi, on government assistance We have to realize that it is a tough pill for these women to swallow and try to be understanding Can you imagine looking in the mirror day after day, seeing yourself slowly decay... then getting on social media to see all the guys you went to school with just beginning to hit their primes, dating beautiful girls a decade younger than them? It would be brutal
syycgi	neutral	Please don't approach anybody's grown-ass son...: I've been seeing several males complaining across the internet about how women don't approach them and they think women should approach them more. Let me tell you why this is a horrible idea. I genuinely feel like men don't respect women who approach them AT ALL. And I also feel like men who are genuinely interested in a woman will go out of his way to pursue her PERIOD! If you find yourself having to initiate literally everything with a man all the time, that means he's not that interested and you should 100% move on. Also these men aren't being 100% honest either, they claim that they want women to approach them more and yet they think those women are desperate and low value and they also feel like the reason why those women have to approach men in the first place is because they are unattractive and don't have many options. I've had friends approach men and even I used to approach men in the past ( before I knew any better lol) and it always felt like I was putting in way more work than the male and always felt like I had to beg for his attention. The men that I've approached in the past don't put in nearly as much effort as the men that approach me and I also find that the males that I had to approach in the past were very passive and feminine now that I think about it....I cringe just thinking about how I used to act like that in the past, and I'm just so happy that I know better now...good Lord!
rgr0s6	hostile sexism	The only two groups of people that benefit from (straight) online dating: The only two groups of people that benefit from (straight) online dating.\n\n1.) All Women\n\n 2.) Extremely good looking men.\n\nIf you're not a 9 or 10 male specimen save yourself the trouble\n\nWhile it's true that you can find some limited success as the average male such as myself and many of you. The amount of frustration, headache, and WASTED time you sink is not worth ANY outcome.\n\nGo date out I'm the real world or go your own way (look up mgtow)\n\nIt will improve your mental health and overall make you a much happier person. Once you've come to the realization that relationships with a woman is super overrated and self-fulfillment is much more rewarding you will be 1000% happier with life.
t57jj2	neutral	What are the possibility that he\u2019s going to settle down?: Met this guy through Hinge. He works for the government/military with security and is always on the move. He doesn\u2019t stay longer than a few months on any assignments and work post. He\u2019s 28 ( three years older than me). He claimed to have been in 11 relationships. Two of which were serious. He got out of a two year relationship a few months ago and doesn\u2019t have any feelings for her. He isn\u2019t close with his parents. He\u2019s private on social media, but shared his info with me. It goes back to his high school days. I saw everyone of his girlfriends \u2026\n\nI\u2019m curious, what does FDS think of this guy? \nDo you think that after being in 11 relationships, is it possible for men like this to settle down?

To clarify what he has been doing lately he has called my cousins and just about every woman he comes across whores who will and I quote " Have fun with every man in the street till they hit 30" . I understand that equal legal rights on topics such as divorce laws and custody should be equalized as much as humanly possible and I advocate for equal rights but ever since he got his hands on mgtow through this subreddit he has been going crazy and I think he is about to go into the extremes if nothing happens to change him soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you guys please just provide some clarity for me so that I can better understand the situation. we are both in high school right now and I do not know what to do about him.

Go figure, a female dominated field talking about how great women are and how awful men are.\n\nI was a young adult and that class did harm to my self esteem.

t3pech	neutral	Is there any way to escape Ukraine if you are military age male? How about in general? How can you escape the country if men are barred from leaving the country?: I know that 18-60yo men have been banned from leaving the ciuntry but Poland and Romania are taking everyone in so they won\u2019t stop you. It\u2019s the Ukrainian troops that stop cars/trains and drag men out. \n\nMy question is basically how precisely do the Ukranian troops check cars for males? I live in a nearby country and if Russia decides to keep going I would like to have an escape path. I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my body when perfectly healthy childless women don\u2019t have to. If we any equality in society then it has to also apply to men and I will not accept us young men being treated as disposable trash. It makes no sense that for example a 45yo childless woman who has lived life already can leave but an 18yo guy like me who has yet to experience life has to stay.\n\nMy plan was basically to get my mom to drive our car. Then we fill the car up with all of our stuff that we would want to take with us. I would hope into the trunk and lay under all of our stuff and hide there. I doubt the troops would dig in to check if there was anyone under all of the stuff. If anyone knows if they do, please let me know. My mom would pretend to be a single woman since my dad would probably decide to stay and fight and not jump into the trunk like me.
o51rrn	neutral	The Dream Woman: My advice is strictly for people who are looking for a meaningful long-term relationship. If you are not willing to look at your flaws and fix them, then this post is not for you. TLDR at the end.\n\n**What to look for in a partner**  \n\nEveryone has an idea of the kind of partner they want in their life. When looking for a partner we have boundaries, standards, and preferences. It might be a good idea to list them down in a private location so you can refer to them later. Don't change them for the person you are dating.\n\n* Your boundaries are your deal breakers and the minimum you should get from someone including friendships.\n* Your standards are what you look for in a partner, and you are the only one that can decide what is good for you or not.\n* Your preferences are additional benefits; things that would be nice to have, but that you don\u2019t need.\n\nObviously, life isn\u2019t like \u201cbuild a woman/man\u201d. You should never make your partner change in a way that fits you. C*hanges have to come internally or they will never stick*. You do not want your partner faking your standards only to decide 10 years later that they are done pretending to be someone they are not. So NEVER try to change someone EVER.\n\n**DON\u2019T fake it till you make it**  \n\nThe goal of dating is not to \u201cwin over\u201d the other person at all costs, it\u2019s to determine whether you are a good match for each other or not. Do not pretend to be someone you are not. Even if you find the woman of your dreams, you may not be the man of her dream and it is not fair to her that you mislead her into thinking you are the one. **It is also unfair to yourself because faking will have its toll on you and your relationship will fail someday!!** Just think about this for a minute. If you truly love someone, you want their happiness right? Then why would you trick someone that you love into being in an unhappy relationship with you? Stop pretending to be someone you are not. The sooner she sees who you truly are, the sooner you can find out if you match each other, and the less time you will waste on a dead-end relationship.\n\n**Changing for who?**  \n\nNow you may be thinking \u201c*women what X-Y-Z type of guys so I got to show her these things*\u201d or \u201c*dating is a competition so I have to show her what she wants to win.*\u201d Now there is a solution for this, and it is not the easy way. This is hard because it will give you the best result.\n\nWhen you think about the dream woman, try to think about what her dream man is like. **Be realistic and flexible.** Then make that a goal for yourself. Like I said above, changes come internally, so you have to want this for yourself. Don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that someone is going to like you just the way you are if you make no effort to better yourself. You have to look at yourself with truth glasses and work on your flaws. **Make sure that you meet the boundaries and standards that you set for others.** *Do not date anyone until you have met that goal and that you live it without having to think about acting this way or correcting yourself.* That\u2019s when you know that it has been internalized and that you are not faking it.\n\n**I want to make this crystal clear. We are not talking about changing yourself for a specific person. The dream woman is an idea. It is not a person. Your idea of a dream woman should be flexible so that multiple women become options to you. Don\u2019t build your dream woman based on one woman, build her based on your experiences with multiple different women.**\n\n**Physical Standards**  \n\nYou can have physical standards all you want, but make sure you can deliver too. Don\u2019t dwell on the things you cannot change like your height or voice, but instead focus on things you can control, like your physical fitness and appearance (ex: cleanliness, grooming habits, wardrobe, etc.).\n\n**Focus on yourself, not what others are doing. If you don\u2019t fit a woman\u2019s standards, then move on; she is not the one for you.**\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. Have boundaries, standards, and preferences.\n2. Don\u2019t try to change someone into your dream woman.\n3. Dating is for finding a match, not trapping someone with you.\n4. Be the dream man of the dream woman.\n5. Work on yourself to be the best person you can be.\n6. The dream woman is a flexible idea, not a static person.\n7. Deliver equivalent physical standards to the ones you want from women.\n8. Don\u2019t try to change people\u2019s standards so you can fit them.
oy0qaf	neutral	Is Tinder a waste of time? What to do an what not to do.: So I've been dicking around with this app for a while and it kinda is one thing that fds has somewhat right Ive made multiple test accounts to see what works and what doesnt but the one thing that is for sure: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON LOW EFFORT PROFILES. Profiles with nothing in the bio are 95% fake and those with just insta or snap are just looking for followers and will NEVER and I mean NEVER interact with you. Now if by chance you do happen upon a real profile that is low effort high picture quality these people are a waste of time anyway getting them to message back is way to much work as they have nothing invested in the app. Stay away from lazy profiles like: LOVES DOGS HURR DURR HURR lol. But BRO I HAVE NO MATCHES. Yes and this is partly why apparently tinder's algorithm favors those who get matches and interactions and convos. If you are constantly liking fake girls profiles and those who will never talk to you, you go to the bottom of the pile. So no real girl will even see you.\n\nTravel surprisingly travel seems to put you at the top of the pile in each area you visit and you will get matches at an increased rate almost as if your algorithm rating is reset for the area.\n\nIf you live in an area with low population you might as  well not bother with tinder as matching will be a paiiiin.\n\nSo now we've talked about a lot of don'ts what are some doos.  First thing is first your pictures aren't the most important thing your bio is. Women read a lot of profiles, they consume porn in the fashion of reading as well so you need to write something interesting or funny. One bio I used was: Serial killer or nice boy to take home to mom lets go on a date and find out. now this brang interactions from curvy girls (lets just be real they were huge not curvy) but they will be too scared to actually go out with you but some of the convos were funny. Another one I though of after watching a podcast by joey diaz. The whole thing is a joke about being way to tall sex and drugs Also about being so obscenely rich only a moron would think it was real. This one was a money maker and the matches proved this I always used all the same pics and the matches always went massively up or down depending on bio, matches an interactions.\n\nSo now you think you've matched with a real girl what can we talk about a \"dad joke\" or something might work but they are getting tired and used to them. Using a hook is a waste of time because ive found if they cant hang for a bit of small talk your ass is grass the second they stop dying laughing at your messages. Dont pester them with question 3 messages max without their reply then just wait. \n\nOpeners like hey how was your day today and then transitioning into something funny ive found more effective becuse if they are willing to do small talk then they ACTUALLY might like you. So how can we grease it along to something more sexy maybe. It may sound juvenile as fuck but 20 questions just mention the game I have no idea why it works but its very effective. Hopefully you can meet the girl before this but this will keep shit going you can lead with some easy questions like favorite colour hobbies then after about number 10- 15 when ideas are running low you can default to a sex question like favorite position.\n\nAnyway this is a small guide from using tinder for 3 years Also take a vacation  girls love travelling boys.

smleqz	hostile sexism	How to deal with feminists on this sub: I noticed a lot of feminists coming on this sub to "discuss" their issues. I always appreciate people trying to talk, but I believe this sub was created to allow men to talk about their own issues created by feminism. If we need an open debate about feminism, we could find a different place. This is my opinion and I will always block every person who openly identifies as a feminist or regularly posts feminist ideas in any other sub. On this sub I want to focus on real issues men face and I will not empower any feminist to promote their toxic agenda.
smbhuh	interpersonal sexism	modern feminism at its finest: So my instagram account got banned because my friends mother (who was extremely abusive) won a child custody case even though there was blatant evidence that she was abusive, his father wasn't abusive at all and had no criminal history other than a few demerits on his license. He put a thing on his story explaining the whole story (his account also got banned) and I screenshotted and put it on my story with the caption "modern feminism at its finest" witch is extremely irritating for me because I just wanted to bring awareness for the situation and try and get him back with his father. He's currently living with me and my parents after running away but his mother is trying to take him back. It's this sort of behaviour that led to this sub being made.
sqsq1j	neutral	This group is not Anti Feminist: I have not seen any posts about problematic issues with the feminist movement such as hatred toward men and not much effort to make men and women equal when it comes to custody, child support, alimony, criminal sentencing etc. It is constant hatred toward all women, the entire LGBTQ community and anyone that is not a cisgender straight white male. The majority of the hatred is people pushing easily disproven propoganda. There are so many men here acting as if more women lie about rape than they actually do. Only 2 to 5 percent of sexual assault accusations in the past several years have been false and only 36 percent of sexual assaults are reported. The amount of men that never face the music for it is far greater than the men falsely accused. Men love to act as if women make false rape accusations more than other false crime accusations which is not true at all. The rate for false criminal accusations have been 3 to 10 percent for all crimes. Black men account for the majority of false accusations and are 7x more likely to be found guilty when innocent than a white man. Black men are also given 20 percent longer prison sentences than white men and even though drug use is equal between races they're still 4x more likely to go to jail for it. The majority of men I have clicked on when they comment something false or hateful had been commenting racist bullshit on other subs but theyll act as if they're the ones facing all of the worst discrimstion of the justice system when they are only a small percentage of it and are treated better in every area than minorities that are men just like white women are treated better than minorities that are women. I believe in men's rights and feminism both because I believe in equality and believe there are disparities that need talked about for both sides but I can't stand the hatred of both men and women and using proven lies to spout hatred. If there are actual facts to back up the claims then I have no issue with criticism of groups and discrimation. Here are a few things I keep seeing that is also false: 1. The people claiming the gay choir sings about pedophilia and have a pedophilia agenda are insane. Statistics and studies show that 90 percent of child predators target children in their family or network. Several studies and the statistics show that gay men and straight men target children at the same rate and that both types of men are responsible for the vast majority of pedophiles. Men married to women are the group that accounts for more pedophilia than single men, gay single man or gay married men even though straight and gay men are child predators at the same rate. The only study done that claims otherwise did not include all of the child predators, cherry picked data to fit their narrative and had severe bias. It was done by a group that has frequently pushed homophobic and sexist theories as fact. The same group were the ones that pushed the idea that you could only get aids from gay sex and it wasn't possible to get it otherwise. They claimed it was a punishment from God and not a contagious medical problem. Studies also show that straight men and gay men both get aroused by children at the same rate as well, not just the same as acting on it. 2. There is an orgasm gap for straight men and women even though men here claim there is not. Straight men get off the most and straight women get off the least with gay men and women in between them. 98 percent of men get off from sex alone and consistently but only 8 percent of women orgasm from sex alone and get orgasms the majority of time they have sex. The majority of women need clitoral stimulation before or during to orgasm but only 50 percent of men know where the clit is. It isn't the bulb in the middle. Oral sex severely increases the chance of orgasm but straight men give oral sex less than any other group and the ones that do only do it for a short time. Straight men are the most likely to get upset or offended when their partner communicates that something does not feel good, they like things better a certain way or that they're sexually dissatisfied. 3. Cherry picking and double standards when you claim things as facts does not actually make them true. Several men said women cheat more and have more sex partners now than men on average. They also said women with a high body count is more likely to be u faithful. Both men and women with a high body count are more likely to cheat. Deep studies show that when asked about sexual partners by others and for studies most women counted every single partner so they could be accurate, didn't count rape and were less likely than men to cheat. Only 1 percent of women have over 35 sexual partners and a fraction of them have more than 50. They also show that men are much more likely greatly exaggerate, estimate higher than their number actually I'd and more likely to cheat. The facts show that the majority of people that men are hateful and sexist more than women. It is hypocritical to create a group against hatred of men to push the hatred of every other person that isn't a straight white man.

t4vjnl	hostile sexism	What is feminism?: By the very definition, feminism is essential equal rights for women. Which by all means I think is fair, as long as it's equal for both sexes. But the problem with feminism these days is that women are seeing other feminists on social media and jumping on the band wagon without any real understanding. I have not once seen a feminist back up what they say with proper facts. Things like the gender pay gap which has been proven to be inaccurate is fact. And feminists never seem to counter the argument. They just change the subject like being "oppressed by the PaTrIArChY" I have NEVER heard a feminist answer questions about the court system, higher suicide rates for men, more violent crimes against men, less education opportunities for men. If they want equality then things need to be equal. Which they are not. I would love to see a feminist actually specifically say what is not equal, and back it up with facts without diverting the conversation. They seem unable to clearly explain with facts and logic the points they are trying to make. It just seems like they end up insulting men who question them or call other woman "PiCk Mes" when they can't actually debate with facts. I'm sure there is inequality. This happens with both sexes, I agree in equality, but I have no idea what it is they actually want because they just go off on mad rants.

t2c6fk	neutral	SAHM vs career.: Hello everyone,\n\nA couple months ago I made a post on having baby fever. This hasn\u2019t gone away at all. It has actually gotten worse now that I\u2019m considering being a SAHM. I am very in love with my fianc\u00e9 and I am seriously considering trying for a baby with him the summer of next year when we get married. I am 19 and he is 20. I am in college right now and having doubts about going to medical school as well. I don\u2019t feel I am self sabotaging with these thoughts or anything. If I continue what I\u2019m doing right now I will go to medical school in the fall of next year.\n\nWe\u2019re living together and  everything has been perfect. I love waking up and going to sleep with him every night. Every day is like a fun little adventure and I\u2019m really happy with him. I love all how he protective he is, how he takes care of me, and how he loves and worships me and treats me like a queen. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening with me, my body. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling how much I desire a baby with him. Things have always been very intimate between us since we met, but somehow things continue to get hotter and more intimate. I can\u2019t get my hands off of him. So I would be lying if there wasn\u2019t a romantic reason behind my desire of starting a family with him. It is very obvious that he has all the qualities that will make him an amazing father.\n\nI also feel that it also logically makes sense. We\u2019ve spoken about finances extensively since we will be married soon. He used to not disclose anything financial before. But now we talk about it/he shows me it open. To sum it up, I  can be a SAHM as my job permanently  as he\u2019s been successful in his ventures. I\u2019ve talked to him about all of what I\u2019m feeling. He says that it ultimately is my choice and he is supportive of whatever I decide to do, whether it\u2019s going to med school and having a baby when my career is established like we had planned earlier, having a baby and being a SAHM. He also mentioned that I don\u2019t really have to choose. I can go to med school and we can still have a baby pretty soon. Many women have a baby during the last year of med school, which is a little more relaxed than the first 3 years. \n\nBut I\u2019ve also had some doubts about going to med school. Sometimes I find myself studying for an exam or something, and I just ask myself what am I doing? When what I truly want is to be a SAHM. There are other shorter more child friendly  careers like nursing I can do, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to sell myself short. I also want to be a doctor at the same time too. I\u2019ve wanted to be a doctor ever since I was little. And of course having a baby right now would make the pathway to being a doctor harder. I know this all sounds confusing but this is just how I feel currently.\n\nThere is also a risk of course in being a stay at home mom. He is clearly in love with me right now and has been throughout the more than 2 years we\u2019ve been together.But this can change. Maybe in the future he\u2019ll wake up and ask himself why he committed to someone so early in his life, or he wakes up from the spell that is love and decides he wants to play the field and find someone prettier, smarter. I try my best to be attractive for him. I\u2019m in the best shape of my life, and he has some  fetishes like lingerie and feet which I go along with. But I like it though. Of course if he gets bored of me it\u2019s not really on me. It\u2019s more on him and I can\u2019t really do anything about it. But it would suck to be a SAHM and in 5 or 10 years he gets bored and I get screwed  out of child support for some unknown reason. Then i would be stuck without the love of my life and have no job prospects as my bachelors degree is useless with our child. So there is some risk to this.\n\nIf I were to \u201cfollow my heart\u201d right now I would tell him I want to start trying literally right now. Of course I won\u2019t do this as this is immature and irresponsible. I can wait till we get married. But I also know at the same time, like he said, that I don\u2019t really have to choose, I can be a doctor and we can still have a baby pretty soon. So I don\u2019t really have to choose or compromise on anything. I would just like some outside advice on this. It\u2019s not really a bad problem to have. Other  people will have more severe problems they have to deal with I know. I\u2019m just feeling a little confused and would like some outside advice. Thank you for reading.

t27sqj	internalized sexism	The grooming of girls and women: This all started when I was overhearing a man in his 30s about how he hooked up with an 18 year old college student. \u201cShe was VERYY adventurous\u201d he mentioned many times. I guess she lived with her parents, so she stayed with him for a week, invited another girl over, and it was a good week for him. \n\nNow here\u2019s the thing, I believe him. I believe she wanted to explore and be aDventUrous. \n\nI went through that phase. I heard other girls go through that phase. And in the moment, it does feel like exploring sexually with men is so liBerAting. But it\u2019s all lies. \n\nGirls have been swallowing sex aka porn that is for men\u2019s pleasure since they were practically born. Media, advertising, pop culture, self-help books, lib feminism, etc. First we tell girls they should be ashamed of their body and sexually, and then we tell them, don\u2019t be ashamed, go have as much sex and that\u2019s empowering. IT IS ALL THROUGH MALE LENS. \n\nWHERE DO GIRLS LEARN ABOUT SEX? They learn about it through pornified men. The clothes, the magazines, the tv shows. Please men. Be sexy for men. Sex is jackhammering. Sex is getting a guy off. Sex is sucking a guy\u2019s dick. You\u2019re sexy if you can make a man hard. Men need sex. And you need sex too! Sex is over when a man cums. Not feeling in the mood? You need to get yourself in the mood. Or maybe try different things, different men, learn what you like! \n\nWe need women-centered sexual wellness and wellbeing. Yes girls should explore, IN HEALTHY WAYS. but all we have for them are awful ways of men who are just going to use them. And we need them to learn about their bodies. How they can derive pleasure. And they can and should start with themselves, not have a pornified man try to teach them what they like. Especially in this society. \n\nIT\u2019S SCARY WHEN I SEE GIRLS SEXUALIZE THEMSELVES - posting thirst traps, dressing thirsty, buying all the f-cking lingerie to look sexy. Trying everything sexually with men. IT\u2019S LIKE THEY DON\u2019T HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF SELF. Their whole sexual identity has been formed by men\u2019s fantasy of using them as a sex object.\n\nBUSINESSES HIRING YOUNG PRETTY GIRLS \n\nTHAT CATER TO MEN, OLD MEN, OR LOW SELF-ESTEEM WOMEN\n\nrestaurants, Hooters, strip clubs, modeling, service industry, secretaries, and more that exploit and profit off of young girls. \n\nWOMEN EXISTING FOR THEIR YOUTH OR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE - I heard a man tell his daughter who was studying nursing that  \"it\u2019s nice to see a pretty girl when you're going through a hard time\". A year ago a male friend (26yo) told me why he liked women \u201cthey are pretty to look at\u201d and \u201cthey make me feel good\u201d. Sums it up. \n\nWOMEN ARE NOT OKAY AS THEY ARE - I was in a waiting room and man after man coming through looked awful. They were their natural selves. Didn\u2019t put much into their appearance. They could live their lives and go through their days not really giving a f\\*ck about what they look like. I see a couple women come in, make up on, styled clothes, SMILES, accommodating gestures, trying to be pretty but keeping it toned down. It became so clear. How women ARE NOT OKAY as their natural selves.  \n\nYOUNG GIRLS AND OLDER MEN - They\u2019re taking advantage of you. I don\u2019t care what fantasy or belief about yourself that you think makes you different, or smart, or cool, or woke. He. is. taking. advantage. of. you. He might not get what he wants in the end. But he\u2019s gonna try. He\u2019ll try by being nice, being encouraging, supportive, making you feel good, being generous. And then that\u2019ll make you feel like you\u2019re in control. But you\u2019re not. And you probably won\u2019t realize it until years after your relationship ends.\n\nEvery single young women I know, and there are many in the media, come out after having dated a much older man, and realized that the guy was super low value. Healthy older men don\u2019t date younger women. \n\nOlder men like younger women because they want to explore sexually with you because you don\u2019t know how low value they are, and you don\u2019t know yourself well enough. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWomen are being sexualized. I would go as far to say that we have been sexualized and objectified so much so that the vast majority of us don\u2019t even know the extent of it. \n\nThis can be changed by valuing and radically acting to the concerns of women that have been ignored for as along as I know. And there\u2019s a whole group of people that hold power and privilege that don\u2019t care to do that. And girls and women, in turn, don't value themselves.
o0m6go	ambivalent sexism	Men\u2019s advice. If you\u2019re hung up on one person who is not invested in you, think of the regret you will eventually have over the precious time, opportunities, and emotional energy you wasted: There were several girls in college that I spent far too long being fixated on, girls who weren\u2019t even that spectacular or beautiful as I look back now. However, when in the haze of lust (which guys will confuse with love), these girls were the end all-be all.\n\nWith some life experience behind me and some wisdom, it seems insane now to focus your emotionally currency on one single person for a year or more, especially when you\u2019ve never been in a relationship with that person.\n\nHowever, this is undoubtedly the biggest mistake men make when it comes to attraction and dating - we deeply invest our emotions far too soon with someone we don\u2019t know well. We fantasize about a life with them and our perception of their good and bad traits are misaligned with reality. Putting it simply, shit gets too serious, too soon.\n\nIf you are invested too heavily in someone, and they aren\u2019t as receptive, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of chasing this person, or an idealized version you have of them in your head.\n\nIf you are on this path, visualize yourself over the next few years being devoted to this person who does not value you. Imagine yourself finally coming out of the fog, while they\u2019ve disposed of you emotionally long before.\n\nThink of all the amazing people you could have met, the happiness and emotional freedom you could have enjoyed in that time period.\n\nIt\u2019s a cliche, but time is precious. Your time should be valued more than any idealized, emotionally distant person that treats you as afterthought. Only spend your time and energy on those who value you.
t1unux	hostile sexism	Men hiding women they are dating : Sex and the City (spoilers): I started watching sex and the city (lol) and right of the bat, I don't like Carrie Bradshaw very much, she is a pick-me of the highest magnitude. But this post is less about her and more about the dismal situation of dating in big cities like NYC. \n\n\nIn one of the episodes titled \"secret sex\", a male friend of Carrie's confides in her how the woman he's dating who's (in his own words) \n\n1. Smart\n2. Incredibly sweet\n3. The sex is the best sex he's had\n\nBUT isn't gorgeous enough for him to imagine a life with and hence he wouldn't introduce her to his friends or be seen in public with her. \n\nThis isn't something new/ ground breaking, I have been on the receiving end of it unfortunately and it honestly baffles me. Men would continue to date you \"in the meantime\" EVEN marry you while all the while thinking he can do better -- PHYSICALLY. \n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, is Charlotte (another of the main characters) who ends up with a man WAY out if her league physically, she's absolutely gorgeous but the guy is unfit, hairy and bald. She marries him and has a family with him. \n\nThe double standards are where it gets me. MeN aRe viSUaL CreATurEs, evolutionarily? Socially? Culturally? BIOLOGICALLY? \n\n(The worst part is, I have deigned myself enough to date men who were physically beneath me and THEY WERE AS MUCH OF AN ASSHOLE AS THE 6'+ MUSCULAR ONES, if not MORE. Except I didn't date them KNOWING it was going nowhere and to hide them.)\n\nAh, perhaps women actually treat men as humans while expecting the same is too much to ask, clearly. \n\nI *wish*, men stopped viewing women as guilty pleasure objects they wouldn't be caught dead with. Like hiding a bar of chocolate from people you'd want to think highly of you. \n\nAnyways, this was my opinion, what do you ladies think about this dynamic?

I understand the crucifixtion of christ for his blasphemy. That only people who are crazy enough to believe in ghosts would truly believe that a poper could ever make anything of themselves. As a male, what is the purpose of my existence other than to serve the lord. How do I cope with such a dreary existence hoping that the lord blesses me with a new toy, or a faux wife. I received the mark at such a young age, and I tried fighting for good, but god resorted to nonsense, and claimed they were ok with being irrational and incomprehensible, when I looked for god elsewhere I received the same sisyphean response, and at such a young age I didn't dare to threaten/resort to violence for that would further prove the already alleged sinful nature bestowed upon me. It seemed like a catch 22, where the only escape would be silence. People say it's never too late to repent until you're dead, and that through god all things are possible but I am dying, I'm balding, I feel weak, I fear that the kingdom of heaven is upon me. I ask here because other Christian subreddits just seem to be full people as lost as I am, or simply telling me I need to accept the life given to me.

I own an espresso machine, tea maker, &amp; nitro cold brew keg. I do daily walks with my dog in the trail behind my house.\n\nI had naively assumed that clearly stating my standards and clearly stating why I find both pointless would have been met with, \"oh yes, ofc, that makes sense.\" But no.\n\nInstead, I find myself playing a fun game of waiting for a man to stubbornly push a coffee/walk date anyway. So I wish them a solid, \"good luck with that\" and unmatch and carry on. \n\nI just so confused how they expect their requests to be met. Do they honestly just think I'm going to turn around and be like, \"oh yea, turns out I am a very silly woman who had no idea she really just wanted a quick jaunt in the woods with you, a stranger, (omg and your dog tho - I've never seen one as cute as yours) and/or to be quizzed on my cafe knowledge for a half hour until you determine that I'm \"good enough\" to be razzle-dazzled with Real Food\u2122! Thank goodness you came into my life and proved my standards to be pointless. I'm very happy to do the walk/coffee date after all!\"\n\nJust truly...

t67chs	hostile sexism	Laura Trott UK MPs comments during todays prime minister questions": She stood up to say something which was so ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s been hours since then but I\u2019m still thinking about it so maybe sharing it will help.\n\nThis is a rephrasing, but in essence she said that we need to make sexual violence an off-limit part of war. She demanded that there by some kind of treaty or international agreement or something which would mean sexual violence cannot be used during war as it often is. She also said that women are the hardest hit by wars because acts like this go up in wartime.\n\nI would say that men dying in their millions in almost every single war ever are maybe a bit more harder hit. Bare in mind these are wars they are forced to go into, while women stay at home. Sometimes they are emotionally and physically scarred - but most of the time alive. \n\nIt surprised me because in a war where people have died in their thousands she felt so strongly about an issue which we have no evidence is happening.

ouwctx	neutral	What general skincare advice do you have for men with objectively unsightly skin conditions?: The title pretty much.\n\nI.e. cystic acne, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, hives, urticaria etc\n\nI say unsightly because I know from personal experience as I have been previously diagnosed with either seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis (conflicting diagnoses from 2 different dermatologists doesn't really help things lol) and know how much it affects a mans confidence in daily activities and how humbling these conditions are.\n\nJust from personal experience, dermatologists are really hit or miss and in the end you're really just better doing your own research on products/ skincare routines (It's a lot of trial and error and also money down the drain but ultimately worth it, if it means less stressing over products being used, how it looks and not to mention the pain associated with it); If I had know the aforementioned I would've personally gone to an allergist at the very beginning but I digress. \n\nIf there's something I'd recommend to any man, is to get yourself a new set of pillows, mattress protector (ideally hypoallergenic and antibacterial) and its not exactly necessary but helps nonetheless to invest in some new sheets, blankets and pillow cases. \n\nI can't quite comment on actual skin care products as I know it varies from person to person and depends on what's available in your region. \n\nThough, I do typically use the FolliculitisScout.com ingredient checker for good measure and by all means check it out if you're unsure of the ingredients in your cleanser, moisturiser, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc. \n\nI can't quite think of much else apart from diet (I mainly stray from red meats, nightshades, onions, garlic excess sugar etc), very similar to the aip diet but not exactly.

tc6a8l	neutral	If you\u2019re emotionally recovering from dumping a LVM, avoid listening to sad love songs: Not only would a man never listen to sad love songs thinking about you while crying his heart out, but doing so may cloud your judgement as the lyrics of many popular sad songs are often placing the man on a pedestal and highlighting how the woman was the one who wronged him.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to play these types of songs if you made the (RIGHT) decision of dumping a LVM, it is often a very bad idea as you may start seeing him through rose-coloured glasses and forget what he did to you or start questioning whether you should have given him another chance.\n\nWhile playing happy songs may come unnatural and you don\u2019t have to force yourself to do that, just stay far away from any sad breakup songs until you have healed to ensure you don\u2019t fall back down the slope of wanting that man back in your life.\n\nAnd always remember that men will never be up at night playing sad songs and crying that they lost you!
sutdfr	neutral	Fake Breakup/Breakup Prank: I've seen this countless of times, that women prank about breaking up by building a whole history or breaking up with no reason given (just for a prank or they own enjoyment), so the reason being I put the advice tag is that as men, we must know that to handle a situation we must be calm, we must be in **control** **of our words and action,** and when we do that and we get thrown in situations like this, when they go like: \u2014I feel like breaking up/I don\u00b4t feel the love/ I don't get that much attention.\n\nWe must seek to know why in a calm way, and if you see solution and she doesn't, make her understand and explain her what can work out, if she still insists, accept it and just say \"okay, fine\" in the calmest tone of voice. That can get her to back off, the difference with what I said and what we usually see and what they want is so we get in a state of **reaction,** were we act like how they want and so we don't have the control no more of our lives nor the relationship. So that's why its importante to not react and just to reply.
t6bzfx	neutral	One of our basic needs as men; as human beings is physical contact with other humans. But we are being deprived of this right.: I am from a Western European EU Mediterranean country and it is in our culture to be very tactile when we are speaking with someone. Hugging people we've just met and kissing on both cheeks is normal for us.\n\nSome years ago I rented out a place with [booking.com](https://booking.com) \\- I always hugged (very briefly) guests when they arrived. This went on for years. Once [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) phoned me and told me that 2 girls had reported that I had abused them. These were 20 somethings and like everyone else who visited I gave them a brief hug and told them 'welcome home.' My wife was there with me and she hugged them too.\n\nI really could not understand whom I had abused! I have no idea what these girls told [booking.com](https://booking.com) but they were quickly taken away and my property was delisted.\n\nThey took away a source of income from me.\n\nOn another note - I sometimes feel the need for human 'contact' - it could be my son 'wrestling' me, my wife holding my hand, a bear hug from a friend, or the gentle hug of my father.\n\nMy grandmother spent her last couple of years in a home - at first glance she lacked nothing - but when I visited her and then I was preparing to leave she would hug me and not let go. Now I can start to understand what she must have felt.

tdwqf8	institutional sexism	How to deal with men at work harassing you for not approaching women?: This is something i struggle with at a public workplace where I don't like to approach or catcall women like the majority of my coworkers do. I had a break up 5 years ago and i decided to be single and work on myself, enjoyed and loved myself, can't say i succeed in the latter, but some coworkers have noticed me not approaching every single fucking woman in there, and their words about how I'm \"not a man\" and will die single, and because of my looks and good character i should have been in a relationship get to me hard. I brush it off, but it fucking hurts and and frankly, i started to believe them, the thing is, I'm a shy introverted person and have tremendous social anxiety, i was only able to be in short term relationships because in those moments i felt normal and good, and have trust issues from some toxic ones. I was at peace with myself a couple of years ago, but now i developed fomo and feel like I'm wasting my 20s because I'm not in a relationship, or more specifically, trying to be a degenerate with non existing self respect like them. Anyone in the same boat? How to deal with this?

t52s6l	neutral	Nice Guy Syndrome in Women- Why Women Get Played: So it\u2019s not the only reasons but it\u2019s one of the bigger ones: \n\nUnspoken Contracts\n\nIn their mind they\u2019re determine- I\u2019ll be his rock on xyz problem and in return he can/ should/ *whiny voice* iT wOuLd bE NiCe iF hE\u2019d- help me raise my kids, give my son a father like figure in his life etc etc. But the contract they\u2019re throwing on this person is only in their mind and hasn\u2019t really even been spoken or agreed to by the other party. It\u2019s a form of heavy projection, like men do to us all the time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also a fools game that\u2019s putting the horse before carriage. In that youre already paying into the person while merely *assuming* they now *have* to give xyz just because they\u2019re taking it.\n\nIf you think about it- it\u2019s a bit pushy and entitled under the guise of giving. Like it\u2019s entitled but not in the male way of just expecting people should give to and serve you without your doing anything- but in a distinctly female way of thinking i\u2019ll just stuff this money in your hand and that should be enough. I\u2019m taking the vase now- only it wasn\u2019t even for sell and you\u2019d know that if you\u2019d asked.\n\nI encounter this code of assumed reciprocity a lot in the older women I work with and I think it has to do with an old nice girl socialization. I\u2019ve notice will lead by giving you things you didn\u2019t ask for and maybe didnt even want- insisting to go to lunch together, giving you advice etc. In their mind they\u2019ve determined i can help her with advice as a younger person, how not to do things wrong etc etc but oftentimes the advice being offered on life or even how to do the job or obvious things that anyone would know and not benefitting you the way they think, it\u2019s just a guise to put something in your hand so they can demand something back- your time, attention friendship, help not to feel lonely in life etc. And they get very angry if you don\u2019t seem to take to it, even if you aren\u2019t rude- just not particularly interested. It may not even be a good trade for you. And they don\u2019t realize the problem that you can\u2019t just go- I give you this and you must give me that.\n\nI think this same thinking of assumed reciprocity is at the heart of a lot of bad male-female relationships.\n\nAnd this is not to say the woman is at fault because men often know what they\u2019re doing when they just take take take but women who do this also bear some small responsibility themselves for the assumptions they make. No one told you to lead with giving without being sure of what you\u2019d get in return or not having really discussed it with anyone\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a form of nice guy syndrome- to then turn around and be upset like I\u2019m angry because I was so nice to them and they were then such a bitch to me! Like men who turn to yelling abuse because \u201cFine. Bitch! I was just trying to be nice to you\u2026\u201d

t3oizl	neutral	We need to talk about exit strategies for those of us with LVM.: **This post isn't particularly directed to abusive situations, but more of just realizing the man is Lvm /man child and you want to leave,  but its not always that easy. ***\n\nFDS should be having more discussions and strategies to guide women on how to get out of these stickier situations. I can only speak of what I know for the US, but let's start a discussion sharing the resources and tips we know for other readers. \n\nThe first step is accepting and understanding the nature of your situation with the LVM. Prepare yourself to move out. This means getting an understanding of the lease you're in, or getting a better understanding for how selling the house you both own would work. For leases, you would have to read through the agreement and see what the terms are. When does the lease end? What are the terms for moving out early? How soon ahead do you need to notify the landlord? These are all things to find out, and you ask your landlord questions. Do you have bills on your name there for utilities?\n\nIf you're young, maybe you moved in with a guy but he never put you on the lease. Or you're living in his house, but there's no lease or anything. In that case you'd be free to go whenever pretty much. But in many states he would also be able to kick you out any time. \n\nFor marriages I don't even know how that works but I would advise getting a divorce lawyer. What are your shared assets? Cars, property, joint accounts, etc. Prenups? Pets?\n\nIn any of these situations though I would start by getting information and keeping these things to yourself. You need to look at yourself financially - start setting aside money and save it up to prepare yourself for moving out, the financial costs of a divorce, etc. You need to have your own bank account that he does not have access too. Do not use joint accounts. Don't give him money. You can protect yourself further by monitoring your credit cards (many have an option to give you a notificayion to approve or decline each transaction) and changing the pin on your debit cards. \n\nYou will also need to look at your housing options. Do you have a family member or friend that is willing to let you live with them? What apartments are available that you would be willing to move into, what are the prices and requirements? You can also look into women's shelters and reach out to community agencies to see what resources they have and if you qualify. There's also extended stay hotels with small kitchenettes and laundry as another option- I stayed in one for 2 weeks as I was moving into my house- they didn't check my credit or employment - if you can pay and a rooms available you're in. If you book online for a week or month at a time the price is cheaper. The extended stay is pricey for the rate it costs there to stay for the month is the rate it costs me to rent a 2 bedroom apartment plus the utilities. \n\nWhere are you working? Generally speaking it's easier to get an apartment when you have 3 months of work history, usually shown via paystubbs. Maybe he's really controlling and \"doesn't let you work\" or drive, look into getting a work from home job like customer service calls as an option to bank up some money and give yourself employment history on paper. \n\nDuring the process of planning your exit detach from him gradually. To make this easier, have a people that can support you. Have that friend you can call or a family member. Look into a support group or therapist. You need to talk less to the lvm, and stop telling them the details of your life, your worries, etc. When he does make conversation dont provoke him- generally speaking treat him more like a work colleague- keep it lighter, more casual, not specific. Stick to small stalk or just keeping it business. You don't need to tell him tne funny thing that just happened at the grocery store - keep professional and just ask him where he put the trash bags. If possible spend more time in a separate room than him - if he's gaming in the living room, take your laptop to another room and work there. If he questions you or whines just say it's work related and you just need to focus. Try not to be snippy, just try to play it cool. Another thing is to start spending more time outside of the house when he is home - start finding more outside hobbies. Consider taking your work to the library or cafe, joining a gym, a class, etc. Cut back any codependency you have. Don't cook for him. Don't cleanup for him. Stop doing him favors. Don't full stop all at once just gradually pull back. \n\nSecure your phone and laptops and whatever else you have in the house that he may try to peep through. When you start moving out, start by taking your valuables out and placing them in a secure location. I would do this when he was working and I knew he wasn't home. After the valuables start moving out your smaller items, things he wont notice. Storage units. Forward your mail to a secure address asap, you can rent a po box. If he has anything of yours like the spare key to your car take it back. If you know where he keeps it take it when he's asleep. Then get it to a secure location. When he notices play dumb and say you haven't seen it, he must have fallen off ir he must have misplaced it. (Yeah you're gaslighting him. This is for your own good though. He's gaslit you a million times anyways)\n\nDepending on the situation ask yourself can you move everything thats yours out quickly? Or will you have to do it a little at a time (you have a small car, are moving by yourself, and he's petty and psycho)? If you have to do it slowly then take a little at a time when he's not home. Get the smaller items out, pack up tye clothes you don't wear, pack up your extra shampoos, and things he doesn't see like stuff you keep in boxes or drawers. With the smaller items already out see if hes gonna work a long shift or maybe will be out of town soon - great opportunity to finish moving your bigger items out. Leave your key. Make sure the landlord was aware and you're off the hook. \n\nIf you do have some help or you can get everything moved out quickly then again I'd recommend doing it when he's not home. \n\nYou need to just cut your losses, don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Don't steal or wreck his stuff. Let's say you both contributed to buying the bed and the throw rug - do you reallllyyy want it anyways? I wouldn't. Is it worth the headache of him coming after you for? For divorces you'd have to talk to the lawyer about splitting things up. \n\nIf you're on a lease and it's coming to end and you're both in agreement you want to break up you still have to be careful and get your valuables out. You can try asking him about furniture you both contributed to financially, but I wouldn't make too big of a stink. If you have to, just cut your loss. I would still recommend moving things out that are yours when he's not home. Even lvm that act civil tend to get petty when they know you're moving out - stealing things, hiding your stuff, damaging things, making a fuss over who gets the $5 soap dispenser... \n\nMake sure you don't have any other loose ends. Don't be petty. Don't leave a nasty immature note saying \"I hope she cheats on you like you did to me\" or whatever. Do NOT PROVOKE him, lvm will already be mentally snapping even if they knew and played cool you were leaving. You do not want to pour salt on a wound you dont know if he will have a rage fit, seek revenge, or stalk you. Be mature. Slip the key under the door. Don't mess with his stuff. Talk to your therapists about how much you wanted to bash that stupid picture he has up, tell your therapist what you wished you could have left him on a note. \n\nDouble check his place before going. \n\nWhen you leave, celebrate yourself for leaving. You're free. Be on the alert that he does try to find you and make contact. Block him when you completely leave. Be careful if he shows up to your job. Be careful it he follows you. Keep your friends and family in the loop.

slvz1m	hostile sexism	Valentines got me thinking about equality…: According to a random google search, 2/14/2021 $11.7 BILLION was spent on jewelry in the US alone. Now I’m pretty sure the only jewelry a man ever receives is his wedding ring… that he likely buys for himself lol there might be a small section of outliers out there though So then I went down this rabbit hole of thoughts and I couldn’t think of a single thing that society says a woman should do for a man these days to be counted a lady. But I couldn’t count how many things society says a man should do for a woman to be counted a gentleman Is the third date rule even in effect anymore? Lol sex was the last motivation to treat women special but who knows how many simps will be told to just rub one out in the bathroom this valentines So after my thinking I decided to test my theory and I did not hold the door open for a girl coming out of a store as I walked in. She gave me a swift stink eye. And it was then that I decided to continue treating women equal in that way lol no more gentlemen behavior from this man I mean if you think about it, the gentlemen “rules” infringe on their equality. Women can open doors, put the toilet seat down, pay for dinner, etc etc. They are equal 👍🏻
t7fv7v	neutral	Detaching from the outcome -- how to keep your heart on the lockdown during early stages of dating a man?: If you have been dating for any non-trivial amount of time, you know there is no one sweeter than a man trying to get into your pants. He will do all the right things, will definitely say what you want to hear to get his dick wet. Which is why FDS implores you to VET, VET and VET. However, as you vet and continue to date him, you must keep yourself detached, so that if he can't meet your standards, you are not left despondent. You don't feel like you have \"lost\" something, or that you \"broke up\". You didn't break up, you simply weeded a scrote out. \n\n**So just how can we keep our emotions in check?** **A special shout out to,** u/ceramicunicorn **a lot of these points are indeed her contribution, thanks to our spirited discourses!**    \n\n\n1. Imagine you are a prize. Scratch that, KNOW that you are THE prize.   \nA unique being who has worked on herself incessantly and made herself a successful, well adjusted, beautiful woman in a world that increasingly hates on, abuses, murders and actively downplays the struggles of women. Now, knowing the value of the prize, will you give it away to ANY man who shows the minimum investment? What if it was $1000, would you give away $1000 to a guy who takes you out on coffee and tries to make half-assed conversations for a couple weeks? What if he buys you dinner 4 times, for a month? No, right? And you certainly are worth WAY more than that, especially to a man: your body, emotional and intellectual presence can't be denominated in currency, trust me, they know it too.   \nSo from now on, **treat every potential date as someone interviewing to get to the prize. Be a ruthless interviewer.** No self respecting firm will give its candidates \"the benefit of the doubt\". Eliminate them like nobody's business.  \n\n2. Remember **HE NEEDS YOU, you don't need him**. Men need sex, they need feminime presence in their lives, which is why married men have higher life expectancies. Treat your encounters as such -- he should constantly pursue you, the moment he does something disrespectful, you \"deduct his points\" -- remember you're the prize and he has to fight amongst tons of contenders to win you over. If you were interviewing candidates for a job and a promising person faltered in a later round, would you sit there blaming YOUR firm's worth and asking what you did wrong or would you shrug your shoulders and understand the candidate just wasn't experienced/qualified  enough to get the coveted job and move on to the next one? OR if you hired a guy and he couldn't perform to your standards, would you - as an employer - cry and make excuses or would you cut your losses asap and open a new requisition? **Enjoy kicking losers to the curb -- it's fun!**  \nMen are extremely transactional, be as such. Get emotions out of this process completely.   \n\n3. **Do NOT share your vulnerabilities early on.** Do not talk about your insecurities, about your trauma, about your childhood. Men use that against you, additionally you get attached. You give a part of yourself away everytime you share that story that only your closest friends know about. Hold your cards close to your heart.   \nLimit conversations to surface level stories, like how bad traffic was, or how Karen from accounting just had her 50th birthday and you loved the icream cake.   \nAt the same time, **LISTEN**. Listen to what he says, how much he shares. And ask questions. However make sure to not become an emotional outhouse -- if he drones on about his ex, look at your watch casually and say, \"so how has work been this week?\"  \n\n4. **HE is not special** \\-- no matter his job, his height, biceps, jawline or whatever gets your heart running, remember he is JUST A MAN. Like all those others before him. OR those that'll follow him. He might be wrapped differently, but as soon as you unpack the gift, you'll be left with the same disappointing hollow of a human being. Remember, men are like buses, there's always going to be one in 15 mins. 10 if you're in a big city ;)   \nDon't think \"oh he's my soulmate\" or \"he's different!\" after 2 dates. He ain't, sis. Until consistently proven for a LONG time, he is just another dick trying to get his wet no matter how he disguises it. Be smarter!   \n\n5. **Don't talk/text too much!** Don't get used to \"good-morning\" or \"good-night\" or \"how you doing\" texts multiple times a day. Men use familiarity to breed emotional connection. Additionally if you use his messages as a dopamine hit -- you'll get addicted to it and consequently him. Only check your messages AFTER work for a short period of time and even better, use texting to set up in person dates. That's it. You don't need to tell him what kind of salad you had for lunch, girl- he don't care!   \nAdditionally, don't talk about him too much. He's not that important to you - don't bring him up with your friends, your hair-dresser, the lady sitting next to you on the metro, your dogs etc.   \n\n6. **Do not invest financially.** Even if it's as small as taking a uber/metro to the restaurant he conveniently picked closer to his home. Say something inane like \"oh I don't want to travel all the way in my pretty new skirt/ high heels/ my recently blow-dried hair!\" He'll eat it up like you dressed up just for him / he needs to keep you safe (\\* eye roll \\*). Men LOVE to protect you, at least the ones that deserve your attention should. Obviously don't pay on dates. Remember the date should be convenient, fun and exciting to YOU.   \n\n7. **Bask in the impermanence of it all** \\- remember men are temporary. They come and go. Will you ever find the one that stays with you for a lifetime? Maybe, but even if you don't you are a fulfilled lady. In the meantime, you enjoy the men that treat you like a queen, while remembering it's better to be single, taken out on dates and courted than be mistreated, constantly wondering why you aren't enough. Trust me, I've been there and done both!   \n\n8. For God's sake, **don't sweat the small stuff**! Men don't sit around with their friends and overanalyze all the details. If you find yourself contemplating every little detail, STOP. Practice mindfulness. Bring your attention back to the present. Do what men do - relax. In other words, don't give a shit about guys. They certainly don't.   \nTo quote Seneca,   \n\\&gt; *We suffer more in imagination than in reality.*  \nNow some very important points as reminders that  have been covered a lot in the handbook!\n9. Keep a roaster of men, don't get exclusive in your head too quickly\n10. Don't get physical too soon\n11. Work on yourself like no one else will, because no one will. Buy that house, run that marathon, get that job. Thanks to our ancestors, we can earn just as men. USE THAT. \n\nIf I missed something, please add it in the comments, and let me know your thoughts!   \nTake care and have fun out there queens!

t5fw6l	hostile sexism	Why do feminists expect empathy from men, but won’t give it to men?: I was re watching an old anime called the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzamiya and the film that accompanies it the disappearance of Harhui Suzamiya. Long story short it’s about a high school boy named Kyon who meets a girl named Haruhi who is God and starts a club in high school called SOS and there are espers and what not who are pretending to be students/members of the club. The main theme of the story is how Haruhi is a real bitch. I mean she is terrible. She is loud, aggressive, forces another girl to dress in outfits that she doesn’t want, forces a guy to touch that girl’s tits so that she can get the room for her club, she is inconsiderate of others emotions and safety and throws tantrum tantrums. Kyon is very annoyed by her and there is an episode where he almost hits her. But one if the espers (a guy) basically explains that Haruhi sees him as the one that will accept her. The movies goes deeper into this as one of the female espers who is actually chill makes Haruhi disappear to get the dude’s attention. Bu the end of the film Kyon realizes that while Haruhi is a bitch, he’s her bitch and wants her toxic ass back. Though he realizes that he should have given the espers chick attention and bows to. All the same, he wants the crazy bitch and is willing to show her empathy. It’s interesting. In a perfect world this great. People do deserve empathy. However, why is it that Haruhi shows no empathy towards Kyon? And while it is realistic for a young man to go towards the exciting chick, in reality the cute book worm chick esper wound have been a way better choice. All this to say that it got me thinking, why do feminists expect men to show empathy towards them but won’t show it towards men? I see a lot of feminists complaining about gender inequality (which really doesn’t exist anymore), but they don’t care about male loneliness, how men have a higher suicide rate than women, how 30% of men under 30 are virgins, how many slave away everyday doing jobs they hate, and then they have to deal with the nonsense of modern women. It does not seem like a fair trade. This is why many men (such as myself) have gone the Netflix and chill route. Men now more than ever have abandoned the idea of getting married. It’s sad.m Funny, Haruhi has a feminist spirit to her. She is headstrong, has written off male suitors as not good enough, considers herself a boss bitch, and throws a fit when she doesn’t get her way.

taop6u	interpersonal sexism	Workplace for some young men: Do some men have it harder than others in their working environment with other women coworkers? I'm asking because I usually just work with other women in jobs. I want to share a story about a partner of mine. In the past back in 2018, I had an ex partner who was 20 in the airforce as a logistics operator and all his bosses (Sgt and Corporal ranks) that were women. Him and four other young men were being bullied in the nastiest ways in the space of two months, three of them almost ended their lives (including my partner) and all of them had been diagnosed with severe depression. I remember noticing my partner not looking his usu al self for weeks on end, he's a very closed off person due to his upbringing, I would spend ages trying to get him to open up to me and only got little information. No matter how hard I tried and sat down with him, making him feel comfortable. I never liked his female bosses and I would tell him that too, but somehow he would defend them and say "no, I'm just useless like I am." One day he came home with this guy (who was a social worker), he almost ended his life, I was told this awful story, the full story how he's being treated at work by his female boss and other women that were slightly higher rank than him. They would verbally abuse him, throw stuff at him, pick at him, tell him to go back home to iron his uniform and I pay attention to detail very well and his uniform was always up to standard. There's some stuff that he probably hasn't told me. Worst of all, the social worker told me he's not the only young man getting abuse from these female coworkers and bosses. I couldn't believe it, I was angry, upset and yes, of course the social worker and I took it up with other high ranking people in the logistics trade. I wanted to take these women to court for what they did, but somehow they got away with it not happening and laughed at me. I have little experience with this stuff, but I had support and even that didn't help. It opened my eyes how corrupt the airforce is with feminists women (they literally called themselves feminists). I was so upset. The best thing for my partner was to leave the airforce, I was gutted though, because I knew how much he always wanted to be apart of the military. Apparently, some the of airforce men left the trade or left the airforce for good because of these women. Funny enough, these women that I said I wanted to meet and take to court never ever faced me. The whole thing still haunts me to this day. My ex partner is safer now and he's doing well for himself, but it was a long road of recovery for him. But it's definitely made me more aware of how corrupt some feminists are and it sickens me to the stomach. I still can't fully get over what happened and sometimes its hard to move on. Seeing someone I loved being broken down and manipulated by these women sent me into depression and I never got full closure and I wasn't able to fight back at them. Worst of all, who else is going to be bullied by them? Those young men with goals and strong attitudes, are they going to meet a fate worse than these other young men at the time? These women in the airforce were never confronted properly and never were held accountable... if it was the other way around, the men would've been held accountable straight away. That's the messed up apart. I feel sick to my stomach. Does happen more often than we think in the military or other workplaces?
sq7ond	ambivalent sexism	Male waiter refused to give me the food I ordered because he "wanted to protect my slim figure": I love chicken, I think it is delicious. But it is NOT what I ordered. I ordered a pork taco salad at this Mexican restaurant. When the food came out I realized that it was CHICKEN, not pork. I flagged down my male waiter and pointed out the mistake. His response was winking at me and telling me he gave me the chicken instead because he wanted to help protect my slim figure. From his expression you could tell he expected me to thank him for being considerate. &amp;#x200B; Instead I asked for the manager, who thankfully was a woman, and got me the pork taco salad instead. &amp;#x200B; TLDR: Male waiter changed my order to "protect me" from calories without my consent Edit: for those of you asking, he didn’t seem like he was covering up a mistake. The way he phrased it, it sounded like he purposely switched it because he thought it would be better for me and that he thought once he told me I’d agree. But I didn’t, because I wanted what I ordered. And to the men in my dms telling me it didn’t happen, your male privilege is showing. Y’all don’t believe women get sexually assaulted either. Your opinions don’t matter to me. I wish for one day you were a woman and you could see all the stupid shit that we go through. I 100% wish this hadn’t happened. I just want to be treated like a normal person in my life and not deal with bullshit like this. You gaslighting me and other women when we share our experiences just makes you part of the problem.

sna11x	ambivalent sexism	I just want to say that I don’t hate women. I love women and I think men and women are better together then apart.: I think some people in this sub or who view this sub view it as anti-women. It’s not anti-women it’s anti-feminism or essentially anti third and fourth wave feminism. Feminism has turned into very misandrist movement and to all the guys out there never date a feminist!

oaqiwg	hostile sexism	I read the FDS handbook today. I wanted to understand it.: I saw a FDS post in popular today. Initially I was a bit frustrated by it, but it's in popular so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and wanted to learn more about it. I actually read the whole FDS handbook while I was on their sub. I actually understood it. It made sense, mostly. These are women that have had a lot of negative experiences in dating, and they're frustrated and trying to mitigate risk of more nasty dates. I had a lot longer post planned initially that started me with me categorizing the dealbreakers in mentioned post, and much of it was already written out as I worked in my head to understand more about them and find some middle ground, the things I liked about FDS, the things I didn't, and I was going to take a break for the night to let my mental defenses cool down so I could read and learn some more about it tomorrow. But I said ah, what the heck. I had thought about trying to talk to one of them to get some more perspective and insight on the philosophy, but decided to save myself what I thought would probably turn into a nasty scolding and instead scrolled down the sub to check out the posts and comments. \n\n&gt;!Alright, well that's... alright. Okay. I get it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Wait. But this....!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And now... well that's not right. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Wow. And that. That's kinda fucked up.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Okay, I see it now.

t763wy	neutral	Stood up for my male coworker to a coworker and a customer(her friend), the friend is now trying to get me fired or transferred stores.: Not sure if this okay here but I had to get this off my chest. \n\nOnce again my 18f coworker made a remark to the 29m coworker, this time about looking at her friends breasts. I brought up how they were talking about his ass the other week. He goes, \"Yeah!\". Then her friend, (?f) who's a lesbian, says \"You know I'm a lesbian why would I sexualize a man?\" I tried to stay away from accusing and more just informational. That it's not okay, I was uncomfortable when they talk like that with him. He's a very quiet and shy kind of person. She went completely in defense mode and verbal attacked me. So I told her she can leave cause I work here so I'm not leaving because of a customer. So she called my district manager at 3am, woke him up, just trying to show me how much pull she has. I told my district what happened and it seems he's taking her side more than mine because her friend is backing her up and the guys just don't want to go against them.\n\nMy thing is... Why get so mad if they didn't do anything wrong? Then my coworker brings up when I complimented a man who came into my store in a different city. I said he was a beautiful man, very buff, could barely fit through the door, always ordered the same thing after his work out, and how the other women always oogled him. Apparently that was me sexualizing him...\n\nI don't understand their logic. I just needed to vent cause I'm getting sick of people thinking they can just treat men like shit all the time.

Not knowing the realities of relationships/marriages is like going to war without shield and sword. The fact that man who havent had 2 relationships or talked with 2 girls in their life protects this false idea is crazy.\n\nI have been with almost like 15 women in my life.  Lets say 5 is one night stand. Its not a big number. I know friends that have 2-3x of this number. \n\nYou cannot imagine how many of them actually cheated me, falsely accused me for rape or even attacked me physically. In good case, it is only mental manipulations. I am not someone creepy or weirdo. I know how to talk to people and have friends. Not only that, every friend i have talked have same issues. Almost all of them got cheated on,divorced, physically or mentally attacked at least once.\n\nNow, i dont say women are evil. I say women are not angels. Stop preaching about relationships/love if you havent had handful of relationships. And go find some girls, experience it. Then preach.\n\nIm tired of all this matrix shit. Not because im effected, im not effected anymore. Not again i girl can falsely accuse me for rape, i just save all the textes, chats, voice textes etc. I put my shield on.\n\nBut because when i see men that arent experience shit when it comes to relationships are fucked up.

tbwvwn	hostile sexism	Does the Emphasis of not Bothering Women Benefit the Most Appealing Men?: I\u2019ll start by saying I condemn legitimate harassment (cat calling, stalking, threats, not accepting \u201cno\u201d as an answer, etc).\n\nWhat I\u2019m referring to is the emphasis over the past several years of basically ignoring women while they are in public.\n\nI will also say that, obviously, women aren\u2019t a monolith, but I\u2019m looking at trends.\n\nIt seems like women only want pre-filtered men to interact with them, perhaps exacerbated by this dynamic in online dating.\n\nUnless a man is part of her existing social group, a fellow student or coworker, many women don\u2019t want to have to even acknowledge his greeting or attempt to engage with her.\n\nNow, let me also say, I\u2019m not talking about men who interrupt you while you\u2019re on the phone, listening to headphones, talking with a friend, etc.\n\nI\u2019m referring to literally just being out and about in public, not clearly rushing or anything important.\n\nWhich type of men are more likely to persist against this relatively hostile dynamic and initiate an interaction regardless? The most confident men.\n\nWhat breeds confidence? Success. What breeds success in dating? Being appealing. What\u2019s the most apparent way to be appealing in dating? Being physically attractive, and for men in particular, being wealthy.\n\nNow, obviously \u201clesser\u201d men will still approach women who don\u2019t want the attention, but overall, what\u2019s happened is the average man has been boxed out of potentially spontaneously interacting with women who aren\u2019t already in his social bubble.\n\nI think this new standard of social etiquette was subconsciously, at least partially, driven by a desire to further filter who women are approached by. They yearn to have a similar level of control in real life as they do in dating apps.
sqxam5	neutral	I(24M) am pretty sure that my professor(35F) is pregnant with my baby. I'm freaking out and don't know what to do: Throwaway for obvious reasons. I (24M) am a graduate student at a prestigious university. I'm also the treasurer of the student association here. In the August of last year, we had a kickoff party for our student association. After the party ended there was a lot of stuff to clean up. Unfortunately my other board members were drunk from partying and I was left with the majority of the clean up. I was doing this when a professor (35F) walked in. She forgot something and came back to pick it up. She saw me doing the cleaning alone and helped a little bit. And then she asked me if I needed help clearing the stuff out of there (there were some decorations, leftover food &amp; drinks and some other important stuff). I told her I would appreciate that because I needed to get the stuff out of there and put it at my place because the place needed to be clean for another meeting the very next day. She told me she had a car and she could help with the stuff. I was very grateful for that because that would make my job so much easier. We transferred all the stuff using her car and then since my studio was on the top floor, she also came with me into my studio to help me finish it in one go. She asked for some water and so I told her to make herself comfortable in the couch. I then noticed a half-empty bottle of wine among the leftovers and I asked her if she wanted that jokingly. She said sure and then we were just chatting and joking with some wine. The couch only had 2 seats and so we were sitting pretty close. It soon turned into some light flirting. She jokingly made a comment about how it was "the best date she's ever been on" and I was saying that "I might get lucky tonight". Then one thing led to another and then we slept together. I made some stupid mistakes. I didn't know for sure if she was married but that's just an excuse I'm making for myself. It was reasonable to assume that she was married. I also had unprotected sex with her. I didn't have a condom and in the heat of the moment we both didn't think much. I also came inside her. I woke up the next day and I was freaking out. She was slightly freaking out too. But then she calmed down and told me she was on birth control and she would take a plan B just to be sure. We didn't plan on it but I kept in touch with her. And then one thing led to another and we hooked up multiple times in the next few weeks. I hadn't had sex in over 2 years and therefore it felt nice to be desired. Every time we had sex, I came inside her with no hesitation whatsoever because she told me she was on birth control. I'm not making excuses and I know what I did was wrong. I wish I could take it back but the past is the past. After the 6th or 7th time, she cut off all contact with me. I knew what we were doing was wrong and so I just accepted it and carried on with my life. I didn't see her after that because she belonged to the faculty of architecture and I was a aeronautical engineering student and our faculties are very far from each other with no courses overlapping. But yesterday, we had a half-yearly meeting in our student association again. I saw her and she was pregnant. I'm no expert but the baby bump looked like it was 6-7 months. I started freaking out because I had sex with her 6-7 months before and the timeline seemed to match. I went and threw up in the toilet out of fear. I didn't talk to her because I was afraid of how she might react or what she might say. I was afraid to even go inside the room. She left the party sometime afterwards and I was finally able to go inside. I met with her teaching assistant and made small talk and asked her about the pregnancy. She said she was happy for her professor because she and her husband have been trying for a baby for 3 years and finally she was pregnant. I turned pale at this because now it feels like there could be an even bigger chance that the baby is mine. I couldn't sleep all night yesterday and I feel anxious all the time. I have a couple of questions: 1. How do I approach her and ask her about any of this? I don't know how to even begin having this conversation with her. If the baby is indeed mine, what do I do then? 2. Even though she's a professor, I'm not under her supervision. She's from a completely different faculty and I'm from a completely different faculty. If this gets out, will she lose her job? I'm planning on telling someone but I don't know what will happen. I'm from Europe, if that helps. TLDR: I had unprotected sex with my professor about 6 months ago. I saw her yesterday and it seems like she's 6 months pregnant. How do I approach this situation?
t7tssb	neutral	Why are you given carte-blanche in the US to shame uncircumcised men?: It's quite bigoted to pick a group of people (ie uncircumcised men) and apply blanket statements (ie their penises are disgusting and dirty) to describe their genitalia. Yet YouTube videos and articles in widely read newspapers face no issues (and gain praise) for advocating for circumcision. Not only this, but you can openly state that you prefer circumcised penises and find uncircumcised ones disgusting.

s4jm4p	neutral	For all those who think this is an incel sub...: Clearly you have never been on actual incel subs like r/incels, r/MGTOW, etc. Those subs had orders of magnitude more toxic content than I have ever seen here.\n\nNo this sub is not perfect, there are some odd posts or advice sometimes, and we all know that you won't meet anyone by being on Reddit all day. But saying this is an incel sub is just moronic. Everyone here knows that sex is not hard to find if you're willing to pay for it and/or lower your standards to zero. We're not basement dwellers wondering why we can't get dimes.\n\nJust as some examples, often times the most intelligent people have a hard time dating because they're on the spectrum and need some tips. Other people may not have been raised with a father or mother and are trying to shake off daddy/mommy issues. Still others have been abused as a child or by a partner and have trouble trusting people. This is a place to share dating strategies so that people that want to date can learn about it and try to remedy any questions or problems they have so that they can succeed in it. Dating and/or marriage is understandably a significant goal or milestone in most people's lives, and this sub is here to assist in that for those men who want it.\n\nAnd to state the obvious, the reason why dating strategy subs are separated by sex is because strategies vary greatly by gender. To avoid irrelevant posts, this sub is geared specifically towards men and not women. Other subs are the opposite.

t6hhtf	neutral	I was falsely accused of SA when I was the one who was SA: In my second last year of school I was out with some friends drinking and this girl was out with us she was not drinking I found out I was locked out so she offered to let me stay in hers so I said I would because in my drunker state obviously I’d rather go back to a girls rather than my friends even though I was very shy so I didn’t really expect anything to happen She offered me a spare bed in her room so I said okay nothings happening I might aswell sleep the drink off but she ended up getting into the spare bed with me and one thing led to another and we messed around a bit nothing serious because I was too drunk to “perform” So we went to sleep and I woke up early and left to walk home chuffed with myself mostly because I didn’t get many girls so I was happy with myself because I had literally no idea I had just been SA because I never knew it could happen to men The next day I get a text off one of my friends while I’m shopping just saying “did you r*** (girl) “ and I just remember my heart dropping in the shop not knowing what to say or do I’ve never felt so uncomfortable in my life Then the next Monday school came around and I’m nervous as fuck I haven’t said anything to the girl because I was terrified and spent the whole weekend overthinking and I’m walking through the hall and some guy just calls me a rapist while walking past me and that was it I just called home pretending to be sick and spent two weeks at home pretending to be sick talking to no one Thankfully the girls ex boyfriend text me and asked what happened and when I explained it he told me she had done it before but it didn’t stop everything I got into a fight when I finally went back to school because someone brought it up it was horrible my attendance tanked for the next year my grades dropped so much I became suicidal I was seeing two therapists I lost friends and it made me distance myself from a lot of people I called friends because I was scared of what they thought of me Anyway sorry for the rant but this was all 3 years ago it’s still the main reason I’m still depressed and have trust issues today but last week it just dawned on me that I was the one who was assaulted and I told a few people about the situation explaining how I was drunk and she was sober but no one (including me) said that I had been the victim Sorry for the long post thanks to anyone who bothered to read the whole thing I just needed to get this off my chest
sz289l	neutral	Can we talk about the difference befween Anna Delvey and The tinder swindler?: I know the tinder swindler has been overdone, but I was learning about Anna Delvey and its so unfair. He conned women into a lifetime of debt and  emotionally manipulated them into thinking he loved them. Anna pretended to be a socialite and she conned banks and wealthy corporations. He's free and rolling in money whilst his victims are traumatised and broke. She's facing 20 years in jail and her victims are still rich and exploiting people, funding wars and causing environmental damage. He caused so much more damage than her yet she's seen as worse. There is no justice in this world.
qbuhbi	neutral	Need a help with a crush. Been on 2 dates last weekend: Well, first of all, thanks for your time that you will probably spend reading this, I really really appreciate your time. Let\u2019s begin with myself, Im doing last year of my uni, almost 21, chubby, funny, outgoing, charismatic and romantic (the last 4 traits I have developed myself throughout the time of university despite being rejected 1000 times).  She is doing her last year as well studying in the best uni of the country, has a unique beauty, very smart, funny, deep, gorgeous and sexy ( that\u2019s at least how I see her). A year and a half ago,  I get a notification about her adding me on social media and that\u2019s when I decided for myself that I should try my luck, cause I believe despite not looking as a hot guy with 6 abs I have something else to offer. So I tried and It worked but due to corona we could not meet, after 2-3 month of us occasionally chatting and lockdown getting eased, I decided to travel 3 hours to finally see her. It was like a blind date and I got everything planned out so we could definitely have a great time. I chose a nice Japanese restaurant for us and we had some nice Japanese wine but after we couldn\u2019t make it to the adventure park since we got late in restaurant. After that, I went back, we chatted and talked to each other for a bit while being occasionally ignored because of her being busy on her work and studies (Im not surprised cause she is studying a very hard course). Then, I offered to meet and was very excited to plan out next meeting to the beachfront but she had several interviews therefore she couldn\u2019t come despite her really wanting to. I already booked everything, bought the tickets, it all went to waste but I still told her that it\u2019s ok and i really hope she gets the job. Anyways, on our summer holidays we both got busy so we didn\u2019t really talk to each other and this April after I texted her I came to her city for a week since she hinted to me \n- \u201cwhen are you going to come to  my city with a winky face\u201d. \nSo I was like fuck it let me not lose my chance with the girl of my dreams. Anyways, we went to a nice restaurant had a 3 hours dinner and we finally went to adventure park the next day. We had a lot of fun it was really really romantic, I even won her a huge teddy bear. Anyways, when took a bus back to her place ( it was night and I couldn\u2019t let her go alone since it might be dangerous and I care about her safety) I told her that I like her. I also said that I don\u2019t wanna make her uncomfortable or put pressure on her, I just want to put it out there she smiled at me, hugged me and said that she will text me before leaving to her house. After all those emotions, I have been waiting every day for her message but after a week I decided to text her and she replied after a day and It\u2019s all the same story, she doesn\u2019t answer on time blaming it on problems with university and some family issues, what do you think I should do next? She didn\u2019t say anything about \u201c let\u2019s stay friends or we\u2019re different, or it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me type of shit\u201d so please tell me the community of Reddit WTH do i do in this situation
tckhn3	neutral	Don't cry, beg or show emotion or over communicate. State what you want then leave when it's not met. Men enjoy the begging, crying and emotional outbursts because they know this means you're wrapped around their finger and will stay. It is a massive ego boost for them to have that power over you: In my late teens and early 20s I was a massive pickme. I didn't understand the true nature of men and dating. I often tried to recreate that intense romance with LVM that media, books and society was brainwashing me with. I used to cry, beg, and explain till I was blue in the face to LVM that the right thing to do was to treat me with humanity and empathy \ud83e\udd21\nI projected my own empathy and kindness onto them. \n\nBegging and pleading and crying made them respect me less, they didn't listen or care. One of the biggest FDS lessons I learnt is that men respond to actions, not reasoning, not emotions, and definitely not you over-communicating. You should not threaten them with leaving either. Leaving a man should be calculated and well planned and thought out. This way you're prepared for any response. Don't go back to them either. Men have less respect and more contempt for women who go back to them. \n\nWhen I've cried and begged to be treated with basic human decency in my pickme days they just stared blank face at my tears or berated me. When I left with no emotion, they cried, pleaded begged and started jumping hoops to give me what I wanted. \n\nYou can cry to your trusted friends, family, therapist. But don't cry and plead with LVM. You're allowed to feel hurt. Just don't beg. If you're sensitive and cry during a breakup that's fine too. Just be firm in your stance on the breakup, don't explain or beg. You can cry those silent tears while you pack up and leave.

She\u2019s like oh yeah definitely this isn\u2019t anything but I just wanted to share with you. Although she brings it up later on at dinner (I don\u2019t know ego boost) and when everyone (men and women) start shitting on this guy she gets defensive.\n\nGurl, barf.

t7xh99	neutral	Bell Hooks on letting go of LVM: \u201cAll too often women believe it is a sign of commitment, an expression of love, to endure unkindness or cruelty, to forgive and forget. In actuality, when we love rightly we know that the healthy, loving response to cruelty and abuse is putting ourselves out of harm's way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn patriarchal culture men are especially inclined to see love as something they should receive without expending effort. More often than not they do not want to do the work that love demands. When the practice of love invites us to enter a place of potential bliss that is at the same time a place of critical awakening and pain, many of us turn our backs on love.\u201d
t3aeyc	neutral	On dating hood, ghetto street men.: this is a message to my ladies who are young, sweet, innocent, and good hearted.   \ndirected to college-aged women too, who are attracted to the hop hop vibes.\n\nBefore you laugh, maybe there was a point in time you were attracted to the rude guy who listened to Tupac, Biggie, and other classic rap, hip hop, r&amp;b. He wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad boy but he definitely had a straightforward flair to him. He might even be straightforward In the way he shows his attraction to you.\n\nMaybe you even thought he was \u201ccool\u201d for talking street. He might not have the best vocabulary, grammar, and you think his diction is endearing. maybe he has pretty good style, though definitely not upscale in taste. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me tell you. These men are toxic, abusive, and downright gaslighting balls of negativity. He will feel inadequate that you are \u201cclassier\u201d than him. And he knows you\u2019re more intelligent than him, but he will make you feel that he owns you. He will not put in the work to match you at your level. Somehow he will bring you down to his level, because he can\u2019t stand the sight that you are and will be better off without him and his drama-laden life. You will not be able to heal him or save him with your classy mannerisms, giving heart, and loving patience.  \n\n\nThe worst kind of man who is already middle class or even upper middle class, and not completely poor, but acts street, ghetto, hood, and working class. I don\u2019t know why some of these men prefer to hang with men who are incapable of supporting themselves.  but it tells me They want to be part of that urban lifestyle with the mannerisms and get themselves into drama.
poyfo0	neutral	Do NOT be afraid to date outside your race!: I moved to Arizona and lived there for 5^(1/2)  years. The dating scene in Phoenix was so different than Detroit. A lot  of the women who are mostly Black wanted men who made drug dealer money  and nice cars. Me being a nerd, I was always treated like I wasn't good  enough. When I moved I decided to expand my horizon more and it was  life altering. I astounded me when women of other races would approach  me and flirt. I always was on the defensive and thought it was a prank  of some sort. I wasn't into white girls, or Asians, or anything not  Black. I thought about it and reflected and went home I ran into my  uncle who's married to a white woman. I just pulled him aside and asked  him about it. His reply confirmed everything to me. He simply asked \"if  you met a woman who was everything you looked for in a woman, but she's  \\[insert race that's not yours here\\] would you date her?\". It changed the  way I approach dating and the kind of woman I approach.\n\nOpen your mind. Your chessboard is bigger than you think it is. Keep strategizing.

tbohyt	neutral	How I think using Social Justice methods to promote anti-genital mutilation is viable and doable: Brendon Marotta has published a book named Children's Justice. He uses Social Justice principles to the anti-MGM idea and I believe that it's brilliant and that it would work. \n\nI mean let's face it, the woke has been quite successful in their lobbying. I thought it was their methods but it was their end goal. If there is one thing the woke has made for the world, it's their hit hard and hit as much as possible method of lobbying their advocacies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI truly believe that it can work in the US. I doubt it's effectivity in other places. ONe just has to look at the UN's anti-FGM campaign to see how effective that is but then again they also advocated for MGM through and through but that does not make the FGM example less true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSJW-ism is effective in the West maybe it's because everyone understands and accepts the very concepts of human rights. You people should know that. Men's rights are human rights and you fight for it because you believe in it. \n\nBut I'm counting the hens before they hatch. I don't live in the US but I have a vested interest in world views on circumcision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just believe this would work in the US due to the culture and the values that are evident in the given population and also because there are numerous researches that have been proven to be true but also for the given population. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis idea proposed by Marotta will work in the US because of the values and the ethics that the nation has. There can never be a one size fits all solution for MGM and I've accepted that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat concludes my post so thank you for reading, have a nice day and if you're restoring, good luck.

Because who wants be the guy that pressures their partner into something they clearly aren't into. I would rather make her happy if it meant she was comfortable. Even if I was not. So I sucked it up. But nothing good comes from turning a blind eye.\n\nHow do you have this conversation with your partner, AskMen? I'm genuinely stuck, and I think many others are too.

sp8744	ambivalent sexism	Her body count is a strong predictor of infidelity: If you’re a man who isn’t interested in being cheated on, don’t LTR a person with a high body count, and that’s irrespective of your own. [Haselton et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167204271303) wrote: &gt; A truism in psychology is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. This is no less true in the realm of sexual behavior. Indeed, one of the strongest predictors of marital infidelity is one’s number of prior sex partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/8X4gten.jpg)). [Buss and Schmitt (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103408) would later affirm this: &gt; Men apparently assess and evaluate levels of sexual activity by a woman prior to long-term commitment—behavior that would have been observable or known through social reputation in the small-group lifestyles of our ancestors. Past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior, and having a large number of sex partners prior to marriage is a statistical predictor of infidelity after marriage ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/rM3iFCE.jpg)) [Kinsey (1953)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1954-05526-000) determined that women with premarital experiences were far likelier to engage in marital infidelity ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/BnXe7I0.jpg)), which has been borne out in several studies since then, with a greater number of partners corresponding with a higher chance of infidelity. [Essock-Vitale and McGuire (1985)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0162-3095(85\)90027-5) found that women who reported having sex with other men while married had significantly more sexual partners (24.5 vs. 3.9) than women who reported no extramarital affairs ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/RTnooIN.jpg)). [Whisman and Snyder (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.21.2.147) surveyed nearly five thousand married women and determined that the probability of sexual infidelity increases with the number of lifetime sexual partners, with as high as a 13% increase in the annual prevalence of infidelity per additional lifetime sexual partner ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/ZhxoqNv.jpg)). However, [Treas and Giesen (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00048.x) estimated only a 1% increase in the net odds of infidelity for each additional sex partner between the ages of 18 and first marital union ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/poSLp4U.jpg)). In their study of how premarital sexual behaviors affect post-marital adjustment, [Athanasiou and Sarkin (1974)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01541486) found that respondents who reported extensive premarital sexual experience generally reported extensive extramarital activity, with the number of premarital partners showing positive associations with the number of extramarital partners, the desire to engage in mate-swapping activities, and lower marital satisfaction ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/gtTOhE9.jpg)). [Forste and Tanfer (1996)](https://doi.org/10.2307/353375) examined sexual exclusivity among dating, cohabiting, and married women, and found that unmarried women with 4+ partners were 8.5 times more likely to have a secondary sex partner than a woman with no previous sex partners, and married women with 4+ partners were 20x more likely to have secondary partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/naqmXdN.jpg)). It should be noted that this category is wildly skewed by women with a double digit number of partners, who are significantly more likely to stray. [UT Austin sociology professor](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/faculty/mdr93) [Mark Regnerus (2017)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Cheap_Sex.html?id=JpeXAQAACAAJ) found that those with 20+ partners were only 3x likelier to cheat (32% vs. 10%) while married than those with &lt;20 partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/rxkpWM4.jpg)). [UofU sociology professor](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0046574-NICHOLAS_H_WOLFINGER/hm/index.hml) [Nicholas Wolfinger (2018)](https://archive.md/F2Kf7) wrote: &gt; The residents of Promiscuous America are predictable in many ways. They’re less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced. They’re several times as likely as their less adventurous peers to have cheated on a spouse. ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/TEIEAV0.jpg)) One’s number of lifetime sexual partners wasn’t just highly correlated with marital infidelity but with relational infidelity as well. [Feldman and Cauffman (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0903_1) found in their study of adolescents that sexual permissiveness promotes sexual activity with a larger number of partners, which, in turn, increases the chance that sexual betrayal will occur ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/R84WjSe.jpg)). In their study of infidelity in heterosexual dating couples, [Barta and Kiene (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407505052440) found that individuals reporting a past history of infidelity tended that have a greater number of sexual partners than those without a history of infidelity ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/HGwCCNb.jpg)). [Maddox-Shaw et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2012.666816) affirmed that the number of prior sex partners predicted future extradyadic sexual activity, or sex with others while in a relationship, in unmarried heterosexual couples ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/VBq0su1.jpg)). [Hughes and Gallup (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1090-5138(02\)00149-6) found that promiscuity (measured in number of sexual partners) is a good predictor of infidelity in women, with promiscuity among females accounting for almost twice as much [variance](https://archive.ph/5Skz7) in infidelity (r^2 = .45) as it did for males (r^2 = .25) ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/2vklWn1.jpg)). [Pinto and Arantes (2017)](https://doi.org/10.30958/ajss.4-4-3) found that sexual promiscuity doesn’t just have a high correlation with sexual infidelity (r = .595), but that it also has a high correlation with emotional infidelity (r = .676)([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/qEPttQz.jpg)). In their study of female twin pairs, [Cherkas et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1375/twin.7.6.649) affirmed the high correlation between women’s promiscuity and infidelity but also discovered that the genetic correlation between the two traits was .47, so nearly half the genes impacting infidelity also affect number of sexual partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/0GNvYK0.jpg)). Summarizing the current state of research on the prediction of infidelity, [Fincham and May (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2016.03.008) listed a greater number of sexual partners in their list of demographic factors found to facilitate infidelity, writing that permissive attitudes toward sex, a greater willingness to have casual sex and to engage in sex without closeness, commitment or love (i.e., a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation) are also reliably related to infidelity ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/vCvZmQR.jpg)). [Bailey et al. (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.78.3.537) wrote that approximately half of women who scored in the top 20% of [sociosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociosexuality) reported having cheated on a steady partner, a ten-fold increase to women who scored on the bottom 20% ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/bEfXZLO.jpg)), though this is likely an underestimate as women tend to underreport their sexual indiscretions. Running values from the General Social Survey, [McQuivey (2019)](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-road-to-infidelity-passes-through-multiple-sexual-partners) found that people who reported four or fewer lifetime sexual partners, the rate of infidelity in the current marriage dropped to 11%, while for those who had five or more sexual partners the number was nearly double (21%) ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/scosEXa.jpg)). Relationship consultant, author, PhD, licensed marriage and family therapist, [Dr. Athena Staik (2019)](https://archive.is/bPRPy) placed a “history of promiscuity” as number two in her list of “10 Predictors of Infidelity and Gender Differences” on [Psych Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych_Central) (popular news site for mental health professionals), writing: &gt; Contrary to the myth, partners who’ve had many partners have a harder, not easier, time remaining monogamous. They are significantly more at risk of straying than those with little or no prior sexual experience ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/aBjwcQB.jpg)). [Taylor Kubota (2015)](https://archive.md/7wOAo) of Men’s Journal got into touch with sex researcher and adjunct professor of human sexuality at NYU [Zhana Vrangalova Ph.D.](https://archive.md/6mhGj) to learn the expert consensus for her article “What the Number of Sexual Partners Says About You”: &gt; According to many experts, it matters — and can say a fair amount about your sexual needs and even who you are. Here, with the help of sex researcher and adjunct professor of human sexuality at NYU Zhana Vrangalova, is an examination of what experts have found the number means for men and women… As it relates to sexual history later in life, promiscuity is linked to a higher likelihood of cheating in long-term, serious relationships. Vrangalova thinks the reason may be that many promiscuous people aren’t really built for monogamy. ([excerpts](https://i.imgur.com/nYZe2IF.jpg))
tcc0y0	interpersonal sexism	Grooming: I work at a restaurant. The only two male servers under 40 (they're 22 and 26) are gym bros. They dislike me (22), they HATE my coworker (31F), and they both bully my other coworker (18F). They are the only two male servers under 45. \nMe and my 31 yr old coworker talked tonight about why they treat us that way. Both of them flirt, talk Abt inappropriate shit, and general behave oddly toward our teenage coworkers. Especially one who looks far younger than she is. \nMy coworkers who we'll call Sarah and Jane (Sarah 31, Jane 18), have noticed this. It's weird. How on top of the teens they are, but when it comes to the three of us, who are very very outspoken (stand up for ourselves etc.) They are offstandish and weird. They don't feel attraction to women who are even semi confident. Sarah and one of those male servers, let's call him Paul, got into a fight over him now understanding how sections work and he threatened her to he face, our managers didn't believe it. Both of them are lazy and only flirt with the underage girls, the second server, let's call him Gage, hit an underage expo with a rag on the ass the other day. \nMy point is men like them, small egos, gym addicts, tinder frequenters, cannot handle confident women or even women their own age (I'm within 0-3 years of each of them).  They want someone who won't question them. Who will stroke their ego. \nIt's sick to see up close. I've complained multiple times to management but they won't do shit bc we are \"short staffed\".
t8toyn	institutional sexism	Today is gender pay gap propaganda day in Germany: I hate it. How can anybody be so retarded to believe this lie? They even calculated the date wrong and changed the definition afterwards, when some people noticed it. Today a saw feminists shift the goal posts even further than the last years. Feminist: Women earn 18% less than men. That's sexist! Non-retarded person: That's comparing apples to oranges. The GPG can't proof discrimination. If you factor in choice of jobs and other circumstances it shrinks dramatically. F: The remainder of 6% proves discrimination of women! NRP: No, it doesn't. There are studies that reduced it to 2% unexplained remainder. And the authors of these wrote that it would shrink even further if they had considered more factors. F: Well, this doesn't consider, that women aren't employed because of their gender. NRP: Unemployment is higher in men. Have you heard, that the female top managers earned 20% more than the male top managers? F: That's just proof women are better than men!

taassd	institutional sexism	Rape case: Ladies, I need some guidance. Please note this may contain triggers for those of you who have been raped or otherwise harmed by a depraved person masquerading as a male human. I will keep this very short &amp; sweet. \n\n6 years ago I was raped. The perpetrator admitted to it in a text to me. His exact words were: \n\n\"It's my fault, you said no and I didn't listen.\"\n\n\"But I'm a pig and didn't listen.\"\n\n\"No means no and you in a round about way said no and I took you into my room which I shouldn't have done.\"\n\n\"No means no, stop means stop. And I didn't follow those rules last night.\"\n\nNow, to be completely transparent, I made excuses for him at the time &amp; I took the heat for letting it happen because I didn't fight back. I was like a deer in the headlights while he stood there pacing &amp; punch his fist into the palm of his other hand. Several things went through my mind and I tried to steer his mind in a different direction such as watching a movie or going to get ice cream. I just wanted out of there. I was fucking SCARED!  He was 6'2\" &amp; 280.  I'm 5'4\" and at the time was 170. \n\nThe next day I called the police department to ask about filing a police report. The woman who answered the phone told me not to bother because they had more important things to do &amp; it would take a long time &amp; they would never prosecute.  \n\nLate last summer I filed a police report. I told the man what she said &amp; he apologized but as he took the report he mentioned \"consensual sex\" nd I immediately corrected him. He then typed up the report &amp; said he would forward it to a detective. When speaking with the detective I mentioned the texts &amp; sent him a copy of every single text between the 2 of us. \n\nI received a letter from the prosecutor in February in which he denied prosecuting citing: with no forensic evidence to support the victims claims, no explanation on why it took 6 years to report and inconsistencies in the submitted text message, this claim is denied.\". I am waiting on a copy of the police report because I did tell them why I didn't prosecute at first. And I got tested for STD's at which time I told my PCP that I had been raped as well as my chiropractor. They were stunned into silence &amp; never mentioned it again. \n\nI should note that the officer, detective &amp; prosecutor are all male!!!\n\nLadies, what would you do?

t5a6rj	neutral	Dear Men. You're not less valuable than women, cause you can't give birth: A lot of conservatives, terfs, and feminists very often say that men are less important, cause you can't give birth. The bring the idea that goes like that:  \n\n\n\"If there would be 1 man, and 9 women, 1 man could impregnate each one of them, but a man could just have one kid in 9 months, so women are more important for survival\"\n\nWhile its true, that a man can impregnate 9 women, and you can make more children with 1 man, and 9 women, than with 5 men, and 5 women, the reality isn't really that easy.\n\nThere are two reasons why men are needed.  \n\n\n1. While the average man can impregnate a woman everyday, and average woman can make kids every 9 months, it still makes a woman capable of giving 20-30 kids in their lifetime. The real problem is, that we aren't financially able, to support more than 4-6 kids per couple without going into extreme poverty, cause kids are expensive. So it doesnt matter, that a woman can make a kid every 9 months. She could make kid every minute. We still wouldn't be able to support more than 4-6 of them for average woman, so it wouldn't matter anyway\n2. Giving birth/ taking care of kids (taking care of kids can be also done by men) isn't the only thing needed in the world. We need to feed them too. We need to maintain the infrastructure of the whole society. Without father role many of kids come up as a criminals.\n\nSo it doesn't matter what gender you are. You are just as important, but different. And you need as much of help for survival, as others. It doesnt matter, that you can't give birth

He was previously married for 25 years; he and his ex-wife divorced nine years ago and have two adult kids. They have a great relationship. But I dislike his frequent posts on social media that reminisce about falling in love with her \u2014 what she was wearing the first time he saw her, for instance \u2014 and how much he loves her still. These posts often include hearts and kissing emojis. I told him they are hurtful to me, but he says he\u2019s free to post anything he wants on social media. He also says he loves me and that\u2019s all that matters. Thoughts?*\n\nGIRLFRIEND\n\nYou definitely have a social media problem. But it is dwarfed, I think, by more troubling issues: Your boyfriend dismisses your hurt feelings even after you tell him he\u2019s hurt you, and he remains powerfully (and publicly) connected to his ex-wife. Does he also make lovey-dovey posts about you?\n\nHis connection to his ex is understandable. They spent decades together. His feelings for her (particularly as the mother of their children) may survive any desire to be married to her. My bigger concern here is your involvement with a man who believes his social media freedoms are more important than your reasonable feelings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/style/social-qs.html?action=click&amp;block=associated_collection_recirc&amp;impression_id=1e920fa0-9bd9-11ec-90d4-734ef34c0428&amp;index=0&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=footer#after-story-ad-1)\n\nI know you\u2019ve raised this issue with him already. It may be worth trying again, though, if the circumstances weren\u2019t right before. Find a quiet time when you can discuss this calmly. It\u2019s possible that the benefits to you of this relationship outweigh your boyfriend\u2019s posts or his affection for his ex-wife. No relationship is perfect.

t4thya	neutral	Insecure Men and their Allegations of Cheating: Hi ladies,  \n\n\nI am trying to understand the psychological underpinnings of insecure men to know the enemy.   \n\n\nIf it is TRUE that we are out of their league, why is that they accuse us of cheating? Why do they threaten that they will talk to their female friends again? (Is it with the intention of being flirty with them or triangulating us?) Also, if they keep saying that we can find better, but swear at us when times are rocky, isn't that just proving their point? \n\nI don't quite understand why insecure men will accuse HVW of cheating unless they were the type to actually cheat as a way to assert dominance??  \n\n\nAnd from my experience, he barred me from having male friends. Even one time he threatened to talk to female friends (and at the time, I literally shrugged when he said this because I thought it was normal to have opposite sex friends that were strictly platonic). Was he merely projecting? He cut off contact with female friends when we were together and he expected me to not have any male friends except brothers. Gay male friends was probably stretching it too.  \n\n\nHe was also very suspicious of me when I wore 'revealing', feminine clothing; he though that guys would hit on me or try to pick me up at parties. He became LIVID at the thought of men flirting with me. \n\nHe would say I was a lot better than him and that I deserved way better yet simultaneously, he would swear at me and say, \"I feel single.\" His words had a way of making me very emotionally unstable, maybe that was what he was trying to do. What was so strange that he would say \"I know you can find better\" and \"I'm not the one\" when we were breaking up, but then he was upset when I decided no contact. Did he say these words as a way to make him not the bad guy, as a form of saying he KNEW he couldn't be what I deserved and that he TOLD me he couldn't be what I deserved so he was basically absolved from fault or guilt? It sucked to feel discarded at the time, but maybe he felt that ***I*** discarded him.  Well, we discard what doesn't bring light to our lives and it can hurt in the process.

It's genital mutilation, pure and simple, and everyone who hides behind 'keeping it infection free' knows it. It initially started off because of an old american prude who made CORNFLAKES, because he didn't want young children to masturbate. Thats a FACT. And now, because of the 'his should look like mine' ideology, it's become a tradition with americans, behind the ill informed disguise of health. It's horrible what's being done to male babies, and it's being ignored just because it's happening to males. Look what happened with FGM, and that was on a scale millions of times smaller than circumcision. This is NOT attacking circumcised people, it's absolutely fine if you've come to terms with how you are, there's nothing wrong with it. I'm saying it should be a choice, is all, as circumcision in general causes one to have much less sensitivity throughout their lives.

Like a lot of teenage girls my partner became my world. Was I still attracted to other people? Of course I was but I developed tunnel vision. I didn't care about those other people. \n\nWell, to my surprise, I quickly realized my partner was not the same. He still noticed the girls he was attracted to and he still indulged in fantasies with others when it came time to masturbate. \n\nNow I have several different mental health disorders that make it really hard for me to see the nuances in life. I can appreciate the fact that being in a relationship does not make you blind and you will always be attracted to other people. My problem is, how much time do you spend on these fantasies? Does it make you appreciate your partner less? I am uncomfortable with the idea of my partner masturbating over the thought of others but I also realize there is nothing I can do to stop him from doing that type of thing. \n\nMy fear is that he prefers his fantasies over me, his reality. Especially since I find that in this day and age the line between fantasy and reality is really blurry. I feel like I need to carve out a specific amount of time in my day to make sure I am also indulging in my own fantasies? It sounds like a tit for tat situation because it kind of is and I'm sorry if that rubs people the wrong way. \n\nI just want to know the rules lol.

nrdn96	hostile sexism	How to be happy in dating: First thing you gotta realize is that less than half of women who claim to be feminist are actually feminist. They don't *want* an equal relationship; they want you to pay for everything, plan all the dates, surprise them, clean after both of you, and either cook for her or take her out to eat for every meal. They don't think this is selfish or bad; they think any man who doesn't live up to those standards isn't husband material - while completely ignoring how they might not be wife material.\n\nNext, you gotta realize that you won't know the true personality of any woman until you've known her for at least 5 years - for many, it might take longer. You'll fall in love with the character she plays to get you to pay for everything and do everything for her, not her true self. Once you accept that you're living through an act and not anything real, it's much easier to approach the relationship with the same mentality as the woman you're dating - get what you want from it and not get attached. The amateur manipulators all make the same mistakes: they show their true selves when dealing with cashiers, waiters, and other strangers. The master manipulators know to keep up their persona any time you're watching, regardless of who they are speaking with - unfortunately, there's no simple rule of thumb for spotting those.\n\nThird, you gotta surround yourself with friends who are comfortable with vulnerability. Here you can choose to chase one of two kinds of rare unicorn; women you can actually be friends with or men who are emotionally open. I'm not into binge-watching Netflix, shopping, or partying so I have a hard time finding female friends; I connect with people over creative hobbies, and those circles are over 90% men. However, it's almost as difficult to find men who will listen instead of telling you to \"man up\" when you want to talk about your issues - but you gotta do it. If you don't build an emotional support circle for yourself, you'll have to rely on your partner for emotional support - and that's basically suicide. Most women will pretend to be understanding while taking notes of your faults and start scheming on how to use them for personal gains.\n\nWhen you've done all these things, you will stop seeing all the women you date through rose-tinted glasses. You'll have a healthy sex life from hooking up without getting trapped in bad relationships and you won't depend on your partner for emotional support, so your mind won't see women as better than they are and you'll be much more comfortable waiting for one that treats you right and dumping them the second they push your boundaries.

The first one because by being an advocate makes you a target. The second one is because we see Left-wing groups are run on emotions, not rationality. As Axel Kaiser writes, " *the excessive emotionality of the younger generations nowadays lacks normative frameworks capable of orienting their lives beyond their mere subjectivity*." By joining a highly emotional group you become at risk of the group turning on you. It happened to Joss, it even happened to JK Rowling! **1- You won't hold the Moral High Ground** The first group of guys who join the male feminist movement is guys who feel they are holding the moral high ground over other guys. These guys believe that they are better than other men because they acknowledge past injustices towards women. The mistake they make is that they equate feminism with historical injustice towards women. However, these couldn't be further from the truth modern feminism is about female superiority not about equality. Lauren Southern, "*Feminism is not a synonym for equality...feminists are creating a world reverse sexism."* **2-You won't Get Laid** The second group of guys who join the feminist cause is guys who believe that by seeking female approval through feminists that they will get laid. However, the opposite is the case most likely if you become a male feminist you will be friend-zoned. At the same time, even if you do manage to get laid it will be used against you later. We have seen how many female journalists use the fact that Whedon could hook up with the women around him as a tool to damage his reputation. Kai Cole(Ex-Wife writes): "*Despite understanding, on some level, that what he was doing was wrong\[having consensual sex with his actresses\], he never conceded the hypocrisy of being out in the world preaching feminist ideals."* His wife accuses him of cheating. However, for many feminist journalists him hooking up with any actress is simply wrong in principle since he is in a position of power. For these Puritan Feminists even if Whedon was single he should never even date anyone in his workplace. **3-Your actions will be scrutinized even more so than those of other guys** Many of these left-wingers put Joss Whedon on a pedestal. Instead of seeing him as a regular guy. For instance, Kai Cole writes "*He deceived me for 15 years, so he could have everything he wanted. I believed, everyone believed, that he was one of the good guys, committed to fighting for women’s rights, committed to our marriage, and to the women he worked with."* So Whedon is a deceiver and horrible person since he wanted to have sex, a normal and natural need, with the attractive actresses that surrounded him? I believe Whedon should have been more open with his wife and pushed for an open marriage. However, that's a discussion for another time. At the same time, this "pedestalizing people" is not a healthy way of seeing the world. However, this is the binary view that these feminists have either you are one of their "good guys" or you are a "misogynist." **4-The feminists will turn on you at the drop of a hat** A few years ago, Joss Whedon was the "darling" of many of these feminists and he could do no wrong. Journalist Ashley writes, "*We’re talking about a critically acclaimed storyteller who has long benefited from this notion that his stories are somehow more feminist and empowering to women than most."* Most feminists had a very clear vision of Whedon. However, all it took was a couple of tweets from some disgruntled co-workers for the mob to come out and punish Whedon. This man has spent his whole life trying to live by the principles of this feminist movement and that's the pay he gets? **5-You will have no loyalty from your left-wing/feminist friends** *"Once an icon of Hollywood feminism, is now an outcast accused of misogyny"- Lila Shapiro.* This last point is the one that makes me reject on a primal level left wing movements. Most of them have no loyalty to their friends or mentors. Whedon used to be the boss of many of these actresses, he gave them a job and made them famous. Yet there is no sense of loyalty at all towards him. Many of the Buffy co-stars instead of defending him joining in the mob to demonize him and make him an outcast. I don't think anyone deserves this type of "witchhunt." Compare that with Japanese culture I heard that when many mangakas hear their senpai(mentor) is accused of wrongdoing they keep silent. Because their Sempai is innocent, "No." But out of respect for their mentor. I've seen this in other non-Puritan or non-far left cultures as well. People in other cultures much rather let others solve their affairs in private. Heck even in American culture we have a guy like Quincy Jones when about former associates or friends accused of wrongdoing he refused to talk about the topic out of respect. **Conclusion**: I watched Buffy and liked some of the episodes they even influenced some of my graphic novels. I personally never resonated with Whedon, I saw him like I see Morrisey a bit too self-absorbent. However, I felt bad for the guy having your reputation ruined despite all the years of activism, being outcasted by your friends and co-workers where you can't find work, and now having to lock by yourself at your house with only your wife. Yet none of his Hollywood or Feminists friends dared to stand up to the mob and defend him. I would only tell them, **"He was one of yours and you let him fall."** &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/9pk6h77nyhf81.jpg?width=1250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471696d0cad4771b3fa2424b836c0e710f7e4ee8
sbyzhh	neutral	What is the smoothest way to end a conversation with a lady fellas?: Hi. New to this subreddit here and I casually fall into the trap of sending 5 or more messages in a question answer because I tend to get a little excited when an actual respectable woman shows interest in me (Friend or potential lover) and I never truly thought on it, but as I am learning about how to talk respectful, learn the text tones for flirting opportunities, reading Steve Harvey's \"Think like a man, Act like a woman\" book to learn some much needed nuances, and things. How would you end a great or ok conversation with a mature lady that can leave behind some curiosity or a satisfying ending that makes the next convo more welcomed? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 23 turning 24 in 6 months fellas.

ta0p41	benevolent sexism	Realizing I may not agree with this sub: After seeing many posts on this sub with people bitching about how the situation in Ukraine is unfair to men as they are not being allowed to flee and are expected to fight, I feel I may not agree with many of you.\n\nMen should be men and it is our responsibility to protect those that we love. If my family was in danger I would want to protect them and keep them safe. I would never want my wife to be forced to protect herself or her country. \n\nI guess I don\u2019t actually want equal rights between men and women. I don\u2019t think women should have to do some of the dangerous shit we may have to. What I guess I would want is appreciation of what men do, same as we should appreciate what women do. We have different roles and both should be valued and appreciated. I think many people on this sub don\u2019t mind the different expectations between men and women, they just want to be appreciated for what they do.\n\nDo many agree with me, or am I just too old school?

She's an adult but considerably younger than me so I think of her as a kid.   \n\n\nSo as I'm driving, I confirm with my sister which way to go to drop her off.  \n\n\nThis chick goes, \"**Oh you totally know where I live, you're obsessed with me**\" *or some shit like this*\n\nI sarcastically go, \"Oh yeah, I keep a file cabinet full of my sister's friends' addresses\"  \n\n\nShe goes, \"**no, you have a cabinet just for me with all my info like my social security card**\" \n\nI go, \"yeah, I'm gonna steal your identity\" *I'm only playing along because she's my sister's friend.*\n\nShe says, \"**Oh my identity is amazing, I'm white and female**\" *low-key racist, high-key misandrist*  \n\n\nI say, \"yeah unless your name is Karen\"\n\nand that shut her up.  \n\n\nI feel like this whole convo was her sending off bad vibes at me with her weird little fantasy or whatever the hell that was. I've never spoken about her and honestly dgaf about her.   \n\n\nBut I figured this would make an interesting post. Let me know what you guys think. I probably shouldn't have played along with her and nipped it in the bud immediately. This is the type of chick to make false rape claims and other false accusations.

t7usd2	interpersonal sexism	The new Batman is a Peeping Tom: I was really excited for the new batman movie because I think Robert Pattinson is really attractive and talented.  However, there is a scene in the movie in which he watches Catwoman, played by Zoe Kravits, undress and then get dressed again in her catsuit without her knowledge and consent.  It isn't presented as something sexual; he's spying on her to find out who she is, but it was still so jarring and creepy to me. They just casually show her strip down to her underwear while batman watches from outside her window. It was treated so casually, like there was nothing wrong at all about it. The theater was full of young and teenage boys and the message they received from the movie is that spying on and watching woman undress without her consent is something totally normal that the morally upright hero does. This is how patriarchy and sexual violence is taught to men.  They see depictions of their heroes doing creepy shit since the time they are kids.  I really wish they would have had Batman at least look away when he saw she was taking off her clothes?? Same old Hollywood I guess.
t8feoo	neutral	TIFU by sleeping with a classmate: Obligatory this happened a year and a few months ago. Me (22M) and a (now ex) friend (18F) struck up a mutual FWB relationship in college. We met about once or twice a week for a few weeks after we both just got out of long relationships that ended poorly. We broke it off after a few weeks was over but remained friends and communicated regularly, even to where she came to my side defending me against people accusing me of grooming her even after we stopped meeting up. A few weeks later she admitted she had feelings for me after not talking to me for a few days and in an intense argument. I told her I wasn't going to be able to date her for a variety of reasons (mainly being I'm much closer to graduating than she was and we aren't in the same stage of life). She cut all communication after that other than insulting me regularly in group chats, referencing our situation, and outright lying to our mutual friends about what happened. After a few times of her doing this over the coming months, I privately reached out to her to tell her to stop. She continued. After 3 times of this, I reached out again and got no response. Instead, she halted all communication in all of the groups we were in for 2 days. A few days after I sent my email to her asking her to stop talking about me, I get a notice from the Title IX office at my school. She turned me in and accused me of Sexual Assault and Harassment. I was assigned a lawyer by my school via Title IX procedures to act as my "advisor". I couldn't explain what was going on to anyone. I felt like I was going insane to the point where I got hospitalized for a few days because there was no end in sight for everything going on. I was left (and was later kicked out of) one group and limited my interaction in the other at my lawyer's advice, atleast until the Title IX trial (which is held by the state with 6 official judges from the local county acting as the jury). I submitted all evidence I had of her trying to smear my name, including our conversation all those months ago when things went wrong, all insults she sent over to me, and any communication we had since the alleged incidents. The trial happened about 8 months after the situation ended and I was pronounced innocent after she admitted she made the whole thing up in this mock court. However, I'm still dealing with the reprocutions over a year later. These groups I used to be in are actively targeting me and using me as the butt of jokes. My false accuser is still in these groups and has turned public opinion so far against me that I've been officially banned from these groups. I had to delete my reddit account because I took moderation action against one of their mods and they doxxed me while sending a harassment campaign towards me. It got so bad they were taking pictures of my family and posting it on their forum for laughs. I finally graduated a month or so ago and I can finally begin to move on. TL;DR: I slept with a classmate in a FWB agreement. We had an argument. A few months later she accused me of Sexual Assault and now my social circle shrank from over 150 to under 6. Nobody believes me when I tell them how serious this got and there's nothing I can do legally since she's got no assets and lawyers won't take a case where there's nothing to compensate me if I do win.

t6ccbx	neutral	I Beat the Shit out of My Sister and Sent Her to the Hospital: I originally posted this story on another sub but was told it belongs here. I Beat the Shit Out of My Sister and Sent Her To the Hospital Trigger warning, this post talks about SA and r*ape. English is not my first language so I apologize ahead of time. I 26m beat the shit out my sister (23f) for s*xually harassing my boyfriend (25m) I can finally talk about this because all the legal proceedings have been delt with. So I’ve been dating my boyfriend “Mark” for about 5 years. He’s the BEST thing that has ever happened to me. He’s kind, smart, understanding and absolutely beautiful. When we started dating he was a bit closed off and was afraid to initiate any form of intimacy. I at first thought it was because I was his first relationship and maybe he was nervous. Six months into us dating he tells me that between the ages of 5 and 12 he was SA’d and r*ped by his mother. His father left when he was around 4. It fucked him up in the head for a while and when it got out his mother was arrested and he and his two older sisters were put in the custody of their grandparents who they lived with ever since. He was placed in intensive therapy and still goes to this day. He’s come a long way and has healed a lot but he still has some days when he gets really depressed and cries. Part of his therapy was exercising, so about two years ago he and I started doing some body building work outs. I toned up a lot, put 20 extra pounds of muscle on and he toned up a bit. Because we’ve been dating for so long and have marriage in mind, he told my family (a less detailed version) and they welcomed him with love and support. That was about three years after he told me. Now for my sister “Sally”. I’ve suspected she’s had a bit of a crush on him, she’ll flirt sometimes here and there but he never reciprocated and usually ignored her. I’ve talked to her about it so many times but she didn’t listen. To make a long story short, I had gone out one Saturday afternoon with some friends to get some drinks and left Mark behind because he didn’t feel like going. My sister had texted me prior to ask if she could borrow a few things from me, a sweatshirt, DLSR camera, and a third thing that doesn’t come to mind at the moment.  I said sure and to get it whenever. She went when I was out, unknowingly. When I came home I found my boyfriend on the ground crying his eyes out and my sister trying to calm him down. He was having a panic attack. It’s never safe to touch him when he has an episode because he may act out violently due to his headspace. Her hands were all over him and he was trying to push her away. Her shirt was also on the ground and she was only in her bra. I tore her away and asked what the fuck she was doing. She said that she was trying on the sweatshirt when he walked in on her, freaked out and went into an episode. However, Mark through his tears said she tried to touch him. I asked my sister if it was true and she said no, but Mark again said she tried to touch him. We have cameras in the house and I pointed it out to my sister. Her face went whit and I don’t know what came over me but I saw red. I can’t remember much because I was so angry, but I beat the shit out of her. I can’t even remember if I was the one who called 911 or her though her beat up state. I do remember kind of snapping out of it because Mark was still going through his episode and I could him cry louder and I had to help him through it. It’s all a haze. I broke my sisters nose, gave her a black eye and bruised her ribs. She was in the hospital for a few days. Update: A lot of people messaged me to ask about context from my last post. 1: This all happened right before Covid hit, the end of 2019 and everything was just settled this last month. 2: The incident happened in our kitchen, the front door leads down a hall directly to our open kitchen and to the right is our living room that leads to the bedrooms. 3: We have cameras in every room but the bathrooms and bedrooms because we have a Great Dane named Butler (he’s black and has a white oval patch from his chest to his tummy, he looks like a butler) who likes to get into EVERYTHING so we set up cameras to keep an eye on him while we’re out. The cameras don’t have sound recording. 4: My sister didn’t r*ape Mark but she did try to coarse him into sexual activities. 5: My sister didn’t know I was out when she came over. I don’t have the recording anymore, it was too painful to keep let alone watch, also, my memory of the whole thing is hazy but the tape showed Mark answering the door. Again our cameras don’t have sound recording, but Mark said that when he answered the door she told him that she was there to get my camera and sweatshirt, he said okay and let her in. He was watching the television so he went back to his show while she walked into our room. She called out to him for help and the cameras showed Mark getting up to help her. I don’t remember how long they were in there but the tape showed Mark rush out of the room while holding his hands out as if trying to stop an attacker. My sister then emerged half naked while holding onto her shirt. Mark backed up into the kitchen still holding his hand out she advanced towards him. Mark said he was telling her to put her shirt on and to leave but she kept saying something along the lines of “Hey, it’s okay. I just need some help that’s all.“ and “You’re a nice guy, just help me out a little.” I think by that point he was declining into a panic attack as he started shaking, my sister took that opportunity to hug him (she said she did it to try and calm him down, but the tape showed her kind of grinding up on him) He pushed her away and fell to the ground crying and screaming. She then got down by him and was trying to wave her hands through his hair. Her other hand was also moving up towards his crotch. I remember from the tape seeing Mark flinch backwards and try to push her way. She always moved back closer to him. A few minutes later is when I got home and beat her to an inch of her life. I can’t remember who called the police but the police had showed up and my sister limped to the door well I was trying to help Mark calm down. I kind of remember them asking questions and trying to help Mark calm down. They thought he was going into shock so they put a blanket over him and the paramedics came. My sister was quickly evaluated and then brought to the hospital. Mark and I stayed behind because by that point he had started to regain control again. I remember my parents showing up and asking what it happened, I told them everything. My mom stayed with Mark and I while my dad drove to the hospital to see my sister. Mark and I pressed charges on my sister, emotional trauma and S*xual  battery (Class A1 felony where I’m from) My sister tried to sue me (A misdemeanor charge) but it fell through. With the evidence we had my sister was sentenced to 60 days of incarceration with a bond of $5,000. No one paid. She also has to serve 200 hours of community service and her named was added to a s*x offender registry. She can appeal to the courts to have it removed after 10 years. She was also placed under a restraining order. On top of that my sister owes us $25,000.  I got a small slap on the wrist and have to do 50 hours of community service. Nothing too bad. My sister was cut off some the entire family and still is. Mark regressed tremendously, to the point that he couldn’t sleep in the same bed as me for months. He was required to go into even more extensive therapy. He’s come a bit of ways, but nowhere like he was before it happened. It will take a long time for him to heal. I consider myself Bisexual but I lean more towards men while Mark is %100 gay. He finds the female body disturbing, to the point that we have had to skip over full female nudity scenes in movies.  My sister new of this. When I asked her why she would do this, she said that she thought she could change his mind. I’m not proud of what I did, but I’m also not sorry.
