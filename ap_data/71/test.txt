R3JMON7OIXN9SX	2	both work but the nano 2 makes you load the card into the \\"mouth\\" of the usb connector rather than in the back like the nano 1. I would buy the nano 1 rather than the 2.  I first thought the nano 2 was not working because the card wasn't recognized even though it was all the way flush with the usb connector, but when i pushed on the card with my fingernail even though it didn't seem to move and seemed to be all the way in it was then recognized.  I was able to reproduce this situation repeatedly so it apparently isn't a fluke.  Or you could save yourself the aggravation and get the nano 1
R2S5X3RJDJ6VJU	4	The positives:<br /><br />The 1080p IPS screen is genuinely semi-mat & similar in quality to previous IPS screens I have had on high end laptops. No noticeable stuck or dead pixels. Reflections are noticeable but not obtrusive in a bright room ( but much less than the Macbook Pro Retina screen which is still quite reflective & unusable to my eyes). Minus points for being widescreen 16x9 ratio though. 16x10 is still better for browsing & photo editing.<br /><br />Speakers are sufficiently loud and clear for watching a movie in a quiet room but not really loud enough for party music.<br /><br />The keyboard is quite usable with reasonable key travel & little keyboard flex though they do wobble a bit. From a low angle when lying in bed the led's under the backlit keys shine in your eyes. Thankfully the keyboard lights can be switched off.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />As shipped the DB71 comes with 4GB of RAM and an old fashioned Hard Drive making it a bit sluggish in use. Doesn't feel much faster than my old XP Netbook in regular use.<br />Thankfully the ram is user upgradable & after upgrading it to the max of 10GB, windows seems much snapper. With faster SSD drives dropping in price that will be my next upgrade, should really be standard though.<br /><br />Screen Backlight bleed. you can see the leds along the bottom edge of the screen in dark scenes & can move the bleeding by sliding your finger along the very flexible bezel.<br /><br />The bottom cover flexes and if something heavy where placed on it it feels like it would deform. 1st Notebook I have had that gives me concern it would not survive sitting on the bottom of my carry on bag.<br /><br />the large right angled Power connector feels like an accident waiting to happen & could snap if caught at the wrong angle. Hoping someone comes up with a third party connector or extension cable.<br /><br />the WiFi has lower signal strength & is slower by 40% than my 3 year old Compaq Mini Netbook on 2.4ghz frequency.  Luckily my home router has 5ghz support & I was able to improve throughput by using that instead.
R2J3K8PZDAP0WG	1	I spent over an hour choosing a bag for my brand-new Dell laptop, which measures 17x11 inches.  This bag, at 18 x 15 x 5 inches according to Amazon, seemed to fit the bill.    Unfortunately, Amazon's description is wrong.  When my laptop wouldn't fit, I measured the bag, and found it's barely 17 inches on the outside.  There's a Targus hang tag that gives exterior dimensions at 17x13.78x6.5 and laptop compartment at 16.5 inches, which seems accurate, so I don't know why Amazon has wrong dimensions.  Yes, I've reported the bad description.    I'm going on a trip tonight and now I can't take my new laptop, so I'm pretty unhappy with Amazon.  PLUS, I have to start all over and hope that the next bag I order from Amazon will be accurately described.  (There's no selection locally for my size laptop.)    Don't pay any attention to the stars -- Amazon's site wouldn't accept this review unless I put *something*.
R1NLXCB2D69FXH	4	The screen cover was pretty easy to put on I ended up using two to put it on, since the first one got a piece of lint stuck to it. Overall it was easy to put on relatively bubble free. The screen protector is very clear and hard to notice it's even on; except on the cutouts for the front facing camera and light sensor. It didn't increase glare on the device, it may have reduced it a tiny amount. I had no issues with it interfering with the dock or a cover.  Ultimately I will replace this screen protector because of how it deals with fingerprints. It seems to reduce how easily the screen collects fingerprints which is great, however it makes the finger prints that do stick very difficult to clean off and I end up with streaking or smudging on the screen. Also the cover seems to add a little bit of friction to running your finger across it (very little but noticeable to me). I personally prefer a more matte feel.  In fairness to the product it does not claim to reduce finger printing and it does exactly what it claims. Just don't expect any more than that.
R3541WS4UC2AJT	4	The Core i3 processor in this Acer chromebook makes it a great user experience. The notebook is the right size.<br /><br />The screen leaves something to be desired, specially for off-angle viewing. And the build quality is indicative of the price point. The keyboard is pretty abysmal.<br /><br />I would really like a chromebook that doesn't compromise on build quality, specially the keyboard. Add to that a quality ~11&#34; touchscreen display. Put a Core i3 or one of the new Core M processors in there along with 4GB or 8GB of memory. And you have a chromebook that you will want to use.<br /><br />The Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga Chromebook 11e delivers on most of this I think - everything but the processor.
R1WDPUKPP9TL59	1	I love the idea of this because I want to be able to float in my pool and read my book but when it is in the sun it gets very soft and sticks to Kindle so when you are trying to get in there to turn it off and on, it is a little cumbersome.  It does protect your Kindle though so it does it's job....
RXTI1Y3BY201M	0	ok
R3TGBQ3HHR5YXO	1	... but would not let me register it for warranty purposes.  &#34;Wrong verification code&#34; keeps coming up.<br />Using with MacBook.  Light-weight plastic body.
R17KVP4SA2AG0W	1	This kindle freezes almost every time I use it.  I can be doing something and  the screen freezes then after 30 seconds or so, the kindle shuts off and comes back on.  My old kindle never did that.  I don't know what the issue is, but it is very irritating.
R2XK88EF2CT4QQ	3	For less than $20, this case is a really good buy. It still would be a good buy at over $20 but I hope for everyone's sake that the seller is not going to increase the price. The rubberized finish feels good and provides a decent amount of friction for a good grip. I was initially concerned about how the front cover is attached to the plastic back tray. After buying another Photive case, which was equally well constructed, I decided to give this case a try and I am not disappointed. I didn't give it 5 stars because the cut out for the volume and lock buttons was a little crude. While it is correctly placed, the opening wasn't straight and the edges were sharp. I almost cut my finger open the first few times reaching for the buttons.  I think this will be my last case for this iPad, until Apple comes up with an \\"upgrade\\" to the iPad Mini in 6 months anyway :-)<br /><br />Update 8/10<br />The rubberized finishing on the back tray is starting to peel off. Has it been a year? Expected it to last a little longer since I alternate between two different covers so technically it has seen less than 6 months of wear and tear.
R36YPLE6U5GAE9	1	I love everything about it except that the on off switch and volume controls are on the back of the device instead of on the side like my Kindle Reader.  The cover I have for it is a generic one so it does not accommodate the controls on the back. I have not purchased a Kindle cover, but may have to as it's difficult to turn off and on.
R2UV4XJO44G2AZ	2	Yes this is dual band Wi-Fi, but only one at a time. Packaging says it's &#34;switched dual band&#34;. Not all of my devices support 5 GHz, and 2.4 GHz was ridiculously slow for some reason (5Mb/s down), so I ended up just disabling Wi-Fi and hooking up an additional Wi-Fi router. Wi-Fi speeds are much faster now (20+ Mb/s down / 12 up). Had I realized this from the start, I would have saved some money and bought the base model without Wi-Fi or spent a little extra for a non-switched dual band Wi-Fi model, assuming the Wi-Fi speeds were better. Kind of bought this in a hurry when we had no options but Comcast/Xfinity in our new house.
R3C77X55ZU4WML	1	After almost 2 months of trying every combination of data in the setup screen - as well as 2 unfulfilling calls to Panasonic - I was not able to pick up the internet with this device. I eventually sent it back. The item itself was neither here nor there but the lack of documentation for it made it into a frustrating experience.
R2V7X601R3Y7A5	1	Perfect for child gaming needs.
R13D2JNQ74UCAP	2	The product is okay, you can't stand it up very well like shown in the picture, and sometimes there is a problem with the keyboard connecting.
R3F60NA0U1YSFA	1	I works in all my cameras and using as Flash Drive works well. It does not format or mount in the ROKU.SX  It is not the  Flash Drive that is defective. It must be the ROKU.
R37SDN154H591F	4	I really liked this notebook cooler because of the cool design and its efficiency (worked well and very quiet).  However, it was too big for my 15\\" MacBook Pro.  The rubber feet on top were too far apart from each other and from the bottom rubber strip.  Also, the one I received was not perfectly flat.  There was a slight bump on the right side of the cooler, so one side of my laptop kept sliding, and I ended up returning the cooler.  I wish Zalman makes coolers specifically for Macs.
R39SW010921D1B	2	HIGH QUALITY-NEEDS HANDLE OF SORTS FOR ONE HAND USE. BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT QUITE INVISIBLE INSIDE THE HOUSE. I PREFER THE LATCH OF THE PAPERWHITE(MORE SECURE)
R1L2AZLLBSW0NI	4	I bought this based on great reviews, especially with children in mind. The Kindle Free time was a great ideal. The problem I have is I have two children and when they want to switch users, it requires the parental login to switch users among children accounts.  It is VERY ANNOYING. I want both, who are three apart, to have different settings.  They are continuously asking me to log them off to allow them to switch users.  Kindle needs to fix this.  I am about to buy a Asus tablet. My Asus tablet has a similar children's app to allow them each to have an account wit their own password.  This will allow them to log off each and allow the other to log in to their own account.  Second, you can't add memory.  Kindle solution is to have cloud storage.  wrong ideal.  Some apps like Real Racing is 4 gb.  After one month, I am out of memory without any videos downloaded from Amazon Prime.  We only downloaded six games.  Most other tablets can add a SD card to increase memory.  I own a Asus Transformer and love it. I just wish I bought them one.  My sister in law bought a Asus tablet for her children and the children accounts work fine and they have a much bigger android app store and can add up to 32gb of extra storage.  The only down fall for them is they can't download Amazon prime movies for out of wifi play.
R2GJJABJ2QSUKB	2	The size of the sleeve, was definitely proportionately made to fit all notebook 13.3. Very pleased with the fit, as well as the shipping turn around time, but a little dissatisfied with the color. I ordered a gray white combination, and it seems I received a navy-gray mix and white even purple in some lighting, but none the less still happy with product.
R28FZG5NOM2RBC	3	This seems like it would be a cool product. I don't think it would really protect it much, but it will turn your MacBook Air another color. Except I can't get the thing on. Yes, I ordered the right one. Yes, I even watched the tutorial video iPearl has on youtube. My fingers hurt from trying to wrestle the thing on. I'm also worried I'll damage my delicate MBA. If someone could install this for me, I might like it. Right now, it's pretty worthless. If anyone has any tips, I'd be happy to hear them.<br /><br />Also, some reviewers mentioned that it came with a keyboard cover. Mine did not.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 10 more minutes of wrestling with it, I decided to try sliding the top part on. It was difficult, took awhile, and I had to start over a couple of times because it slipped off, but I did get it on! If you are having trouble, try sliding it.
R3FJQ8X48ZAGI	1	Keyboard is awesome only problem is that one of the keys are on an angle but other then that i love it
R1D4P6AGG3999J	1	Cloned a HDD to this one and installed in my system, it's been in less than a month and the computer will no longer boot and it's giving SMART errors upon bootup.  I'll try 1 more and then I'll move on to another product.
R8AF0QBA7EV5I	1	It works as advertised . Better if used by smaller hands. I've never seen a usb cord that tiny. I wouldn't buy a second one
R19G3G682HPN0T	1	Delivered on time, but It showed some troubles when connected to socks!!<br />Despite of being the orignal, not so good as it should be, I needed to replace the cable!!!
R37Z3KKS25XIPO	2	I have a macbook air, and this keyboard cover looks super cute. Unfortunately the cover does not match they keys on the top row of the keyboard.
R3OR38IQW2E3K8	2	The product fits and works well,was delivered on time, price was ok. However they delivered a screen with a small white spot.This is clearly not a prime product. They should say that in their presentations. The problem is almost irrilevant as we assemble the screen in a used notebook, however this will make me more suspicious with future purchasing. Normally I could give the part back and get back my money, but this is not what I want. I need to get a product as offered.
R3ULIRBHM2IHZ0	3	This keyboard works OK to some degree with its limited number of features. It has one major flaw - it can only be used on a desktop. It is inconceivable that no provision is available to secure the tablet to the keyboard. The tablet simply sits in a keyboard slot where the slightest nudge will dislodge it with the very real possibility of falling and becoming damaged. I use a PC at home and purchased this tablet and keyboard to take on the road to various events such as the Georgia International Horse park to watch the horses do their thing. I also expected to be able to place it in a shopping cart such as at a grocery store where I can see my shopping list. No can do.<br /><br />If all you need is a firm desktop space on which to set down your tablet and if you do not require hardly any convenient features then this may be right down your alley. But if you plan to use it on the road then it would be to your advantage to get a better keyboard.
R19B9ABZGKPX9K	1	I love this case but if you close it, it doesn't always turn off the backlight. Also about 60% of the time when I open it, my lock screen comes up but the backlight is off and it happens so often that it's driving me insane.
RQRU82QOG93B9	4	I really, really wanted to love my Kindle. It was a gift from my husband. First the good: downloading to the Kindle is as easy and fast as they say it is. The convenience of being able to get and read and book whenever you feel like it is great. But.....I was suprised at how little else it does. With phones working as cameras, navs and basically tiny laptops, can't they get a giant (by comparison) Kindle to do more? The storage takes up alot I am sure, but how about sticking an external memory card on it and instead offer screen customization, color screen, better organization for books etc.? There are literally only two ways to sort ALL of your books. The Kindle reminds me of an old Atari game console. (Yes I get the the \\"book\\" look screen, but frankly I don't care). And I find the Amazon/Kindle site is also lacking in the search engine, which is unusual given the parent company. Also it can be uncomfortable to hold but I also have pretty small hands, so that could be just me. And lastly, absolutely don't buy one if you think you'll save money, unless you buy all your books in hardcover normally. Every book I've ordered has been $9.99- whereas a paperback is usually $7.99 aside from \\"fiction literature\\".  So yes it is good to order up a book and have it delivered instantly. You'll save time and trees. Aside from that, I'd hold out to see what Apple does.
R1KF2STB0BFQU3	2	I tried to install this like the directions said and it would not work. Called tech support and found that he could not help me any more after 1 hour and 1/2 of being on the phone. Finally my brother checked it and it was a simple set up problem under basic settings. Now it works great. Also the item was on the shelf for an unreasonable amount of time according to the serial number date and the netgear tech said I may have trouble with warranty if I do not keep my receipt handy.
R20WW397L2T0PP	2	This item is good.  So far it has maintained my screen as advertized but I will say the directions could have been a might bit easier to understand and the bubbles are not as easily removed as advertized but they do work and I am glad I got them....
R2YROX39H6G0KG	2	The Uspeed USB3.0 to SATA cable is well made. The adapter is compact. The power supply is bulky in comparison. To be fair it does push 2 amps. It would be great if the folds folded down for travel. Need to put Uspeed label on power block too so it doesn't get lost.<br /><br />Performance was good. No manual or documentation on the website.
R3IIG6JY559KYX	4	what initially got me into the portege series was the aesthetic. it has a very simple and clean look. I'm not exactly tech savvy as I don't keep up with all the latest processors and whatnot, but for all the praise and hype about the new Sandy Bridge processors, this laptop seems decently quick. doesn't blow me away compared to my several years-old core duo desktop or even my 1-2 year-old, $500 toshiba satellite. overall, I like it a lot because it's big enough that hopefully it won't give me carpel tunnel syndrome, but small enough for easy mobility, which is good for a student.<br /><br />since I'm not doing any hardcore computing and just using it for a few basic functions like browsing, streaming movies, programming, etc, it satisfies me (but then again I think any computer in this day an age could pull those tasks off). unfortunately, even for those basic functions there are a few issues that Toshiba can improve on:<br /><br />1) the keyboard keys CLACK... really loudly. typing in the library or in class will probably stir up a ruckus. clackity clackity clack. not that big of a deal though, I guess.<br /><br />2) I don't know where everyone is getting all these claims about a 9 hour battery life (even cnet said they were able to get something like 7 hours in their tests) when I'm running the laptop in 'eco' mode with 77% battery life left and only 4 hours and 11 minutes of claimed life left. a second later, I have 76% batter life left but only 3 hours and 41 minutes left??? I'm only on my battery's second charge but I've been noticing these really sporadic projections and it's really annoying.<br /><br />3) the track pad straight up sucks. I'm not a fan of mac at all, but when my girlfriend had her 13.3\\" macbook, one of the things I found coolest was how easy it was to surf the net. the 2 finger scroll feature they had was super cool and some other functions included: three finger swipe up to open a new tab, three finger swipe down to close a page, three finger swipe left to go 'back' and right for forward, two finger tap to function as a right click [extremely useful]. comparatively, you can't really set any three finger functions to your own liking, the two finger scroll is really jittery - if it manages to detect your fingers there is no sensitivity and can go insane and jump entire pages at any given moment. overall it's pretty frustrating to use the multi-finger features.<br /><br />4) could be a part of gripe #3, but the two clicker buttons for the track pack are stiff. I like to use the tap function because my thumb would probably get sore if I used the clicker too much. yes, it is that stiff.<br /><br />other than that, it's really light and powerful enough that I can use it without getting frustrated and just looks awesome which is good enough for me. I would give this laptop 5 stars otherwise and while a 2-star deduction might seem harsh, I feel these basic attributes could have easily been included and are prerequisites to just being a decent laptop. I mean, how expensive could it be to develop and include a good track pad?? overall, laptop seems sturdy and reliable and I'm looking forward to using it<br /><br />update: an issue with the r705 series was that the fans would get really loud or that the laptop would get hot, but for either case, toshiba has remedied the problem on this model. the laptop stays extremely quiet even after I have been using it for 6 hours with just one break. it does warm up when in my lap on top of a blanket, but on a desk it doesn't heat up at ALL.<br /><br />4/25 I've had the laptop for two or three weeks now but since it's my backup/extra I'm really taking care of it and haven't used it that much yet. Mostly for school and not for browsing/videos pretty much. But one thing I noticed today was a little clacking noise that's from the chrome hinge, which is loose. I have no idea how it could have gotten loose as I've used the laptop probably less than a total of 7 times and it's onlybeen handled with the utmost care. REALLY annoying because for a $900 laptop, this really shouldn't be an issue.a $900 laptop, this really shouldn't be an issue.
R130R6DBQU19H6	2	The instructions that come with this are not all that helpful, and setup takes some work.  I found additional material on the web that got me going, and in the end it wasn't too bad.  I have this centered upstairs and base station is downstairs at one end of the house, have much better signal coverage of whole house now.  You will need some level of understanding of networks etc to make this work, but I'm not an expert and I got it done.
R2WQVRW9LG60K4	2	It's okay for 15 bucks. It definitely is NOT leather, but I didn't think it really would be at that price. It's bulkier than I would like. I really like my tab for reading books and this is a little cumbersome for that. I like all the sleeker, lighter options they have for the ereaders (Kindles, Nooks, etc.) but there just aren't as many options for the Galaxy tab. It does set up nice in the landscape view as an easel if you wanna watch movies or whatever, but as far as using it as a handheld device for reading, I'm hoping something thinner and better comes along.
R2CQPHVDSVFV6S	1	Seems to be an adequate product, but this Anker proved too frustrating for me to install and I returned it.  Laptopmate was kind enough to send me the other Anker (see Anker® Compact Wireless-N Wi-Fi Repeater) which they said would be easier. See that product page for continued story. Hint: the Compact has WPS, this one doesn't.
RXC5LRUZ605DC	3	This is a good product - nevertheless...<br /><br />...when used as a range extender the Almond must be placed in a location that has a strong signal - the Almond will extend the signal it receives, but will not boost a weak signal - the instructions allude to this, stating the extender must be a reasonable distance from the router.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind the signal it extends is susceptible to degradation by walls or other obstructions that may be the origin of the need to extend in the first place.<br /><br />The bottom line is the user must place the Almond in just the right spot - this may be easy, or, in some instances, may be impossible.
R2MOK75OH5F76X	2	If your hands hurt, stop working with the computer at your job, or reduce the amount of hours, otherwise this and other stuff like it, simply won't help.<br />In specific to this item, you'll have to use a good mouse pad, preferably all black, to get a precised mouse movement, otherwise tracking on table is not good at all with the existing beam it has.  Also important, it raises your wrist a-bit, and as said, if your hands hurt already, stop typing, stop mouse movements, reduce computer work hours, otherwise you'll seriously injure yourself. seriously.
RL7B46P3GV8S2	1	Quality build. Fits Kindle Fire 7 perfectly. Good padding. Taking off a few stars because the first one arrived very obviously used. It had significant wear marks on it. They were very obvious and visible. There is no way this could have been missed when the item was packed. Fulfilled by amazon so I'm not sure who to blame here. If you get one that is new you'll be satisfied with the price/quality.
RQ8CAHJWLEBJZ	1	It was not a Microsoft hard drive. Microsoft drives have backwards compatibility built in for older xbox games. If you are using only xbox 360 games, this is all you need at a fraction of the price of the genuine drive.
RU20Z85BT3BDH	3	The basic machinery works fine. I like the look, the ease, the battery life. All fine and up to my expectations. But, it does not amplify the sounds to a level that makes this useful for the iPad (I have the iPad and the iPad2, and have similar results).<br /><br />Otherwise fine, but just not loud enough.
RPFV0V1MT71BI	4	It's OK. I really wanted a 360 rotating stand for my new ipad and I spent a lot of time looking for the right one. There are plenty of cheap ones out there, but been there/done that/don't recommend. The cases with grooves to hold the ipad at an angle rarely work well, so I hoped this approach would be better. It does grip the ipad fairly well if you're only reading or perhaps swiping through a web site. But I am drawing and painting so I'm making lots of &#34;touches&#34; to the screen. This case bounces and jiggles as I touch it with my stylus. And often it slides. The front tab that folds over to close the ipad is not rigid enough to catch the device, so it slides right past this and flops down. Yes, I could detach and use the 'typing' legs, but it sure would be nice to have it just catch on the front flap.<br /><br />I think I may return this one and continue my search. Why is it so difficult for the manufacturers' to make grooves that would actually hold an ipad up ????<br /><br />One more thing - this case is fairly heavy, compared to the weight of the new ipad. Why negate one of the advantages of upgrading my device?
R3BR7IDJZ80E0	2	Everything about this monitor is as described.... except for the 2mm bezel. Yes, it is true the plastic frame around the screen in only 2mm. It appears to be edge to edge screen when off, but when you look close or turn it on.....there is an internal black border beneath the screen measuring another 1/4 inch or so. I don't understand why manufactures are having such a hard time making a turn edge to edge monitor?
R2F0310UC3UD5S	1	This gizmo is sensitive to the surface it is on... much more than other optical mice I've used.  I notice it uses a blue laser... not the common red type... so I'm apt to attribute this weakness to the laser type.  It seems to work best on monochromatic or plain / dull surfaces.  On more reflective surfaces like marble tops and things like cloth tabletops with patterns, the Wedge just doesn't track well.
RCQRYGYGE3E3D	4	I bought this so I could leave the laptop home and have more room in my carry-on for a recent vacation. I have a few issues with it - it burns power fairly quickly. Once the Kindle goes into sleep mode, it doesn't work properly when you wake up the kindle. You have to turn off bluetooth mode, reboot the keyboard, turn bluetooth mode back on and re-pair the kindle and keyboard.  I find this extremely frustrating - I don't know that I would have chosen this case/keyboard had I known this would be an issue. The keyboard is not compatible with some of the apps I use which have chat - also frustrating but not a huge problem. Finally, the purple is MUCH darker than pictured - much more plum than the light pinkish purple pictured.  It doesn't change the function of the case, but it was a disappointment.
R35K05Q5QB4HC9	1	The battery does not last as long as I had hoped. Only about an hour, hour and a half.
RTLPNNQSYQGC9	2	Smaller than expected. It appears to be designed to fit your hand, but only if your hands are super small... Other than that, it connected right away, great tracking and you can change speed/sensitivity via the DPI button on top. Batteries are included... Although, the battery compartment is a little annoying to open, if I ever manage to do so... Also, works just fine on Mac OS, but Windows 7 chokes, recognizing the mouse, but failing to use it anyway.
R3U67ABJ4S7ESM	1	When is stand mode the top corners do not hold the iPad from starting to slide down the top of the case. This started to happen very shortly after I purchased, but just having a chance to review now, while I am on Amazon looking for a new case.
R2RX04QXY73T2H	3	I received this battery on March 23, I tested the battery on my HP DV9000t by fully charging it and then calibrated my laptop per HP's instructions on their Website.  This aligns the battery charge state with the battery status reading on the laptop.  The battery seemed acceptable.  I was able to play online poker for about an hour and a half on battery power before getting a low battery warning.  Keep in mind though that this poker software is not very demanding.  There is no hard drive access, etc. while playing.  Then my next test was to fully charge the battery and leave it off the charger for about 10 days to see how much drain there would be.  The battery meter read 93%.  This seemed like nearly a full charge and being impressed I went ahead and began to update my Windows from Microsoft's Website.  Within 15 minutes the laptop shutoff and the battery was completely dead.  Either I have a defective battery or the MAH (milliamp hour) rating for these batteries is GROSSLY overstated.  I called Amazon customer service and as usual they provided top notch customer service by sending me a replacement right away along with a return shipping label.  I will update this review upon testing the replacement.  Be very careful, charge your battery fully, calibrate your laptop battery per HP's instructions on their Website and then test it under real world usage.  If you don't take these steps you just might be sorely disappointed when you need to run your laptop on battery power and the battery runs dead after 15-30 minutes.  I know from experience that the OEM battery that came with the laptop from HP would run the computer for between 1-2 hours depending on the type of usage. I will not accept any less performance for the sake of saving a few bucks buying a cheap substitute that probably wouldn't last as long as the original.  Update: In December 2011 the second battery failed completely.  It would not hold enough charge to even start the laptop.  Once again, Amazon customer service came through with flying colors and replaced it under warranty.  It had been about 8 months since I received the 1st warranty exchange.  The 2nd warranty exchange battery now installed seems to hold more of a charge and last longer than either of the first 2 so I am hopeful this one will last longer.  If it does not, I know that Amazon will stand behind the product 100%.  I am therefore raising my rating up to 3 stars.
R1LQAPYNY4J55Q	3	This case as two problems. The first is the tiny tool provided to press the reset and  power buttons. I bought two of these cases so far and I've already lost one. Second, the case doesn't really stay together; the snaps are barely noticeable. I bought the case so I could carry the BBB around in my bag, but I won't be doing that with this case...
R1TCESNHQHS3N8	2	You'd think that putting on a simple screen protector would be easy? Not so much. Despite my vast experience with screen covers, I couldn't get this one on without numerous air bubbles. Despite many attempts to remove and smooth, I wound up with air bubbles all over the screen.  HOWEVER, I am glad I did not just remove it and toss it. After a day or so, the air bubbles dissipated (nearly invisible), and now I am only left with a few corners that won't lay flat no matter what I do.  It may not look perfect, but it gets the job done. Felt it should have performed better for the price.
R1ICQ20ADQD2G8	1	Having used my original Kindle for over 2 years and being totally used to how it works, the new Paperwhite version doesn't work in most ways the same, or in my opinion as well.
ROFZK7O7AS1MT	2	The way the straps fit, it tends to bleed out the power so the battery Dies a lot faster.<br />The look and feel are great.
R1RI90ZKIY4RH7	3	I got this as a case and keyboard for my Arnova 10 inch tablet. The keyboard does work but the stylus does not, it is very cheap plastic and the touch screen  will not respond. Also the holder tabs that hold the tablet in place on the left side of the case are right where the power button is for the tablet so I will have to cut part of that holder tab off so it does not keep turning my tablet on and off. Otherwise it is ok. It is definitely synthetic material and looks nothing like leather. It is somewhat solid and has the stand on the back to hold the unit upright. The Arnova is not as high as the case but is held in well with some modifications as mentioned earlier. Overall not bad for the price for some other tablets. Not perfect but will do for now.  Sharon
R13CZ6MZRTF92O	2	Gorgeous monitor, but after i set everything up I notice a dead pixel about two inches from the bottom and ten inches in from the right side. It appears as a tiny green spec. It's not a huge issue, but for $200 I don't want any imperfections. I've submitted a return order and will update this review when I get the replacement.
RN8N0UR7GTB2D	2	Overall, the bag is ok: no bad stitching or broken parts. The design is not so great. The only part that truly closes is the little zipper pocket on the outside. You have to be careful not to put anything small, loose and valuable inside the main bag, because it's just dividers in there. Also be careful the flap is secured to the straps. Stuff can easily fall out if the bag goes upside down. My other gripe is that it's really closer to 16&#34; wide. I wanted it just to hold my new iPad Air 2 but it's plenty big enough for a laptop... I feel like I'm totting  luggage. I was looking for a purse substitute that would hold a tablet, phone and my personal stuff ( wallet, lipstick, etc) but this isn't it. Too big and no zippers inside. Way bigger than 13&#34; wide.
RYYCECLBB88IZ	1	Have to assign a static IP address for it to be stable (once you know this, it is great).  Dont know if this is because I bought &#34;refurbished&#34;.  Get what you pay for I guess.
RLKWPV1W3GRNV	1	It works but is not very stable unless it's on a table.  I do like that it works equally well vertically or horizonally
RBKG8PGX4VU24	2	This case is very good for protecting my ipad. It turns off when I close it and comes on when I open it. It is a little heavy and it isn't the greatest for propping up the ipad for reading.
R2E0BOIDEY76PC	1	I bought these to protect our keyboards from spills and crumbs.  However, they make it so difficult to push the keys accurately.  The one I got for the office, I have even taken off because I found I was constantly pushing the wrong key.
R3TGYQAN8NNRFL	1	Works well but not compatible with Panasonic TV
R1JYZF0ISOCXLQ	3	Its good, doesnt seem to do much better than my h100i did, installed it on a fx8350 which bent the arms on the heatsink, i just installed it on<br />an i7 5820k and i was getting high temps, removed cpu cooler and thermal paste was only on one half of the cpu block, so i noticed the arms were bent, i straightened them as best i could and temps have been better, i initially had an issue which swiftech responded to immediately, then i had the issue with the bent arms and emailed through amazon twice and never got a response,
R58PVD2XBMIZA	1	I have two of these.  Somehow the second order disappeared and luckily I found out that USPS had it in their branch.  Just inconvienent to stop by and wait to pick it up.  The signal is boosted and it does expands the distance where the wifi signal was a little weak.  But tends to drop signal for some odd reason.
RIIK09NCDY91P	1	Padding on the inside is great, however the zippers on both pockets pretty much fell apart after a few months of light use.
R2FI1I02JMU55Z	4	I've used this case in black color for a year.     It's stylish, quite comfortable to wear due to adjustable strap and safe for my laptop because it's a hard case.    I have HP dm4 and it fits it (leaving over 1 inch of space by the side). But the laptop is the only thing that fits there: all cords with adapter (slim version) and a mouse I have to put into the pocket of this case; and when I close the case, it bends a little at pocket side.  And there is no room for anything else.  When you have glossy plastic on top of your laptop you could hurt or scratch it with things in a pocket, and I definitely don't recommend to use this case when you plan to carry laptop with adapter and cords.  I wish it would be a little wider.    The most unpleasant thing about this case I've found - it's easy to scratch and marks are WHITE. I have a black case, and after a year of use it looks awful at corners.  That's the major reason I buy another case. When you buy this case in white or yellow it's OK, I guess.
R2F2JK61JQT3IA	1	I should have read this one more carefully.. I thought this was a silicon skin. Turns out i just paid 30 dollars for 2 stickers.  Can't believe I just did this.<br />I guess it still looks okay, the stickers are much darker than in the photo though.
R2XIVPO3S5VPLB	4	Pros:   I don't think you'll find a better budget KVM switch. It is very easy to setup. The software is quite simple; very basic/no frills.  Exactly what I expect from a something in this price range. The KVM switch itself is not cheap looking by any means. It's made of good quality plastic and the cables that are sent with it are pretty good too. It takes about 2-4 seconds to switch between PCs. Quite acceptable from a USB KVM switch. If this were a PS2 connection I'm sure it'd be much faster.    Cons:   It looks like it was designed to be smaller and take up less space, however because of the positioning of the ports the cables make this thing about 4-6 inches in diameter. I would have preferred it be wider and all the ports be in the back. Also, there is no way to mount it to a surface. So you're stuck with leaving it laying on your desk with the wires going everywhere. You could leave it laying behind your desk but I like using the buttons on top of it versus the keyboard. It also does not work well with my Logitech MX300 mouse. The scroll wheel works intermittently. All other features on my mouse work fine including middle mouse button click via the scroll wheel. I contacted tech support on through their online help desk. Their responses were professional but did take a few hours. They could not offer me any solutions and suggested I try a different mouse. A microsoft optical mouse works just fine. While they did not offer to fix the KVM they told me I would need to purchase a different mouse.  No big deal, I need a new one anyway. :)    Summary:  Despite the mouse problems and the mediocre port design this is a very good budget KVM. It suits my needs and gets the job done efficiently. The age old question to the salesman is \\"Would you recommend one to your parents?\\".  Yes, indeed I would.
R2O9L19OIUK9TL	2	The bag is not very spacious as compared to my previous swissgear bag. The laptop storage section features a velcro flap to secure the laptop (often gets entangled with other items). About 1/4th of the laptop (15'' macbook pro) stays out of the laptop storage \\"pouch\\". The shoulder straps are very comfortable compared to older swissgear bags and distribute weight of contents very uniformly.<br /><br />Overall, not worth its price (usd 107.00). Would recommend buying other swissgear bags that are a lot cheaper.
R1QWK7QAPOREL0	2	I purchased this drive with some reservations - especially because a few reviews mentioned that the drive is loud.  It is primarily a backup drive for me, so it doesn't get the intense usage that other drives may see, but so far it has performed flawlessly.  It is quick and quiet.  My main drive is a Western Digital Green drive which is specifically made to be quiet at the expense of being somewhat slower.  Well, so far, this Hitachi seems as quiet, if not quieter, to me.  But it is definitely faster than my Green drive.    All-in-all I am quite pleased.  Perhaps I will reformat my drives sometime and use the new Hitachi as the main drive.    **UPDATE** After just a few months, the drive died and I had to send it in to get a replacement.  For that reason, I've lowered to 3 stars.  I realize that drives die, but this drive was only a few months old and rarely used.  It shouldn't die that soon, in my humble opinion
R3INNTBUY6AGAD	2	This product is not really an iPad sleeve (a little bit too big) but for the price, it's not bad
R3TK3LIZUTEI5D	1	I thought it was a good idea to have the built in light, but the description didn't match what I expected. It didn't fit my kindle so I sent it back. Wish the description was more clear about what the product was specifically for.....it didn't say it would not fit newest kindle reader.
R1JZYEDL26TWAH	2	I read the reviews before purchasing but hoped my stand would be different....NOT! It did last longer than others but have to be replaced after 4 months. The stand is ideal for the case and practical for placing horizontally or vertically but not durable. Purchasing the Trident case locks you in to purchasing the stand because it's too heave to hold w/out the stand.
R1104VGEBOEZZN	1	The main case was pretty cheaply made but the other accessories made up for it.  Like the extra charges and zippered case so its still worth the price but I ordered a sturdier case after the fact.
R1Q9H6C08AM9BA	4	I am not quite sure if I have written any review on this Tablet, iPad Alternative, but after several months I came to like this little machine.  Although, the webcam is not functioning and the storage is extremely small (30 gb which I wish it was 120 gb or more) but it does its job well. Again, I wish there would be a way to upgrade to a higher storage capacity instead of buying a new one later on.  Windows 7 ultimate is taking most of the 30 gb leaving at least 10 gb or less which it does not leave room for Adobe Reader and Flash drive.  After I installed Maple math software I have 2 gb left.  I can't install other math or any other software.  The multitouch is not working properly but I rarely use that anyway.  All in All, it is great the way it is - with its Office suite you still can use Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote. You still can check the email, browse the web and watch sport.  It needs a little more juice to be an iPad alternative since iPad runs on Apps that are abundantly available and this machine runs on pure Windows 7 applications that not only are not cheap but also this machine has storage limitations for applications.  I hope the next generation of computers and tablets would be capable of booting from a flash drive so at least the machines can recover from a crash or capacity limitations.
R1AWO43165SM5D	1	The background is far from white, closer to grey.  It also has a glare from the lamp/other light source, which you wouldn't experience in a printed book.
R1T2LI9DU8DV1O	2	I got it for my ASUS 15.6\\" laptop and the molding is too short for my laptop to fit into it. So it does fit if crammed in, but only one end is protected by the hard molding. And the front seems to be thinner material than on a different BUILT sleeve I had, so I guess you have to choose whether you want the top or bottom of your computer to be left vulnerable. I'm disappointed by the design. It will get the job done, adding an extra shield in my laptop bag, but it just didn't feel cool. It kind of looked like a serving tray wearing a wet suit. :(
R2NY825OIZK56H	1	Nice Tablet cum laptop feature. No Keyboard back light rest of the feature good. Speaker sound produce little bit echo. Sometime not getting clear voice
RHIR9GA81QRP3	2	I bought this to use with my MK808B mini android, and yes it does connect but the connections goes in and out, turns off on its own. It also constantly conflicts with the android built in onscreen-keyboard.
RF08OURERR4N2	4	I love this keyboard and case (there's a &#34;but&#34; coming).  The case is sturdy, and it grips the iPad tightly so that it won't pop out (a problem with my previous Logitech case).  This keyboard has great funtionality and is a bit easier to type on than the Logitech Ultrathin Folio.  The backlight feature on the keyboard is very nice, including the choice of colors.  In terms of design, the only disadvantage for me compared to the Logitech is that the Zagg case cannot be folded back on itself to allow easy holding of the iPad for reading.  However, I quickly got used to holding my iPad like an open book, so this downside did not outweigh the good things about the case.  BUT, the show-stopper for me on this case is that it is completey unreliable on bluetooth connectivity.  I read in some other posts that this was an issue, but I thought it might be an occasional issue.  For me, every time I opened the case to use it, I had to Forget/Re-pair the device to my iPad, and on a few occasions, even that did not work.  That is enough to drive me batty, so I have sent this case back.  However, if Zagg and Apple ever get this bug fixed, I will definitely purchase this item again.
R1LWFLJ8HZGPUI	2	The cover itself is good - I like the auto on/auto off when you open and close it.  The stand part seems overly complicated.  I have to stop and think about it every time I try to use it - seems like it should be second nature by now.  It also collapses on itself sometimes - I think the magnets that are supposed to hold it together are not strong enough.  I think I would go with the cheaper basic cover over this one.
R1SQ04Q89YJZ4G	2	Great color and good cover, but the 4 &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom tend to fall off, making the laptop unbalanced. One of the &#34;feet&#34; also came glued on crookedly.
R1FKN6MVABNRBI	1	Ok for knocking around on the web but you can't watch youtube.  I would not have bought it if I had known that.
R26UQ3TQAWBTY8	1	I was rebuilding an old work station.  It's possible when I updated a controller driver, it created a conflict, but it was the correct update.  This system was running Windows 7 32 Bit and 64 Bit.  I could get the Floppy and the USB to work, but could not get the Card Readers to work.  I could get Windows to see the Slots.  Windows loaded a Generic Driver for those Slots, but when I put a card in, it could not see the Data.  I contacted Bytecc, first they said maybe something wrong with the unit.  I bought the first on Amazon for about $12, I returned that one as defective, then ordered a second.  The second one cost about $30.  I had the same problem with that as well and returned it.  I found a used Floppy on Amazon, ordered that, then bought the Sabrent 75-1 Reader and installed them both and everything worked fine.  I see now there is a Sabrent Floppy and 68-1 Card reader combo.  May want to start with that and forget about the Bytecc unit if you want to run Windows 7 or 8.
R1CPM97E16626V	2	This product worked great for a while, but then the printer broke. Not only that, but it only allows for 100 connections and when I was unable to upgrade to 200 users, I was unable to reach any kind of customer support and my emails went unanswered. Ultimately, I stopped using the product and replaced it with a different system after only 6 months.
R3MQONOAKSUQ45	2	This fit OK. Did the SSD optical upgrade on my 2009 MacBook pro. Decided to use this to put the optical in. It really dies not fit too well or snug. It does the job and at $8 you can't expect much. If your like me and use your DVD drive once a year it's fine, if you use it daily or weekly spend a little more.
R1R6S4YG2TESX5	3	Gotta admit I was truly excited when the Neuros MPEG4 Video Recorder 2  finally arrived. I actually found more value in my Palm Treo 650 smartphone. Yes, I can now watch my favorite movies while be mobile. That when I found I hit one those solutions unresolved... Since I use SD cards for extended memory I needed to get a SD/MMC CF Adapter, very hard to find since most locate Computer Stores are no longer brick and mortar(I ordered one through Amazon as well).     Once you do everything up running the process is really simple. As you're recording you can preview the playback on the TV. Great resolution and audio.     The same though does not hold true for the playback on my Palm Treo.  You'll need to download the TCPMP Core drivers for playback and audio (does not work with the Real Player software). Once loaded there is an error message, \\"Player: MPEG4 AAC Audio decorder not included! It was ermoved from the official install package because  of intellectual property considerations\\".    So now I'm thinking maybe I should have gotten the Neuros MPEG4 Video Recorder 2 Plus, maybe they've worked out the audio decoder matters.
R2MO0Q5W6GDVSQ	1	Other consumers looking for a product like this need to know they may need to make some modification. It does not fit the Galaxy  Note 10.1. But after the modification it works well enough.
R1597YKFU7E639	1	When I first recieved my AC adapter it worked for a little while and then stopped working for no reason. I sent them a message back and they asked me to send the broken one back and they would send me another. Only thing is it had to be USPS first class mail. I did anyway and they sent me another one. It was about a week later when I recieved it but at least the second one worked.
R2D8XWKJOBFJ6L	3	I got this as an external keyboard for my Macbook.  I am a fast touch typist.  I tested it last night for the shift-key stickiness people have been complaining about.  Definitely no longer an issue, at least with the keyboard I received.  However, there is a peculiar lag when typing that I have never noticed with other external keyboards, e.g., Kinesis.  Is it hugely noticeable?  Well, I guess it depends on whether you pay close attention to screen as you're typing.  If you type quickly and watch, it's obvious.  It does bother me but I haven't decided how much; I suspect it will drive me crazy when programming but I've only used it for text editing so far.  Oddly, my older and larger external Thinkpad Keyboard with the numeric keypad doesn't have this problem but that's too big to carry around.<br /><br />The real problem is there is no Lenovo driver to control TrackPoint speed and sensitivity for Macs.  Its speed is directly linked to mouse speed in the preferences panel.  This is a shame, as the TrackPoint experience is not remotely as elegant as it is on a Thinkpad.  But, it does work albeit somewhat stiffly.<br /><br />So, bottom line: The physical typing experience is much nicer than using the native Mac chicklets.  (Mac keyboards are tolerable but I use external Kinesis keyboards at home and at the office; I type enough that I want a \\"real\\" keyboard.)  I'll likely keep this but I'm not sure if I'll travel with it.
R1U4P9174MPXXQ	1	Needs to be a quarter inch wider, it doesn't completely cover the screen of my iPad mini.
R28GH5726FIA9U	3	This mouse was great. It looks great, the LED's have the perfect amount of brightness, etc. but like many people have already said, after a few months the left button starts to double click, which is a pain in the butt if you do work in Photoshop or when you drag windows around. I would save up a bit more money and buy a different mouse with a longer lifespan.
R87OU048TQJ6Z	2	I love the case ! Also on that note I can only give three star because it started peeling on the side where the black lining is. I even keep my ipad in the case in a bag. So the wear is minimal. If you use this as your main case .. It will slowly fall apart..
R3M6BFX1RF521T	1	Case is good over all but the stand function does not work as depicted and is functionally unusable. If you do not care about the stand function I would rate this as a good buy.
R3PVQL3A2D2SN4	3	I picked up Amazon's unlighted Kindle cover when I bought my Kindle.  I had problems and read that the case might be the problem so I went hunting for a new cover.  One of the things that I wanted in my new case was the ability to use the cover as a stand so that I can read while I eat.  I wanted a case that would be easy to hold while reading on the bus, as well as one that would provide a good amount of protection.  The [[ASIN:B004ALXSTU Acase Genuine Leather Flip Case for Kindle 3 with Multiple Position Stand (Black)]] does allow for mostly hands free reading--you still have to turn the pages--and it does provide protection for the Kindle.  Unfortunately, it is not easy to hold, being too bulky.  I've never considered my hands particularly small but I suspect that this cover would be easier to hold by someone who has hands a good deal larger than my own.  (I believe that I wear a men's medium work glove.)<br /><br />I was unable to comfortably use my [[ASIN:B003HKRVAW Belkin Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle (White)]] which is a necessity during the winter months--it's dark during my commute.<br /><br />One final note:  The other day, I noticed an odd edge on the flappy-do that allows the case to be held open.  The edge scratched my hand.  Why is this a concern other than it was annoying?  Well, that bit of the case is not made of leather--I would say that it was actually a vinyl of some sort.<br /><br />July 7, 2011 Update:<br /><br />I ended up giving the Acase Kindle case to a friend.  She loves.  It only goes to show different strokes for different people.
R2BIZVCQP53Y1W	0	The case is awesome if it wasn't broken.. I will not replace it, it still works but it has a chip in one side. buyer be warned
R271IZ9YWXZUQO	4	Initially considering a tablet PC, I instead chose this netbook for several reasons.  It's lighter than many 10&#34; tablets, has a 320gb hard drive compared to tablet storage limitations posed by microSD card technology.  A true keyboard (as opposed to the touchscreen or bluetooth keyboard for an additional expense) and the capability of using programs that I'm already familiar with completed the decision.  While tablets are the current tech rage, and while I do own a Nook Color, they have limitations that a full computer does not.<br /><br />Pros:  At about 1kg (2.2 lb) it's very light and easy to carry.  The hard drive can be replaced with a larger one should the need for more storage arise. The screen is easily viewed, with nice contrast and definition.  Processor speed and graphics acceleration are adequate for the requirements I place upon them (with one proviso).  Since this is a low-end netbook, I did not expect a gaming machine.  The keyboard, though compact, is easily adapted to (admittedly, my hands are on the small side for a man), and possesses a good keystroke and feel for touch-typing.  The Asus utilities are straightforward and intuitive.  The wifi is the most sensitive of all of my family's wifi devices (2 smartphones, a Nook and a Samsung laptop).  The touchpad, though a bit different from what I'm used to, is easy to adapt to and there were no hiccups in adding a wireless Logitech &#34;notebook&#34; mouse.  Audio quality...according to my 18 yr old audiophile twins, it's good quality when using earbuds. (Years of punk rock and other loud environments have left me with significant hearing loss, so I cannot give a first-order review on that).  The built-in speaker is sufficient that I can understand movie dialogue even with a moderate amount of home background noise, so should be more than adequate for people without hearing loss.<br /><br />Cons: Depending on your requirements and computer savvy, these could be deal-breakers.  First and foremost, the computer comes with Windows 7 Starter, the most basic version and its fixed 1gb RAM is not really adequate to the task.  At login, even with as many bells and whistles disabled as possible, the operating system requires 50-54% of the RAM, leaving 512mb or less available to run software.  This can be rapidly consumed by the browser or many other programs, at which point the OS starts swapping data from ram to disk and back (disk-swapping).  The slow HDD further compounds matters making this little netbook pretty sluggish in Windows.  My solution was to set up crunchbang Linux as a 2nd operating system and I use Windows now only for Netflix.  A Debian-based distribution, crunchbang uses about 102mb of RAM, leaving over 920mb free for programs, drastically reducing the need to swap between RAM and disk.<br /><br />The Intel GMA 3600 graphics co-processor is barely capable of handling Netflix and only then when HD is disabled (not an issue of concern with the 1024x600 display), when all is working well.  However, Intel has stated they will no longer be supporting this chip and there will be no Windows 8 driver released for it.  Both the Windows 7 driver and the Linux graphics module are buggy.  When displaying video (Netflix or watching an .avi or .mpg via video player), the entire computer freezes at irregular and fairly frequent intervals, necessitating unplugging the charger AND the battery to turn it off.  This freeze is accompanied by a loud buzzing sound from the speaker or earphones and it renders the power switch inoperative.  Bluray movies (via my desktop computer through the wifi and home network) are often unviewable as they overtax what appears to be the Intel graphics software (not the chip).<br /><br />That complaint is directed at Intel and not Asus and, lacking a TV at home, I cannot say whether the problems will carry over to viewing through the HDMI port.<br /><br />----<br />A 7200 rpm hard drive or, better yet, a solid state drive, would do much to speed things up in Windows 7, but I purchased this as an inexpensive, more versatile alternative to a tablet and don't plan on further expenditures.  Crunchbang's lighter footprint alleviates much of the problem, it's free (donations gratefully accepted), and less prone to crash than Win7 Starter.  This is not my first Asus product, nor is it likely to be my last, but it may well be the last Intel-based computer I purchase; I've dealt with similar issues from Intel in the past, particularly with laptops.  In contrast, my first AMD computer was put together in '87 and I've owned AMD computers extensively in the intervening 26 years, with virtually no such issues.<br /><br />Conclusion:  if your intended usage is mainly for more mundane tasks (word-processing, etc.) with sufficient power for web-surfing, Netflix and the occasional DVD via network or USB drive, this netbook is a decent choice, but has limitations.  If you have the interest in learning the installation, care and feeding of crunchbang or a similar Linux (not a difficult task), or have prior *nix experience, a dual-boot computer which allows you to select the OS to use at startup gives this machine some welcome boosts in performance.
R1LHTT1YF7S9DP	1	Nothing I do to adjust tightness of the headset seams to stop the pain after about an hour of listening,
R1VWRCKDDQJJJZ	1	I received my case and was very excited to get it. I had read the reviews about it been to big, but I thought my iPad2 would fit because it has a hard case on it. But no it is to big it really is. This will not work for an iPad. the case is very nice and it looks great but it is not for an iPad. I gave it to my daughter for her netbook and it's still to big for her netbook. she is able to fit her netbook, charger and a lot of other stuff in it. So pay close attention to reviews because they are true. I had never written a review but now I know that it is very helpfull.
R352WFUT3CRWR1	0	It;s insurance you really do not need but if you do it is great to have.
R2VBSR41VJGHWE	1	This is a low quality tablet. First the colors on this tablet go crazy when you enter some apps/games. They go grey. But the shipping was fast. Everything was in the package.
R1M8T5WRPG6ZOE	1	The battery is twice as thick as the one it replaces. The online description did not indicate that the battery is oversize.
R38R4R1FJ5G86C	1	Can not fault seller but this card was terrible. Would connect only on occasion and for not particular reason why it would or would not. Just too unreliable
R2BZC4GMMC8CVC	1	I was excited to recieve this product as when i bought my samsung galaxy note 10.1 best buy had no adapters left in sock.This is a reasonable price and appears to work so far. I find it difficult to pull in and out of the device, but i am hoping that will become easier as time goes by.
R1PK9YGGN98S6B	2	I bought it few months ago for my laptop, but i tried to install it but couldn't it's doesn't install automatically as other accessories installed now I'm waiting for my friend to when he get a chance to see me he might be able to install it. it does not come with any cd or some installation software etc.
R2HXOGDN3TK4SV	3	I've got this monitor sitting next to my main monitor, which is hardware-calibrated for accurate color. In just a few words, the AOCs color looks like total crap. They've injected the monitor with a lot of excess blue to make it appear sharper and more vibrant. Television manufacturers do this to try to get in edge on competition while on-display in the store. The difference is that with TVs and non-DisplayLink monitors you can neutralize those artificial colors after you buy them. Not so here. This monitor cannot be calibrated, nor can you truly adjust the brightness (you can download programs that overlay some grey on your screen to mimic lowering the brightness). SO. If you have the option of a non-usb powered monitor instead of this, go for it. If you need it to be USB for portability, it's pretty decent at getting the job done. Just don't think about editing photos or doing any color or contrast sensitive work on it.
R11RYI4AV5QWN0	1	I get this tablet mainly for the GPS function, but unfortunately most of the newest apps for navigation are not compatibles with this fj_vortex model or any other newest apps, I have to install old versions on it. But so far no problems with it, just incompatibility issues.
RNQCJAPQ81KHD	1	The case fits fine. It came with micro not mini usb as I thought. I ordered an adapter from micro to mini and the keyboard does not work.
RURYGP5ZTPJI7	1	This vendor and others say that this a 2-way IDE - SATA adapter. Our intent was to have the device plug into the FEMALE IDE cable plug [the needed plug on the device needs to be MALE] and then put a SATA device on one of the SATA connectors in the device. I have ordered these from several vendors; also thinking that thier's is what I need. The vendors' descriptions are such that their's looks with what I want. Got any suggestions??
RH1IL8UP6WQBB	2	I ordered the R6250, it arrived two days after shipping. Out of the box, everything worked correctly - I was able to set up the SSID and connect various devices to the network. After about 5 minutes all devices lost connectivity to the network and I noticed the power light on the front of the router turned from green to amber. The device booted back up, all devices reconnected, then about 2 minutes later the same problem occurred. There is definitely an intermittent power issue with the device I ordered, as it was refurbished and may have made it past QA due to it being an intermittent issue. I contacted Amazon support and immediately received a refund and return label. I don't think this is a reflection of EMBIZ as it could have been overlooked if the device wasn't tested for very long. I give this 3 stars because the product did arrive ahead of schedule, appeared to be in new condition, and the refund was given by Amazon with no problem.
R3LVUIKTH1Q77M	0	Works fine.
R15V7MC32Q3FET	5	This is my update to my earlier review in which I noted that this &#34; tablet began deleting newly installed apps on reboot after a system update and this continued after a factory reset. Others cite the same problem at postings on the Lenovo Community website under the headings 'Idea Tab A8-50 (A5500) paid apps won't install' and 'applications won't install'. Eventually another user posted the fix on the Lenovo Community website which required installing the beta version of the Google Play Store software (at the time, not yet released on the Google Play Store) from a geek site that had the beta version. Neither Lenovo nor Google would acknowledge the problem leaving A8-50 owners on their own. This did fix the problem described in my first review. So with this fix, it's a decent tablet. Nice screen size, decent resolution, decent sound. Its biggest limitations are: 1.) its limited memory (16 gb). 2.) There is at least one Lenovo App installed that Norton has rated as a high security risk, a problem similar to that found recently on other Lenovo products.  3.) Lenovo still has not released an Android OS update, so the A8-50 runs Kit Kat rather than Lolipop, putting the OS several generations back. 4.) In that it's own software is a security risk, a somewhat antagonistic relationship with its customers. Because Lenovo still has not updated the OS, I can not recommend this tablet. Still, a decent tablet for the kids.
RU73A2LIBVCRY	3	I have generally liked this iPad cover, especially the magnetic shut-off when closing the case. The felt lining is a pet hair magnet, which is unfortunate (almost like Velcro- I can't even remove the hair with a standard lint roller). That's ok, but the biggest problem I have is that the little hook on the back of the case is positioned about an inch too close to the edge. This means that using it on a table in landscape mode is fine, but trying to turn the iPad around 180 degrees to view it upright doesn't work because the angle created by the hook on the case is such that the iPad is not supported and falls over backwards. So it can't sit up upright at all (neither in portrait mode, which the case isn't designed for, NOR in landscape mode which it's supposed to be designed for, which would be nice for displaying recipes on the counter while cooking, or trying to watch a TV show or movie).
R20AFGE10D1MID	1	The car charger works great the home charger not so great.<br />The porn charger so apart out of the box, but I manage to get it working.
R17OIBSOF8VOCQ	1	Often, disks connected to this device via a Mac Pro spontaneously disconnect and the device does get quite warm. I've had particular issues with the eSATA ports not working from time to time.
R3P8NKNE6WGYM5	1	This screen cover is a fairly thick sheet that goes on smoothly, doesn't wrinkle, and exactly fits the Kindle screen.  When I first put it on, there were 2 tiny bubbles, barely noticeable, but the instructions had told how to get rid of tiny bubbles caused by dust, so I tried to make it perfect.  All I can say is that each try ended up with bigger and more pronounced bubbles.  The moral to this story is that I should have just quit after the first try.    I finally thought that really, the Kindle does not need a screen cover. I have the leather cover with a light, which is very worthwhile, and it's not a touch screen, so I never touch it.  So I took the cover off, and when I get a round tuit, I will cut it down and put it on my camera.
R3VQQIGIYGWJ0O	3	I wish I had phyically seen this netbook before buying it.  The individual keys are this netbook is just too tiny compares to other netbooks.  I also own a HP mini 1010 netbook, and this idealpad's keys are only about 75% in size compares to the HP.  It makes very difficult to type.  The overall built quality seems decent and the screen is bright enough.   The unit also does not seem to run hot and it stays very quite.   The 6 cell battery that comes with the unit is a big plus.      Bottom line, if you are not going to do alot the typing, then this unit is fine.  However, if you do, then you better off consider some other brands.
R1S4PPDJD0SAFF	1	Not as loud as I expected from powered speakers.
R290ILIKC4XPQK	5	I purchased these Dvorak keyboard stickers for my Sony Viao laptop. They are the correct configuration, so now I can easily look at the keyboard if I can't remember which key is which. That has been a problem for me with some of the keys I seldom use, specifically a few of the symbol keys such as =/+. So the stickers do what they are supposed to do. However, there are a couple of reasons why I am disappointed. One is that the stickers for the F/U and J/H keys do have a cut-out for the bump that lets me feel where to position my hands correctly, but placing the sticker so that the cut-out is in the right place meant the top of the sticker had to be trimmed away because it stuck out over the top edge of the keys. That's not that big of a deal, really, but the thickness of the stickers is such that I can't feel the bump on the key anymore regardless. That may be different on a different keyboard. But the main problem is that the stickers have a slick surface, and I just don't like the feel of my keyboard with the stickers on it. I much preferred the feel without the stickers. Also, my keys now have a shiny surface and have a glare in the light when I am using my laptop in bed. The glare is enough to obscure the lettering so that I can't read which key is which without tilting the keyboard this way and that. That's annoying. I wish that I had applied only the stickers for the special symbol keys that I needed and not bothered with the letter key stickers, since I know the letters by heart. Now, for someone just learning Dvorak on a standard keyboard, the stickers would be a great aid until you get to the point where you have memorized all the keys and are truly a touch typist. The stickers are certainly a very economical alternative to a Dvorak keyboard such as the Kinesis Advantage (which is fabulous, but rather expensive for a keyboard).
R3JTXGD2IZOIRA	3	The sound quality is great, the microphone is very sensitive ignore the noise canceling it claims. It picks up everything. You will most likely have to make a bunch of adjustments in whatever chat service you use to make up for the initial overwhelming loudness it projects when you speak, but that's easy enough to work out.     I was really excited to play with the voice effects, then was met with great disapointment. There are only a few options with many of them sounding incredibly similar to each other, and some of them being much to high pitch for anyone to tolerate listening to you speak for more than a few words. I was hoping to be able to model a draenei voice, but it surprisingling did not make the list. Nor did the nightelf of either gender as my husband had hoped. The voice effects were fun to play with for a few minutes but it annoyed more people than amused with the high pitches, or inability to understand what was being said due to the frequencies. There is a create your own feature, but that seems more of a headache trying to find just the right settings than it's worth.     Also, kinda wish this wasn't usb so if I wanted to just use the mic or headphones separately I could. The mic is removable but it's bent at an odd angle with no flexability so I don't imagine pluging it in on it's own would be an option for many machines.    Other than the awesome sound this thing puts out, the best part is the customization of the lighting on each ear. If you are wondering how to change out the lenses, it comes with a little screwdriver intended for that purpose. It comes with both alliance and horde lenses with the alliance lenses already in place. Maybe the folks at soundblaster are a little partial to the alliance side? ; )     Anyway that's my review and everything I would have wanted to know when I was purchasing this. Hope it helps!
R18JCHKAZHX0H5	3	I bought the Kindle Touch for my wife from Amazon. The instructions say that if I bought it from Amazon, it would be preconfigured for my account. This was not the case. I got a Kindle that had somewhat of a charge, but no information. I proceeded to enter in my account info and connect it to my wifi. Everything \\"seemed\\" to work, but when my wife went to download a book from the Lender's Library (I have Prime), the book just sat in the pending state. I wasn't sure how long it should take to download, but after 24hrs and still in pending, I figured something was wrong. I tried hard rebooting, which didn't work. I tried disconnecting/ reconnecting my wifi and that didn't work either. I then did a factory reset. That restarted the kindle, but on the load up screen, it just froze. I then did another hard reboot and that finally fixed everything. I input my info and the book began downloading immediately.<br /><br />My other gripe is that it's slow to accept inputs. I put in a passcode and I have to wait at least a count of 2 before putting in the next digit. It's just really slow on accepting keyboard inputs. Overall, I would go with the Kindle Fire since it's supposed to have a faster processor.
R1T9AYQ93CV4TR	1	I won't go into a lot of detail about how it operates since their are thousands of other reviews. Overall I like it, but the battery life is four hours or less.  Half of what the specs say.  It does get annoying.  It's not worth taking on a plane since it won't last.
RXAQDVWSIW5YG	2	I have a brand-new Dell Precision laptop (64-bit Win-7, i7-2820QM) and the display just blinks across the three monitors after installing the driver software.  My coworker with the same model laptop had the same results.<br /><br />--Revised, 4/27/12: I just figured out that these new laptops have USB 3.0 controllers, and I see on DisplayLink's support page that there are known-issues with the USB 3.0 controllers.
R1126X5RV3E75S	3	This monitor works just fine on my 2013 Mac Pro and the current Mac OS does a great job making the UI a normal size so you can read it. In FCP X and Premiere Pro, 4K video is, indeed, 4K at 100% on the monitor.<br /><br />The problem with this monitor is I can't get it to color calibrate at all without a purplish hue over what should be white. It has Adobe RGB and I have used that, and I have done custom calibration using the Mac OS advanced calibration options under the Display preference.<br /><br />Even with a white screen, there is a slight pinkish or purple hue. Next to the Apple Thunderbolt Display, it's very apparent.<br /><br />The other problem with this monitor is the well publicized problem of it not waking up from sleep about half the time. You have to turn it off and back on to get it to wake. Apparently, it's an issue with the monitor and not the Mac since people with PCs are reporting the same issue.<br /><br />This monitor looks sharp though with text and user interface elements, just like a Retina iPad versus a non-Retina iPad. So if you want the Retina resolution to use traditional software, it's fine, I suppose. I wouldn't get this monitor if you need accurate color, though.
R1X61988C39HBC	4	[[[UPDATE August 14th 2014. To make it short: The Toshiba Qosmio failed in my Latin American Country after the first day of full use. It became totally dead. Amazon was very helpful and fast and kind. Five stars. Toshiba too. I sent the Qosmio back to the USA, paid from our money the freight, and Amazon refunded me quickly the total original price. I must state that the machine was delivered inside the USA by Amazon, as far as I know Amazon cannot deliver laptops outside the USA ad that is why I paid the freight. The Toshiba dealer in my Latin American country said something about the warranty: Perhaps the Toshiba warranty for the Qosmio is not valid in Latin America (I am confused now). Amazon would even had paid a reasonnable fee for service here in my country but the damage was too serious according to the Toshiba people here and the Qosmio was sent back to the USA. Now I have the money back but I do not know if I will buy Toshiba again since I do not understand how the warranty works in Latin America. If I find out that the warranty works then probably I will buy again the same machine because it is outstanding. My confidence in Toshiba has been damaged but I repeat, Amazon has been outstanding in solving this problem ]]]<br /><br />And now back to the machine: I used Toshiba Satellite Notebooks for most of my life. I am just amazed by their quality. I used to be in contact with several machines and I am amazed by the quality of almost every Toshiba Notebook that I have been in contact with. My Toshiba Satellites survived falls, spills, etc. Once I was waving to a taxi and I forgot that I had my Toshiba Satellite in my hand and when I raised the hand the Satellite flew several meters high and landed in hard asphalt... The screen was broken BUT THE TOSHIBA WENT ON WORKING!!! It was absolutely mind boggling and since then I became totally in love with Toshiba Notebooks... I have seen so many NON TOSHIBA Notebooks fail with very little -or fail with nothing-.<br /><br />Toshiba Satellites are awesome but they do not have the best available screens. I was amazed at the Qosmio screen quality: The sharpness and detail is mind boggling. I do some photo editing. Thanks to the amazing Qosmio screen I realized that many of the photographs had imperfect focus, an imperfection that I was not able to realize before having the 1080p Qosmio screen. Before the Qosmio there was sometimes a problem with our photographs that I could never find out. But thanks to the superb Qosmio screen I realized that we were using inadequate contrast settings when editing the photos, my other computer inferior screen never let me see the error that we were doing. When you look from a different angle the Qosmio screen (perceived)  colors change little while the machine that I have used before the Qosmio has big (perceived) color changes when you look from a different angle.<br /><br />I lived the whole life from MS DOS to Windows and then to Windows 95, then going through the nightmare Windows 98 and then ending in Windows 7. It seems that every new Windows version was slower to start eventough machines got faster and faster. The Qosmio, thanks to its solid state disk, starts amazingly fast, just a few seconds !<br /><br />So far I do not like Windows 8. I dislike Windows 8 need to setup a Microsoft account but so far what I disliked the most was how Windows forced me to link my Skype Account to my gmail account and make both accounts accesible with the same password: No link, No Skype (probably there is a way to avoid this)<br /><br />Having a backlit keyboard is just GREAT because you can work in the dark. The red black color combination (the only one available) for me is kind of sinister but that is a very small annoyance. I would have loved green black, blue black or white green or blue.<br /><br />The sound is very very good, we watched several videos. It was just amazing. The speed is lightning fast. I think this machine is GREAT VALUE and SUPERB performance. I rate it 4 stars because it failed but it seems that that will be fixed pretty soonormance.

R31243EAFPWD8I	1	There's too much space left which is actually uncomfortable when carrying your computer inside. The design is nice, but this sleeve is only for 16inches computers, which I don't know if they exist...
R3E7YHZ6GWRNQ9	2	My two complaints is that there isn't a volume control, and it would be nice if the LED would indicate when the battery is fully charged to avoid over-charging.  For a corded speaker, this works well enough.  This has better sound than my smart phone speaker.  And I am mainly using it indoors so outdoor noise does not interfere with what I am listening to.  What is nice is that when I am charging the speaker, it can still be used to listen to music.  A two to three hour charge is recommended.  One good thing is that this corded speaker will not have the connectivity problems that bluetooth speakers are known to have.
R26OBS8DDK9RNZ	1	Having issues maintaining the wifi connection. Since there is no ethernet you must use wifi.. I am not that far from the router and cannot maintain a solid connection
R3RBXNPS2R3HG1	3	I use my note 8 mainly for work, at which I take a lot of notes.  I really enjoy the writing and pen feature of the device, but the battery life and the overall performance of the device makes me jealous of others that are at work who mainly have ipads or ipad mini's.  The overall user experience is a bit choppy.  Some apps that exist on both ipad and android tablets work smoother and faster on my colleagues' ipads (accessing hospital electronic medical records), and there just seems to be more support for the ipad versions of things than android.  This isn't a knock on all things android.  I like my device and plan to continue to purchase android devices (probably beyond Samsung now).  I just wish this device were snappier and the battery performance were better.  To give an example of the battery being poor, I've once unplugged my device at 6am after charging overnight, and by 10am, the battery was in the red after using the pen to write some notes for about 2 hours at 50% brightness.  It's a weird issue because it doesn't always happen, but does occur occasionally.<br /><br />The overall feel that I'm getting with this device is like when I first bought a Galaxy S1 (Verizon Fascinate) and felt that it lagged behind the iphone version at that time but after upgrading to the Galaxy S3, the device felt much improved and much more on-par with the iphone version at the time of the S3 release.
RVYUATKL1DM7N	2	I ordered the TB-7300 and it arrived fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to get the pen to work.  The scroll wheel works and the selector LEDs work, so I have to conclude that the tablet is communicating to the PC without a problem.  I contacted Trust Support and they sent me a replacement pen at no cost which was rather decent.  Sadly, the replacement pen is not recognized by the tablet either.  I've tried several driver updates and none of them have resolved the issue.  I'm returning the unit to Amazon for a refund while I contact the retailer for a replacement order.  Hopefully this is just a defective unit and the replacement will meet my expectations.  I will update the review/rating based on the outcome.    Update: The Trust reseller does not process exchanges so I decided to return the tablet and get a slight smaller one at a comparable price.
R2RUKWIZC556DW	2	The sound bar has excellent sound quality and volume for it's size. It is inconvenient that I used to have to remove it everytime I shut my computer to shut it down. Did you notice the past-tense? That is because it did not take long for the clip on the back of the bar to break off, preventing it from being mounted onto the screen.
RMI90CSRTQE8I	2	It looked very nice but didn't charge the device I bought it for( a playstation remote). Maybe it was just compatibility problem
R22GU1GIFXZU9F	3	I had just finished setting up my mediaPC and was ready to try out this wireless keyboard. Setup was a breeze (plug and play) and it worked great while standing next to the PC. Now my situation may be different since my mediaPC is tucked away in a closet next to the media room. So with that in mind, I can still use the keyboard in the media room within about 10' of the closet but anywhere beyond that distance and it becomes a paperweight. I may try getting a USB extension cable to move the RF unit closer. Also don't expect to be able to type 50+ words per minute on this thing. It's just not quick enough to keep up even if the signal quality is excellent. Therefore I give this a 3 out of 5 since it does it's job - just not well enough for my situation.
R2T8JFHFE5ZX1P	1	I purchase this battery for my Dell XPS M1330 and for the price it was very reasonable compared to a battery purchase from Dell.  Battery will last approx 1 1/2 hour only but that is ok considering the price.  It does not last as long as advertise but you get what you pay for.  If you are a traveler and require more battery life then you need to purchase the battery from Dell otherwise this one will suit you fine.
R25EE158QXHPJK	4	After using these for a few months, this is what I've encountered.<br /><br />PROS: Wireless!<br />Simi-OK battery life, I find 4-5 hours seems to be the charge it's holding now, It was around 8+ when I first bought it.<br />Microphone Clarity is nice.<br />Charger is same as my cell phone.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Good Luck getting it to do 7.1 - at best it sound like a 5.1 system. Required Corsair Dolby software that really isn't that great. I had a turtle beach 7.1 and it sounds way more clear.. You hear foot steps ect more prominently  when  someone is trying to come up from behind, this headset defiantly is NOT 7.1<br />Sometimes the power button doesn't sync the head set when using ventrillo, you have to turn it off then on then off then on and then you can hear people.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I would not recommend people buy this headset - the XBox wireless headset (Works on PC) or Logitech wireless headsets for the same price are a better option.
R6558DQJ0JB02	2	I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to the Microsoft brand hardrive. In addition to extra memory, I was also wanting to make my XBOX 360 Slim backwards compatible with XBOX  games that were compatible with the original XBOX 360. I was informed by the Microsoft website that purchasing a hard drive would make this possible. This product did give me ample memory for saving games, but it did not make my XBOX 360 Slim backwards compatible like I had hoped. I later learned this can only be accomplished through an official Microsoft brand hard drive, which this product is not. I would also say that the available memory, before transferring saved information to it from the original hard drive, was not quite the 250 GB promised. I am not aware as to whether this is a normal occurrence for all hard drives, but I can't deny that I wish I would have been informed of this detail before purchasing.
R2EHKG2OFQ4VVF	3	I am a fan of Bose and these speakers didn't let me down.  These are small speakers, but they are solid, heavy great-sounding speakers.  Amazing bass, not just for their size and lack of a subwoofer. Amazing bass and great across the whole range. BTW, I'm not into thudding, overpowering dub bass.  I like solid tight bass that doesn't muddy the rest of the music.Tight is the best description here.<br /><br />UPDATE: Sad to say, these haven't withstood the test of time.  You see, all of the above is true, if you are 10 feet or more from the speakers when listening to music.  The sound fills the room and is great across the board. The problem is, in my case, as is common with computer speaker set-ups, I am not across the room from the speakers. They are located on the corners of the table where my computer is.  And up close, they sound muddy, bass-heavy and unbalanced. In fact, the sound reminds me of bootleg records from the 70's.  If you plan to place these at somewhat above head level and at least 5 feet from where you listen, then I still would say they are 5-star.  For most typical computer-based set-ups, they aren't worth the money and, in fact, offer no advantage of speakers in the $50 range.
R2S9B5O7O07LCG	2	While the unit itself is OK, the person who decided it needed a proprietary plug in on a 6 inch cable should have been fired years ago.<br /><br />Even this cable is too short to have the unit recharging on top of a desk while it's plugged into a surge protector on the floor.<br /><br />So, I just took off the removable tip, hooked it up to a 3 foot long cable, and I use that.<br /><br />The cable is gathering dust.  This was not a good decision on Plantronics's part.
R1N1OL54MC22RP	3	Where do I start with this TV tuner? Well let's start from the end... Bottom line once it works, it works great! The picture clarity is fantastic and it works with Windows Media Center. If you're not an advanced PC user I wouldn't recommend this tuner because there are a lot of steps that need to be taken to get it working. Keep in mind I have Windows 7 64-bit so your issues or lack thereof may vary. The drivers on the CD aren't worth the disc it's burned on and the Diamond website has no real help. I found if you plug in the tuner then install drivers Windows won't recognize the tuner and it'll throw a error. After going around in circles I even was able to \\"Blue screen\\" Windows. Here are the steps that worked for me but keep in mind they might not work for you. Use the information for just that, informational purposes.<br /><br />1. Left the tuner unplugged.<br />2. Downloaded the drivers from the Diamond website for both the tuner and remote fix.<br />3. Installed those drivers.<br />4. Plugged the tuner in and it was found.<br />5. Started up Windows Media Center and setup the tuner in it.<br />6. It found 5 channels, BOO! Needed to add the missing ones manually.<br />7. Step 6 was difficult because I needed to find the actual number of each channel and the corresponding guide. Did a web search found the information<br />8. Finally was done!<br /><br />Pros: This is a great tuner with fantastic picture quality<br />  It works with Media Center, well sorta.<br />  It does support Clear Qam and does work with HD channels.<br /><br />Cons: The driver disc is worthless<br />  Could lock-up your PC<br />  Very hard to setup<br />  The Diamond website has no real help.<br />  Need to do manual channel and guide setup in Windows Media Center (I'm not sure if it's the tuner or Windows Media Center)
R183XEY21974W6	3	This is a great case in terms of design. It protects the Kindle well and keeps the light out of view until needed. When turned on, the light is adequate for reading comfortably. However, this case is much too heavy for reading with one hand like the pictures show. The Kindle itself is feather-light. However with the case on the weight increases greatly. After a few minutes of one-handed reading my hand begins to tire. In order to read with the case on, I have to use two hands or brace it up against something like a desk. Otherwise, it is more comfortable to read without the case on.
RN4P788HU9MD1	2	The package arrived on time and product looked as expected.  The inner rubber black sleeve could fit a little tighter it seems very loose on the fire phone.  I wish it fit snuggly.  I'm afraid I'm going to catch it on something especially around the bottom part.  But otherwise I'm satisfied with the product for the price.
R198VD59JQATOJ	2	Good quality, very pretty. Arrived in good condition & in a timely manner. Installation is tricky, but not too difficult with patience.<br />I was disappointed because it didn't fit quite right. It's missing 2 of 3 cut outs along the bottom edge where there are small rubber stops on the laptop to keep the lid from slamming. I didn't want to return it because it matched the photo & I hadn't realized it wasn't right until installation, so I just cut them out with a super sharp exacto. I don't know if there are 2 versions of this laptop, just be aware if your's has 3 rubber stops across the bottom edge, you will need to alter this skin.
R1BEUZNZWM84R7	1	I used this on my yacht to get wifi from the marina. It had to be plugged into the PC to work and did help a little. I could then use the PC to rebroadcast the wifi but the connection was iffy. I ended up using another wifi repeater that enables me to get wifi direct without the PC now and that seems like a better solution for me. No longer using it.
R1R8ZRZA1LYN1S	2	I have the deluxe PCI-bus version of this thing that I've been able to use for all kinds of projects on my older computer.  When I upgraded to an HP Pavilion that only had ONE PCI bus, I had to buy this \\"PCI-Express\\" version, hoping to get some of the basic functionality I got on the PCI version (thanks, HP).  It does most of what the PCI version does, except for being able record from the MIDI output directly onto digital audio tracks. My Sonar documentation says it should work, and the Sonar tech support says it should work.  They say if it's not working, it's the card's fault. (It worked on the other card with Sonar, so I can't really argue with them.)<br /><br />I can't say what the Creative Labe's Tech support people say about it, because after an hour on hold and several unanswered e-mails, I gave up.<br /><br />As far as it stands now (several months after I purchased the card), this seems to be a good sound card for someone who wants to listen to music and play games, but not for someone who wants to use it for home recording.<br /><br />- Paul Race, Editor, Creek Don't Rise
R2UP0JPCF0YDH5	0	Great for fun not for longevity.
RAJO9TQGZU1WT	2	I bought three of these, one for me and two for gifts.  Both gift recipients have reported that the stylus works very well, just as mine does for me.<br /><br />For me, the main reason to get a stylus was to reduce the need for frequent screen cleaning.<br /><br />The only thing that the stylus can't do, of course, is multifinger gestures.<br /><br />It works very nicely with painting programs where I feel like I'm painting with a brush.<br /><br />When not in use, I clip it to my iPad's case, and so it is always available when needed.<br /><br />Update: Eventually the capacitance -- I guess it is -- seems to wear out, and the iPad screen no longer responds predictably to the motion of the stylus.  One other person I know has had the same experience.
R39CNH9CRHXYW6	3	If you don't already own a Dell Mini 9 you should.  It's a great machine.<br /><br />This bag is fine, but it really wasn't designed specifically for the mini9.  There are straps inside but they do nothing to secure the computer like any good laptop bag should.  Be sure to place the bag on a table first before opening, and check to make sure it's zipped up before lifting!<br /><br />My other complaint is that it was almost real work to shove the power cord into the accessory pocket.  It does fit but barely..  And I do suggest opening the bag's plastic packaging in an open-air environment.  The artificial leather does give off some fumes on the initial open.<br /><br />Overall the bag is not perfect but does fit the Mini 9 and its power cord for a reasonable price.
R36H90M762GUQG	2	This fit in perfectly, but is a little noisy.<br /><br />Also, after letting a hardware tech friend of mine look at it, he believes I could have simply replaced the fan by going to Frys for the fan and re-using the mount, which would have cost only a few dollars and a few minutes.
RHER8VVCTGIT1	2	Tried this in my old Sony 2 megapixel camera (supposed to be the max size) and it didn't recognize it.     Service was good though.
R1X49NNQO1DZHI	1	The keys have to be tapped a  certain way or letters will not print---- takes much longer to type. If I had been aware of this I would not have bought this computer.
RZLCGJM7OKJWX	1	Pretty good, but the bluetooth keyboard lags behind your keystrokes. Otherwise, decent quality, esp for the price. Keyboard is very light as well.
R2JWTUW25SGMS	2	The gateway computer looks good and I like that but the slowness of the laptop right here in America means the laptop would have been even slower in Africa. My intend of this laptop was to carry it back home for my family in school to use for study. So my concern is the poor network back home.
R2GEL3O35W3XGW	2	I get that I only paid $30 but it also says 720p. I expected better picture quality from that. I'll keep it as it does the job just fine but I'd have spent more to get a sharper image. Probably just fine for most people who want to talk but if you are recording do yourself a favor and get one of logitechs more expensive options.
R223WVFQFCKUT6	4	Received this product yesterday and right out of the box it looked like a solid and well made product.  The faux leather feels good to the touch and the white accent stitching compliments the black leather well.  The inside of the case is lined with a grey felt material.  It is nice and soft but could potentially get dirty over time.  The case fits the 13inch rMBP very well.  Sliding it into the hand rest pocket is easy and provides access to all ports.  The straps that attach the case to the screen are also of the same grey color as the inner lining.  It is relatively unobtrusive and only covers a small portion of the corners.  Overall, this case looks and works well for my purposes.<br /><br />This product is well built and will likely last me a while.  However, I have 2 complaints as of date.  1) It is a tad bit overpriced.  Similar products (see case crown for retina macbook pro 15inch) cost only 1/3 of the price of this product.  Judging from the pictures, reviews and a visual inspection of the product, you can tell-- apart from it's name- that it is similar if not the exact same product.  The same design, build, even the white stitchings are the same with a huge difference in price with the casecrown for the 15inch retina priced only at $9-24, with many colors to choose from.  Given, the difficulty of finding folio cases for the 13inch retina version, most buyers have no choice but to purchase whatever is available and amazon taking advantage of this, jacks up the price to a premium.  I have been on the lookout for a good folio case for a while.  I do not have $179 to spend for a premium leather Sena case that is why I thought of getting the alternative, which is the cheaper faux leather case which should work just as well only for a fraction of the price.  I've search and searched and the closest one I found that was made for the 13 rMBP was this guy and another case that cost $19.  Due to the poor reviews for that product and the seemingly better quality of this one, I pulled the trigger (despite the almost $10 price difference) on the Duzign.  The product is as described and looks and feels like it is made well.  If it were not overpriced it really would be a great buy.<br /><br />2) While admittedly the case seems to be solidly built and looks well made, it does add a bit of bulk to the rMBP.  The profile isn't as thin.  It has a hard interior backing that could be helpful for insulating your computer from minor bumps but it takes out from the beauty of having a light and thin computer.  If a thinner profile is what you're going for, then don't buy this case.  But if you want something that feels solid, fits well and do not mind the bulk it will add then this might be the product for you.<br /><br />This product is good overall.  A tad bit overpriced, a little bulky but works well overall and better than most other stuff they have out there---at least right now.  If you wait a few months the manufacturers might catch up and make better products for us 13 rMBP users.  *crossing fingers*this one, I pulled the trigger (despite the almost $10 price difference) on the Duzign.

R2QI14SOXX2M0C	1	The quality is great and they are very quite however I just need them to spin faster.  They can be used for just about everything.  I installed mine in a DIT kit and they worked fairly well.
R1KYGKO1DNLV35	2	If you have USB 3.0 don't bother with this antique 2.0 drive. It runs at a max of about 5 MBytes/sec, slowing down to about 2 or 3 MB/s after 100 MB or so. This means it can take over 4 hours to fill it.<br /><br />Instead, get a [[ASIN:B008AF383S SanDisk Extreme 64 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive up to 190 MB/s]]. This fantastic USB 3.0 drive is advertized to run 190 MB/s. I certainly beat that as measured by HD Tune read test at 210 MB/s. Writing, I got around 170-190 MB/s when copying from an SSD.<br /><br />Note -- you won't get this speed if you're copying from a laptop HD as you're lucky to get much more than 100 MB/s from a 7200 RPM drive. But that's still better than 20 times faster than a USB 2.0 drive such as this one.<br /><br />If you do have an SSD drive and USB 3.0 ports you can get better than 170 MB/s with the SanDisk Extreme. That's more than 40 times faster.
R2TB682GXD8UWP	3	It took me a while to get used to this mouse. Especially using my thumb with the four buttons so much when playing games. The battery will last 3 hours on intense gaming, since I play D3 hardcore, I cannot risk dying so I leave it plugged in, which works out pretty well for me since my PC sit on the desk. Wireless also goes out, even though its right next to the PC, but it may be time to refresh windows. That or there is a driver issue.<br /><br />Even with those issue I cannot live without a mouse like this, maybe I just need to find another brand.<br /><br />Pros<br /> * Good build quality.<br /> * Good precision with dpi settings.<br /> * Simple enough to configure with the software.<br /> * Comfortable to my hand (5'11&#34; with average size hand)<br /> * Great button placement in my opinion.<br /> * Battery should last you 3 hours on average for gaming.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> * Had a bit of a learning curve.<br /> * Logitech drivers are still slow and bulky.<br /> * Sometimes the left mouse button double fires.<br /> * Sometimes when I have the left button pressed, it will release and press again (sputtering) on its own.
R3K35BQBMXY2QG	3	Great for everyday business users who need a cheap wireless mouse that works like it's suppose to!!!  Battery life is excellent but wish it had a better storage mechanism for the &#34;usb plug&#34;
R2DFY5C3KWMDAR	3	The case is decent at best, or at least mine was. The case doesnt fit the tablet snug, so when i have it propped up with the kickstand it slides down the bottom a little making the band rise up blocking part of the windows button. Swiping on the right or left edge is difficult. Tried emailing the company twice, no response to either about these problems. I wouldnt really recommend this to anyone at this point.
R80XUAGMD6GNT	2	I ordered this shoulder strap for my laptop bag to replace the original one that came with it which broke.  The hooks are strong and made of metal so they shouldn't break like plastic ones.  My only gripe is that the shoulder pad is too large and bulky as compared to other ones I have had in the past.  Overall it is a decent product.
RQ5RG25K9MBQG	1	I was really expecting a lot more. Very comfortable but my biggest complaint involves the tracking. I have a light brown desk and it didn't work well with it. Also, the scroll wheel clicks instead of scrolling smoothly so the page jumps too much.
R3B8FKX2JD1XS5	4	I've owned a half dozen RAID enclosures, and this one is the noisiest one I've had to bear. I managed to get a few benchmarks--Performance-wise, it is on par with the best enclosures I've used. In RAID 0 on a pair of Seagate 4TB 5900RPM drives, I was getting 230MB/sec (sequential 2GB writes), the same as my Guardian Maximus (both over USB 3.0, Intel Z97 chipset). In single drive mode, I was getting about 130-140MB/sec. I did not test speeds writing from one drive to the other in port multiplier mode.<br /><br />The Guardian is near-silent even though it has a tiny 40mm fan (I did a fan swap to a Scythe). My AkiTio 2-bay RAID enclosure is similarly (but slightly less) quiet with a 40mm fan as well. This Orico enclosure has a larger (and theoretically quieter) 50mm fan but it manages to be FAR noisier than the rest of my computer combined. The noise is a very distinct &#34;whooshing&#34; sound, probably because of the shape of the enclosure & its ventilation holes.<br /><br />If you are willing to disassemble the unit and spend $10 soldering a quieter fan, I can definitely recommend it due to the price. But, even at the $70 price point, there are definitely some other competitors such as the AkiTio NT2 U3/U3e which also features a very easy drive swapping mechanism (although this Orico 9528RU3 has the easiest latching doors of any enclosure I've used, even if they are a bit finicky on closing)
R2XAE3WEG78R6Y	3	So I was able to set this great NAS up and get it running without too much difficulty.  However, I have started to have major problems transferring data to it under certain conditions.<br /><br />You see, if I do one single thing involving the NAS at a time, everything goes just fine.  Also, if I only transfer about 3GB at a time, everything is fine.<br /><br />However, if I try to do more than one thing at a time, even something like moving data to it and play music off of it on the same computer, the drive will completely freeze up and require a power cycle.  Bad news!  Also, if I send along anything around 5 or more GB at one time, the drive will freeze up again.<br /><br />This is not what I would expect from a NAS device with gigabit ethernet.  At the very least, I should be able to play music and transfer files to it.  That's ridiculous.<br /><br />But the worst is that I called up WD tech support, and after about 15 minutes of the fool on the phone following his script and not thinking for himself (he probably couldn't), he said flatly that Windows 7 was not supported.  I asked him why on earth it would matter what operating system I was running, as long as the file system on the drive was readable by the OS, but he had no idea what I was talking about and that was the end of the discussion.<br /><br />Since then, I've seen many people complain about freezing when using this drive with Windows 7.<br /><br />To be clear, I never installed the software that came with the drive (it probably wouldn't install anyway).  I shouldn't have to install that crud to use this drive, and I really don't have to, it works fine without it, with the above exceptions.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll somehow \\"support\\" Windows 7 in the future, though I don't have a clue what they need for that, whether it's a driver on the OS or a firmware update to the drive.  Whatever it is, I hope they do it soon.<br /><br />In the meantime, it's still a great drive.  My favorite use of it is as a media server for my WDTV Live.  That works perfectly every time.  Oh, well, except for the times the MyBook froze up!e.  Oh, well, except for the times the MyBook froze up!
R3T8WMKBEPPT36	3	I love the color and it is very stylish and provides sturdy protection for my new Ipad2. Also, a good deal for the price. It allows you to stand the Ipad in either horizontal or vertical positions, and gives the option to have the Ipad at different angles with ridges in the case that hold the ipad upright when you put the bottom edge in them, but it only stays up in one or two of those positions. Check out the other video review here that talks about that. Overall, a decent case. It's pleather, by the way, not real leather.
R3IJQ6TYZLW7G6	1	I'm not sure if it's my remote or this keypad, but half the time when I put it on, it doesn't work and I have to take it off and put it back on again. Sometimes I even have to take it off again after that. And after owning it for about a year, the headphone port at the bottom stopped working which pretty annoying.
R1367KWBP33G8A	2	although this item has been used for a while now by my son we noticed that what was pictured is not what we received. The mouse does not have a micro usb toggle like the picture shows.  However; we ordered three of these kits and his mouse is the only one that still works.  Putting the long USB aside, the mouse is rechargeable by plugging into the computer with a cord provided.  If I knew for sure that another order came with this kind of mouse I would definitely order another.
R2JD716IK0LEVK	2	I was disappointed with my purchase because  \\"red\\" is really \\"pink\\" and the cover did not come with a stand as shown.  It is only the silicon protective backing :-(
R2AJSDV6CT19HG	3	I like the portability and the ink is decent on the eyes.  Another thing I like is that when I purchase a book, I have it immediately and without a shipping charge.  There are a couple of things I don't like.  I still have difficulty getting it to connect to my hidden wireless network.  Tech support spent a good deal of time with me trying to make this work, but most of the time I still have to broadcast my network in order for the Kindle to connect.  My wife has a Nook and it doesn't have this problem.  I didn't like the fact that the Kindle was advertised at $69, but then I found that this price is good only if I wanted advertising, so I I ended up spending more.  I felt that this was deceptive and it should have been advertised at the actual price without the advertising.  I did not like that a power adapter and a cover cost another $20 for each.  In total, that's almost half again as much as the Kindle costs.  I felt that those should be included in the price.  Although I did have to buy a cover for my wife's Nook, it came with a power adapter and no advertising.  Also, I bought the Kindle because there are some trading books that are only available on the Kindle.  However, when these books have graphs, the detail is difficult to see on the Kindle, especially for someone my age.  For text reading, it is okay.  I'm still inclined to buy fiction novels in hard copy though.  Maybe I'll try a novel on the Kindle to see if I can get used to it.  Basically though, it does what it is advertised to do.
R2OCKQCYJSJ5HF	4	I like a mouse with a lot of extra buttons. Buttons that can be custom-configured to my liking. My ideal mouse would be wireless and have, in addition to the standard buttons & scroll wheel, separate buttons assigned to middle-click, ctrl, delete, shift, copy and paste. Maybe one for alt too.    After reading that the buttons on this mouse were configurable I thought it would do the trick, but sadly it does not.    Only some of the buttons are configurable - the 4 behind the scroll wheel and the black button on the side are not. They're permanently set to built-in features of the mouse (DPI settings and a macro function) - settings that I not only don't plan to use but that are outright inconvenient if you hit one of those buttons by mistake.    On the positive side the basic functions are fine - it tracks well, the buttons respond fine and it works as a mouse should. The scroll-click and the 2 silver side buttons are user configurable, but at this price I just want more control - the additional buttons could have easily been made user configurable as well.    Another bad design choice is the charger. It's USB only. I want to charge the mouse while I'm not using the computer. Overnight generally. However when I turn off my PC for the day it no longer supplies power to the USB ports so the mouse doesn't charge. A simple solution would have been to supply the charging and RF transmitter \\"puck\\" with an AC adapter. Make that a 4-port USB AC adapter and then put two USB cables on the puck - one to connect to the PC and one purely for power and you'd really have a nice extra feature - and people who do leave their computers on all the time could simply ignore the AC adapter.    It's problematic - I'm experimenting to see if putting my PC into sleep mode will allow the mouse to charge, but I'll probably wind up having to use an external battery charger instead. Another thing in the plus column is that the mouse uses 1 standard size AA battery (it comes with a rechargeable).    Given the high price you get too many problems and not enough features for the money - I think I should have bought the $20 MS Explorer mouse that comes with a charging cradle instead. It has fewer buttons but if you only count the configurable ones it works out the same.      Couple other things; this is a large mouse. Full size. So keep that in mind. Works for me, but for people with smaller hands it may not.     The mouse comes with 3 sets of feet (extras stored in the puck). I couldn't tell any difference between them and the mouse actually still worked fine on a mouse pad with no feet installed. I'm just using the default ones.    The magnetic charging cable is pretty slick, nicely designed, but the problems with it being USB-only detract from that pretty seriously.
R3C5YCX5SQB9N8	4	I bought this product to use with a Galaxy Tab 10.1\\" tablet. Wishful thinking got me expecting complete functionality for the various buttons and the scroll wheel. The reviewers who've said there's nothing Android-specific about the mouse are right. Logitech says \\"for Android 3.1+\\". This would be more accurate: \\"works with Android 3.1+.\\"<br /><br />What works... single- and double-clicking with either button or the scroll wheel: same result as you'd expect from single- and double-tapping with a finger.<br /><br />Scroll wheel: scrolls web pages, pages within a text editor, long scrolling lists within menus.<br /><br />Clicking and dragging: same as dragging with a finger.<br /><br />What doesn't work: Separate functionality for the left and right buttons? Nope. Left- and right-\\"tilt\\" of the scroll wheel? No effect.<br /><br />The ability to scroll with the wheel is definitely handy -- likewise, the mouse's ability to target scroll-arrows and scroll bars precisely -- something that can be difficult to do with a finger. This precision makes working with web-forms much easier than it would otherwise be. (No luck dragging scroll _handles_, though. Oh well.)<br /><br />Flaws: The mouse pointer sometimes takes as long as 20 seconds to appear while a web page is loading. Why this would be, I don't know. Bit of an irritation with slow-loading pages. On occasion the Bluetooth connection fails. Getting it back has required going through the full pairing procedure. Now that's irritating. My Zagg Bluetooth keyboard has no such problems.<br /><br />One full star off for extremely poor documentation as supplied with the product -- not even minimal information about pairing (I already knew how; someone new to using Bluetooth might have trouble figuring it out).<br /><br />The \\"information\\" in the Getting Started pamphlet shows, but doesn't even bother explaining when to use, the small Connect button on the underside. For crying out loud, why not? What, are we saving ink here? There's a web page whose URL appears in the pamphlet: \\"for Bluetooth setup instructions for your tablet.\\" Wrong. The PDF you can download from that page is identical to the noticeable-in-its-absence information in the minimalist paperwork supplied with the mouse. Adventures In Discoverability: the real-world pairing information is actually on one of Logitech's FAQ pages: [...]<br /><br />[EDIT: looks as if Amazon scrubbed the URL. Look at the Logitech FAQ page -- easy enough to find -- for the link to the 'how to pair' topic.]<br /><br />That they would have omitted so much information, when it would have cost them nothing to include it, is inexcusable. Shame, Logitech. Take a lesson from Zagg, whose (supplied) documentation for paring its Bluetooth keyboard does the job quite well.<br /><br />So the thing works and, despite its limitions, will be useful when I'm using the tablet on a stand. No doubt it will be much more useful when it's paired with a laptop or Bluetooth-enabled desktop system. (Well, unless its irritating habit of losing the connection persists.) Just don't expect complete functionality in Honeycomb. Wonder if it's any different in ICS...<br /><br />[EDIT: a friend with a Motorola tablet has also had mixed success with mice. He reports the same problems I've observed: pointer freezes, disappears, takes a while to reappear. He figures it's a problem generally with mouse support in Android. Beats me...]
R2LWJIDH2OZGZC	2	It's tight on your head, but it installs easily, and does the job well.. I get clear Skype communication with it.
R3FNHCQ4GU3Y41	3	It's really difficult to find a good combination wireless keyboard and mouse.  I've tried Logitech's more expensive expensive [[ASIN:B000J43HJ8 diNovo Edge]], and the trackpad is nearly unusable.      Overall the IOGear is better and much cheaper - in terms of both price and construction - but it's by no means perfect.  The trackball material is horrible, and it sometimes doesn't register quick movement.  Once you slow down to a speed it likes, it gets the job done.  The keyboard is fairly good, but has some odd button placements that take a bit of getting used to.    I'd recommend this for an HTPC that will get occasional use as a PC.  I would not recommend it if you'll be using the keyboard for extended periods of time, however.
R1SC3CUHDQ6LJV	1	I would love to give this 5 stars but I have had it for less than a week and it is already having to be shipped to Hp for a faulty screen it has a huge crack in led screen and black blob just from opening it up.  I understand its a refurbished computer but I have never had this happen before.
R109QIZ2MRMIRV	4	I have been using the kindle app on my ipad to read books for some time. Although this works really well, the size and weight of the ipad made this a tad uncomfortable. I couldn't really tuck it into a handbag much smaller than a tote bag. I had friends who really liked their kindles and I thought Id like the smaller, more manageable size. Out of the box, I had a really exasperating time trying to get it to connect to my home wireless network. After about an hour, I went online (on the ipad) and got some answers, several of which were quite informative. Obviously, I was not the only one with this issue. After resetting my wireless router and manually typing the IP address into the kindle; success!!! Only took about an hour and a half. Contrast this with my apple products which took about 5 minutes. Strike one for the kindle. Web browsing, both at home and on my work network is a little slow, but adequate. I'll find out when I use it more to access the web which will probably not be at home. Much larger screen size on the ipad or my laptop makes those a far more functional choice for web browsing. My choice of the kindle was primarily for reading. One of the things I like about the other kindles is the non-glare screen with the e-ink display. The fire, unfortunately, has a screen which more resembles the ipad, making it difficult to read in direct light and with numerous reflections on the screen. I have to say that I'm quite disappointed with the reading ease because of this. I was hoping that the fire had a screen like the less expensive kindles. Fingerprints are an issue with the fire also and this is no different from the apple products I own. Overall, I like the fire with the reservations in web connectivity and reading ease. I'm editing this review. I just returned from a cruise. I like to read on the deck. It was impossible to do this on this kindle. I should have taken the cheapie kindle. The only way I could read was to get in the shade.  Defeats the whole purpose of a kindle.urpose of a kindle.
R2PJ4UHFSIU98D	3	I bought this bridge primarily for my Xbox360. Expand the network with the second port to stream movies from media server. Doesn't stream very well. Use my laptop to compare connection and stream. Setup my laptop as a bridge and was able to stream DVD quality movies without lag, but with the Zyxel bridge, there were significant lag. Don't bother with HD with this bride.    I agree with all other comments on documentation and initial setup. Very poor docs and initial setup. Also, can't tell from the management UI the actual wireless connection speed. Always shows \\"300\\" even if i limit my router connection to 54MB or 145MB. Should be able to stream DVD quality movies and HD if connection rate is 300MB.
R2T73D9RHUD547	3	I was very satisfied with this bag until the fabric loop that the shoulder strap attaches to ripped off just a few months after purchase (and also just a few days outside of my return window with Amazon).  I'll have it repaired, but I was definitely not expecting this from normal use after so short a time.  I've also been using the bag with a 13&#34; Macbook Air rather than a Macbook Pro, so it was carrying a lighter load than it might have been.<br /><br />Otherwise, I appreciate the bag's qualities, particularly the outside Kindle pocket.  I'm able to keep my Kindle in a cover and it still fits.  My Macbook Air can slide around quite a bit inside, but I still feel it's well protected by the padding of the interior pocket.  I would have given this item a higher rating if the fabric loop hadn't torn.
R3U7FQ3X7XIP3X	2	It might be just a case of incompatibility with my motherboard's SATA interface. (which I doubt it, as my motherboard is somewhat decent, the high end of gigabyte's offerings for Intel P45 popular chipset EP45-DQ6).     But in any case, I thought it might be helpful to point out that it does't work well over SATA (lots of corrupted files) when running under Windows 7 64bit (haven't tried it under other OSs)    However, it works very well via its handy built-in USB interface.
R2OD0R6NFHE55Z	2	Basically, I wanted to buy something that protected by kindle, which this does perfectly. The color and quality are quite acceptable for the price this comes for. However, having used this for a month now, I see that the elastic band is starting to slack a bit (it is not as taut as it was when it was new and fresh). It still does the job, but am hoping that it does not slack off anymore. Another little thing is that using the arrow key (right direction) becomes a bit constrained with the cover.
R2JQ7DN7TGVDQ6	4	Pros: Durable, not easily damaged, defaced, or scratched. Protects tablet well. Fits tightly and holes are perfect for all cameras/mikes and controls. Works well as stand.<br /><br />Cons: You can't use the keyboard dock while this is on. If you use the dock a lot you will be taking this off/on several times a day.
RHIZ8MAUHQGIJ	3	The tablet looks great but the drivers completely suck... The ones on the disk don't work, the new version on the wacom site doesn't work, and it takes hours to figure out how to get it to work...  I found this link [...] and was finally able to get this thing to work properly!  You have to download another driver first then download the correct one from the site but after all that it finally started working.  Be prepared for the hassle but once I got it working it seems to be working pretty good.  A couple small bugs to work out still but nothing to serious...
R1HKDNO3N36OOH	2	The magnetic bond is not as strong as with some other covers. Of course, the keyboard fell off and broke 2 days after I got it. The keyboard itself is great and I loved it until it broke.
R201TFU458SJ76	2	hard to set up. 1 1/2 hrs on phone with<br />service provider and manufacturer. hopefully will work ok but<br />only 90 days of 'free' tech support. shouldn't need ANY but we'll see. faster then my service so hoping it'll work thou my experience is modems last under 3 years.<br />best feature, led lights are dim reducing visual night time distraction.
R1GW2BEA0H66Y9	3	I fully agree with Richard on this. - The \\"Soft\\" part of the case is semi-rigid, and prevents the On/Off switch from pressing down enough to operate the phone. - Also VERY difficult to put the phone inside of. - And even harder to remove the phone from!! - (HINT: Take the 'Gold Plastic part off the 'soft' part before attempting either move with your phone.)  ALSO: - The case prevents a Headphone Plug from fully locking into place, as it's several mm higher than the phones edge itself, so you can't listen to music w/o removing the case!    UPDATE:  The Manufacturer has been in touch with me, and is working with me,(and everyone), on these 'Cons', and also has offered to replace it with another type of case. - They are doing everything they can to make this a winner for all who buy one.  Keep the faith, as these are really nice cases, and will be even better in the near future. - P.S.
R1L9CX1ESDT5ZE	2	Nice design, lightweight, very thin, and colorful! Love the floral design, makes it different from the other ones. They only thing that REALLY disappointed me was that it did NOT include the stylus pen like it said in the description...
R2AUVLJB10H7UJ	3	3/5 because this reader processes extremely slloooow.  Have fun if you want to place a large library onto this.  Another thing is if you would like to put music on this reader, forget about it.  I put 10 mp3s on it and the unit froze every time I tried playing them.  Then I reduced it to 1 mp3 to see if it could process that.  No luck, it froze every time.  In conclusion, if you do not care about music capabilities, online connectivity, and have learned some patience, this is a decent, simple little reader.  It can read several formats, easily change font size and orientation, and can store thousands of books with an SD card.  You can go to your SD windows explorer and create folders to drag your book collection into.  This makes it easier to navigate to what you are looking for.  I now enjoy reading on this item after understanding its limitations.
R1XCXHHY6V8BSA	2	The keyboard is functional and a nice addition for my Nexus 7 but it only gets 3 stars because of the magnet placed under the keyboard which causes my nexus 7 to go into sleep mode.  If you try and take it out of sleep mode the magnet keeps it in sleep mode.  Frustrating, but you can easily snap the top plastic off of the keyboard and remove the magnet.  Now this is a really nice keyboard...too bad the manufacturer couldn't figure this out before selling these for $30+...Should be about $15 in my opinion.
R2R8PAU8YQTI1X	2	Starts double tapping after 2-year use (click \\"space\\" once and actually input 2 spaces), really really annoying...Before the double tapping starts, the keyboard is really good.<br /><br />follow up:<br />It seems a common issue for this keyboard and I finally found a work-around. Since there is little you can do in Razer Synapse. You actually need go to keyboard setting in control panel (on a PC running Windows 7) to set the \\"Repeat Delay\\" to long. In this way, chances of unexpected double tapping will be much lower.
R3U1OEMXYMI0MA	1	it's ok. it doesn't fit well, and the design isn't the greatest, but better than nothing if I accidentally drop my Kindle.
RLWSMK6W603JT	1	I've been a little disappointed with this laptop. The battery life is about 3 or 4 hours when the lid is closed but the computer is still on. The performance is mediocre even for streaming and browsing. That might have a little to do with Windows 8, I'm not sure. None of it has been bad enough to actually send it back though.
R1PXU9P7NWDZ1M	2	I purchased this because it was a good price for the specs. It turns out that for a decent DVD reader, it does it's job adequately, but there is little to write home about. I would have expected better reading speeds.  For the price, they are acceptable.
RXMSJRQSXJ3HG	2	Cover fits well but when folding it back, it has just one position. The &#34;hinge&#34; of the cover is loose and is hard to keep straight. Not the best, most durable cover but it was inexpensive and protects the screen.
RGB9NE4ITY8VZ	4	I'm being nitpicky, but I feel I have the right to be with a $200 product.<br /><br />Overall the device works very well. Battery lasts for a very long time, screen is easy to read, plenty of brightness settings to find that perfect light wherever you are, plenty of room to store many books. I love no longer needing to use a book light, I was chewing through CR2032 batteries at a tremendous rate. Prime lender's library is a nice bonus, if it weren't for the 1-book-a-month limitation, but I digress....<br /><br />My biggest complaint is a lack of physical page-turn buttons. I frequently switch off my \\"holding\\" hand, and with my previous e-reader, a Nook Simple Touch, there were physical buttons on both sides that allowed me to turn pages one-handed no matter which hand was holding the device. Not so with the Kindle Paperwhite. If I'm holding with my right, no problem, if I've switched to my left I have to bring my right hand up to page turn.<br /><br />While I've read hundred of paper books, obviously, and dealt with this in the past, you can say I'm being overly picky.<br /><br />The device is also incredibly difficult to hold comfortably, I have very large hands, but the finish doesn't have much friction and the bezel is very small, my thumb is quite a bit thicker. If it wasn't for the case my wife ordered with it, which has a hand-strap behind it, I would've returned this immediately because I just cannot hold it comfortably one handed without the case.<br /><br />Special Offers cannot be removed with a gift card. I'm glad my card on file was invalid and my payment didn't go through when I tried, but I was annoyed I couldn't remove them with a giftcard.<br /><br />The library is very annoying to navigate through. I have upwards of 300 books on my device, and it takes me a very, very long time to get through them. For whatever reason, I cannot get my library to sort by Author's Last Name, my library was imported from my Nook, using Calibre to move everything to .mobi, and I've embedded author sort in the files. Lack of physical buttons to navigate the library often causes the device to register a short swipe as a tap, and opens a book it thinks I tapped on, rather than swiping through the library.<br /><br />The device needs frequent restarting. It seems to have memory problems (physical device memory) and slows down, much like a computer with a memory leak that's left on too long. Frequently it will lag for 1-10 seconds on page turn. Restarting every few days has kept this at bay.<br /><br />Between my wife and I we've owned a Nook Simple Touch, Nook Simple Touch with Glow, a couple tablets, and now this. This is, by far, my favorite to read on. Once you actually find the book on the device and open it, at least.<br /><br />Side Note: Our Nook Glow screen cracked one day inside my backpack. Research lead me to find it's very common and the glow screen is horrendously delicate. I settled on the Kindle because I read the Kindle developers actually abuse-tested the screen to make sure it could take an average tap without breaking. While a cracked glow screen doesn't stop the device from being readable with the light off, it causes light bleeding, making that entire section a bright spot. Reading that about the Kindle more or less sold it to me on the spot.
R3RMQBBBBKHFQ7	1	It is O.K. but it is not as flexible as it says or easy flexing it.  It seems like it was intended to moved into a position and left in that position.  The 360 degree turning is very very very did I say very difficult and it makes these loud clicking noise like it is going to break as you attempt the 360 degree turn.
R2X3K4Y48FFIZK	2	I bought this cable to use with my mid 2009 macbook pro.  The cable works as it is supposed to and displays great video.  However if you own a Macbook Pro pre 2010 like I do you will have to find another source for audio instead of this adapter+HDMI.  Otherwise this is cheap and works.
R1JUGLMSLUM00V	3	I purchased this camera as a baby monitor & grandparents camera. It works OK, but beware a few issues:<br /><br />1. Although Linksys tells you it is Vista compatible, it isn't really. You can view the camera through any IE web browser, but if you want to view recorded video clips or use the Linksys recording/monitoring utility, don't plan on using Windows Vista. I've been arguing with Linksys since I received this camera over this issue. I took me three days and four of their \\"engineers\\" to finally get someone who had the capability to understand the issue and try to help. Even then, I was advised that Microsoft is at fault for not making Vista so that all pre-vista products will run in it. They say they're considering updating their software, but will not give a time to update. Keep in mind that Vista has been available to Linksys for testing and development for almost a year, and they act like this is an issue that I pointed out to them.<br /><br />2. The audio on this camera is flaky. When I first set it up and plugged it in, the audio was remarkably sensitive. I could hear everything in the room through the camera. After a month of use, the audio is seriously degraded. I have to reboot the camera frequently to get any audio from it. Yesterday when I was testing it, I had to get my wife to stand 2 feet from the camera and talk directly to it in order to hear anything from it. The Linksys customer forum has previous customer postings on this issue, from 6 mos to a year ago, and the recommended solution was to update the firmware on the camera. I'm running a firmware that was released in the past two months.<br /><br />3. Linksys' customer support forums are heavily censored - one of the best resources available to Linksys customers is their customer forum, where customers can go to share knowledge and experience on their products. What I discovered is that the forum moderators don't like customers to describe negative experiences they have with Linksys products. I was banned from their forum for my insistence that Linksys was not providing good customer support over their inability first to acknowledge and then to effectively address the Vista compatability issue described in item number 1 above. I didn't use any bad language or make any defamatory claims, but I was banned for life from their forum for \\"bashing\\".<br /><br />Aside from those issues, the camera was very easy to set up. The picture is good. It doesn't matter what kind of home networking gear you have (you don't have to have Linksys). I have the camera connected wirelessly, and it works fine (except for the audio problems). The PTZ controls work well through the web browser. If you're in the room when someone is viewing you through the camera, there is an activity light that flashes on the front of the unit.<br /><br />If you can look past the audio issues, the non-compatability with Windows Vista, and the poor support from Linksys, this seems like a good camera. I haven't used the competing DLink, Siemens, Panasonic, or other products, so I can't compare.forum for my insistence that Linksys was not providing good customer support over their inability first to acknowledge and then to effectively address the Vista compatability issue described in item number 1 above.

RFYB2SP6F4Z03	1	If you are buying this product for the color, to differentiate your connections, the product is NOT this color at all. The one I got was a very faint cream color (which I already have so it defeats the purpose of purchasing the yellow I wanted.) Had I known that this color is greatly misrepresented I would have either purchased another color or purchased elsewhere. Other than that, it is just your typical RJ45 cable, nothing special.
R5SJQP26IKDRF	1	This screen protector is crystal clear. This is okay if you do not use your tablet in bright lights or outdoors. I will be looking for an anti-glare screen protector because there is to much reflection.
R1EPO8TBYPI7OJ	1	When this card works, its GREAT!  However look it up and Dragon Age Inquisition, and you know why I gave this only 3 stars.  Right now there is nothing wrong with the hardware, but I don't like running Beta Drivers to get a game to work.
R36G1HVN02T0DN	1	ive had mine barely a month and it has stopped working. amazon is replacing it, so i hope i dont have the same problem with the new. most reviews on here are good ones, so maybe us with bad reviews just got the few unlucky drives. and amazon has been great with return process. no hassle and immediate response to claim via email. thank you amazon
R18BK5YZ2GF7AC	1	This card is an absolute beast at pumping out graphics, and at a great price with a lot of room to over clock. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, mine regularly refuses to display anything on my screen when I turn on my computer. This can be solved by unplugging the card, then reinserting it, but it is quite annoying to half disassemble my rig every time I want to boot. I'm not sure if this is an anomaly with my rig, but for now, this is a big flaw in an otherwise fabulous card.
R2OTR3HEGVPPZK	2	Worked once for about 10 minutes, then never again. Instructions followed. Device approved. Latest firmware for this piece of junk installed. Still nothing. A lot of wasted effort.<br />UPDATE.. Got it working again. Required reinstalling phone drivers that had been working fine til I used this. Product does work, but a lot of the options in the program do not. But to be fair I have raised my rating to reflect the once again working product
