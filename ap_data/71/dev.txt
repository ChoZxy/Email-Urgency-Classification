R2A46OLP7R1T7	1	After following the recommended hinge method, the protector shifted down slightly anyway giving me air bubbles and difficulty pushing the main menu button. Will try again with the second protector in the package but wouldn't buy again if this doesn't work.
R3OS1GEBMVWP60	3	Good quality, aesthetically pleasing and easy to install on a Asus Impact mini ITX board. Because of space limitations with my build, I am only using one fan, exhausting air out of the case. The average CPU temp is 30C, however I haven't had a chance to overclock and evaluate cooling performance. I need to RMA the board, and I had issues removing the cooler because of the back plate.
R1A4YE7WBBB7MJ	3	Durable case.  I saved me from plenty of drops.  Biggest down side is the cut out for the front cameras.  It is completely off alignment making the camera unuseable.  Not a deal breaker for me....(not big with skype)  but I pretty sure it would erk others.  The keyboard aspect is awesome.  All the short cuts and buttons work as they should.  I don't expect to be able to type like a normal keyboard and you won't but it does help versus the touch screen keyboard.
R1JV3L2PHWSJXS	3	Best ipad cover i have bought so far and i can say i jhave bought quite a few now. Wish i had bought this cover from the first cover i have bought. Money well spent. Love the colour and the feel of the material. Very easy to fit in as described and the sleep function works well. Reconmend it.<br /><br />Edit<br />As much as i love this cover, i must warn ipad owners with toddlers (age 1 - 6), please do not get this cover. Its not good when you have kids who smash the ipad on hard floors when fighting over the ipad or just plain angry when a game is not going their way. For the first time since i have had ipads since 2010, my ipad screen is shattered and my husband's own has a sratch on it. This case is not very smug and the edges do not hold in the ipad as well as i thought initially especially when you have kids using your ipad.<br />To be fair and objective, its still a great ipad case, met my need of been sleek, slim and stlyish, but just not wise and practical for me as a mum with 3 kids who struggle to use the ipad with themselves. I have to spend $125 to replace the ipad screen now. Not a happy mum!
R3S7HJ8DRISXY	2	First, I can say that this is the best bluetooth interface to my stereo system that I can find at a reasonable price.  It is simple and easy to setup so that I can feed music to my stereo or listen to it wirelessly.    I stream music to this device from my ipod bluetooth interface (A125s).  I listen to music from my stereo via this device using my bluetooth headset (BT620s).  This device paired easily and consistently keep the pairings.  Connection to the A125s dropped occasionally during music playing but only for a short time and not enough to be annoying yet.    Now, for the bad part.  The audio lag is very noticeable and is at a varying amount.  This make playing games like Guitar Hero almost impossible if you are keeping rhythm by listening to the music.  On GH4 (World Tour), there is an audio calibration that can help compensate for the lag but I still have problem due to fluctuation in the delay.  GH3 has no such calibration so I can't play any songs beyond the easy mode when using this device.    I should note here that the audio lag may be a common problem with all bluetooth audio devices.  There are three devices in the loop here (my stereo system, the bluetooth gateway and the bluetooth headphone) and each of them probably contributes to this problem in someway.    Overall, it is a good device to have.  The audio lag is a big let down for me but for others, this issue is probably not a big deal.
R1XTBHCP3TJ9UE	2	Cool board but mine seems to have a gremlin in it. Randomly just stops working , have to unplug then replug it and even then sometimes that wont work. I love the overall fall of the board just , kinda disappointed it only sometimes feels like doing its job.
RJJH9PI5UBMJ6	3	I used to read on a Kindle Paperwhite, which I absolutely loved - at least until I started having to remove content to make room for more. Out of curiosity, I tried reading on my boyfriend's Kindle Fire and was instantly hooked. I love that the Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (to avoid wearing reading glasses, I read with a large font) and I love that I can see the book covers in color. And while reading in the dark I can dim the screen to a comfortable level. What I do not like is that I cannot arrange my books into categories, but this is an inconvenience with which I can live. I find the carousel simply annoying and wish there was a way to turn it off.<br /><br />Anyone who has a Kindle Fire absolutely must sign up for Amazon Prime in order to take advantage of the free videos. (No, I don't work for Amazon.) I didn't think I would enjoy watching movies and television shows on such a small screen, but the picture is unbelievably sharp and crisp, the sound is good, and is even better with headphones (not earbuds) on, and you can watch in bed without disturbing your partner.<br /><br />I can't speak to all the many other features because, as yet, I've not had time to try them, but I will update my review as I do.<br /><br />UPDATE: 1/27/2014. I lowered by rating from five stars to three, and had considered giving only two. Lately, my Kindle Fire has constantly been freezing up as I'm reading and, sometimes, restarting it does not fix the problem, so that I have to dig out my old Paperwhite to continue reading. I have had no problems with the Paperwhite, only the Fire. Sometimes, when I turn on the Fire, I get a blank, black page - no carousel, no bookshelves, no nothing. For the price, I expect not to have these kinds of problems. I can only hope that there is an update coming soon to fix these glitches.
R10I9YLVKHGMCY	1	I bought this as a backup if my service provider ADSL modem burned out. It was hard to set up on Embarq of TX and so I bought a Zoom ADSL modem from Best Buy. I would recommend the ZOOM modem instead because it was much easier to set up. However I did finally get the DLink modem to work. I still kept it as a backup. Thanks.
R1X4L2WC2Y8H3	1	I was not a happy camper when I found out the Vista Basic soft were expired after 30 days.  I purchase the computer with the intentions of having the software not a trial bases.
R2CULM8J3VM39M	3	The fan doesn't spin too fast and as a result gives a nice gentle cooling. If you own a 17&#34; like I do, skip this. This is solely for 16&#34; and below. The laptop will not stay on. I do appreciate the LED lights because the brightness is according to fan speed.<br />One thing I don't like is how cheap it feels. It looks and feels like it could break at any minute. The instructions are only in Chinese (says a lot about the quality) but it's simple to use. Overall, for a 14&#34; cooler it does its job.
R2R9HBVNNEZU40	2	Easy to set up and convenient, but it does not come close to a true wired connection as far as speed. But all in all I would recommend it but you will still get some lag playing online xbox or ps3 as compared to a wired network. But other than that I have my pc and netflix dvd hooked to it also. Maybe pc is a little slower download time too. Netflix works fine.
R2OBYZJEPV9XKI	4	I got this in the cyber monday lightning deal that went sold out in a few seconds and let me say that I wouldn't have been too disappointed if I had missed the deal now that I got this thing on my hand for a few days. First of all the screen is a bit too small for my taste and I didn't realize until after the purchase that amazon was selling the 1024x600 version not the 720p version that has been in most review. Second, the Windows 7 is slow, which is nothing new, but apparently I had expected a responsiveness closer to a smart phone, and Windows smart phone is not at all that fast by the way. I have a great suspicion that 2GB memory instead of the non-upgradeable 1GB could have made a great deal of difference in this manner. However, a mixed curse with Windows 7 Starter will limit the number of applications open at a time to total of 3 so 1GB is probably never going to be a problem just because of this self-imposed crippling of the OS. In this respect to the non-upgradeable memory, running full-blown WindowsXP is probably going to shoot you in the foot more than the Windows7 Starter. But on the good part the TV reception is great and the software works, albeit slow to respond in changing channels. Youtube video runs smoothly but since the screen is so short I found myself having to go full screen most of the time instead of watching within the window. The shortness of the screen also makes most of the real estate consumed by the toolbars in the browser to be very annoying, except for Chrome which barely has anything on the top. I guess if I had laid my hand on this item before I purchased it I wouldn't have been too eager to click on the lightning deal, but for the price I don't think I could claim it as a terribly poor machine although I would gladly spring another $100 for the larger resolution and 2GB memory and then it would be just perfect. For now, this is great as a quick companion for emergency use on the road when the regular laptop is just a bit too muchhassle to lug around.
R1HKZ28B77AR3G	1	it took me a long time to apply the item but i did get it right thanks to the video
R1DFXBVVOI2OBR	4	The drive itself works very well.  I have backed up a ton of pictures and videos with no hiccups and have been able to read CD's and DVD's.  PowerDVD 10 DOES NOT work with Windows 8, so I am unable to watch Blu-ray movies with the drive.  You can upgrade to PowerDVD for a &#34;nominal&#34; fee of $39.99, but I was hoping to be able to use the included software that came with the drive.  I have verified that the drive does play Blu-ray discs with other paid software, but I haven't found a free one that works.  All of the software out there is between $30-$100, and I can buy a Blu-ray player for my TV for less dough.
R1LPR2VNUOGSFL	2	it is a good case except when you are making phone calls for some reason the screen blacks out and you cant get back to the phone screen when you are done to hang up. dont have that issue without the case. the price was right when i got it and it will do to i can find an otterbox
ROA6BRHUQ77KQ	1	IT IS OK FOR MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. IT IS HANDY AND VERY PORTABLE. IT IS COMPACT. PERFECT FOR TRAVEL USER. OK
R2OX3P57B36ATY	2	If you do graphics or need precision touch control this isn't for you. If you use the ipad like 90% of the population this is a great case. But be aware that the screen protector design causes the touch sensitivity to change and sometimes not register swipes or touches properly. When trying to scroll in some situations it will instead register as a click (touch). The screen protector may show little dots in the sunlight etc... The case is top notch the only negative is the screen protector part.
R2781TLEOXAWNX	1	I don't quite understand why they included they included \\"brushed metal\\" in the description.  But I got an authentic Samsung 32gb class 10.  So yea me!  I tested it with SD Tools on Google Play.  Really great super fast read times 19.2mb/s.  But disappointing write times in comparison 8mb/s.  Overall gave my HTC Evo a new lease on life.  I would buy again if they don't come out with anything faster.
R2SRC5Y7MQ0U29	1	My oldest daughter has maxed the 8G storage space. How do you remove some of the downloads so she can download something else she wants? Is there any way to upgrade the storage space?
RR0Z311HHOBMY	2	Neat product. Doesn't hold its connection real well with my LG bluetooth headphones though.    Edit:  The folks at Plugable contacted me immediately to see if they could help resolve my issue from above.  Sam sent out a replacement product and it works flawlessly.  Stellar customer service that is above and beyond what you could hope for from such a small company.  Buy with confidence from Sam and his crew.  They're the real deal.
R1FA6GZACLCCLA	2	I received my drive in early October and have been using it as my Vista 64 boot disk with a 4 drive RAID setup for file storage, games and commonly changed files. Hardware wise this drive is great. It has great throughput and loads most anything instantly. The one issue I have with this drive at this point is the sudden %33 jump in price. Even worse, this is a jump directed by the manufacturer since this is mostly a change in suggested retail price. My advice would be if you are in the market for an SSD of this caliber or below, wait. This sudden price gouging is ridiculous. Hopefully, once Windows 7 is released and demand goes down, Crucial will decide to bring this product's price back down to the original mid $100 SRP.
R3JK7KHGQO2DF6	3	The monitor has a very nice and clear HD display. I have no complaints with it's quality.  However the touch feature doesn't work with Windows 8 and that's really why I bought it.  I have a Samsung Slate 7 PC Tablet with Windows 8 Consumer Preview installed. I was really hoping to extend it's display to a touch monitor but no joy with this one.  I'm hoping there will be a driver ready when the final Win 8 product is released.
RZNKLZ6E4IFX8	2	Product is great for HDD and flash drive combination when using with a tablet such as Surface Pro 3.  Tablet port doesn't have enough juice to support two HDDs.  Maybe the installation of a power port from another USB port or power source would make this a 5-star product.
R30MRUII1CQKS3	4	It's between 2 stars (I don't like it) and 3 stars (it's OK).  I bought it on the strength of the NY Times story and paid about $90 including shipping for the red version. For $9.24 shipping it came UPS Ground from the west coast, in 8 days from placing the order.<br /><br />I've been using the Ematic for a day or so. It works; it does many things well or at least OK, but it's slow, very slow.<br /><br />Pluses:It's got mostly intuitive controls. It runs android apps. I like the integration with google applications and syncing with same on my other devices. It runs a Sonos app which is a big plus for us since we have it at our home.  (I tried a Samsung Chromebook; it won't run sonos as of early May 2013.)  Another plus is the Kindle app you download.  It lets me read the same books I have on a separate kindle, on ematic.  It works really well.<br /><br />Cons:  Slow, frustratingly slow, esp using the chrome browser.  The touch screen really lags in chrome; can be several seconds or more; especially frustrating when typing.  I wind up pressing several times and waiting.  There's no sensitivity controls for the touch screen that I can find.  I looked for them after learning the screen does not always respond to my taps. In some instances I find myself pushing on the screen rather than tapping since it appears not to respond. When typing, it frequently enters a foreign alphabet character, like an accented e or o.  I tried to see if Firefox would run faster than chrome.  I downloaded FF and got a format \\"not supported\\" message.  Not a surprise, but want to note that it runs android not other formats.  Screen contrast and sharpness are marginal.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, its not bad for having around the house as a tool to run a timer, do a quick check on mail or the net, read a book, etc.  Take it on a trip or use as a main device?  Not for me.<br /><br />You get what you pay for in this case. It's an inexpensive tablet. It works.  You'll probably be frustrated, as I am after only one day.  I'd suggest paying more and getting more.<br /><br />3 week update:<br />May 24, 2013:  I've been using it for 3 weeks now.  I would return it if I could.  Works well as a kindle reader, Sonos controller, and some android games.  As a browser its so slow, its useless or freezes completely.  Available storage is so limited I continually get out of memory system notices. No idea how to remedy them, maybe buy a memory card? That wipes out the advantage of low price?  Won't really run other android apps like NYTimes, Wall St Journal, etc.  Just freezes.<br /><br />Can anyone else who bought one comment on speed, freezes, etc?  Did I get a lemon or is this just not an adequate tablet beyond the reader and sonos functions?ed, as I am after only one day.  I'd suggest paying more and getting more.<br /><br />3 week update:<br />May 24, 2013:  I've been using it for 3 weeks now.  I would return it if I could.

R3ORT37IHA50C7	3	The price was right, but the keyboard is obviously a refurb. Some keys came with scratches. I ended up using the backlight from the old keyboard because the power connector was broken on the one this came with. Keys feel different than my old keyboard but at least this one works. Took about 4 hours to install for someone who has never done this before.
R170NRIGIEX1MD	1	Where the hell are  set of proper instructions?<br />These must have been written by someone in a Gulag...who only spoke Mongolian<br /><br />Is there no website where a proper instructions may be found?
R150II282JNDQJ	1	I have an Asus UX31A, and the plug was too big to fit in my computer.  The item shipped quickly, and was in good condition.
R1VAXBCNG5KFV5	2	The instructions say that the lines or streaks will go away in a few days.  This did not happen.  Did they diminish? Perhaps.  Did I get used to living with them? Yes.  Another issue is: Is it as smooth to the touch-screen as it was? No.  Am I now used to using it, after a few weeks of having on? Yes.  After the first couple of days, I wanted to rip it off, but I decided to give it a shot.  The only benefit, other than the obvious 'screen protection' that it provides, is that 'perhaps' it reduces the extreme glare that the Acer W700 screen has slightly.  It is possible that I really needed to pay better attention to the video steps, than I did.  Maybe I would have had a better experience.  But I have had screen protectors before, that were not as finicky.<br /><br />Pros: Provides Screen Protection.  Perhaps Slight Glare reducing for the Acer W700<br />Cons: You must be absolutely perfect when putting on.  Leaves visible imperfections.  Streaks/Lines (that may diminish, but do not disappear completely).  Not as smooth to the finger strokes, that is necessary for Windows 8/8.1
R2OCSY8X8AJ1SL	4	I just purchased this mouse after having used a Razer Lachesis for the past 2-3 years. I was excited to try it out, and really wanted to like it, but I was unfortunately disappointed in it.<br /><br />I'm not going to recap on all its features, as those are mostly obvious from reading the product info or many other reviews... What I will do is share my experience with it.<br /><br />From a construction stand-point, it's a very nice mouse. It feels very solid and looks very nice. The soft rubberized touch, which is common these days, feels nice. However, they did not use it on the main mouse buttons, which can make them a little slippery; and they really don't have much in the way of a texture either. Mouse glides nicely on my Razer eXactMat. Only gripe here is that the DPI adjustment buttons feel cheap and are not solid in place like all the other buttons. I do also wish the USB cable was longer. I routed it the same way as my Lachesis and it does not quite work out well. Another 8\\" to a foot would be great. Oh, and the cable is rather stiff; although that might soften up with use... EDIT: After only a few days of use, the right mouse button has loosened up and the plastic no longer is solid, now it has some wiggle and noise like the DPI buttons... After a few more days, I can feel the main left click button also loosening, soon it will make noise like the others.<br /><br />Function: During normal usage, it has very good tracking. It's lift-off distance is nice as well. However, it does have a Z-axis issue like many do. If you pick up the mouse a bit, the pointer tends to make its way towards the bottom left of the screen. (the Razer Lachesis also did this, but towards the bottom right). The main mouse buttons have a little too stiff of a click for me and while the wheel works well, to me does not have enough resistance.<br /><br />Comfort & Design: Here is where I have issues with this mouse most. While its design is heavily ergonomic... I just do not feel comfortable on it at all. I know this mouse was probably not designed for 'Fingertip Grip' users, but it also does not say its exclusively for 'Palm grippers'. I also use 'Claw grip' from time to time and I could not comfortably use this grip at all on this; my hand sort of just slides right off the back-end... The mouse is rather long and I find it actually gets in the way. --The thumb rest feels odd to say the least; almost like you should have your hand sort of twisted for it sit comfortably. There is a harder edge in the thumb rest near the back end that just rubs me the wrong way, literally. Normal resting position does not feel right on the thumb rest. Location of the back and forward buttons, while being in a common spot did not jive with me cause of needing to move the thumb up a reasonable amount to hit them... It definitely does not make it easy to access them quickly while gaming. ---Due to my grip style, fingertip, I often pick up the mouse and move it a smidgen. Problem here is, there is almost no grip on the right side of the mouse at all. My ring-finger and pinky have nothing to grip onto. The mouse does not feel secure in my hand if I go to pick it up; in-fact a few times, it has slipped out.<br /><br />Software: The drivers installed easily and seem to be easy enough to get working. The main control panel is a little cluttered and some text is very tiny; but it's all very functional. I'd say they did a pretty decent job on this. However, I don't know how they are doing with support as I do not see any recent driver updates or any firmware available. Which is not a problem as long as there is no issues with performance; which I can say has been fine.<br /><br />Bottom line: A high quality mouse that seemingly works best with palm grip, but I'm unsure of what shape of hands it was designed for... Ergonomics seemed confused, especially by the contour of the thumb-rest.<br /><br />Looks as if I'm still on the quest of my ideal mouse. I might have to invest inthe newer version of the Razer Lachesis as that is the best mouse I've used to date, with my prior favorites being the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer series. Might give the customizable R.A.T. 7 a try, but it is rather pricey... May also try the Logitech G9x, though doubt I will like the position of the back and forward buttons on that either. ...May have to stick with Razer to keep the direct in thumb contact back/forward buttons and the 'on-the-fly' on screen display sensitivity adjustment (which I use a heck of a lot more than profiles and is a great addition to the normal DPI adjustment).<br /><br />EDIT 3/18/11: Despite the buttons loosening and bothering me, I tried and tried to like this mouse. Removing all of the weights helps the feel a little bit for me, but it's still too long of a mouse and the weight is not well balanced... All the weight feels like it's in the rear, even without the weights installed. I've been gaming with it and I definitely feel as if this mouse inhibits my performance from my old mouse the Razer Lachesis... When I go to use the back/forward buttons (Which have the best feeling click on the mouse), I feel like I lose control over the mouse due to the grip of the mouse. The front of the mouse is much narrower than the middle/rear and it creates a very strange way to grip... When you go to press a back or forward button with your thumb while gaming, it feels as if you lose all of your grip on the left side of the mouse since the buttons are located so close to the top.<br /><br />I have since decided to purchase the Cyborg R.A.T. 7 mouse and give that a shot. So far, I'm liking the R.A.T. a whole lot better than this Sentinel. It's got a much more solid feel in the build, I like the click of all the buttons better, and it's surprisingly comfortable... I will be doing a review of this mouse soon too after I get more testing in...best mouse I've used to date, with my prior favorites being the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer series.

R3USPLLG9CJZ54	3	This is a beautiful cover for the Kindle, but I specifically bought it to go with the M-Edge reading light for the Kindle 2 which it does not do. The cover will not close completely with the M-Edge light which is disappointing. I wanted to be able to take my Kindle with my cover and light, and carry them around easily with me. I still can't do that with this cover. The M-Edge design folks need to test their products to work together better. But as a cover, this product is very, very nice.
R281G21BA0S5EG	1	Works fine with tablet not working with windows phone
R3P6GQFFSX5Z38	2	I just got this today. I put this on my TF101. Seems to have a good fit. One thing I dont understand is the build of it. Why in the world did they cover the left speaker? Why? I dont get it? There are open slots everywhere. But they missed it on this. Why? We may never know. Also the snap on the dock doesnt snap on in place on  both sides. Just on one. I will contact them for this. Right now I am 50/50 onwhether I should keep it or return it.
R3C74K2348MIAE	2	I'm somewhat disappointed it Netgears quality control.  All that needs to power the unit down is to bump it.  The switch side of the transformer has a weird fit to it.  It has to be pushed in very tight like something is holding it back.  Once in, it works fine until even a slight bump will dislodge it and power the unit off.  It's out of the way now so it doesn't get bumped and works fine.  It was kind of a pain while setting my system up and moving things around but now that it's stable, it's fine.
RRPTQIZHV6Y7G	3	I purchased two ASUS ET2020AUKK all-in-one computers with the AMD A4-5000 processor (detailed specs above as I purchased directly from Amazon); my intent is to use them as visual displays to run very basic software for advertising.<br /><br />I'm pleased with my purchase because they're a very cost-effective option for point-of-sale demonstrations; but that's about it.  I've spend three days messing around with both computers basically updating Windows (ugh), removing the ASUS bloatware and turning off all the stuff I won't need.  These things are SLOW.  Really slow...  for reference, I use a third-gen Intel i7 Toshiba and a fourth-gen i5 Lenovo laptop each with 4GB ram on the same wireless home network; this really shows the ASUS' age - or the inadequacies of the AMD A4 processor - depending on your perspective.<br /><br />These all-in-one computers are really designed for web surfing and light processing tasks, like looking at por- uh, pictures, writing papers, etc.  You will NOT even want to think about processing home videos or even watching high-def on this unit; it just doesn't seem to have enough processing power for higher demand home or business users.<br /><br />The good news:  the display is clear and bright, it does do a good job for what it's purpose is, and it's very cost effective for that at around $400 or so.  You just need to be honest with whether or not the bare essentials are what you want - because that's all this is.
R5LK234URVQU	1	Lid cover fits tight.  Bottom does not fit tight.  The snap on tabs on the back corners do not snap in place.  Since the bottom does not fit tight I had to remove the handle because the bottom would come off if I carried by the handle.
R3G2XGQE8KBUJO	1	The company tapes a silver/grey wrapper around the syringe in the ad.  So if you are looking for silver/grey grease buy something else.
R3VQYJ075MTNJ2	2	Without revealing much, I go to a very rigorous school and I carry a lot of books around. Something to the tune of 20-25 pounds per day. Not fun.<br /><br />For about half of the year, this worked, but it has slowly ripped, not just the backpack but the zippers and other things.<br /><br />If you are carrying around a laptop and an iPad this is fine. I would not recommend this for heavy things, but otherwise it is great.
R2RIPQJVO48B4Y	2	Arrived in excellent shape however connector is very touchy and it is hard to keep a connection. Might be my phone, however other chargers connect and charge with no issues.
R21I8BTAV4UQS2	1	This sleeve is too long for the \\"WD My Passport Essential SE\\" 1TB, as I suspected, rather it is compatible with the WD My Passport Essential, which is somewhat longer in dimension. I  looked around for a sleeve for the \\"SE\\" and have not found one yet, took a chance on this one, to no avail.
R3FXQUPVAUU1U7	1	Love it but when playing games if freezes when purchasing extra moves so I don't purchase any more have to turn off my tablet took my money had to start all over not happy
R1ROD0WX0WL0ZR	3	Big bright monitor. Sometimes too bright, and the settings seem to change on their own. Contrast and colors vary noticeably with the view angle, so finding the sweet spot that works for you is critical.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the touch controls on the side of the monitor. The very top control doesn't seem to function correctly, so I have to use the &#34;remote&#34; to set up the monitor. Both the monitor controls and remote are slow and awkward, but fortunately you don't need to use them much.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent monitor, but I'm not sure I would buy another one.
R2Z64EXKSGK42	2	Item came with no stand, like the one you see in the picture for the item. Not sure if the case was damaged or not included at all. The case seems durable however and this product would most likely be excellent if the stand were included.
R38ZF32FZI8VXK	2	Love the long battery life. Hate the needs of constantly refreshing the tab. Only suitable if you open one or two tab at once. The memory cannot handle multiple tabs open at once. I returned the chromebook, now using macbook pro retina 13 inch, which  I am enjoying these days.
R1MWG3ENZTAP8P	1	This product definitely helped with the glare but I had a hard time getting all the bubbles out. Now I got it down to only a couple of bubbles and you really can't see them when the kindle is turned on.
R1QIQDIITHLVEP	4	I really wanted to give this a five-star review, but I can't. I only just put it on my new Kindle Fire last night, so I can't speak about how it holds up to scratches yet, but I do want to point out some basic issues:<br /><br />1. I wasted one protector trying to get it to firmly adhere to my Kindle. I had everything lined up and ready to go. I was following the directions exactly (which isn't hard). And as I was slowly placing the screen and removing the first layer of backing, I noticed that the protector, which was supposed to be sticking to the section of Kindle where I'd placed it, kept slipping. I had to keep pausing and trying to hold down the end with the exposed sticky bit while removing the rest of the first backing. Very frustrating. By the time I had gotten the backing off the first side and managed to keep the screen in place, I noticed that there were many air bubbles that couldn't be removed and were unsightly. So I removed the protector (something it says you can do), and I even did it carefully, but a finger smudge still resulted on the sticky side and it looked horrible. Into the trash went the first protector.<br /><br />2. I had more luck placing the second protector because I was now aware of the flaws and aware of what may result if I wasn't completely watchful. Now, the protector was clean with no smudges and my Kindle was ready for its case. This brings me to issue No. 2: The screen protector does not fit the Kindle Fire screen from edge to edge like my screen for my iPhone. This was pretty annoying because that made it difficult to line up in the first place, and it left a small gap between protector and edge of device all the way around. I don't have a thick, framed Kindle case; I opted for the book-cover portfolio for my device. So the edge of exposed glass around the perimeter of my Kindle is irksome. Also, being somewhat of a perfectionist, when placing the film I had to make sure the perimeter was exposed uniformly -- in other words, I made sure one side of the Kindle wasn't more protected than the other.<br /><br />3. Issue No. 3, for me, is that this protector screen is too glossy, it shows fingerprints faster and easier than the glass! I have a similar shield for my iPhone and I don't have this problem. It's very strange to me. I wish I'd researched more and looked to see if my iPhone screen protector company sold protectors for the Fire. When it's time to replace these protectors, that's what I'll hope to find. As it is, with me being a perfectionist, my portfolio pocket contains my lint cloth so I can keep the Fire clean. Constantly wiping the screen down is bound to get old, though, and I may simply request better screen protectors for Christmas.<br /><br />All of this said, the protector should do what it's meant to do, for the part of my Fire that it covers. No matter what, you shouldn't operate a device like this without a protector.made sure one side of the Kindle wasn't more protected than the other.<br /><br />3.

R32XQUFAN10JWO	3	While it meets the specifications in size and ports, it hides the windows key<br />it slides down and partially covers the camera and you need to push the tablet a bit up to have clear cam
R2MWT3EPJJOLMF	3	I love love love the fabric - very chic. The spine is too loose - it flops around and makes it clumsy. Love the inside pockets, wish there was a pen holder in there.  Just tighten up/strengthen the spine.
R3DEBF08QJHKNS	1	I purchased to give as part of a Christmas gift with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.  While the product is okay, it was very difficult to put on, it just wouldn't hardly stretch, after using much muscle finally got the case on, at least it won't fall off!  The cut out for the charger needs to be cut with scissors, as the charger cord will continually fall out because the cut out doesn't line up with the slot, and taking off the case each time you charge the tablet is not an option when the fit is so tight. I was also somewhat disappointed with the seller as this arrived without packaging. I had purchased  2 and the other came in a package so it looked to the receiver of the gift like I had opened a portion of their gift prior to giving it.
RZBNJHXMIOGVC	2	When I first got the nighthawk I was amazed, but after about three weeks strange things started to happen to my PC, four days ago I turn my PC on and there is no internet, no virus protection up and running, I got hacked big time the nighthawk had two reddish lights on and I could not do anything with it. My wife calls into netgear technical support and they seemed to be very knowledgeable about what happened &#34;TO KNOWLEDGEABLE!&#34; For an additional 399 dollars I can got a 3 years unlimited tech support and lifetime protection. Maybe it is just me but seems odd. And one more thing I was told I cannot view who has logged into my Router however when I went to www.routerlogin.net there was an IP log for my router &#34;ODD' it was empty except for that day. I check the log often now.
R1OOOMN0HJ9GS2	4	Before I proceed with my review, please see below for the keyboard specs...  Name: Multimedia Photosensitive Gaming Keyboard Model: JLK009 Bar-code: X000OQM5M7 Key Technology: Architecture crater Key Life: 10,000,000 times Connection: Wired Keys: 104 normal keys (full-size style) Color: Black Cable Length: 1.8m (USB braided) Size: 454x180x30mm Weight: 700g  I took a gamble with this keyboard since there were absolutely no reviews for it. What made me go for this keyboard was that there is a video link in the description that has a short video showing off this keyboard. If it weren't for that video I wouldn't have given this one a try. I just received it today and wanted to be the first person to say I am pretty impressed with this keyboard.  Firstly, I wanted a keyboard with dedicated multimedia buttons, not secondary multimedia buttons which most of the blue led lighted keyboards on Amazon had. This keyboard has dedicated multimedia buttons and they work great. Very big multimedia buttons and are colored red for easy distinction. Although, the led back light does not light them up like on the keys of the keyboard, they have lights that kind of go around them to at least see their border in complete darkness but can easily see them in daylight.  Secondly, the key ScrLk is labeled underneath it with a picture indicating it is the button to change the led lights from blue, red purple and off. Just hold the FN key down and keep pressing the ScrLk key for your desired color. Easy, simple and no guess work or trying to remember what key it was to change the colors. You can also change the brightness using FN + PgUp or PgDn keys. Easy!  Thirdly, the keyboards USB cable is braided. Nothing spells good quality like a braided USB cable.  Fourthly, the keyboard keys click very well. However, it seems the space bar has a tiny squeak when using it, which I hope will die down over time or I might take it out and get some Wd-40 in there to quiet it. The keyboard is pretty heavy with rubber feet underneath it to keep it grounded. Also has tilt option.  Lastly, the keys are very hard to see when the back light led lights are not on. This is obvious because the letters on the keys are transparent and are not black on white, or white on black. So in all honesty, in order to use this keyboard, either the back light needs to be on at all times, day or night, to see the key letters or if you took a lot of typing classes in your day you don't have to see the keys to type.  Some interesting things to know about this keyboard:  1. There are shiny red bumpers to the left and right of this keyboard. They light up very well with the red and purple back lights but the blue doesn't seem to shine through as good.  2. The keyboards back lights turn off after 3 minutes of being idle. I assume this is a power saving feature. Just click a key on the keyboard to wake the lights back up. It resumes the same light you left off.  3. When you wake the computer from sleep, the keyboard goes back to its default color which is blue instead of going back to the color you left off of unless it was blue. This is kind of annoying, Not sure why it just can't go back to the last color selected.  Bottom line, for the discounted price of this keyboard it is just pretty cool. Very bright led lights from blue to red and purple and to be able to increase and decrease the brightness I am satisfied. The reason why I rated -1 star was because the annoying squeaky space bar on a new keyboard (which I will have to take out and spray some lubricant in there on a brand new keyboard). Please feel free to check out all the pictures I uploaded of this keyboard.  UPDATE:  After further investigation of the squeaky space bar (it was driving me nuts) I popped the space bar off and to my surprise there were no 2x mini springs as stated on the back of the keyboard box making it a stronger keyboard. I quote &#34;The blank space key double spring design curved&#34; and has a picture of the spacebar removed and two mini springs are present indicating a strong double spring design for a strong lasting space bar. However, all I find instead is a traditional long bar spring which was used in the old school keyboards (probably still used today in cheap keyboards but definitely not gaming keyboards I would assume. Then again, I'm not popping off the space bar to check every single keyboard I purchase to see whats under the hood). And since the back of the keyboard box states, with a picture I might add, that it should have two springs in it, I have to say I have identified false advertisement on this keyboard and it must be reported. Not that the kind of spring in a keyboard is such a big deal but it makes the company untrustworthy and that puts me on edge. I plan to submit a picture of this, once Amazon sends me email instructions on how to add additional pictures to a review (can't seem to figure it out) in hopes that the sellers see this false advertisement and correct it. Also I appreciate a contact from the seller to arrange an exchange for the double spring keyboard that is stated on the box rather then the one I got. Because of this I had to take away a star. False advertisement is completely unacceptable. Sellers, feel free to chime in and explain your side of this. On a good note, the space bar is no longer squeaking and driving me nuts. The long spring bar must of been rubbing the wrong way.  Also, the picture of the keyboard on the box has blue multimedia buttons instead of red. And the small picture on the back of the keyboards box that displays the double springs for the space bar has a completely different design then the keyboard I got. The keyboard I got has a pointy arm rest below the space bar like shown in the sellers pictures. However, the referred picture shows a smooth arm rest which tells me they are illustrating the wrong keyboard. Maybe it was an earlier model but there are definitely no double springs under my space bar.  So after seeing the false advertisements I can only imagine what information is actually correct and what isn't according to what is stated on the tin besides the obvious. Does this keyboard have a waterproof splash design as stated? I have no idea and not sure how to tell other then to poor water on it and see what happens. There also seems to be two model numbers. On the box it states JLK009 while on the back of the keyboard it states MD-KB-02. Which is correct? No idea. Neither give me a whole lot to work with when I Google them. On the front of the box it states &#34;laser carving radium technology, never wear&#34;. Not sure how confident I am in that statement since the dual springs weren't there for the space bar. See what I am talking about? If I find anything else I'll update.
R2L7IGWHN59NKI	3	I had purchased this mouse to replace the one that came with my current computer (the left-click button was acting up).  Unfortunately, said computer is finicky and only functions reliably/properly when using a PS2 mouse and keyboard.<br /><br />I like the ergonomics of this mouse.  It fits my hand comfortably enough.  The \\"back\\" and \\"forward\\" browsing buttons on the left side are pretty convenient.  The sensitivity took awhile for me to get used to, even with the sensitivity adjustment button (which is a pretty nifty feature when one needs precision for an instant or so).  Unfortunately, after a month of owning and using this mouse pretty much daily, it seems that the scroll wheel has disengaged somehow.  I try to scroll up and down, and there's no clicking resistance (for lack of a better description) like before, and I can't scroll with the wheel.  I'm a little disappointed, to be sure, but I guess I should have seen this coming.<br /><br />I guess I'd better look into a replacement soon.  I can probably cope without a scroll wheel, but if that piece went bad on me this quickly, there's no telling how much longer this mouse will last.  If reviewers could give half-stars, I'd actually give this product 2.5 stars.  But I guess I'll have to make do with rounding up.
R29RWOSGPZUR09	1	The wrist rest area is very small unlike advertised in the picture on Amazon. Quite frankly, it is a cheating. Otherwise the desk is ok.
R2M666KDXSLP2K	3	Works great as a case but like other reviewers have stated it lacks the ability to fold back the case when you want hold it for general reading and use. I first thought it wouldn't be an issue but after some use it is rather annoying.<br /><br />The only other downside I noticed was that the middle of the screen seems to always dirtier than the rest of the screen.  Now I would say it would be due to use but when you look at it you can see the straight lines that go inline with the middle of the front part of the case.<br /><br />Overall it does the job but it does have features that are annoying.
RZ3NQ39KHZKM1	3	The good:<br />The back plate fits very nicely<br />Good access to all ports and etc<br />Magnet does work but see below<br /><br />The bad:<br />Front cover should have a latch or elastic band to keep it in place.<br />Front cover can easy slide around, waking/sleeping the iPad constantly when inside a bag<br />No typewriter angle<br />In landscape, only two of the three positions are useful. iPad will slide off the bar closest to you<br /><br />The price was very good. However, I wouldn't mind spending an extra $20 for a better case that does what I want.<br />This case might work well for some.<br />Therefore, I give it 3 stars. Not bad but not good either.
R1T8A4WIP2JH1S	2	The reader itself is great and no complaint with initial supply of reader, charger and cables to Spain. However my charger to Kindle USB cable failed and Amazon will not ship a replacement. The USB micro plug appears to be a non standard type and is proving difficult to source. Non-US/UK buyers beware!
R1XC4Z39VV1LR5	4	Ignore the rating in the title. Read this review for the real rating.<br /><br />The AN-200 is a stylish and compact MW antenna. The manual tuning is nearly perfect for the band as it allows precise control of the tuning. The AN-200 works well as an antenna whether electrically coupled or directly connected to a radio. I've tested the AN-200 with two receivers, a Meduci MW-2 which lacks a ferrite antenna and a Tecsun PL-880. Naturally, the AN-200 must be directly connected to the MW-2 and its performance was very good on local stations. The AN-200 was electrically coupled with the PL-880 and its performance was impressive with the sensitive PL-880. The AN-200 and PL-880 combination is so good that I was listening to previously unknown stations via skywave. One such station was a 130 watt AM station (KMTA) which is more than 150 miles away. I rate the AN-200 a solid 4 stars out of 5. Hopefully, your experience will be as pleasant as mine. Good luck.
R19V8CXV2NMCJD	1	Good fit, but kickstand is a little loose and doesn't snap into it's holder very well.  Will see how it holds up.
R1ZT9QP1PA6X9D	2	I got this touchpad to help with my arm and shoulder issues. It bothers me to hold down a touchpad button when scrolling and to dragging-and-dropping so I have given up using a mouse long ago. I have a Microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard which I really like, but is huge and doesn't leave a lot of space for a touchpad / mouse / trackball.  This touchpad does its job, but still doesn't really fit on my microsoft keyboard  and iis not as smooth to use as the built-in touchpad on my laptop or the Logitech k400 keyboard + touchpad which I'm now trying out.
R3D2I9AGV74MGB	3	my friend has this system and it sounds pretty good. For 82 dollars you really cant go wrong, although with my pair the right output sounded like it wasn't preamped. Therefore when I turned it on it sounded out of balence and there was no difference in sound between the right speaker being plugged in and it not being pluggedin.<br /><br />Unlike speakers I have had in the past the sub volume control not only effects the volume of the subwoofer but also the amount of sub in the 2 satallites. Franky it could be really nice or really anoyying depending on how you like your sound. For me having the bass down means someone is sleeping, not that I want to void all things below a certain frequenzy.<br /><br />Pros: Price to sound, sounds pretty good overall. Its sub-w is small so it fits into smaller locations. The sub being only 20W makes it sound you can definitly hear all of the different frenquenzys of whatever you are doing without being anoyying if you are in a dorm room or live with alot of other people.<br /><br />Cons: The cords between speaker and sub are kindof short which makes it a little difficult to settup if u have more the one monitor, the stretch will be difficult. The audio 2 didn't work for me unless there is a special way of setting it up in which you can use it that I dont know of (in that case leave me a comment please).  Also that the right speaker was broken and a replacement had to be sent.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Its okay, but for the money you could probably get the same sound out of a logitech set althought it looks cool and does deliver sound. Im not a fan of the way the bass is adjusted from both sub-w and the top speakers alike.  Depending on your settup and your preference on sound, it could be just what you need. But for the more vivid gamers it lacks the punch, and the drop from your dubstep music :P
R3H1J6GFPZQNUW	2	I was having to many delays when using this in my camera. When it was working it was fine. But the mnin continue sliding out saying it was full when I know it was not.
RJJ7BHVW8GXA6	1	This does not work with windows 8.1 and above.
R1R2F8EMJT4T5A	1	Great concept. If only it were more reliable. It works sometimes. This is my second one. I will try a different reader next time.
R2PASOZLF8XNQO	1	PRICE WAS RIGHT. BUT EVEN OUT OF THE BOX THE CHARGE ONLY LASTED 60 MINUTES. GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH THIS PURCHASE. CHEAP PRICE WORKS MOST TIME, BUT NOT WITH THIS PRODUCT.
R144UG1JRZW5SE	4	Like many, I had high hopes for the Kindle Fire and after using it for a few days, here are my first impressions and why I had to end-up returning it.<br /><br />Size:  I really like the size, it fits into my hands well and can comfortably hold it in one hand.  (unlike the iPad).  It can easily fit into some of my coat pockets.  I would expect that next generations Fire's will be thinner and lighter, which still has a way to go.<br /><br />Color screen:  Colors are vibrant and good resolution, but not HD quality yet....<br /><br />Software issues:  The biggest aggravation I had with the Kindle is the total system lock.  The Kindle would \\"FREEZE\\" on me at least once everytime I used it.  It would become completely non-responsive, to the touch screen or anything....just plain frozen.  The only way to unfreeze it was to do a hard shut down.  That was very aggravating and the primary reason wny I had to return it.<br /><br />Video Freezing:  Similar to the total device freezing, the video would also completely freeze on me 1-2 minutes into a video.  I have one of the latest Belkin N routers designed for wireless video, so I don't believe that's the problem.  But in any case, I could not complete a single video without complete freezing up.<br /><br />Apps:  Disappointed with the selection of the Apps....<br /><br />Also, too much of the experience seemed more about how I can spend more money on Amazon and less about delighting me with an outstanding experience.  This is opposite of teh Apple model.<br /><br />I am a big Amazon fan, Prime customer etc....and really wanted the FIRE to be a better device, but it ultimately disappointed me with the overall user experience....I'm in a dilemma now....spend more money for an iPad, or wait for the next gen Fire?
R1IU4HTEVFJ5ZA	2	Product is pretty good, but a good product alone could never gain 5 stars without good documentations and fool-proof quick start guide. Fact is the document that comes with the product is worst than none.    Anyway, I set it up after quite some hack work. My old HP deskjet 970Cxi works great via the LPT port, but I could never get my HP LaserJet 1000 printing on the USB port of the print server. So if you have an HP laser USB type, beware!    Is there anybody who knows how to make HP LaserJet USB printer work with this print server? Please kindly give us some advise here!
R5UMNV10XZG1X	1	The cable is too short for my need (~6-7 ft.), as I usually don't work in rooms where I'm that close to a power outlet. Anything else works well for me.
R1A8EYJYTLMN20	2	It works fine. but no instructions.  Went online and found a company to contact for installiation.  Ended up costing a lot because company indicated extensive computer work on my computer was necessary to install.  It was a scam.  Watch out!  My credit card company helped me recover $800.00 of the amount spent.
R264IKE9X3QB11	2	Nice look, and features. Gave four stars because i find touch screen little less sensitive and there is transient initial lag in wireless key board and mouse function.
R3GQLNNAY6K4EQ	1	This device lacks personality.  All other tablet devices allow you to select a desk top scheme or use a personal photo.  That is what makes the device personal, and this would not have added to the cost factor.  Little things mean a lot.
R1FC4EICBQYSJE	2	During setup, my MV2020 hung up while doing a firmware upgrade, and then would no longer boot up. After a long period of dealing with phone support, they mailed me a new HDD. Cost me a trip to FedEx and a lot of time, but did not cure the problem. After another long phone support session, they sent me a new chassis. After moving the HDD into this unit, it would boot up, but now had a different problem with the HDD. After talking with phone support yet again, they sent me another HDD. This one worked, and I have finally been able to use my unit. Nearly all of this hassle could have been avoided had they just sent me another unit as I requested in the first phone call.    Anyway, after way too much time talking on the phone and shipping components back and forth, my MV2020 now works. Needless to say, I am a bit concerned about trusting it. Time will tell.
R6Y77EWHGZHWQ	2	Nice case, fits well and not heavy or bulky. Cute, too.  Edited Sept. 2015: I noticed in July that the fake leather of the case was cracking where it folds open, now in September its completely cracked and only the fabric backing is holding it together so it wobbly. I'll be needing to get a new case. I'd hoped this would last longer than six months.
RLY5IBB5O6TP6	2	Tablet is very responsive. Cameras didnt work correctly had upside down issue. contacted seller and said it was a system error. Would off loved to be able to replace so i can have a totally fuctioning tablet and would of rated 5 stars and good buy but i wasnt able to. They did help me thou and refunded me part of the total cost. Tablet came with all cables and they sent an extra gift in there which i was happy about. Packing was really good. Apps work well and tablet itself is really good maybe i got that one in 100  with a defect meaning the cameras. They both work but have a mirror upside down issue as said. Quality of cameras is same as other andrpid tablets so i wasnt really looking forward to using them. Arived before est time. Very fast as a matter of fact. Seller was helpfull and answerd my concern really quick. Seems like other people got working cameras so i would recommend.
R2OUJHI1OH70CE	2	This is a good product, but on one hand there are cheaper options, and on the other is a little big which made the installation more difficult with my WD TV Live Plus.  When trying to insert it into the back of the WDTV the adapter strikes on one side. I had to sand one side of the adapter to make it fit in.
RDGUKL4K1ANQS	1	I got a dud so I dont know how she will run, besides the backside having spotty laminant or whatever its called, the board was very nice and sturdy. there are plenty of fan placement for those wishing to use the mobo as a fan controller.   When I flipped the breaker and powered on the pc my Vid card didn't display so I freaked out of course and rolled the GFX to each pci slot and cycled each of the 4 monitors individually hoping it was a cord issue. So then either believing I had a GFX or PSU error I was upset and busted out an old gpu with low power reqs. Nothing. I then realized that the USB inputs on the board werent even powering my mouse and keyboard but everything connected to the PSU was powered the Green Powered light on mobo was engaged and one short beep upon start. The last PCI port had a RevoDrive SSD and it sequenced. I have requested exchange and will install new mobo on arrival. If anyone has any insight and why its something else. IF YOU CANT EXPLAIN WHY THE DRAW WOULD FALL SHORT, I dont want your two bit comments.  So No USB No ethernet indicators No GPU Display no RAM recognition.  Sounds Like board to me but If you know better   AMD FX 8120  Asus Sabertooth  16 gb Vengeance Ram 1600  OCZ 1000 watt VX   Radeon HD 6950 2bg Sapphire Dirt 3 ed  Corsair H100 6 fans   Aerocool Strike X   Samsung Blu ray   OCZ RevoDrive  WD Caviar Green  Corsair Graphite 600T with mesh I believe has plastic risers.
R2UMFWQUW7Q4OM	3	I occasionally work in a dim environment, so I bought these stickers for my laptop.  They DO stand out much better than my normal keyboard's lettering did and I was able to see my keys very well. They're fairly easy to apply if not a bit time consuming; I was able to remove and realign stickers if I didn't get it right the first time. If you're concerned, this did come with a sticker for every single key except my \\"Fn\\" button.<br /><br />That being said, I've had mine for a little over a month now and my frequently used key stickers are wearing out: 'A', 'E', 'C', and 'SHIFT' now have white spots on the keys.  Soon it's going to look silly and I'm going to have to peel them off and work on getting rid of the adhesive residue, which I don't look forward to.<br /><br />Long story short: great if you use it on a keyboard for moderate use. Not good if you use it for a work or student computer/laptop.
R1L0P82P38673W	1	Works okay under Arch Linux with the Dell XPS13. Kernel panics when monitor put into vertical orientation. Ubuntu 14.10 is very jerky.
R36NZI1PWRVTB0	1	Requires reboots randomly.  Appears to be connected but no downstream device can see the Internet until reboot.<br /><br />When it works, it's great, but when it doesn't its a pain to get back up.
R27TNMMZ0ZF61H	2	given its not a bad computer for the price however I am upset by the fact that it does not come with Microsoft Office and I'll have to pay extra for that also only had the computer for a few months now and the keys are little and responses sometimes I have to use an unusual amount of pressure to get the keys to respond again I did not pay a great deal of money for this computer but at the same time I was expecting a certain minimum standard
R23OQF57AW6NM7	3	the product itself is very solid, the clamp itself is adjustable to fit any thickness. the problem with the clamp tho, is the fact that it isnt padded. the bottom part that actually tightens is all metal. if there is any malformations onthe place that you are clamping on, i cannot say how well it will hold. the top portion of the clamp is padded, but barely. also, although the 4 section joint allows for most orientations, the up and down joint is limited by its own screws. the platform will never become a perfectly flat surface simply due to the fact that the screw that holds it in place is much to close to the arm. although it isnt a problem yet, this stand is better used to mount a screen rather than holding a laptop.
R23SLQH5Q81NK5	2	It's annoying that this datalink doesn't have software that saves your connection. I have to put in the password each time I restart my computer. Also, sometimes it randomly won't connect.
R1L6ZYW37K6A2M	2	Is slow at times, but quicker than the inconsistent one in my laptop when it is down. Seems to throttle down at times to a much slower speed, when others usually stay more consistent. But is small, range is ok and stays on all the time.
R2IQES70WNIZXK	4	I got this mouse because you can program buttons to do what you want. The mouse is nicely built but the sides slant inward towards the bottom, this causes my fingers to get tired or cramped. Someone with smaller hands may not have that problem, I got big hands.<br /><br />Now for the programming part. You can record your Macro and  include key strokes. The BAD thing is it runs the macro slow and misses steps. Before I got this mouse I was using Mouse X and I can tell a BIG difference on macro speed and Mouse X does NOT miss any steps in the macro. I am NOT trying to promote Mouse X, just telling the truth about the Macro feature of this mouse.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I am not sending it back is because it does work as a mouse just fine and I already threw my old one out. If you are a serious gamer and want a good mouse SKIP this one.
R17CJJMH2LEE1Y	2	I liked how it had a stand in the back, however the case did not fit properly. The button on the top right of the mini does not work when it's in the case and you cannot turn off your ipad
R3U9ZFQ19F6EOZ	2	i did not see much faster compared to my tab 3.  it's thicker and heavier than i expected (later generation compared to previous generation).  For surfing web and some simple tasks, it would not be bad.  The battery doesn't last long, just for your info
RZ7HJP4KKFCGM	1	Product was much like it was described but I discovered it's much slower than I envisaged for the 1GHz processor. seems the motherboard was much more worn than I thought.
R1C8I4ZWYLKMAJ	2	It's OK... yes, that's it.. no more.<br /><br />If you're looking for an ANDROID device,, it works.<br /><br />BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN LINUX BASE (ie UBUNTU...) NO!!!!!<br /><br />I took me more than 4 hours to make it run.. and... it's a very small Ubuntu, w/o wifi, if you want HDMI, so you dont have VGA, if you want WGA, so you don't have HDMI... SUCKS!<br /><br />No support, no drivers, nothing at all!!<br /><br />PLEASE MR VENDOR,,, respond mails!!! get some coverage to customers!! upgrade your platforma,,, respond blogs!!!
RQ5PQGY4HVTKS	3	I purchased this keyboard because I was looking for a moderately priced gaming keyboard. So far, It works just as well as any normal keyboard. There is nothing that stands out about this product that makes it for &#34;gaming&#34; though.<br /><br />I like that this keyboard is USB. I like dthat it is plug and play pretty much. Nothing special to getting it working. The different color keys are neat, but not really necessary fro an advanced user who has the keyboard memorized anyways.<br /><br />I did not like that the keys give the same push as a cheap keyboard from Walmart. I don't like the unusual shape of the keyboard. I dislike that the media keys are nearly impossible to distinguish from date of arrival.<br /><br />All in all, this is a decent STANDARD keyboard. It should not be advertised as gaming for any reason.<br /><br />Hope this review helps someone.
R1RD27530KAEP	3	Purchased this product April 2011 to replace a missing charger. Cheap compared to original chargers and initially serve its purpose. The charger suddenly bogged down and does not charge the IBM R61 laptop by the end of June 2011. The small green button that light up when charging is nowhere to be seen. A loose component inside the adapter can be heard when you shake the adapter. I wish the charger lasted for a year to get my money's worth. I do not recommend this product.
R1G4PHC1EJSQMB	3	I've had my kindle for 5 wks now, and have enjoyed the speed and easy access to new books. I have, however, also spend alot of time with the phone support trying to keep it connected to my wireless home system and keeping the battery charged. I've had it plugged in for more than 30 hrs now and the battery still isn't charged. I'm starting to get tired of this.
R29VYMB1ZNDEME	2	This product is good but hardly worth the price.A lot of flex and made of very cheap plastic.If you are not careful removing the tablet from case per instructions it will tear the tablet case apart.Its so bad I would only let a adult do it and even then the middle grabs the tablet right where the halves of the tablet meet.Terrible design flaw in my opinion.Other then this and its huge it seem to be ok keyboard and blue tooth connection.update.added one star as child has used for few weeks now and its still going.the above mentioned issue is still a big issue but figure most people wont be removing the tablet from case and if you do,do it carefully and be sure to lift middle edge of case off tablet at top and sides,instructions say only lift at side edges.this is when it grabs tablet at seem.
R3S9NDV31MTITD	1	For the price I guess I couldn't ask for more. I bought this for my daughter so she can have a little tablet, but honestly it's slow. My Galaxy S II is faster and more reliable. I wouldn't buy this again. Next time I buy a tablet, I'll just cough up the money and get the Galaxy TAB.
R2NUQWKFVPMAXI	1	Don't bother to spend the extra $20 for the ad free version.  Amazon still pushes books at the bottom of the first screen.  I was especially excited to see the &#34;teenage&#34; suggestions since I haven't been a teenager in many many years.  Ad free is very misleading.
R3T371M7SYYDG6	1	It's clear alright - colored is better. I found out that it has a long STAIN from my Orange iPad Cover.
R3J0W3CXK5JOTA	3	The tablet is really nice, nice design, but slow.<br />The camera isn't nice and sound isnt as good as expected.
RG3UNGMRM7BGL	3	Was curious about cheap Chinese unbranded tablets. I also needed a GPS devise. I cant say that this is the best of both world device, but I will admit it is a good GPS with android tablet functionality. The screen is probably its biggest setback. It is hard to see in direct sunlight, basically hard to see on the dash board of my truck during the daylight hours in Arizona. Probably would be better off some where else. That is a drawback of the large screen. It also comes with a stylus, that you will not want to loose. The screen doesn't do to well with simple finger taps like a more costly touch screen devices. I wish there was Windows Driver so that i could root Android and get rid of some of the crap on it. That would probably help some with running apps.Tried a couple of games on it. It did ok i guess for a gps device.<br /><br />Pros: Cheap GPS on an android tablet.<br />Cons: See Pros.
R1M223ZH9UNFNN	1	It is definitely brings a cool look to the laptop, but the size was way bigger than the one shown in the picture.
R2FULOHEO2G5W5	2	The case provides protection for the tablet, and works as described. But there are shortcomings: rotary function is not good. Tablet cover comes off from the outer case very easily (held by a very loose button) and that means the tablet might not stay in the case. Also, the case is very thick and heavy, which makes the tablet holding a workout. Auto sleep/ wake function works fine, but the cover won't stay closed without the elastic. Overall, an okay product, but not the easiest to use.
RL1VRCSI33A84	3	I bought this adapter as a replacement for my daughter's L355-S7915 Toshiba laptop.  The original adapter had come apart at the edge of the stress relief for the laptop plug.  This one works perfectly fine to charge the laptop, but, despite being listed as a replacement for this laptop, it isn't what I would have chosen to use if I'd seen it in person before purchasing.  This is because, while the actual connector itself fits the laptop, and the adapter does charge the laptop as well as the old, the plastic shield around the connector is not the same diameter as the original.  It is actually smaller.  This is a problem because that plastic barrel fits into the outer edge of the laptop case's charging port, providing a snug fit that keeps the plug firmly in place.  With the smaller size of this replacement's connector, it actually wiggles around in the opening when plugged, and may be placing excess stress on the actual electrical connector inside the laptop.  Further, care has to be taken that it doesn't simply fall out of the laptop, as only the electrical connector is holding it in place, unlike with the factory original power supply plug.<br /><br />So, it works as intended to charge this laptop, and is relatively inexpensive. But it doesn't fit very securely into the laptop's charging port, so care must be taken when using it to ensure it stays connected and that the port doesn't become damaged.
R48QUBTFMPZ95	2	it is one of the few stands that will hold iPad with a smart cover on iPad. Not as stable as it could be but compact and so travels well.  no idea what velcro strips were for.  takes way to long to arrive.  one month is ridiculous.
RRS86XDY82A6K	4	My boyfriend, a serious doctor who fan and iphone user, ABSOLUTELY loves this cell phone case! the graphics decent. Although i wish it was not just a decorative case and actually added some protection for the phone! if they could find a way to make that change and improve the case then i will give it 5 stars!<br /><br />ok so update! the case broke... the edging shattered when the phone was dropped on to carpet. ?!@#$? really?
R2N15MZWSQO8A5	2	OK switch for the price.  I like the metal case and wall mounting holes on the back.  My only complaint is that it would not drive 100 feet of Cat 6 cable.  I changed out two of the switches for a DLink product, and though I still was not able to get 1G speeds down the 100 feet, at least I did get 100MB/s data rates.
R2TDKKL5C6IWQ2	1	I put this on my iPad, followed the instructions down to the T. iPad was brand new, right out of the box. There are two bubbles that I can't get rid of. Instructions stated it will go away In a few days. It's been 3 and still there. Would recommend but hopefully You have better luck installing than me.
R26Z9EB35H2PIZ	4	This worked well for a three level 4000 sf guest house 500 feet away on our apple farm -- once I finally got it configured. I bought two, and it was a good thing, since one failed intermittently to connect, resulting in many hours on the phone with clueless tech support people who knew even less about networking than I do, and have such thick Indian accents that words sometimes had to be spelled out. The configuration Wizard often failed to recognize the repeater, requiring a temporary complex reconfiguring of Windows LAN settings (if you don't understand these settings, you may not get it to work).     I connected one antenna input to a directional antenna [[ASIN:B000B59J8I Hawking HiGain Directional Antenna, indoor/outdoor, 14dBi HAO14SDP]] to get the signal from the source router (Encore brand), and left one omnidirectional original for the house. The install was on a 1.5 Mbit DSL line, and both houses now have full speed internet throughout, for a mix of Windows, Mac and iPhone clients.    While this Hawking repeater does work, if you don't need two external antenna inputs, there are simpler and more reliable solutions. If you have an Apple Airport router, you can get the Airport Express router/repeater, which requires no configuration at all, and just works.
R2UG3E6DHB7WNX	1	This is the second asus I had die on me within a week of getting it. The first showed up sorta DOA (repeated blue screens of death out of the box). ASUS is usually really good but 2 dud's in a row so I'm looking elsewhere for my next gaming machine.
R2UQZNHK680N04	1	Used it backup all of our data from a laptop and from a network drive at school.<br />Works fine - has the standard USB cable, but has the newer USB 3.0 connector on the HD drive side.
R16B0GHYBK7ZK1	1	We like the case and it protects the iPad but the back holder broke already and we only have it for a month, that is the only thing we are not happy about. So now we can't get it to stand.
R2QY16ZGAJ73WB	5	There are many aesthetically fanciful covers out there but casecrown ipad2 cover is simple and does the job. The speaker and back camera hole is an advantage over those without.    What compels me to buy is the lightweight, very important for me as i will be carrying it everyday. Of course, lightweight means a sacrifice on sturdiness. It will be obvious when you try to make it stand horizontally. It won't be as stable as those heavy duty covers. It will fall if you tap with a little pressure.    Another thing that can be improved on is the magnet. It isn't strong enough and will sometimes flip open when u hold the cover with the flab facing downwards.     Protection wise, it will do a good job except for the corners. It will probably save your ipad2 from a few falls but if it lands on the corners, things might turn out differently. Personally not an issue to me as i'm using this as a primary cover, and another secondary cover (belkin pleated) when i need to keep my ipad2 in my bag or when i expect some rough handling.    To be fair, it is a good cover with full ipad2 functionalilty incorporated in its design. The velcro strip at the insert side will keep your device snugly in place without having to worry that it will drop out.    It isn't perfect, but it is very well worth the price!
R10LILLSXV0XYJ	3	The fan itself is great but the usb ports in the back are a very poor design.  I've had quite a few laptop coolers and they all failed me because of the usb cords they would always bend at the end.  I thought this one would be better but this time it wasn't the cord it was ports.  The usb cord plugs in from the back and the wide part sticks out so when I placed it down at angle it broke.  I tried to take the fan apart so I can retrieve the broken part and to clean the fans (I have two dogs and there was some fur in there) but there are hidden screws that you cant get to without poking a hole between the power and A/M button and underneath the rectangle where it tells you the temperature of your laptop.  It could have been designed better, if the ports were farther back (only the cord is visible from top view and not the wide part) and being able to take it apart without ruining the appearance.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you are really careful with it
R1SY2IRVA5T1Z8	1	i encountered no problems with SD and SDHC cards, but with a 64GB SDXC card this adapter only reported a 32GB capacity.  A different SDHC reader correctly reported 64GB.  So if you plan to use SDXC cards, you may have problems.
R1D1LU09QFEVQD	1	It worked well but it sticks out a decent bit and I broke it quickly
R3CDK84MKK6GUH	2	Much too fragile and easily broken--stressed when it was bumped from its location on the back of my computer. It's working (kind of surprising) but have had to jury-rig the USB plug where it connects to the antenna to keep the connection reliable.
R2GJLFZQSRA6FA	1	It is okay. I have already had one issue after only a week of use. I was really careful with the wires, but they accidentally slipped out of the grooves and they ended up wear out after a couple of races and now the steering wheel no longer works. This seems to be a design flaw personally I think it should be made different.
RF07E1IZSY58A	0	Inconsistent
R2Q0VJ2ZCX8H51	0	I love it but it was not working good
R3M5BT39D6S6W1	1	Very nice!! Came fast just when u turn it off at the top it doesn't sleep and comes back on. Came new!
R1SLZ6VXZCK2DD	1	I had the previous generation, it suddenly decided to stop working on one side of the screen one day. It was out of warranty, so i had to send the old one in to purchase a refurbished one at $78.<br /><br />It is not a big difference from the previous version, improvements are barely visible. I wish they had made better quality kindles so it would not suddenly stop working on one side of the screen, and i would not need to pay again. $21 usd discounted from $99 to $78 is not a lot of help to me, considering i bought mine new at $119.<br /><br />Kinda feel i have been ripped off, but nevertheless, i enjoy reading on my kindle Paper white, i hope you guys have more luck then me on your Kindles.
R1023GKWTWLQPP	1	Meh, it's not what it says it is.  Low quality for a low price. Lesson learned.<br /><br />Also? It's light purple, not hot pink.
REMLWI30ASTWB	3	I want to give 3.5 stars.<br /><br />[Good]<br />- I dont need my labtop anymore<br />- Wifi works totally fine<br />- easy to use<br />- many good options(I dont actually need all of thme bczu I only use this for PDF and internet things)<br />- GPS, so you can track yours when stolen or lost<br />- Enough space for all my e-book and music... and you can get more space by purchasing the $14~20 flash memory card<br />- I want to strongly recommand people to buy galaxy-tab2-bluetooth-keyboard which makes this product even cooler<br /><br />[Bad]<br />-Battery doesnt stay that long.<br />If you want to use this for a long time that samsung mentioned \\"Music Playback (Up to 77 Hours), Video Playback(Up to 6 Hours\\", you have to turn off all the options such as wifi, bluetooth, sound, light(minimum), and GPS.<br /><br />-Also, the screen sometimes stops or move slow for a while (like 0.2~0.5 seconds but it's annoying)<br /><br />I havn't used other tablet so I can't really compare with, but I wouldn't surely recommand my friend to buy this.
R1G4Z8S5815Q6U	2	I was looking for a sleeve big enough to hold my Nexus 7 while it was in the thin TPU case and have some room to spare for accessories. The case is quite sturdy and the stand tabs are interesting but not supportive enough to hold my tablet in portrait mode. The fit is very snug and the tablet doesn't move around. I was expecting a more useful accessory pocket. The picture shows a charger cable sticking out of it, and that does fit without too much difficulty, however trying to put my charging adapter in there too was a no-go. I'd be concerned about ripping the neoprene and possibly damaging the tablet with something bulky pressing on it for an extended period. For the price this does enough of what I need. I have another small pack to carry my accessories in that this sleeve fits into, but I was hoping for an all-in-one solution.
R2R1LJOVTPNLOC	0	You get what you pay for.
R314HM1FHK2SXY	1	Love the design, but I quess I was expecting something more or something thicker.  I was not expecting something I peel off of a piece of paper and stick onto my Kindle.  However, I guess that is a vinyl skin.  Do not expect anymore for $20.
R15TRQSZ19RB0H	1	This product worked as expected for the first five minutes.  The cable is very flexible and therefore hard to guide to the right spot without attaching something to stiffen it.  After five minutes of use, the LED lights quit working and never worked again.  I will be returning it for a refund.
RRX1LVO49RDRJ	2	Nice cover.  The problem I have with it is the hands-free feature.  My Nook HD won't stay in the grooves...it only takes a little jostle to cause my nook to fall.
R1TPIGTQWAOSTO	1	Nice concept!  However, if you have the new style outlets (rectangular), then these will NOT screw to the existing mount.  You will have to remove the new outlet and replace it with an older style with the center screw mount.  The new outlets are mounted with two screws, one at top & one at bottom.  Seems like I remember the electrician saying the new style is called Endura, but I could be wrong.
R3AO41BERJJMUT	2	I gave this tablet ultimately to my daughter and got me a nexus 7 instead.  Here is why.  This tablet is good but it is slow and I mean noticeably slow.  I am used to Asus tablets and I have had great experience with them, I have a Samsung S3 and love it, but this tablet is just slower than anything.  It looks good, feels good, but it is a good starter tablet if you ask me.  Also, the 8gb of ram is definitely a constraint.  Believe me, you will fill that up quick.  Again, not a bad buy, just keep in mind there are other tablets that are better.
RH510XB4TPIBB	1	I have purchased this item in the past as a spare to take along with me to school, etc. and it usually lasts about a year before failing.  I use it every day and frequently plug and unplug the unit.  This one lasted about four months before one of the components needed to be replaced. The converter gets abnormally hot compared to the OEM, but for the money it is certainly worth considering.  I would buy it again.
R2ZK4402RXEYZI	1	I originally bought this for my kids' kindles.  The first set was defective. I was sent a replacement set by the vendor and they are stronger.  I wish the plastic plug covers were more solid.
R38L594XEB3V	2	This is a smart, sturdy cover for the kindle with a very convenient reading light.  Having an integral light means that you have a light as long as the kindle is charged and prevents the occasion arising of forgetting to charge a light.  However, there are a couple of drawbacks: 1. At 200 grams the cover just about doubles the weight of the kindle and 2. the light might drain the kindle battery more rapidly than desirable.
RA9DO1CVUFEJD	3	I needed a lightweight, inconspicuous day bag to carry a Fujifilm X100s and and iPad throughout Europe. This bag fills the order, but only just. There is ample padding in the main pocket, where I choose to keep the camera. It is well protected, and there is a smaller pocket inside, also padded that holds my passport, kindle and wallet. Would be perfect for an iPad mini, but I choose to carry my 4th gen Retina instead, for its larger screen for basic photo editing. Herein lies a problem: there is an additional pocket at the rear of the bag, perfectly sized and padded for a full-size ipad, but lacking the very crucial padding AT THE BOTTOM. The back and front are padded, but there is nothing but a thin layer of nylon and canvas separating your ipad from the ground should you set it down too hard, or if the very weak strap should fail.<br /><br />Second problem: this bag is very cheaply made. I realize that the price justifies this, but I believe that everyone would pay a few dollars more for this bag made with better materials, and with padding in the iPad pocket. Also I could do without the very bad fake leather patch on the front. If you aren't going to use real leather, don't pretend, you aren't fooling anyone.<br /><br />In conclusion, the basic design and size of this bag are outstanding, would easily pay thrice this price for a bag of this design, made with better quality materials and craftsmanship.
R99Q4QUZCTFCB	1	This thing is called scratch resistant but I'm sorry to say the first time I placed it in my bag it became scratched and looked as though I've had it for years
R29SXF0KW8YULZ	2	I was a bit disappointed by the cover... the color of the one I got in the mail is darker than the color in the picture. Also, the little hook things that hold the Kindle in place scratched my Kindle :( Overall I guess it protects it from drops, etc. I just wish it hadn't scratched it up!
R2DULV7YFGJJWC	1	Could have been better. The material is not that great. Regardless its a good case. Its a little big for my 13 inch so dont expect tight fitting.
R1Q2B20G96M0LP	2	This tablet Pc with external dock seemed great at the beginning. I use it normally at school to take notes and some internet surfing at home. Tablet works great alone and keyboard did function well. I have a case for it and it was always safe in my backpack and somehow the keyboard connection was broken, as it only works when I push the screen back to force a connection. Still a decent tablet but seems like a cheaply made keyboard
R3FDLU6YC9F532	1	Of the ten ports one works.  Yep, nothing but a usb extension cord.  Don't waste your money.  Added later:  The company did contact me to attempt to address the issue.  For that, I'll give them an additional star.  They replaced the unit, I have to give another for that.  The issue ends up being a flaw in the design.  Host system goes to sleep and so does the usb.  Stupid design.  They did send a replacement.  It's still in the box and I have no intentions of using it.  I have a different brand that meets all expectations.  Personally, I won't buy another.
RDAKLMZP7YKLS	1	It is nice, but the strap is not confortable, and you cannot put alot things inside
R2704YK6A4A502	2	Functions fine with my Galaxy S5, fast access. The activity LED is a bit obnoxious, especially when viewing a stored video. Ended up taping over it to help subdue the glare.
R26UTHU1VQUSVU	2	I like the key board except for one flaw. This flaw alone drove me crazy and would never buy another one until this flaw is fixed.<br />The space key is so low and is activated only if you press it down enough. The front guard prevents you from pressing down enough unless you turn your thumb down and consciously press it thereby losing your rhythm in typing. I had to tape a couple of thick paper on the space bar to make it work.
R2HIHHLOJYVRHE	2	I like this laptop bag...except not enough room for power cord. The memory foam is a nice feature to protect my 15\\" Dell
RR11RNWCRJ332	1	This mount is plenty heavy duty for the two 22 inch monitors I have attached.  It's fairly easy to make quick, minor adjustments, but the entire system (not the post on which the arms attach) hangs to the one side with no way to properly adjust or compensate.  It's functional as is, but every time I sit/stand at my adjustable height desk, my OCD begs for me to figure out a way to straighten the monitor arms.
R3PXRI86LQWYRS	1	I love this tablet, but I would not have bought it if I had known it would not support Adobe Flash player, which I need it to do for many of the things I bought it for. I thought I had done my homework on all the specs, but I'm very sorry I missed this.
R749HCUM3BLYI	3	I loved this MacBook cover until the rubber feet started falling off.  One I was able to stick back on, but then it fell off again and was lost.  Then another came loose and keeps falling off and I am sure it will disappear sometime soon.  Now my laptop is out of balance and rocks while I use it, which is super annoying.<br /><br />Otherwise, all ports that I have needed are accessible, the case snaps on cleanly and looks nice and is unobtrusive.  I do find that the edge of the case that hits my wrists does irritate somewhat, so if the feet had not fallen off I would have given 4 stars, only subtracting for that reason.  Also, fingerprints become visible over time, but I don't mind that so much.  It does a good job protecting the surface of my laptop.  I don't think it would do much to protect it from an impact, but it does a good job for scratches. I have the light green and love the color.
R24EXAE7DM9RV5	2	8/4/14<br />I bought this for my Yoga 2 Pro.<br />Pros<br /><br />It is easy to apply and the whole process took me around 20 minutes. If you do not get it perfectly on the first time you can try again. The hardest piece to get on is the keyboard piece. I really like the feel of it and the edges do not seem to dog ear and peal off.<br /><br />Cons<br />It seems to have many redundant pieces. I did not put the piece for the actual laptop screen on. I think that piece looks ugly, but that is personal preference. The bottom and back piece seem to peel where the laptop hinges are. I put a little piece of tape along the edge and it works fine. I would really like it that didnt happen for ascetic reasons, but i can live with it.
RBUKGZ2VLOIOC	3	The case is fantastic, does exactly what I bought it to do, covers my macbook nicely although the bottom part of the case doesn't cover the back corners of my macbook pro which isn't very good because they will be the first to get scratched if anything is to happen. The colour is lovely and just what I wanted. Reason for the low review is because of the seller, they sent me the wrong product at first, it was the wrong colour and size. However they did send me the right one free of charge I just had to wait a few more weeks to get it. All in all lovely product that is worth the money considering it is protecting a $3000+ machine.
R3K2KXSVNG05TK	2	What it does do is enable you to save everything but games, and games are the main thing i wanted to get saved for my ps3, so make sure you listen to me when i say if you are planning to buy this to create more room on your PS3 just to save Digitally bought games then you have made a big mistake. Up side is you can save tons of movies on it.
R1DK0FQM97YBMT	1	Very fast shipping and good price. use this for work . Don't use it everyday. there is only one machine that use this kind of cable but works good.
R35L6R5L4O8QPX	1	These are OEM drives with NO FACTORY WARRANTY.<br /><br />Amazon did not allow my original review, because they said my review wasn't about the item, but when the item is advertised as an Enterprise Drive (meaning a five year factory warranty) and that's NOT WHAT YOU GET, then I AM reviewing the product.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
R6SGROF6RB55G	2	This case is everything others have said in their reviews.  A good case that does what it should.  However, it is NOT leather! It's made out of a smelly, rubbery material.<br /><br />Why lie?  The case is a good case otherwise.  It's very sturdy and will protect your iPad.  Just don't expect leather for 15 bucks!
R1PZM8RB6FLJZC	4	I bought this Monitor after mine started to go bad and the DVI input on it completly died.  Old monitor was a Dell Perfect Sharp 24\\" IPS LCD. I went with this Samsung after i listened to people that a TN LCD had a faster refresh rate and was better for gaming and the off axis viewing difference was negligable.....  going from an IPS to a TN, i feel they are wrong... IPS is FAR superior to a TN, and i wish i woulda saved up some money a lil longer and gone with an IPS display, but oh well...    As for this monitor, while the screen is rather nice and quite large, i think it makes a better TV then a monitor. Lack of any height adjustments, no tilt and no swivel makes this kinda hard on a person for a desktop. That is my biggest complaint, as my old Dell i could tilt, swivel, pivot, flip to portrait and adjust height to my hearts content, while this one is in one position and one position only. granted the 8 years ago that old dell cost me $1200 and this cost me just under $350 i should expect a lil downgrade in features. Also i think on a screen this size the 1920x1080 isnt quite high enough for a PC and when sitting this close to it... i woulda prefered a lil higher resolution, but that could just be me.    I know im a lil rough on this monitor, but the screen really is quite nice, in some websites if the background color is a lil different in color then the usual black or white, i can notice the off axis shading. But its really not that bad, and more of that is cuz of how my desk is set up and the monitor sits on a lil shelf on my desk.  Half-Life 2 looks pretty amazing on this screen, and Beta testing Rift looks quite awesome too. I'm using the VGA plug since this didnt come with a DVI cable (i will be changing that tho), and text looks just fine to me.    So in conclusion    Pro: price, size of screen, screen does look quite nice, comes with a remote.    Con: TN just doesnt quite measure up to an IPS screen, complete lack or ergonomic controls, 1080p resolution might be a lil low for a PC and a screen of this size.      I think this is better suited as a TV with the option of hooking up a PC, then as a PC Monitor with TV inputs.
R2U17K91RHGF7X	1	I ordered a Dell 1707FPT. I received the correct monitor. They sent the incorrect stand. The stand does fit the 1707 FPT, but it is not the correct stand that goes with this monitor. The correct stand is an adjustable height stand, which swivels, and it says 1707 FPT.  The stand they sent me is a fixed stand, that doesn't swivel. The monitor looks and works great! But the adjustable height stand which swivels is an important feature that was expected. If I were to receive the correct stand from the seller I would happily give them five stars.
R3OW2QJQZMFGLL	2	This does keep the heat at bay for awhile, but if you have your notebook on your lap for hours as I do, the heat does eventually start coming through.  it's better than nothing, but not sure if there might be a better product out there.
R36DM7YTBAR0VU	3	I'd read all the good reviews and thought this light would improve on the one I have, the [[ASIN:B002HIE10S M-Edge e-Luminator2 Kindle Booklight]].  My light was giving a bit of a hot-spot where the bulb reflected on the screen and I'd have to reposition to get good even light.  So when the Kandle got rave reviews, I ordered one.<br /><br />My first impression out of the box- shoddy materials.  Something is going to break soon. Both lights match the Kindle beautifully, but that's where the similarity ends.  Where the e-Luminator is solid and sturdy, the Kandle feels like a cheap plastic clip.  It's TOO lightweight.  The clip itself feels like it could snap off and so does the folding part of the light.<br /><br />It DOES clips solidly to the Kindle.<br /><br />I was initially extremely disappointed in the amount of light, but decided to try it with the spare batteries which came with mine (but apparently do not come with all Kandles.)  Unfortunately, the battery compartment requires a jeweler's screwdriver, which didn't come with the Kandle, so that took some doing.  However, replacing the batteries did brighten the light considerably.  It was good that it came with the batteries as they are not a common household type but rather the flat watch-type battery CR 2032.  Not uncommon but not something I keep at home, either.<br /><br />Even brighter, though, the light is much less even than the e-Luminator light.  It diminishes as you go down the page, and you can't reposition the light without having it glare in your eyes.  It just doesn't raise high enough off the page- bad design.<br /><br />Also annoying is that if you do want to try to move the clip, you must first close the light.<br /><br />The switch is hard to operate.  It, too, feels like it will likely break off soon.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very disappointed.  I gave it a three overall though I really feel like giving it a two because it hasn't broken YET despite how it feels.  And it does fit the Kindleand light up.
RL8LU0R04U0V9	0	Seems as no one like the new configuration. Not a show stopper but a definite consideration to see if others may be more suitable to your taste.
R1U2MO26HZ39NN	1	Just as good as any other usb cord works on my mac and cannon printer no issues seems good quality
R2IN0MA3TLN16Q	2	I've been coveting this case for a while now, and only recently had a chance to get one shipped to me in Thailand. I have a Speck &#34;satin&#34; shell on my 11 inch Air, and although the fit is a bit snug, I can get the laptop with the shell on it in this sleeve. I think over time, the sleeve will stretch enough to make the fit a bit better.<br /><br />I love everything about the case except the fact that the velcro strip that holds the sleeve shut is already starting to peel off from the right side. I've only owned the sleeve a week and have only used it a handful of times. I'm sure Amazon would replace it, but I have no way of returning this case and receiving a replacement in Thailand, so now I just have to pray it holds together for the rest of my bicycle tour. C'est la vie.
R20SRJE4B1BJOE	1	Product shipped fast. Card looks legit, but after doing a few test I am very suspicious. Card reads at 8-9mbps access speed with a size of 14.90gigs of storage.  I have noticed some issues with pictures not being stored properly with a camera app that requires a Class 10 card.<br /><br />If you need a cheap card that you don't need to trust with wedding photos or catching bigfoot on camera this card will work for you.
R1XT9XEH5O5BDP	3	Looks pretty.Works as it should. Priced well. Touch function works well.  Somewhat slow(I guess OK for the price).  Touchgate with the three floating desktop screens is a dumb distraction and does not add any functionality.   WORST OF ALL,the pen writing in the tablet mode (which was the main reason I bought this tablet)DOES NOT WORK, as the palm touch input is not blocked.This NEEDS to be fixed, including updated software for those of us who bought it without knowing this serious deficiency.  And the User Manual (paper as well as oline) is virtually useless. Does not give any info or suggestions on using the various functions unique to this tablet.     CK
RG6V1WQIYAOEF	4	I bought a Speck case for my 2010 MBP.  A couple of weeks later, I bought an Incase hardshell, and sold the Speck case.  The price was about $20 more for the Incase, but it was well worth it and I'll explain why.      There are a couple of issues with the Speck case.  First, the Macbook Pro uses the aluminum as a way to dissipate heat.  That is why the bottom of the case gets hot.  That's also why the MBP is so quiet, because it doesn't need 3-4 fans like a PC laptop.  People that complain about the bottom of the MBP getting hot seem to not understand this key concept.  On the bottom of the Speck case, you can see prefabbed slots that are there for ventilation.  However, only the slots on the left corner are \\"drilled\\" all the way through.  This makes no sense.  Yes, the left back side of the MBP does get hotter, but why have prefabbed holes etched in the plastic, but only have 25% of them actually usable?      Second, the bottom part of the Speck case attaches in 4 places.  When you look at your MBP upright, and in use, the Speck will clip onto the front left and right sides next to the palmrest areas.  The Speck case also clips at the back right and left corners.  That's great and it's fine if you have a 13\\", but on a 15\\" when you flip over your MBP and look at the Speck case attached to the MBP there most likely will be \\"bowing\\" along the whole backside where the hinge is.  Plenty of dust and debris can creep up between the Speck case and the bottom of the MBP. The fit is just not snug.    Incase on the other hand solves both of these problems.  Incase has vents that go across the ENTIRE bottom/backside.  Therefore the MBP can vent properly.  Second, the Incase bottom doesn't clip on the back corners, instead it's got one large clip that clips across the entire hinge on the back of the MBP.  This eliminates the \\"bowing\\" and thus makes the bottom of the case fit better than Speck.    Another thing, the rubber feet on the Speck case are made of plastic.  When you'reusing your MBP on a smooth surface, it will slide around.  The Incase has rubber feet.  I haven't had any issues with my MBP sliding around (I put it on a Ikea laptop stand that I can bend at a 30 degree angle, and it still stays put).    One last thing.  The inside of the Speck case is rough and the one I ordered had a few sharp pieces of plastic that weren't shaved down.  I had to sand them down for fear of scratching the metal of my MBP.  Incase on the other hand has a smooth surface on the inside which is the same as the surface on the outside.      Yes Incase cost a bit more, but trust me (I've had both), it's well worth the extra investment.
RUCUI8FTFZR6Z	1	This skin is beautiful but it was a bit too big for my Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display. I had to cut off the edges for it to fit, and now they aren't smooth .
R3PPXW6S5Q3F4Y	1	Other than reformatting the laptop because win8 is terrible the laptop is good for basic web searches and such.  Do not expect a super computer because it is not such.  The good is that it has a super easy to the touch keyboard and the screen has pretty good brightness and also good resolution.
R34MYEDGZY5JJ0	2	Product performance (keyboard) is good. I am no so satisfied with its physical design however, i find the leather case oversized by about half inch on both left and right sides in relation to the tablet. It is also about 1-1/4\\" thick when closed making it even thicker than many laptops and netbooks that were recently released. Back camera hole is a bit offset with the camera.
R1ZG8MPO3XSATV	2	First of all, I'll start by saying that the I haven't had any reliability or data problems with this cable at all.  As far as I can tell, it does the job it's supposed to.  Having said that, I have two complaints that bring my rating down to three stars.  My first (and primary) complaint is that it doesn't connect snugly.  I'm using it on a laptop, and moving the laptop around can cause the cable to come out far enough for the connection to be lost.  And I'm not talking about major shifts here; just having it connected while using the laptop in bed can occasionally result in a lost connection.  The cable that came with my external drive had a metal jacket around the connection, and this problem never happened even once with that cable.  If you plan to use this cable on a desktop computer, this probably won't be a problem for you, but I've stopped using the cable entirely because of this.  The second complaint is that the Firewire logo is on the BOTTOM of the connector.  Once you figure it out it's not really a big deal, but that a manufacturer could do this in the first place doesn't leave me feeling very confident in the product.  Added to the first problem, it seems to indicate a lack of thought being put into this cable's design.
R3HNNZD0LPE3DI	2	Got it today and I'm already dealing having some minor issues. One, the charger won't my tablet so I had to use my phone charger. Two, it turned itself off on its own. Three, its hard to tell if its charging (shows an empty red battery) unless you have it on.<br />I'm not gonna but when I play some games it kinda laggy, but the price I got it for I kinda don't mind.
R3GJVT145O2QY6	3	I installed Ubuntu 14.04 by using an external USB DVD-RW drive without any problem. The computer is pretty fast while I was running Hadoop 2.2.0 with pseudo-distributed mode. However, this Zotac box is very noisy. Its fan sometimes surges with actually no heavy cpu load. This is an experience I never got even for my old full size desktop PC with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 cpu. I wish the new Apple Mac Mini could have a 4-core Intel i7 cpu.
R2Z1HD2PUTUV1K	2	the cover is very easy to apply and does look great but it does affect the resolution and if you're trying to read, the words do get slightly blurrier which I was not a fan of.  so either you have the screen protector with anti-glare and slightly blurry words, or you deal with no screen protector and a strong glare.....it's preference really.
R1H1MQOBHL26TO	3	This headset is ok at first I used it for about a month and then it stopped working and I was furious. But all i did was mess around with the wires a bit and they worked fine just the quality sucks if you get anywhere near the wires.I hardly touched them and they came out but in the end it is a good headset. I play a lot of games and my main is CS:GO and I can hear people clear across the map and the bass is pretty good on these too. The microphone sucks my built in mic on my all in one pc has better quality but you really shouldn't be looking for a mic in a headset anyway. I should be giving these a two but i give it a three star being because they are comfortable and sturdy with decent sound good value headset, but watch out with the cheap parts on it.
R2DNOUNIU876ZN	2	For photos, it is great! Speed seems fine and it stores a ton!<br /><br />My only concern is with the HD video from my t2i. It seems that ever since I got this card, when recording video on it, my camera will sometimes stop recording automatically. Some error message pops up stating it is stopping, and then after a few seconds it lets you record again. Sometimes it does it again, sometimes it doesnt. I may be wrong in assuming, but it seems the camera may be writing at faster speeds than the card can handle. Not sure if this is the case or not, but yeah. Just something to be aware of. And who knows, maybe I got a bad card.
R3N3PRBFFM64ZN	2	My only real complaint about this mouse, is that when you have to plug it in to charge it. While corded the wire constantly drags and makes it much more difficult to move the mouse across the pad. They could have at least had the plug in section not be flush to the bottom of the mouse.<br /><br />As far as wireless itself goes, this mouse is great! no issues with response times or buttons not working properly (I did have to return the first one because of a side button not really clicking when pressed).<br /><br />I recommend trying it in a store or if your friend has it (both wireless and plugged) before deciding on purchasing.
RFF9E992HEG3B	2	I have the KVM installed and working.  I tried to use with a wireless keyboard and mouse and had constant issues with the keyboard and mouse ceasing function.  with a regular keyboard and mouse it works fine, even using a PS/2 keyboard and a USB mouse, but wireless devices will not work properly.  Also, you must have the item selected when you are booting it otherwise you will not be able to control the computer which means you have to manually power-up on a power failure instead of having systems set to auto-boot when power is restored.  Has the standard hit scroll lock twice and then the number to switch between stations.
R3VBBJUJTSX5BW	3	Just got this keyboard and it is working great!  keys feel awesome, nice touch with the rubber padding for my gaming situations, and an excellent price for a mechanical keyboard.  I had missed the sound and love the feel of it.<br /><br />I have one CON,  Arrow Key gamers beware;  You are able to use up and left or up and right to move forward and strafe, however, moving forward while strafing is the only thing you can do with the buttons near the arrow keys.  While pressing both up and left or both up and right, no other (3rd simultaneous key press) button works.  They work fine individually or if you are only moving forward, or only strafing, but you cannot move forward, strafe, and hit another key at the same time.  For this reason i have dropped it two stars because i feel doing these actions is important for my gaming and I was quite disappointed when i found I was limited in this.  I just wish i had kept the box so i could return this keyboard for one that will work for my button combinations.<br /><br />Other than the one con listed above, I love this keyboard and will probably use it for a work computer or one of the boys school keyboards.
RKJD45JRNZSZU	2	I ordered 4 to be used at my church.  One came with a broken arm and had to be sent back.  The others work okay.  With the way they attach, it is hard to get to the power button and difficult to plug anything in to the audio port, but if you can live with that, they do hold the iPads securely, are easy to put together and are easy to use.
R3I8Q95XVVXWCR	3	Here are the Pro's, its mostly well made, its a great product, especially if you like to pack together SSDs, the SATA interfaces are good, and I have no problems with bandwidth on my computer.<br /><br />There are some Con's, however. The first con is that these things trap dust better than a case/cpu fan or vent, these things need to be cleaned out more often than you might think. Also, the fans on this item, for me, started making a lot of noise a few months in to the use of this item. Not having the fans installed is not a big deal for me because I use SSDs and the temperatures are not that bad given I operate the SSDs in a relatively cool ambient temperature, but ... Like I said, the fans are noisy or become noisy and this is a big problem, probably 4-5x noisier than anything else on my tower, pretty loud. The last con is the price, I could see justifying a price of 55$, but not 60+$, especially not the price I see which is 75$. This item is a good deal at 55$, at 75$ you are paying just too much, especially seeing as how you will probably want to replace the fans after a while.<br /><br />Also of note, the unit does not fit very well in to my case, I have a nicer case and I dont believe the tolerances on the case are an issue, however these were very difficult to insert and remove, and I think these guys should take a bout a millimeter or two off the dimensions of this unit to make sure it fits well.<br /><br />Final verdict, 4.5 stars @ 55$, 3 stars @ 75$. Look on ebay for used units if you can, this shouldn't cost more than 55$ in my opinion.
R9ICPQ6U2N12Q	3	I initially bought the cover because it appeared aesthetically pleasing.  Also, at the time I purchased it, there was another Amazon.com reviewer who seemed happy with it.  As of this posting, that reviewer is no longer here and I wonder if that was a review by someone affiliated with the company?    Anyway, here's my evaluation of the sleeve.  First, it's a fine sleeve, it's functional, and looks reasonably good.  Second, it's not high quality material.  For example, it's not real leather, and it must involve some cheap polymers, because it has a bit of a chemical smell.  It's not unbearable, but if you bring it close to you, you'll smell it.  Lastly (this is the part that matters), the sleeve is fine as a cover, but it won't necessarily protect your kindle from impact.  Specifically, the sleeve is a relatively thin cushion (and hence provides some protection), but it is not a rigid case. So, it's markedly different from say, a Case Logic product, which seems much more rigid and would provide a good protection.  Gizmo sleeve also would provide less protection than other less rigid nylon cases.    Conclusion is this.  If you are careful to handle your assets, then this sleeve would probably serve fine when you carry your Kindle inside a purse or a backpack.  If you're the type who might carry the Kindle in your arm along with notepads and drop it now and then, then don't use this product.
RIZHJF8TM4QFO	4	I did not want Windows 8 and this was a good deal for the few Windows 7 computers out there. The size and weight are very pleasing, and it came well packaged (not too much extraneous packing materials) and with a quality sleeve which was a nice surprise. If you have a lot of music, photos, or other large files, you will likely need an external hard drive and/or cloud storage as 128GB doesn't hold much, but the speed that the solid state drive and processor offer is fantastic, and the USB 3.0 ports charge my devices and transfer data incredibly fast.<br /><br />Here is why it gets a 3 instead of a 5. There was no prompting or instructions on creating back-up DVDs of the OS; it freezes several times a week and cannot be restored with Ctrl-Alt-Delete so I have to do a hard shutdown and lose my work; the cursor jumps around as I type and has resulted in many lines of text being deleted or having to cut and paste my work back in order. As I do a lot of writing, this is extremely frustrating especially in word processing; on a website I can move the cursor to a non-text area to prevent the jumping from affecting my typing (like now). And the power key is the same size as and right next to the delete key.
R35D03F92HKJU0	1	My son saved his money for months to make a big purchase.  He was choosing between kindle 8.9, xbox and laptop.  He chose kindle and has regretted it since he had it for a week.<br />Now, it keeps freezing up and going to a black screen and you can't turn it back on.  Then....days later...it will work again for a few days and then do the same thing again.  I am calling customer service tomorrow to see if we can get a refund.  We have had it one month and 2 days as of today.  I will let you know how good customer service takes care of this problem.
R3ABBBMF5048Q5	0	The keyboard is okay! it looks cheap but it works ok and I got what I paid for. It was shipped slowly but packaged nicely! Thank you!
RLEO090I0EYIK	3	I actually purchased this case for use with an Acer Iconia A500 10.1\\" tablet to make use of the usb keyboard. Please note: The Acer does fit into this case and works very well with the usb of the Acer but it does slide around a bit. The keyboard works well but sometimes the keys like to stick. The interior of the case really needs to be lined with a soft material to prevent slipping and scratching. The keyboard actually rests directly against the screen and a protector is not optional since the keys will cause scratching of the screen if the tablet moves too much. All-in-all this is actually a good addition to your tablet since it makes a good stand to hold the tablet for viewing and the portability of the compact usb keyboard is great.
R3OFY6A4RTR6Y	1	This case is durable protection for my Galaxy Tab 7plus.  The cover does produce lines on the screen, which are easily wiped off with a soft wipe and a little lens cleaner.  Recommend strongly using a screen protector.
R2339JHCIHUGQE	0	I will use it for something. I only gave 3 stars. I am sure it should have given 5 stars for what it was made for.
RZJZ0B0P34N1P	2	The case is good. It is not great but it does it's job. I went with this case instead of the amazon brand to save a few more bucks. I never used the amazon brand but from what I can tell the only difference is that the amazon case puts your tablet to sleep automatically.<br />Now for this case's review.<br />Pro's:<br />- decent stand for watching videos on tablet.<br />- minimal - average protection (not an otterbox)<br />- little flap on the side to hold stylus pen<br /><br />Con's:<br />- Quality: poor - average. I wouldn't expect it to last past two years.<br />- suede inside sometimes picks up dust and puts it on the screen.<br /><br />* Mainly knocked off 2 stars (1 1/2 in my head) due to the quality and durability.
R1QWRCQPJN4XJL	1	Works great. The only bad is that you have no way of knowing when the battery goes down. It just dies.
R19WR09LSET63A	1	The screen protector os ok but it did not go on as easy as I though it should. I did what it said but it got some bubble in it and they say it will go away in a few days and mine are still there. It cover good so maybe I did something wrong but I did what it says and it been on for over 2 weeks now and it still has bubble.
RQJAQLDQ1KY3H	0	You put it in the camera and it works, not much else to say.
R2R74VJQCO4UMB	2	I have had the product only a week or so and there is no issue with it. However, I am lowering the rating because (1) there were no instructions at all on installation (2) there was suppose to be a 3 year warranty and when I registered it there was only 27 months given to me - still trying to resolve that issue. (3) the phone number given for tech support doesn't work (4) too much time taken to try to resolve warranty issue and to get an instruction manual
R3URXBG79920SN	0	I think it is over priced
ROGH03V94FD51	3	Bought this unit back in Feb 2013 and had been using it with both a 2.5 and a 3.5 SATA drive inserted. I really only used the 2.5 SATA drive for data and left the 3.5 drive alone as a maintenance drive, only intending to use it for data swapping and such. one year later I started to use the 3.5 drive slot and started to lose data on transferring to that drive. Being stupid, I blamed the WD Drive first. Duh, it was the 3.5 inch drive slot not the Hard Drive. The small cable connection that hooks between the 2.5 slot and the 3.5 slot is ugly, cheap and the pins are bendy and just terrible. It's just the power connection, but not good looking. The drive passes all the SMART tests, but will not format in that slot. The vendor really needs to upgrade the material. As others have mentioned, replace the PLASTIC handles and key locks with metal and upgrade the connectors and cables. You have a good design, just bad material. Would buy again at a higher price if these upgrades were added. I am going to remove the whole thing and go back into the case.
R1LJ432TG7MDBH	1	stopped working on me, but could possibly be the hdmi cable, but a little confusing to use, but this product is ok.  a bit pricy ...
R2FN1S69SU9AJV	1	This battery has preformed good, but so far has not been fully charged. I am happy with this purchase.  Good value for the money.
R3O3PYOJ5DTBON	1	Its a micro SD chip. It holds the max storage most phones/devices can accomodate. It works. Nuff' said.<br /><br />PS: It's tiny, don't lose it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Chip died a few months after purchase, this is the first time I've had this happen with a SanDisk chip but it was disappointing.
R3IXMFKOJRQKJG	1	Stand feels a little cheap and wobbly. So far it has done what it is designed to do though.
R1EQHC5Q56DENM	3	I have purchased HP products for many years without complaint.  But this unit is an exception.  Yes, the picture is beautiful and bright, and the mouse unit works perfectly with the computer.  But the touch screen has caused me many a headache.  It has frozen  four times.  Calls to India (HP tech support) have had mixed results.  Moreover, the keyboard is cheap and difficult.  And the Mail app is giving me one hell of a time.  Windows 8.1 (God knows I hate it) doesn't support POP accounts, so one must buy Office and use Outlook with your POP address.  After a time I got it to work.  But the Mail app intercepts some of the time (now all of the time) and reprints e-mails designed to appear in Outlook. The experts in India just do not know how to handle this.  That operation, by the way, needs some attention.  Like some instruction for 8.1.  In retrospect, I should not have made this purchase.  HP is out of its depth, which is disconcerting to say the least.
RB82U6EA3O82T	1	I purchased these stylus because I wanted to see how I liked using a stylus with my Google Nexus 7. I had seen other stylus in stores, but they seemed pretty expensive just to see if I liked using one. I found these on Amazon and ordered them not expecting very good quality, but figuring I would at least get the chance to try using a stylus and see if it was for me.<br /><br />They arrived yesterday, and the quality of the stylus is mugh higher than I expected and the tip seems to glide appropriately on the screen of my tablet. I think I am going to like using a stylus, but I don't think I will be running out to buy one, the 5 pack I ordered here will probably last me for a while.<br /><br />Shipping took a while, and there were no updates or tracking numbers available, but when they arrived they were packaged well and in good shape.
R3JZO88OZWN263	2	I got this to replace my original that came with my laptop.  While it does charge my computer, which of course was the goal, the plug doesn't fit snugly in my laptop so it often comes out.
R6RN2TSYUEWVD	3	The fan controller does not work out of the box. The pump still works and I am getting good cpu temperatures just by putting the radiator near the 200mm case fans on my HAF-X. I am waiting for my RMA to get a fully functional system. Hopefully that will have even better temps.   Corsair seems to have a couple of bad batches of these. There were a rash of complaints on their forums earlier this year which forced a recall of one batch, and this week they have another slew of complaints about the most recent batch.   Should be a good product based on my preliminary temps but their poor QC has me worried for the long term.
R2I70C6CYLENUY	4	I bought this stuff because one of my laptops (heavily used by kids) finally got its audio output loosen to unusable state.  The idea was to plug adapter into usb port and thus get audio output back.  And it worked.  I put 3 stars here because it's definitely  &#34;Okay&#34; - for a couple of bucks you receive pretty usable plug-and-play thing. A few remarks though. Watch out its size. It takes more space than typical usb connector, so you might have difficulties with plugin something else in nearby port. Also with my laptop/headphone combination it delivers _way_ more loud sound in comparison with laptop's own output. So volume needs to be heavily adjusted (maybe down to lower 10% of scale) to keep my ears safe :-)
RSLJB37U3Z9VI	2	I do love my Kindle HD...but on my third time replacing, before the warranty had expired. BIG ISSUE...that Amazon desperately needs to fix is the plug on the Kindle. It becomes loose, which causes the adapter to not charge eventually. Has been a flaw since the Kindle came out and Amazon, for some reason, I guess cannot seem to fix. I would give it a 5 star rating, if not for the inconvenience of having it replaced ever year. But I must say, Amazon is the best to deal with, always helpful and prompt in sending me a new one. Them I give 5 stars!!
R373PRPCV0DYYF	2	I hooked up my iphone and it said it was charging at 30% but 3 hours later it was still the same amount of battery left 30%. The next day my boyfriend hooked up his nexus7 and it charged it up with in the hour.
RVYFCD25B1KYC	2	Was disappointed in this product and found it rather pricey for both quality of sound and cheaper construction. The little bag accompanying the ear buds was extremely small.
R28N0G9E9OH7PD	3	I gave it 3 stars because it's nice and compact.  It looks nice, but if you put it next to the August Lion case, it looks less streamlined and more plasticky.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because when you fold it back to read, it turns off because the cover triggers the wake/sleep mechanism.  The makers of Roocase, also a nice case if you don't mind leather/pleather around the screen, fixed this problem by placing a metal disc in the case so that it will not turn off when the front is folded backwards.  Poetic needs to do this, as well.  I also bought the Poetic case that is a stand, and for that purpose, it is great.  There is no fold back problem with that model.  I have had the case for about a month.
