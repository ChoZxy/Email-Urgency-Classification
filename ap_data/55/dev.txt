9711	4	AITA : Girl who slept with my ex is claiming he raped her, and because of past experiences with her I don’t 100% believe her. So this girl, we’ll call her Beth, has a long history of being not he best person. She’s one of those people that seeks attention constantly. Here are some examples of things that have happened to give you an idea of how she is. - She smokes a lot of weed and has moved onto other drugs, which she talks about constantly. But then people will say they don’t like her because she’s a drugee that smokes weed all the time, and her response is “Why do they think I take all these drugs? I don’t even smoke that much!” (Despite literally talking everyday in huge groups of people she doesn’t know about how much weed she smoked and how high she got. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if you smoke weed but Jesus Christ shut up you talk about it all the time of course people thing you’re a drugee). -One time my friend asked her why she smokes so much anyway, and Beth’s response was “Cuz I have a shitty life. My dad is a bitch who makes me eat [she has an eating disorder] and people talk shit about me all the time. It’s how I deal with my problems. You wouldn’t understand.” The girl who asked Beth that question had been molested as a child and was then sexually assaulted again as a teen, on top of it she has severe depression that her mother refuses to treat. Beth knows this, and has the audacity to act like her problems are more severe. - Another time a group of us were hanging out and someone was having a severe panic attack. We were all trying to calm her down, and Beth goes “We’re supposed to be having fun, quit being an over dramatic bitch. I have panic attacks all the time and they’re not this bad, I know you’re faking.” None of us were having it and I called her out so she shut up. But then ten minutes later tried to act like she was also having a panic attack. Basically what I’m trying to show you is that she tries to one up people to get sympathy, and if she doesn’t get it, she goes about getting it anyway she can. And I can provide more instances if you want them, I just picked the most extreme. So, recently she slept with my ex. (I know this all probably seems like me just being petty and jealous that he slept with someone else, but I can promise that I just really fucking hate Beth.) This is her exact account of events. She felt pressured because he kept asking, but she finally said ok. When it happened, she said it kind of hurt and he didn’t stop. Then afterward she wished it hadn’t happened and hated him for it. And when she told me this she started with “So I<|response|> Dale Carnegie once said that if you can be right only 55% of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. So if a man as competent as that couldn't even hope to be right 55% of the time what hope do you or I have? So let's not consider whether she's lying or not lying. Whether she's right or you are. Clearly she's terribly distressed in some way or another. Perhaps instead of focusing on how much she pisses you off, you should take those few moments and suggest she see someone. Look up a number and give it to her. Surely your life could be better without harboring enough bitterness towards someone that you wrote over 700 words to condemn her? People misusing the term rape does upset me as a rape survivor. But not nearly as much as it upsets me that someone is distressed enough to claim it falsely for attention. Not an asshole, but maybe it's worth considering your own motivations here. <|endoftext|>
153656	2	AITA for thinking my brothers don't deserve a go on my Xbox? I have an Xbox one and I'm sick of my brothers using it. For some reason when I got it my parents decided it would be a good thing if I "Shared" with them. This soon evolved into hourly rotations of my turn, brother 1 then brother 2. This has been going on for quite some time and I'm getting sick if it as most days when I wake up and when I go to play on my xbox, I end up having to wait two hours to play. Am I being unfair in thinking that this is wrong? Edit: It was my Christmas present. They each got their own Christmas presents Edit 2: Christmas presents<|response|> INFO - Did you pay for it? <|endoftext|>
32666	3	AITA for telling my friend to fund for her own trip? I would've just posted on my usual account but unfortunately she'd know right away I was talking about her (and she knows my reddit username so yay). A little bit of backstory: When I was young my mother passed away and without saying much more it led to a decent trust fund that I just put away into investments until I KNOW what I want to use it for. Now I'm 20 years old and I work and pay my own bills. My friend has been my best friend since high school. We were chatting about people we knew at our favorite kava bar she then mentions a guy who had everything paid for him, I just nodded along to the conversation until she mentioned how I'm not very different from this guy and I became a little confused. I asked for an explanation and it's because of the trust fund from when my mother passed away. And since this was shortly after talking about going to Quebec for a week for my 21st birthday, I then said if she felt that way then I don't have to use any of that money to fund for her side of the trip. She then goes and tell me about how I'm being rude and I should pay for her anyways because she currently has no job and no way to come with me. I know I'm being a little petty but AITA here? &#x200B; UPDATE: I had a talk with her about it and we came to a mutual agreement. She's currently applying for jobs so she'll have money to come to Quebec with me so it all works out in the end.<|response|> NTA. She wants to travel with you but only if you pay? She's TA. Instead, she should worry more about making her own money so she could one day travel comfortably instead of mooching off friends. And its damn rude to expect a free ride like this no matter who you are. You act humble woman. &#x200B; Edit: added word to make sense. <|endoftext|>
181612	4	WIBTA if I confronted my stepsons bio mom on her absent parenting? I(19f) began fully raising my husband(26m)'s son(now 3) since his bio mom(27f) abandoned him in August 2018. She did not visit him until December 2018 and did not pursue legal visitation rights until June. The court gave her visits on every holiday, every other weekend, and one weekly visit. For a while she followed this routine. However, she began slipping on her visits, always with an excuse. Eventually she told us she did not want her weekly visits at all because of her older son's schedule being "thrown off by the weekly visits. She has stopped asking for her weekend visits as well. She did not come to his birthday party. She didn't see him on his actual birthday either because she said she had to catch up on doing laundry. She also did not see him on Thanksgiving. Her reasoning was that her mom(who she lives with) was working and she "doesn't know how to celebrate a holiday alone." It is the belief of me, my husband, my in laws, and bio mom's own father that she has no interest in her son unless it is a holiday in which she will be having extended family over to show him off and act like real mom. I know this sounds harsh and cruel but that's how it looks. At this point she has not seen him for over a month but is planning to take her Christmas visit. Coincidentally her extended family will be there for Christmas. She also doesn't like me. She doesn't like how much my stepson loves me, she doesn't like how much effort I put into raising him like I would my own blood. She has said to my husband that she doesn't like "his little girl friend playing mommy to her son." It breaks my heart to see her continuing to reject him. I want to tell her that he is not going to keep loving her if she does not step up, and soon. But maybe this message, from me of all people, will only stir the pot further and lead to retaliation toward me or, worse, my stepson. Would it be an asshole move of me to call her out on her crappy behavior? As an added side note, my husband refuses to confront her himself because he is fine letting her "dig her own grave" when it comes to her relationship with her son. I think it would be good for him to have a relationship with his bio mom's side of the family. But maybe I'm just being an overly invasive asshole in something that's none of my business. Please tell me! Tl:dr my stepsons biological mother seemingly only wants to visit her son to keep up her image. I want to confront this behavior but fear stirring up worse drama/coming of as a huge asshole. Resubmitted, original was rejected for word count. Edited to add a lost detail.<|response|> YTA at least in the sense that it will do no good and only make the situation harder. She isn't going to go, oh, yeah, the new woman I hate gave me this advice, I will follow through. Communication needs to go through the dad. Stay out of it. It is what it is. You can't berate her into being a good parent. Yes, it is awful, but you can do what you are doing and have a living home for the child. <|endoftext|>
78355	2	AITA For going through my gf's phone behind her back ,when she goes through mine infront of me My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year and she has alot of trust issues and paranoia so if she ever asked to go through my phone I would let her and she used to be ok with me going through hers which I only did like twice. About a week ago I got suspicious cause she was distant and spending alot of time at her university so I asked to see her phone and she refused, this made me VERY paranoid so I looked through her phone when she was asleep and found msgs about her wanting to have sex with her TA. I took pictures of the messages and read them to her the next day and she got mad at me saying" it's just a crush I won't act on it " and "don't snoop or else you'll see things you don't want too". I. Staying at a friend's now and what she said got to me , did I over react I mean she was just talking about it and didn't do it but she has a crush on someone else while claiming to love me so I just feel betrayed.<|response|> NTA. Run away bro. Run away from that mess. <|endoftext|>
140133	2	AITA for missing boyfriend's and friends' diploma receiving and making bf cry at commencement So a couple days ago, I went to the bf's and friends' graduation ceremony. There was me and 3 other mutual friends as their guest. After 2 hours of founder/advisor/grad talking we started to get hungry, so one of us (let's say him Bryan) offered to go to dinner, (on campus) told that there is more to diploma receiving and we all agreed. We told Bryan to send message to WhatsApp group about we have left for dinner but if receiving starts before we come back, they can inform us. It turned out that Bryan didn't send the message for half an hour and we have missed the receiving part. &#x200B; After that we met at after ceremony cocktail. My boyfriend told that he looked for me but couldn't see while receiving, it was a dissappointment to him. After 1 hour arguing and talking, he started crying and said that I have ruined the day for him. And one of the grad friends told that we are all assholes and dumbasses who couldn't manage to go hungry for 30 minutes. There was no point for us to come if we have missed the receiving moment. In my defense, 1. I had not eaten anything for one and a half days. 2. Bf always complains about I am too intense and falling over on him, I should be more casual. It seemed to me casual to leaving for dinner without the enormous anxiety of missing the diploma receiving. (Which is my true self without my intentionally intervention on being casual) 3. Since I don't have a close relationship with anyone but my bf and I don't know the rules of casual caring, I assumed that our 3 mutual friends know and it wouldn't be a big deal if we miss it, we were there for them after all. 4. Bf's parents live in an other city. They were not planning to come to the commencement due to transportation and accommodation expenses. He had to convince them by booking their place. When I've asked if he will be upset if they don't show up, he told me that it would be unpleasant but not a biggie. Thence I didn't think it is a super important day to him.<|response|> YTA. It’s even more sad that you are trying to defend/excuse your actions. <|endoftext|>
105865	4	AITA for cutting off a friend? Bear with me, this is a long story. I should start this off by saying I am a young male who met a young female in college a few years ago, pretty standard. We met at the very end of freshman year, and became fairly close friends, her and some of our friends went out a couple times to grab coffee and talk about life. The next year, she transferred to another college about 40 minutes away and we fell out of touch. About a year later, a friend and I visited her for a weekend but we kind of fell out of touch again after that. Fast forward to early this year, she commented on one of my snap stories and we started talking again. She told me about some rough drama she was going through with a shitty ex and her friends who encouraged his manipulative behavior, I’ll spare you the details. I gave her some advice and we started talking again pretty regularly, every day. As for the dynamic between us, I always assumed we were just friends since although I’d consider myself a fairly good looking guy, she was like an 8.5-9/10. I naturally assumed she was out of my league and I wouldn’t have made any moves regardless, considering she just had a messy breakup. But then she started flirting with me. Just subtle stuff but I brushed it off since I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship, and also because of the aforementioned messy breakup. Part of the advice I gave to her was that she was better off staying out of a relationship at the moment, because her friends were pressuring her to give another guy a chance, and she said he was a nice guy but she wasn’t ready for another relationship. Cue her friends getting mad at her, saying he was nice and he deserved a chance with her and she was being a bitch for shitting on this guy. Yeah, not very good friends. Anyway, she eventually did end up in a relationship with this guy, and stopped talking to me as much which insulted me, because if were just friends like I thought we were, talking to me shouldn’t be a problem. Either way, I stopped messaging back as much too because I didn’t know if her new guy was the jealous type and I didn’t feel like dealing with that. A few months later, which is also a few months ago, she told me that her boyfriend had just been taken to jail for an offense that she wouldn’t tell me. I tried not to pry, all I got out of her was that he could be in there for a long time. She started messaging me daily again, and I started responding again. After another month she told me she was officially breaking up with him since it didn’t look like he was getting out of jail soon. Now she was talking to me pretty regularly again I figured we would pick back<|response|> Nah. NTA. Being yanked around and ditched like that constantly is annoying and gets old. If she DOES ask why you havent been responding i'd give her an honest answer and explain how you feel about the whole thing. <|endoftext|>
148635	3	AITA for sitting my parents away from their partners for my wedding and not telling them? My Dad has remarried and she's lovely, my mum has a boyfriend who is also a sound guy, so it's nothing against them at all... even my parents still get on! My sister got married last year and mum saw her seating plan for the wedding whilst it was in the planning stage. It was a traditional top table plan so groom, bride, parents, best man and maid of honour - mum immediately kicked off and rang dad who also kicked off (he wasn't married then). They gave my sister such a hard time about not being able to sit with their partners for the meal - she got so stressed out and just to get them off her back she sacked the top table and just had a big round table like all the others. It wasn't what she wanted and I felt bad. Now it's my turn to get married... myself and my girlfriend both want a traditional top table but after my parents last performance, we've decided we're going to keep the seating plan under wraps and just let them figure it out on the day. Got a bad feeling they won't be happy but I don't care its not their wedding. Am I an asshole?<|response|> NTA. I feel a bit like a broken record with this comment, but I truly mean it: Your wedding and you can do what you want. Congratulations and best wishes to you both! <|endoftext|>
153882	5	AITA for going off on a good friend for refusing to leave a toxic relationship? Throwaway account because this is a pretty specific situation and posting it on my main account would 100% give away my identity. I know how to title sounds. Hear me out. This friend and I have only known each other for a month, but everything about her relationship checks off all the marks for a textbook abusive relationship. The nonstop fighting, victim blaming, refusing to admit when you're wrong, not taking responsibility, not even caring about your partner's feelings-- all from the boyfriend's end. Nonstop. The past 2 WEEKS I've witnessed them going at it every night over the phone. She admits it's been like this for more than 2 months and they've been together for less than one year. She also said sometimes he breaks up with her over some really bullshit reason, he claims to change, and they get back together. Then he's an asshole again. I'm obviously paraphrasing, but she also admitted that she's aware her relationship is abusive but doesn't want to leave because she still cares. She really seems to want to leave though, as she keeps making jokes about becoming single and that there hasn't been any communication from his side. I know escaping a relationship is harder for some people- I went though a similar thing a few years back with my ex. He was a toxic asshole (I am a gay male), and if someone pointed out how abusive he was, I would've left sooner no doubt. That's what I'm trying to do here. Be a good friend and help her escape. The boyfriend comes from home from work, he gets mad at my friend over some really petty shit (last night it was over my friend crying from losing her mom). He gets mad and ignores her, she gets upset, he ""apologises"" by blaming her, she gets mad, cycle continues. This wasn't the first time I pointed out how abusive things are, I tried convincing her to leave the relationship and pointed out how relationships aren't supposed to be like this a few days ago- and about a week and a half ago when he was yelling at her over the phone. Last night I really pissed at her for letting him stomp all over her. I told her that if she wants to stop feeling like shit, then she has to accept that her relationship is falling apart and that him and his friends shouldn't get mad at you for being upset, that if they don't care about your emotions they were never your friends/boyfriend anyway. She got really upset and said she just needed to change. "Be more tough". I wasn't having it and told her to choose her own happiness or someone else's happiness who evidently doesn't give a shit about her emotions. I also told her if she had to completely change herself to be in this relationship, then I didn't want to be in contact with her anymore. Reddit, AITA? Edit: grammatical error<|response|> NTA (TA is the abusive boyfriend, not your friend). I was in a similar situation where a friend of five years was in an abusive relationship and refused to admit it. It is draining to try and help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. With all the empathy possible for someone who is manipulated to stay in an abusive relationship, it’s not your responsibility to get her out. However, YWBTA if you lost contact with her for her boyfriend. Abusive partners need friends and family to distance themselves from the victim in order to have more power. You can honestly say that you don’t support her relationship but still want to be her friend, but you don’t want to hear about her relationship *however* you are here if she ever *really needs* you. If she then doesn’t accept these terms, then it’s her choice (but still remind her that you are there in emergency, if you want to be). If you don’t want to be her friend regardless that is okay, but if it’s purely about the boyfriend, then you would be TA. <|endoftext|>
39339	3	AITA For Taking A Picture of the Security Guard? I am currently a senior in College and ran into a situation today that made me question my actions after the fact. &#x200B; I was attempting to access my library when I realized I had forgot my student ID at my house. Since it is required to scan your ID to get in I searched the school guidelines and realized that it permits you to show your phone app ID through the schools portal to get access to the library. I will say that nobody checks your ID is actually yours, you just have to flash it over a badge scanner and the walkway opens for you. &#x200B; I went inside to the security guard at that entrance desk and when I went to show my phone she already had a scowl before I even got to her. I explained the situation and showed the phone ID - which has your student number and current standing beneath it - and she told me I have to have my ID. I explained the rule in the school guide and even got a librarian to agree that it would be fine but she would not budge. It may not be important but I even explained that all I was there was to collect a print order I already placed and would never be outside of her vision. &#x200B; She began to patronize me saying I would have to go to the student center (which she knew was already closed because she laughed when i told her) so I asked for contact information about her superior so I could get clarity why she was allowed to make her own decision over-ruling the schools outlined operating procedure. &#x200B; When I said this she immediately covered her name badge and told me I had to leave or she would escalate the matter since I displayed aggressive behavior - even the librarian rolled her eyes. &#x200B; As a result I took my phone out and *pretended* to take her picture - I actually just turned my flashlight on for a moment to make it look like a flash. She immediately covered her face with a piece of paper which allowed me to see her name badge. I then said I would make it a point to contact student services to file a complaint regarding her behavior. She began ranting about how she "didn't give me permission" and I offhandedly remarked I didn't need her position as she was in the role of a public servant and as such had no expectation of privacy. I left as she started to respond. &#x200B; I still feel like I was fine to make her fret over her actions but a part of me does think she was "just doing her job" no matter how misinformed she was. Additionally, I have already followed through with my promise and submitted the complaint as I am a student body representative. But I felt like I still have to ask if I'm the asshole.<|response|> NTA Not really much to say, you didn't do anything wrong, she was an asshole. <|endoftext|>
72210	4	WIBTA Pretending to be ill so I don't have to attend a close friend's birthday? For some context we are a close group of friends from high school. We now attend college in different cities. It is my close friend's birthday next Friday, said friend is hosting a party at their new flat. The birthday visit would mean me and my flatmate going over Friday evening. This would be a night out and then staying for the weekend. Visiting them involves a 3 hour train journey as well as sleeping on someone's sofa. Now before you judge me for getting stressed about having to sleep on someone's sofa I should explain a few things. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have only just started drinking on my medication. Every time I have ended up feeling awful mentally. For the past two weeks I have ran myself into the ground trying to behave as extroverted as I used to. I have started having panic attacks again. Travelling on the train exhausts me. Then add having to make an effort around new people and drinking as well as not getting good sleep. For me that's a recipe for a panic attack. I think I can't do this and I need to try and convince my flatmate I don't want to go. After trying to explain the reason I didn't want to go my flatmate she got really upset. I explained it would probably cause a panic attack, she counters well we can just relax on the train and not do much on the weekend. She doesn't seem to understand that anything aside from being on my own in the house tires me out. She honestly, doesn't seem to care that it would cause a panic attack. So, I spent $60 on a train ticket. I am very easily swayed if I know someone will feel bad. My flatmate started to get annoyed with me and since we are such close friends I don't want to upset her. I really do not want to go. I am currently trying to think up excuses so I can't go. Since we live together there are very few things I can do far from pulling a Ferris Bueller. Will I be the asshole for pretending to be ill to get out of my close friend's birthday party? Do I need to just suck it up?<|response|> Don’t lie. Be honest with your friend whose party it is and about your mental health. Explain this will be difficult for you and you’re going to politely decline until you’re in a better place. True friends will understand and support you. YWBTA if you lie. Your flat mate is an asshole full stop and you DO NOT have to do what they say. Hope you feel better soon, please make sure you get some help x <|endoftext|>
46810	4	AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do the dishes? I'll preface this with saying that since the start of our relationship, we have agreed everything is 50/50. This mostly just includes bills. I front all the bills and she just pays me back when she has money &#x200B; We don't have a dish washer, so all our dishes must be washed by hand. I'm definitely on the cleaner side so when dishes pile up it makes me kind of anxious. &#x200B; Normally the dishes have been 50/50 as well. But lately I've been working 10s/12s (55hr weeks) and not getting home until around 5 most days (Ranges 4-6). We both start 6am. She gets off at 2:30 sharp everyday, and because of traffic she's home around 2:45/3. Also, the last week we've been starting at 4am (She was off at noon, I was at 4/5) &#x200B; When I get home she is either watching TV or taking a nap. I tell her it frustrates me she watches TV for 2/3hr before I get home and she doesn't do the dishes. To her credit she'll do them 50% of the time. The other 50% i'll start them and she might help dry. When I work Saturdays she'll sometimes do the laundry for us. Other-times it waits until Sunday. She says I make the dishes disgusting, but I think the dishes are just fine. &#x200B; TL;DR: AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do the dishes because I work more than her? Even though we agreed everything was 50/50?<|response|> YTA. She sounds like she is doing her best to go 50/50 with you, but your cleaning standards being so high and so specific are kind of your problem to deal with. Yeah, she wants to nap and relax when she gets home. No, it's not her responsibility to have things spotless for you at the exact time you want them to be. She is carrying her share of the weight, it's just not on the exact schedule you want it to be. <|endoftext|>
134774	3	AITA IF i don't want my son's dad at his graduation... REPOST with names now. Long time lurker, mobile so please excuse. English is my 2nd language. I give birth to my son Andy in 2001, Bob was the father but due to medicals issues my family took me and Andy with them. That was it for our relationship. After about 12 weeks I landed a sales rep position. In comes John, asked me out for weeks. John met Andy when he turned 8 months. We had about 2-3 great/happy years after, the last 8 years were hell. He turned to be something else. I give birth to our girl Elly about 2 1/2 years into relationship; Andy was 3. I stay for 5 years, then I left with kids. Let me explain, he wasn’t a bad dad at first. John was great with Andy, even started calling him dad. Unfortunately John was not a good dad to Elly, he still isn’t and Andy saw this and still does. Through the years the relationship between John and Andy deteriorated; I found after taking my kids to therapy the way he used to treat them when he was alone with them. I talk to him about extensively but he always says the kids are too sensible, they don't understand him. I decided to keep them full time, for the last 5 years John can visit, take them out but do not spend the night with him. Last 2-3 years only Elly goes out with him if she wants to, Andy just excuses himself. Last year Elly had her Middle School graduation, I made the mistake to invite Jonn and his mom Sally. He was civil until the point the ceremony ended and we went to eat, was all grabby hands, talking nonsense, even pinch my butt. I left and asked Elly to call me to pick her up upfront after, I haven’t seen him since. So Andy is graduating from high school next week (Jhon never did, he drop out on 11th). Andy has 4 tickets, he decided Me, Elly, my boyfriend Brian and Grandpa Rich (Jhon’s stepdad) can come. Has no intention to invite John. Andy got an extra ticket, decided to invite grandma cause of grandpa Rich. To explain, Sally lost her son DJ when he was 14; John was 11 when this happened, from that point she gave him everything but also make him who he is now. and has this deep sense to giove anythig he wants. I was about to give them tickets for next week, Sally then says she will give her ticket to John, he raise Andy when he didn’t have to. This was started by Rich (I know he can’t stand him so I’m lost). I advise them I will think about it but didn’t give their tickets. Now Sally called me telling me John is already pissed so she will give him her ticket and I need talk to Andy about it and made him understand what's right. Thinking of not inviting Sally to<|response|> NTA. Andy can have anyone he wants at his graduation. <|endoftext|>
10416	3	AITA if I don’t donate my old clothes to charity? Basically, I’m moving from grad school housing to a tiny studio apartment. I’m planning to dump 80% of my clothes for various reasons (no longer the right fit, no longer my style, etc). Most are in okay to very good condition and could be donated. The thing is, I live in the city, and I don’t have a car. So donating the clothes would require a number of trips wheeling the items in large suitcases to some place that may or may not accept them. I have a lot of other things going on right now and that is not high on my list of priorities. But I can’t help but feel a sense of guilt and wastefulness. At this point, I’m planning to put all of the stuff in this huge trash bin the housing staff leaves out this time of year. There’s a chance someone here will grab it, but it’s unlikely since most people are moving out and in the same boat I’m in. I await your judgment.<|response|> Clothing takes up a lot of space in land fills and it doesn't degrade, so I don't think that option is the best one. Craig's list has been mentioned and you might also check to see if there is a Freecycle in your area. I've posted stuff on Freecycle and people came to get it. There are other options to just putting it in the dumpster that won't require you to haul it somewhere. <|endoftext|>
147522	5	AITA for refusing to go to my dads house until he puts down our dog. Okay so I know how the title sounds and you all probably think Im the asshole, but hopefully reading the rest will change your mind. So basically I’m a 17 year old guy who has had my dog before I was even born, so my dog is 19 y.o. I have always loved him more than anything and wanted the best for him. So recently, I’d say 4-5 months ago he started to go blind, deaf, unable to control his pee poo, basically just all the senile dog things. My dad counters this by locking him in a storage room 24/7. I would bring him out to hang out with me but he literally just pees and poos everywhere. The room that my dog is locked in leads to the garage. So everytime my dad or anyone needs to come in from the garage or go out, we need to avoid stepping in his shit and piss. My dad cleans this by grabbing a bucket of water and mop that just sits in the garage at all times ready to clean it up. He never even replaces the water or anything so it’s really really dirty mop and water that he just spreads all over the floor. I cannot even sleep at my dads house because all I hear all night is my dog barking and crying, and through the vents it makes it sound like it right in my room. My dad has terrible hearing so it doesn’t affect him. I can tell from my dogs cries that he is in pain and just wants to be let out of that dark room. The whole house also smells VERY musty and disgusting from my dog since he walks around in his poo and pee and my dad never cleans him. His hair is all matted and dirty. I’ve asked my dad on multiple occasions to just bring him to the vet and put him out of his misery. But he just replies with “I don’t want to” so I have decided that I will stay at my mothers house until he puts the dog down. Because I cannot stand to to see my dog that has been with me my whole life be treated like this. So AITA?<|response|> NTA that's horrible, the only thing I would say is you're almost TA for not taking matters into your own hands and either getting the dog help or taking him to be put down. But not only was that not the question, you're also a kid and it's going to be hard to go behind your dad's back like that. I feel really bad for your dog though I hope you figure it out. <|endoftext|>
98740	3	AITA for wanting a ride home at 11pm? I am a college student. It was the night before my final exam and I was at school with my classmates studying and preparing for the exam. I live in a town 30 km (19) miles from the campus and it takes me an hour and a half with public transport to get home, whereas by car it takes 20 minutes. We are practicing our finals and next thing we know, it is 9 pm. The buses stop running at 10.30 pm and we were starving ( I had not eaten a thing since 11 am that morning ). We order pizza and we were told after we paid, that it would come at 10.55 pm. So we wait for the pizza since we paid for it and decide to figure something out later. My husband was at work in the town where we live and drives to and from work. His job is close to the highway so it would take him a little under 20 minutes to come to the campus to get me. I send him an SMS asking him if he could help me out. He answers when he gets off work, asking what my friends are going to do. I tell him they are walking home because they live in the same town as the uni campus. I wait 20 minutes to hear from him again. No answer to ask him if he is coming to get me. He said he was too tired and didn't want to drive 30 km to pick me up and come back home. I, of course, get pissed and curse him out over SMS, tell him that he is a shitty spouse and that if it had been reversed I would have come to get him without hesitating. But that just resulted in him calling me an ass and ignoring the rest of my messages. I am forced to walk 2 km (1.5 miles ) in the dark (I have trouble seeing at night), to get the nearest bus which doesn't always come, to try and make it to the train station by 12.15 which is when the last train leaves for my town. I was lucky and make it home at 1.55 am ( I also have to walk home from the train station and that is 1km/0.5 mi ) and went to my final the next morning with only 4 hours of sleep ( I have to get up at 6.30 am to get ready to head back to school to be there by 8.30). AITA?<|response|> YTA... sorry, you should’ve been on that 10:30 bus. It was your responsibility to make sure you had a ride home, especially if you had class in the morning. Unfortunately, adulting is a real thing. <|endoftext|>
105694	3	AITA for not wanting to hang out with friends I didn't invite over? My roommate is inviting mutual friends over to drink at night, which I don't participate in, and they stay the night and he leaves in the morning and they're left to their own devices in the common areas. While i'm in my room watching Netflix or sleeping. Lately, they're starting to give me shit like "you sleep too much" "you spend too much time alone".. and it's annoying af! I tell them they can do nothing we me in my room anytime. Also I work from 4a to 2p every weekday. I'm just tired.<|response|> NTA. They're not your company to entertain. <|endoftext|>
100615	4	AITA for finally telling my best friend that we just don’t work together? I have known my friend since third grade. We used to go to summer camp together and we’re still friends in high school. She follows me around like a puppy and doesn’t want to go anywhere by herself. I’m a very independent person who likes her free time. I don’t have loads of people to talk to so I usually sit down and read or browse through social media or something. My friend thinks this is very boring and keeps on pressuring me to go places with her even though I’ve told her I’m comfortable with my routine. I put up with this for a long time but today I just had to say what I thought. I told her that we just didn’t fit together because I was too introverted and she was too social. With her, I can’t get the time I need to recharge by myself. I’ve been asking her and asking her to try doing things on her own and that following everyone around isn’t the best way to go about things (she downgraded from ap literature to be in english honors with me). So yeah I told her this and she just melted and started crying in the middle of the hall. She thinks I’m a bitch and my mom (who has the same tendencies as my friend and pushed us together) thinks I’m being too rude. I literally cannot stand being with her anymore. So yeah... Am I the asshole?<|response|> You're NTA for feeling those things - people change especially in their teens and 20s, and it's not uncommon for even the closest of childhood friends to get different interests and drift apart. However, it does sound like you could've broken it to her better, maybe with a longer sit down and discussion of what's up and that you need your space. Hard to know for sure without getting an overly detailed breakdown of your conversation. If you feel like you were as nice and reasonable as possible, then it might just be that this sort of thing is difficult for everyone involved. <|endoftext|>
41978	3	AITAH for my friend flooding the classroom? So it was my sophomore year of high school, and a friend and I went into English class. The teacher had these balloon holder things for a party she had a day before, so my friend picks it up and drops it about a foot off the ground to see how heavy it was, he dropped it and it made a weird plop noise. Turns out it’s weighed down by like 2 gallons of water at the bottom, so I pick it up and drop it and it plops again. He picks it up, drops it like 4 foot above the ground and it rips, water gushes out everywhere, the teacher was in the hallway, as class hadn’t started yet, in the end, the entire classroom was flooded with 2 inches of water. I go into the hallway and get the teacher, as she asks who did it, I told her it wasn’t me who broke it, and that it was my friend. My friend says “you did it too” so the teacher yells at ME and makes ME mop it up along with him, I got my parents called, and a referral, am I the asshole? She said I was involved in it, and “encouraged” him to do it.<|response|> YTA for blaming your friend and saying that you don’t have anything to do in the incident. <|endoftext|>
182518	3	AITA For Being Offended By Rejection Letter? I was recently unemployed and had been aggressively applying for jobs through multiple mediums. As a result, I filled out dozens of job applications online and sent them in along with resume. I was fortunate enough to find a job recently and am now back to work. However, from time to time, I still receive rejection emails from companies months after the fact. While most rejection letters don't bother me, I received one recently which I found highly inappropriate. It basically read like this; *OP* I appreciate your interest in the position with {company}. Although your experience is impressive, we have moved forward with another candidate........\****If you have contacts in your network that I can also be of assistance to, please have them reach out to me.*** The highlighted part is what annoyed me the most. I understand that being rejected is part of job searching but I found it extremely tacky that the company was asking for referrals inside of the rejection letter. To me it reads like "you aren't good enough for the position but you can help us find someone that is". My friends say that I am overreacting to a simple boilerplate email but none of them have experienced the stress of job searching and the pain of being rejected countless times. I haven't responded to the email (which I would definitely be a TA) but that doesn't mean that I think the company shouldn't change their wording. So am I being an over-reacting TA?<|response|> NTA. I don’t think this makes you an asshole necessarily, but your friends are right in that you’re overreacting. Is it distasteful of companies to do that? Yeah. Do they care? No. Be grateful that you found a job, and ignore the email. <|endoftext|>
80869	3	WIBTA if I told my roommate to fuck off My roommate, Marie, and I are in college dorms, so we’re literally sharing a room. Our dorm is on the far edge of campus, pretty far away from everything. I spend most nights at my fiancé’s, who is an RA in another dorm, so he has his own room. His dorm is also in the center of campus, so it’s closer to everything. Marie started complaining a little while ago about the room being too quiet since I’m not home too often. I said I would start being home more, and I am on MWF when I have a break in my day. She’s never home during that break, and I can’t really extend it since it’s in between work and school. I also have a huge 9 to 5 block of classes T/Th, so I’m barely home on those days at all. I saw it as a scheduling issue, and while I sleep at home a little more now, can’t do much about. Especially since late at night is like the only time I get to see my fiancé. There’s also some other drama between the other suitemates, so I’m just not exactly comfortable at home anyways. She started having guests over to fill the space, and I was fine with it as long as they slept on my bed, instead of in it, until they started moving (and sometimes taking) my stuff. I tried to make it clear that I really wasn’t comfortable with that, and asked if she could cool it with having people over in my bed for a while. That lasts all of about a week, when Amy, one of her friends, starts leaving her laundry and some of her bags on my side of the room. I thought it was a one time thing, since I was gone at a conference that weekend, but the stuff hasn’t left. Cue Monday, when I found Amy’s body pillow under my covers. I really want to throw out my covers now, and feel completely uncomfortable sleeping in my own bed. Sit down with Marie, and try to talk to her about it. Instead, she implies that *I* need to move out, insulted (and lied about) my fiancé, and downplays any of my efforts to be a better friend to her (I try to invite her to things whenever I can’t be home. She never responds). She also defended Amy, saying that she only sleeps over because she’s over studying with her until late. I grin and bear it, because IDC anymore, I just want to have my own space be mine, and tell her that I’ll se me her at home tonight. Jump to that night, Amy and Marie walk in surprised to see me home, and immediately go to bed. Marie hands Amy a pillow, and Amy sleeps on the couch. No studying done. Just a sleep over, on a Tuesday. Her laundry bag is still here. Since Amy first moved my shit, I’ve been worried about finding her<|response|> NTA. Just because you crash in your bfs room a few nights a week doesn’t mean you don’t still live there. You’ve tried to be reasonable but now it’s time to speak with your own RA before you have to resort to being a bad bitch. Good luck! <|endoftext|>
22493	3	AITA for being annoyed at my boyfriend constantly asking about his hair? Boyfriend and I have been dating for a couple years. His hair has gotten thinner over the years but absolutely nowhere near bald. Since the start of the relationship he has not stopped worrying about his hair. It \*\*absolutely\*\* consumes him. I fully respect this as an insecurity of his and have bought him Viviscal, I do his hair on nights out to look thicker, suggested shampoos and researched thinning treatments, I tell him that I don't care if he goes bald and that I'll love him whatever happens (obviously it's not exactly about what I think, moreso that he is just upset at his hair thinning). &#x200B; I kept up the sympathy for years until recently, so lately we'll have a heated discussion about how I can't keep up with the persistent questions about his hair that I have answered a million times before. "Does it look thin?", "Does it look thinner than last week?". I feel like an asshole for being annoyed at it but it feels like 1.) I'm trying to help and it's not going anywhere and 2.) It sucks that his hair is thinning but I have a "fuck it" philosophy. If it's not something you can control then there's no point worrying about it. Not that he can just decide to think the same way that I do but I truly believe that's probably the healthiest way to deal with it. In all honesty, I'm just upset that it bothers him so much. &#x200B; So am I right in thinking I'm being a bit of an asshole? Do I just put up with it and hide my annoyance?<|response|> NAH I would be annoyed too but as a guy I can relate. Hopefully he will get over his insecurities. Bald is in fashion again so it's no biggie. <|endoftext|>
95043	3	AITA for refusing to accept responsibility for my FIL's cancer diagnosis? I posted here a couple of weeks ago on a throwaway about the argument between my wife and I that started off this whole debacle. The overwhelming consensus was that I was indeed an asshole then, I accept it, and I apologized profusely to my wife hoping we could put it behind us. Basically a few weeks back I screwed up big time and forgot about an appointment I had, to get out of paying the cancellation fee I lied on the spot and said my FIL had died in a car accident that morning. My wife found out and was rightfully furious with me. One thing I forgot to mention is that the reason that particular lie came to mind so quickly is because it is something my FIL says all the time. He is in poor health and has been for a long time, heart issues and poorly controlled diabetes. He has lived a long and adventurous life full of hard living and lots of fun, he has been a heavy smoker and drinker his whole life and he struggles to make the lifestyle modifications he needs to for his health. Every time someone tells him he needs to lose weight or quit smoking he says "why bother, with my luck I will make myself miserable doing all this healthy shit and then die in a car accident" or some variation on that theme. I love my FIL and it isn't my place to ride his ass about his health but he makes a lot of bad choices. He goes hunting and fishing alone without telling someone where he is. His eating habits are like 1970s Elvis. When he put on a suit to go to my brother in law's wedding last year he looked like Hermann Goering in the methamphetamine years, and acted like it to boot (he did shots all night). To be brutally honest I am surprised he has made it to 78 years old. My wife found out a few days ago that my FIL has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The doctor says it is not an aggressive form of cancer, but that he would prefer to operate, but that this is not currently worth the risk based on his overall health right now. Basically the doctor is politely implying that his other medical problems will kill him before the cancer does. The man is nearly 80, slow progressing prostate cancer is super common in his age group, his cancer isn't terminal and he himself seems pretty unconcerned by the diagnosis (as he was about the type 2 diabetes and heart disease). My wife on the other hand has been in tears convinced that her dad is going to die. She keeps accusing me of "jinxing" him and giving him "bad karma" because of the car accident thing. I tried to explain that yes this was inappropriate but there's no such thing as jinxes or karma and that FIL is not in imminent danger<|response|> NTA- saying your FIL was in a car accident didn’t give him cancer. If you want to test it, try confessing to your lie and see if he is cured. <|endoftext|>
80942	2	AITA for eating in at a restaurant and ordering an entree as takeout? This is very normal behavior in my family. If someone isn't able to make it to dinner but the rest of us want to go out to eat, we just ask for a takeout order to be added to our bill. I asked my girlfriend to do this for me recently and she told me she hates doing it and she's never met another family that does this. Is this normal or is this asshole behavior? EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone, this post was all in good fun and we were both in on it. Her family didn't go out to eat much growing up so it's just something she never experienced before. She does have social anxiety but so do I. I was going to pay her back for the food, and yes we are both good tippers.<|response|> NTA, what’s weird about it? I’ve done it. <|endoftext|>
191661	2	AITA for refusing to give an old man daily candy? Hello, I'm hoping to settle a bit of an issue here. I work in a sales position inside of a grocery store, with one other co-worker. We are at the same location 5 days a week each (overlapping three). Over Christmas, my co-worker bought candy canes out of her own money to pass out to customers and their families. It was out of goodwill and also to get them to stop to listen to our pitch. We noticed an increase in traffic and sales so we decided we would keep it going. We rotate who buys the candy - I bought a package, she bought a package, etc. We just leave the candy on the table; I have stopped offering it to kids, but she still does. So, we have regulars at this store, mostly elderly or disabled folks who come by a few times a week. I actually enjoy talking to these folks and find it breaks my day up. I only have an issue with one of them. I gave worked here for 10 months now. Ever since the start, this elderly gent has made me uncomfortable. He will always try to touch me, he rambles on about random things, he is constantly trying to get me to agree to go to his house, and it's just unsettling. Still, I have always been friendly and polite. He comes to the store every single day - I am not exaggerating, he is here every day. I used to worry about offending him, until I realized none of the other staff appear to be very friendly with him. Remaining polite, of course, but there is a huge difference between having a chat with a regular and the bare minimum "can I help you" this guy gets. I also started to realize I have never seen him purchase anything. He comes into the store, wanders around, tries to talk to all the employees, then leaves without buying anything. Here is where the asshole part comes in. Since we started handing out the candies, he will always ask for one. At first, we saw no harm and gave him candy. But this is now a good month later, and he still asks for candy. My coworker suggested we stop giving him candy and I agree with her. So, he came in last week. I was chatting with a friend who works in the loading area. Man - "Can I have a candy?" Me - "No." Man - "Just one?" Me - "No." He looked sad and walked away. My coworker thinks I'm a massive bitch because I refused to give him candy. I told my coworker that this man comes in daily, has been given free candy everyday for over a month, makes us uncomfortable, and this seems to dissuade him from lingering. My coworker still thinks I'm a bitch because this is an old man and I should just try to make him happy. So, reddit, I accept your judgment: am I the<|response|> NTA, you can say "sorry, the candy is for customers". <|endoftext|>
122662	2	AITA for roasting my friend way too hard? So my friends and I are all in a discord server together where we talk, play games, and generally have a good time together. A few weeks ago I had this idea to basically create starter pack memes of each of my friends poking fun at all the quirky and small things they do or have done. This went really well for the first few of my friends as I quickly slopped together some Google images and pasted them in mspaint. However, we have this one friend, we'll call him T, who is generally kind of recognized as the pretentious friend of the group. As I worked my way through each of my friend's memes, T takes notice and asks for a starter pack of himself. I tell him that he'll have to wait until I get through some of the other people's before I started working on his. He obliges initially for a little while, but then he begins to become a little more persistent while also requesting that I pull no punches on his, making sure to really "push his shit in." His words, not mine. Anyway, I finish up and begin working on his starter pack when he says that anything relating to him "acting smarter than he actually is" is low effort and unoriginal. Here's the thing about T. I mentioned that he was the "pretentious" friend, but in general he's a pretty good guy. However, sometimes, he gets too big for his britches and I feel like I need to knock him down a few pegs, so hearing that I should pull no punches on his starter pack, I went all out on him. Over the next couple of days, I made a giant collage of all the weird and strange things he tends to do, but also went after all of his deepest insecurities in making his starter pack as he had requested. After it was all done, I immediately thought that perhaps I had gone a little too far. However, persistent as he is, T demanded that I post it. I really hesitated posting it, even going so far as to make him sign a "consent form" for what he was about to see. I upload the image and immediately T shits on it, calling it unoriginal, low effort, disappointing, and 0/10. I felt a little bad as I had worked on this for a few days only for it to be put down, but whatever. However, things got weird from here. Following this, T completely and suddenly disappears off discord and cuts all communications with the friend group for the next two weeks, deleting his discord account one week in. Rightfully so, the whole group starts to get increasing worried about his whereabouts as we try to contact him to no avail. A few hours ago, though, one of my other friends broke through to him to ask what happened to him, only to learn that he left because of the image that I had posted.<|response|> [NTA.] T sounds like a dick. And all of y’all need to make better use of your times. <|endoftext|>
137636	3	AITA for not siding with the family name? Okay so pretty much me and my dad were drinking at this outdoor establishment and we had our dog (who is a Rottweiler) with us and he was also muzzled because in Korea it was the law. So our dog, Lager, was just laying down with his muzzle on and the owner of the place came outside and asked us to move our dog because he was too close to the entrance. At first I was like “wtf? He has a muzzle on and he isn’t harming anyone” But with further examination I saw that he was laying within 4 feet of the DIRECT entrance which was the only way to enter the establishment. So I was like “okay okay I understand we will move our dog” but then my dad was all like “no fuck you he isn’t doing anything wrong he was muzzled and just minding his business” and then he went on to say (to the owner) “you’re fucking retarded like you actually have something mentally wrong with you” and I was flabbergasted and I called him out right there and then and said “don’t fucking say that wtf? Stop saying that” and I apologized to the owner and he looked at me like I just fucking slapped in the face. So after we moved away from the doorway he said “I can’t believe you dishonored the family name” and I was just kind of in disbelief because he kept saying I was being disloyal and I was a disappointment to him because I didn’t back him up. So pretty much AITA for not siding with my dad on a situation that unfolded?<|response|> NTA Good on you for sticking up for the stranger! <|endoftext|>
113411	2	WIBTA if I asked my dad to stop eating so loudly? I'm 24 and have lived with my parents for basically my whole life. I've graduated from college now and am looking for a full-time job so I can move out. My relationship with my parents is pretty good most of the time, but it's really the little, dumb things like this that make me wish I could move out right this second. &#x200B; My dad has been an obnoxious eater for as long as I can remember. I mean, it's not like it's hardly noticeable - I'm talking open mouth chewing, smacking his lips all the time, talking with food in his mouth, slurps his soup, the whole gambit. In addition to all of the run-of-the-mill annoying eating habits, he also does this really dumb thing when he eats hot food, especially soups and stews, where after blowing on it, he sharply inhales while putting it in his mouth. I think it's a reflex to make the food seem not quite as hot, but as I've pointed out to him numerous times, it actually doesn't do anything to make the food not hot. &#x200B; In a sense I can't really blame him for any of these tendencies, as his parents/my grandparents have similarly abhorrent eating etiquette. The problem is that listening to him eat basically ruins the experience of eating for me whenever we eat together, which is pretty much every night at dinner, plus lunch on the weekends. I love soup, but I hate eating it with him because of the disgusting noises he makes. I also try to avoid eating breakfast with him as much as possible because while I don't personally eat cereal, he does, and it's a similarly unpleasant experience for me. &#x200B; I feel bad about this, because I know he probably can't help it and likely isn't aware of how loud he eats, which is why I never say anything to him. The biggest issue I take with it is that not only is he a loud eater, but he's also been hypocritical about it in the past. My brother (22) used to eat the same way when we were growing up, and I did as well to a lesser extent, and my dad was constantly criticizing us about it. My brother has for the most part grown out of it now, and while he still is noisy on occasion, his eating is nothing near as bad as what my dad's is like. I find the noises that humans make when eating, regardless of whether they're quiet or not, pretty gross regardless of who's making them, including my own eating noises. Because of that, along with my dad's criticism of my eating habits, I learned to be a lot quieter when I eat, and now the only time you'll ever catch me slurping my soup or smacking my lips is if it was a complete accident. So in a sense, I feel as though I've really improved my etiquette and noise level for my dad,<|response|> NTA You're fine. <|endoftext|>
136761	2	Aita guy mistakenly mows my lawn and I didn't pay him Today while I was home a strange man mowed my lawn. I texted hubby at work and asked if he had hired anyone (highly unlikely but you never know) and no. He knows that due to my history I don't open the door to men I don't know/am not expecting. He asked the neighbour to go over and see what was up. Neighbour wasn't quite home so it took a bit. Turns out the guy had misread the house number. Guy asked our neighbour if we were likely to pay him. He was given a diplomatic answer. Later Thai evening as I was getting the kids ready for baseball he walks up to me and asks if I can pay him for the work. He said that he had to re-assembke our plastic play structure (he's the one that moved it) I said that unfortunately I don't have the budget for that and I tanked him. He tried a few other tactics but I actually don't have money to give him. He eventually left. (He then, I later learnt that he went and complained about me to my neighbour, because he did a job and we should have paid him) so... Should I have come up with money to pay him? I don't carry cash so I really have no idea how this would have been accomplished but. Should I have worked something out? Aita for not paying a guy who mowed my lawn by mistake?<|response|> NTA. He made a mistake and now he had to eat it. <|endoftext|>
103653	3	AITA for constantly complaining about how other janitors do their job? I'm a janitor at a city bus station. I work with about four other janitors. Me and the daytime guy work for the bus company and are full time. The other three people are part time contractors. I have issues with the way they do things. I talk to them about it or complain to my boss pretty much all the time. I used to complain every day but at this point, I'm down to probably once every two or three weeks getting fed up and bitching to my boss about the same old crap. The main things that get on my nerves the most: When other janitors don't take the trash they collect to the dumpster. They leave it in the bucket in the janitor closet instead. This makes me super mad especially when I was days, I had to empty all the outside trash cans as well as the inside ones. So I'd be hauling anywhere from three to eight giant bags of trash (55 gallon bags) to the dumpster every single day. It would just piss me off that the night guy, who had three small trash bins to empty (two 13 gallons and one 4 gallon), would collect the trash but leave it in the janitor closet at the end of his shift instead of taking it to the dumpster. There's a guy that started a few months ago and decided to start using a cleaning cart. It takes up a ton of space but the real problem for me is, he puts trash in the yellow bag and then just lets it stay in there instead of taking it to the dumpster. It makes me mad when other janitors don't empty their mop water. I asked one guy why he didn't empty the mop water after he mopped and he said, "It's still good." Keep in mind, the water was used to mop three public bathrooms with and is black after that. There's no reason not to dump it. I hate it when other janitors don't wrap the vacuum cord properly. To me, it's irritating to find the vacuum cord wound in a ball around the handle or simple thrown on the floor. The biggest room we have to vacuum is not even 12 feet long. I hate having to untangle all 50 feet of vacuum cord before I can use the stupid, crappy vacuum. The last thing I really hate is when one of the guys stores toilet paper on the cleaning cart. The cleaning cart is dirty so the toilet paper gets dirty. I wouldn't want to wipe with dirty toilet paper and I don't think the people who use our bathrooms should have to. Honestly, if he would put them in a plastic bag to keep them clean while they were on the cart, I wouldn't mind. Talking to the other janitors directly has varying results. When the new guy who brought the cart came, I asked him why he wasn't emptying the<|response|> Hell naw buddy. Sounds like you're dealing with an asshole or two. Hopefully these guys move along to a new job! <|endoftext|>
81303	4	AITA for asking my friend not to come to my birthday dinner. My friend has gone to university in the same city as myself but we go to different universities. She lives in the city and I live at home since it is only a very short train journey for myself and even shorter for herself (she wanted to live there for the university experience). Now it’s mid November I’m really starting to realise that she is making very little time for me and very frequently bails on plans we make, she even left early from a movie we were watching together since she had other plans with friends that she only made the day of compared to us making the plans of the movie a few days prior. Is she trying to send me a sign that she doesn’t want to hang around with me anymore or is this just normal? Because of this being heightened recently, would I be the asshole if I asked her not to come to my birthday dinner since she would rather be somewhere else? Additionally: she’s very spotty with communication and infrequently replies to me.<|response|> NAH. People grow apart. Inviting her would only be a nice gesture, but if you really don't want her to come, don't invite her, but don't make a scene out of it. If she gets angry at the lack of an invite, take that opportunity to explain to her what's been bugging you. <|endoftext|>
48537	3	AITA My (24M) Gf (23FM) went to go watch a new movie her and I were supposed to watch together without me. Not that this has anything to deal with the main subject- but tl;dr gf and I just got back together after a 2 month break-up from a 6 year relationship. We told each other what our problems were and how to fix things. We're 3 weeks back together. One of the things we discussed was that I wasn't as spontaneous as I used to be. Of course, we grow up, we have other focuses on life, please understand. Two weeks ago I planned to surprise her to watch a new movie coming out. I asked what night she was free and we agreed to go on a date. As the date is coming up, she plans to surprise me also with dinner to one of my favorite restaurants on the same movie night. A few days before the date, she tells me her cousin is coming to visit on our date weekend. She says we can do it either sat or sun depends on her cousins plans. The weekend comes, we end up with her cousin the whole weekend, she says we can do it in two weeks (the next week she's going on vacation.) I agree, and understand- family is family, I have no control of that. What's done is done. She is on vacation with that same cousin and other cousins at this moment and she tells me "I'm going to go watch the movie with my cousins." I said "without me?" She said "well, they want to watch it (they already watched it by the way), I'll still watch it with you." I said okay. Am I the asshole for being upset? UPDATE 7/7/19 I AM the asshole.... GF got back today, we got in a fight. She told me she watched it because one of the cousins she was with-their dog died and they became an emotional wreck, so the vacation was pretty much a downer since everyone loved that dog and they needed to get it off their mind which is why they went to go watch.. I'm such an asshole.<|response|> NAH. It’s a 6 year relationship and everyone has road bumps. This seems like one really small thing—at the end of the day, it’s not about the movie, but who you’re spending it with. You can watch a different movie together, nbd. <|endoftext|>
56906	3	WIBTA if I didn't take the fall to protect my fiancé from his judgmental [religious] family and prevent him from being permanently rejected? His family are deeply Pentecostal and run their own church. It's *huge*. They're the definition of warriors of god.. He was actually banned when he was 12 because he grew his hair out... which represents Satan. He was later unbanned but steered away from church which started a history of awkwardness with him and his family. We aren't religious. His family knows this and have been told we don't want to go to church, be "saved", and we want them to respect us and it's been fairly peaceful thus far. They've never been rude to me, but we're aware they wish he was with a "godly" woman. Well, here comes trouble. I am bisexual. I strictly dated women before him. He knows and is okay with it. To keep things undramatic we didn't tell his family. We have a semi-open relationship where I am able to "hang out" with women, and if they're into it, we involve him. His idea and we're happy with it. I have a Tindr account and I'm not sure what happened but the settings on mine got reset and therefore instead of "only members I like can see me" for privacy being selected, my profile was publicly available and ANYBODY could see I have a profile on Tindr where my bio is flirty and aimed towards meeting other women with no mentioning of my fiancé. He knows of this profile, helped me with my bio, and even helped pick which photos to use. And of fucking course someone found it, made a fake FB and sent a message to him "exposing" me for being a cheater and said they're going to "tell the rest of his family too to finally get rid of that good for nothing wh*re". I want to come clean because I personally don't give a fuck what they think about us or me and our sex life is OUR sex life, and if they're homophobic we don't want them near us anyway (general life rule). Yet I don't want to be branded as unloyal because I am very loyal. He wants me to lie and say I was testing the waters online but didn't *actually do anything* so he doesn't have to admit that he was involved in my gay sins and have to deal w his family. At the end of the day they're family and he does love them so he doesn't want to be outcasted by all of them again. He said I don't understand how strict it is and how it's not a game we're playing and we gotta do what we gotta do to make it go away and they'll get over it eventually. AITA for potentially letting him get banned from his family? Should I just bite the bullet and take one for the team? TL;DR - someone found my Tindr profile, "exposed" me to fiancé who knew, gonna tell his fam, I want<|response|> NTA. He wants his family to hate you then? Because doing this is how he gets his family to hate and belittle you for the rest of your time together. No matter what else you do, no matter how long it's been, you'll still be that "d*$k cheater" to those kind of homophobes. If you're okay with being treated that way then go ahead. You should definitely explain it to him that way. <|endoftext|>
25429	3	AITA for asking my friend to reimburse me for my Uber? So to give some backstory, my roommate we'll call him A) and I went to California for spring break. We asked our friend (we'll call him T) to give us a 30 min ride to the airport In A's car. In return, A let T use his car for the week we were gone. He agrees, and drives us to the airport. The day before we got home, we texted T to ask if he could pick us up from the airport. He agreed and we moved on. Our planned flight got packed, so we had to roll over to a later flight. After a bit of a wait, we got on. About halfway through the flight we get a text from T saying he's too tired and he won't come pick us up. We land around midnight and right away we call T a couple times, but no answer. We start to contact other people trying to scramble for a ride, but everyone we contacted had either been drinking that night, or was asleep. Eventually, after no word from T, we called an Uber. The Uber turned out to be $45, but we finally made it home around 1:45. In the morning, I messaged him asking for him to reimburse me. He informed me that that day he had woken up not feeling good (which he never told us) and that after doing us a "big" favor by driving us to the airport. After some argument, he made it clear that he wasn't going to pay us back, and that we were being ridiculous for asking. Am I the asshole for feeling like he should have stuck to his word, and picked us up? Is it an asshole thing to do to ask for him to reimburse us for the Uber?<|response|> ESH. Your friend should probably have sucked it up, but finding a way home is ultimately your responsibility. I don’t see how the car stuff is relevant unless “A” was going to pay out the nose to keep his car at the airport while you were gone—which would likely have cost more than an Uber. Don’t try to charge someone for not doing you a favour. <|endoftext|>
123102	3	AITA for wanting to confront parents that I see smoking? Any time I see a parent or parents smoking with their children beside them or in a vehicle etc I just want to tell them if they truly loved their kids they wouldn't be potentially taking years off their lives from all the second hand smoke. Should I just not care?<|response|> YTA Smoking is a terrible habit but also really hard to quit. Parents know what they’re doing, and they know that’s it’s bad. Yelling at them will do nothing but make them angry at you. <|endoftext|>
161836	2	AITA for not agreeing to give our future child my girlfriend's surname? So we're coming up to 4 years in our relationship, and we've been having talks about having children in a relatively distant future. After marriage, she plans on keeping her last name, which I have no issues with whatsoever, it's her name so it's her choice. However, when it comes to what the children's last name would be, she didn't hesitate to say that they should be her surname, no questions asked, because of the following reasons: 1. Her paternal grandfather had 5 girls and 1 boy, and that boy is my girlfriend's father now, so he was the only one that had the surname passed down, while the rest of them had their name changed from marriage. She feels bad that her dad can't pass on his name and that his surname lineage will die out with his kids, and so she wants to do it in honor of her father. 2. She is not looking forward to the whole pregnancy and birthing process, from insemination to post-birth recovery, whether it's vaginal or C-section. She has read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos on all the possible risks that could happen and the damage it could do to her, both physically and mentally. The fact that she has to carry a baby for 9 months and have her body permanently scarred from giving birth, while her spouse remains unscathed and healthy without a care in the world, makes her think that she has the RIGHT to have the final say on the FULL NAME, first middle and last, without my having any say in the matter. Here are the reasons why I think the above are not valid arguments: &#x200B; 1. My father never had a father, so he's actually the first in a line of my family's last names to be passed down to another generation. In my opinion, both my father and my girlfriend's father are practically in the same boat here, so I don't think the first reason is applicable in this situation. 2. I can understand where she's coming from, and I feel bad for any partner I'm with to go through the child birth process, which is why I want to be there for her in every waking moment to provide the best comfort throughout her pregnancy stages and be able to nurture our child after birth for as long as she needs to recover! What she said, however, makes me feel like the effort I'm putting in doesn't even come close to what she has to go through, and makes me feel like I'm not involved with the family, like my opinion doesn't matter and my worth in the family is insignificant compared to what she'll be going through. So that's the situation....also, she added that if we were to adopt a child, she would CONSIDER allowing the child to have my last name and be open to discussion about it...I would be happy enough to just have our<|response|> Info why can't you guys hyphenate it? <|endoftext|>
29189	3	WIBTA if I file a police report against my bro's homeless dad for identity theft? (18M) Let me start off by saying I don't like the guy but this isn't about my personal feelings for him. This is more because my little brother (12y/o) adores him, my brother is fantastic at basketball and his dad's a great coach for him and even though I don't get sports I think he genuinely has a future in it, he just got invited to his first national tournament. Okay now that the background is out of the way here's the situation. So about 3 months ago I got a letter from the local power company saying that I was 1,000 dollars in debt to them from 2013, but here's the thing I was 13 at the time. So I called them to figure out what happened and once they told me the street address I immediately recognized it belonged to my old step dad. Obviously I was furious, so I talked to my mom about it to make sure she didn't give him permission to do anything like this, because he's a great manipulator and that was about the time they were thinking of getting back together (they didn't) and she assured that she would never let something like that happen and she was just finding out about it as well My mom called him and told him to either pay the debt or have it put back into his name. But the problem with that is he's currently living out of a tent in a friend's backyard so I know for a fact he won't be able to pay it but once it's out out of my name it's not my problem. He tells her that he'll do it and I thought that was that Yesterday I call the power company so I can make sure that this won't affect my credit or anything because I have no idea how that works and it's better to be safe than sorry seeing as how I'm planning on moving out in the next couple of months. So after asking her to check my name in their system the lady asks me "How would you like to pay your debt?" and I was LIVID (obviously I didn't take this out on her shes just doing her job) and I explained that I was minor at the time and she transfers me over to the debt collectors agency and after explaining that I was minor to a 2nd woman she helps me file a letter of dispute. But then she tells me that the power company may require me to file a police report and name anyone who I might think is a suspect if I want this to be taken out of my name. It's hard because when I was his exact age my dad started drinking heavily and fell out of my life and that was hard one me. I don't want my little brother to go through that too, seeing as how this is punishable<|response|> NTA, you're the victim of a serious crime. It may complicate your relationship with family members, but that doesn't make you an asshole. You're reporting a crime and protecting yourself. None of that is your fault. <|endoftext|>
36349	3	AITA if I don't pay for my son's camping supplies ? First time poster, moderate amount of time lurker here. My (32F) son (12M) is going on a 9 day long camping trip with his other family. For some backstory, I was never really with his father, he's a deadbeat, emotionally abusive POS , and my son doesn't care for him either. He loves his aunt and grandma though , so he really wants to go on this trip . I was hesitant at first but he convinced me, and promised to not fall behind at school while he's away. I agreed ONLY if I paid NOTHING towards this. His father has fought child support and I receive nothing , never have , never will. Obviously this makes me feel somewhat bitter at times, but I love my son and we're best friends so I dont usually feel upset about providing for him . Now I see my sons sleeping bag is horrible and wont be sufficient and he needs a bunch of other things as well. His dad just told him to bring a blanket and he isn't going to buy him anything. I refused to aswell. It seems petty because I want him to have a good time , but I swore I wasnt going to help pay for this. So AITA? A horrible mother , or both ?!<|response|> ESH I mean, if you're going to let you kid go, you can't do that without knowing that they will be safe and comfortable. And if you can't ensure that (whether that be by buying things yourself or asking the aunt or grandma), then you shouldn't let him go. It's really that simple. And then obviously the father is TA for refusing to buy anything for a trip he is organizing. <|endoftext|>
65115	4	AITA for being pissed that my mom told my dad how much I weigh? So I always used to be small/skinny and recently due to circumstances and the fact I like food, I have put on a lot of weight. I have started a new diet and so I’m due course weighed myself - and the result did shock me a little as I didn’t know I was THAT big. I didn’t tell anyone until eventually my mom coaxed it out of me and she said it would just stay between us. Now I have fat fingers, so when typing quickly at work I put the wrong weight making me look a lot heavier. I quickly readjusted this and apologised but she must have skipped over that message. When I mentioned it later she started swearing and saying “why the fuck would you lie” and then went into the kitchen and told my dad my weight. It really upset me because now he knows and my siblings heard as well. When I said she had no right she just said whatever. I have pretty much avoided her since this since I hate confrontation but she has not apologised or tried to say she’s sorry. AITA?<|response|> NTA Stop telling your mother things if she can’t be trusted to keep them in confidence. I will say that I generally consider romantic partners to be excerpt from secret keeping, but the way your mum told your dad in front of your siblings was extremely shitty and sounded really bitchy. <|endoftext|>
110178	3	AITA for resenting my flatmate over a stupid mistake? I've had a kitten for a couple of months now and she is mainly an indoor only cat. She is incredibly curious so will try to run out the door and explore if you give her half the chance. For new years I stayed over at a friend's house (don't drink and drive!). I told my flatmate I was going to be away for the night, but the kitten had everything she needed (food, water, litter etc) so he didn't need to do anything - just FYI. I do everything for the cat, but I did check with my flatmates before getting her that they were OK with having a pet in the house. Anyway around 4pm the next day as I'm driving back he messaged to say he hasn't seen the cat all day. When I got home and asked about it he said he hadnt seen her since the night before but didn't think he let her out because he only left the door open 'for a second' to put out beer bottles - but she may have slipped past him since she is so curious. I just left and started looking for the cat. I was pretty furious, because there is only one way she could have got out, and that was by her getting out when he opened the back door. It just seemed disingenuous to deny letting her out but saying 'maybe it was possible' to cover his bases. I figured it was better to walk away then say something snarky when I was stressed, tired and pissed off. Anyway this led to hours of searching, hitting up all the local social media, contacting the neighbours etc etc. Also ended up being a massive downer/distraction for the last night I had with my family from overseas because we were all so worried about her. I managed to find her just as it was getting dark on my last hunt through the neighbourhood climbing fences etc. Then it turned out she had been attacked by another cat while she was locked out all night. Her scratches got infected and led to giant cysts, a huge open wound that will take weeks to heal, multiple vet visits and $150 vet bill. The flatmate blamed it on the breed of cat as it was 'prone to happen'. Haven't found anything on the Internet to back that up and the vet didn't say it was a breed specific thing so.... I know the kitten is my pet, and my responsibility, and stress and vet bills come as part of the package. I just feel resentful that his mistake (he was probably drunk) has taken up hours of my time, caused stress and inconvenience, cost a significant amount of money and caused serious harm to my beloved pet. He hasn't apologised because he 'may or may not have' done it and I'm not really sure how I can get over it and not let it become a simmering resentment? Am I being an<|response|> Sorry but YTA. You already knew your cat was prone to trying to escape. You should have closed the cat in your bedroom with food water and liter. <|endoftext|>
59807	3	AITA for being sick of my sister's daily complaints about being single and letting it be known? Obligatory on mobile sorry about formatting notice Now by daily I mean daily. It's very rare a week goes by that doesn't have 7/7 days where she calls me up to "talk" that eventually leads to her crying about being single and "wasting" her 20s. Now she's 33f and i am 35f, I've been married since I was 26 and have 3 kids and a husband, something she said Id regret doing so early when we were both in our 20s. She's always been a party girl, and I a home body so yeah no duh we'd have different interests and lives. This all started about 2 years ago shortly after her 31st birthday. We all went to dinner as a family then DH took our kids so her and I could have a sister night in. We were each about half a bottle of wine down and talking about our lives how we are both over the dreaded 3-0 now Yada Yada. When she started crying saying she felt like she wasted her 20s partying, sleeping around, turning down "goos guys" for a one nighter.. I tried to comfort her, tell her it's ok she has plenty of time to havr kids get a guy etc. There are still some good single guys in their 30s without kids or a divorce, and there's nothing wrong with dating a divorced guy or single dad, or going for younger guys if she is dead set on never married +no kids. As the months went on these talks became more and more frequent, each ending with her saying she felt she wasted her 20s and me giving the same there are still guys for you speach. And her Facebook as been flooded with posts from older women who write articles about how they wasted their reproduction years and now have to settle for step kids or childless marriage if they can find a guy at all. Now for last 5 months its been nearly daily... Last night I snapped and told her yeah I know you wasted your 20s you turned down guys looking for long term for "Mr right now and has a functioning penis" you made your bed now lie in it and accept being forever alone or get out of it and go find Mr forever. You're young you got time. Just stop complaing every day. I may have been a bit harsh yes but I'm. Worried she's going down a dark path and I can only take so much of the same complaining over and over<|response|> NAH. She's lonely and afraid, and you have shit to do and recognize that her whining isn't productive. Sounds like she needed to hear bluntly to put herself out there and find someone, or shut up and accept the consequences of her choices. <|endoftext|>
174784	2	AITA for tearing up a certificate? Sounds terrible I know, but listen to me. Recently we had a awards ceremony at my school, something where they usually give out certificates for a bunch of stupid shit and then prizes for people who did well in certain areas(sport, academics and culture) I play rugby(I usually play flank but due to the lack of big guys in the team, I often get moved to lock) this year was probably one of the best years I've had playing. Anyway throughout the latter parts of the season, my coaches were telling me how I was a shoe in for getting forward an maybe even player of the year. I obviously felt good about it and this led me to believe that I would definitely be winning it. It gets to the awards ceremony and my mother tags along(she's supported me throughout the year when it.) We get to the awards ceremony and surprise surprise I don't get either reward the coaches said I would be getting. As I walk out I find out another player that had an absolutely mediocre season at most, had won the prize for forward of the year. This was the breaking point for me, as litteraly everyone in the team(yes the coaches as well) had said that he was mediocre. They usually give out certificates for playing for your provincial team and also for playing first team in my school. But unfortunately mine could not make it to the car even as I had been so frustrated with the decision that I tore both up. My mother gets to the car and asks to see them and is immediately furious about how I'm ungrateful and asks me what will my father or my coaches say if they find out. She then also goes ahead and says that she feels ashamed about me, and asks what she is supposed to say to her friends about me now. She then goes ahead and links my depression to me never valuing things that I get (despite me having every medal and award I have ever gotten hung up in my room) She even now refuses to answer my question on if we're still getting a puppy or not, citing her car has apparent problems. I have no sympathy for her for being mad about it, I honestly with all my heart believe I deserved more than a mere certificate and badge, Just wanted to know if I am the asshole in the story?<|response|> Yta. Wow, I wonder if this attitude carries over into the field and is part of the reason you didn’t get an award... <|endoftext|>
188032	3	WIBTA for restarting a "club" without letting the other "co-founder" take part? So... After my ex and I broke up, I started taking to this girl (C) from my past. At some point, C asked me if I was interested in building a "go cart" to go racing and my answer was yes. And so, we started building these cars. We did it for 3 years and for 2/3 years it was just the two of us building a car together and, for the most part, everything was a 50/50 split. (The third year there was another friend but he was really only half involved.) We took a hiatus because 1) we both started taking college classes again and 2) I was super uneasy about where my relationship with C was standing. (The mixed signals were hitting me like a truck, but anytime I asked what was up I'd get friendzoned so I needed some space to breath... but that's a story for another time.) Even with the space, I wasn't able to deal with the feelings that had developed until she finally told that she had been seeing someone for ~5 months later last year (was told in August). This broke my heart, and to this day, I'm still having difficulty interacting with her in person. (We work at the same place, so it's unavoidable sometimes.) So now the dilemma..... The go cart things was some of the dumbest fun I ever had, and I've made some new friends since shit kinda just the fan with C and I. I've talked about starting things up with this new friend group and they're all on board with it. At some point, during some random conversation, C also mentioned that she was interested in starting the go cart thing again. I wholly agree that starting things up without even talking to C would be a dick move.... But, I want to start this thing up again, without C being involved. Does that make me an asshole?<|response|> NTA. I thought this was some school club. I don't think you have any obligation to include C this is just seems like a hobby you love doing. And my word of advice just move on from C. You will end up just torturing yourself. <|endoftext|>
190604	3	AITA for telling my wife her dog isn't her baby? I've been married to my wife for about 2 years. A year ago we lost our daughter, Sarah at 5 months old. We got a dog, Samuel (or Sam-I-Am as she calls him) who my wife absolutely loves, we get into the house and she'll spend like 10 minutes talking to the dog saying things like "*mummy missed her baby*" ETC The dog loves her too, he literally follows her everywhere (*even to the bathroom*) We recently went out to meal with friends and they bought up children, they're planning. My wife said "we have enough on our hands right now with our baby!!" I said "he isn't your baby" then to friends I bought up the fact that next year or the year after we're going to start trying for a baby again. My wife now insists I was an asshole and should mind my business next time. AITA?<|response|> YTA. Yes, your wife's treatment of the dog might be over the top, but it is probably in part a reaction to the loss of your actual baby, so you should definitely cut her some slack. What did you hope to accomplish by correcting her in front of your friends? <|endoftext|>
191567	4	AITA if I tell my brothers we have a long lost brother my mom abandoned and denied? I recently found out that my mom had a son when she was 17, before marrying my dad. Growing up I remember seeing him a few times but I never made the connection because she kept it a secret from us that he is our brother. My mom has always been a very mysterious person with a dubious past. After meeting my dad she changed her name and left her own family behind except for a brother whom I eventually connected to and had the courage to ask him what is my mom's life story. This is when he told me about my half brother, whom I clearly remember coming over to our house and spending time with my mom. My mother never told any of us he is our brother, we moved from south America to north America and she basically ghosted him when he was 20 and I am utterly disappointed with her actions. My younger brothers and I have always questioned what her story is and why we dont know anything about her family. Furthermore, his dad and my dad past away within a year of each other when I was 12 and he was 20, which means that she literally left him in 3rd world sh*it hole to be on his own. I found my brother in social media and we are both very happy to have found each other. He doesn't hold any anger or resentment towards her but cannot understand why she disappeared from his life like that. I have not told my mother yet that I know all this because i know she will lie about it one way or another. My question is, would I be an asshole for telling my brothers about him and how should I go about it?<|response|> Info: have you talked to your mom about this? Maybe you should give her the opportunity to tell your siblings first. ETA: NTA if you give your mother the opportunity first and you talk to her about it in a level-headed way. <|endoftext|>
36428	4	AITA for getting annoyed at my husband because he doesn’t check the gas level in our car? So my husband - who is the love of my life, and for whom I will gladly chop off my arms and legs to feed to the crocodiles - shares a car with me. Lately, my husband has been the primary driver between the two of us - which I have no issue with at all, since it just makes logistical sense - and we usually carpool together since we work in the same city. However. I constantly need to remind my husband to look at the gas gauge. Not get gas, no - but to actually LOOK AT THE GAS GAGUE. THE ONE THAT IS POSITIONED AT EYE LEVEL ON THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY. AS HE IS DRIVING. He checks the speedometer, pays attention to the gear - but not to the gas! If I don’t remind him, he will let the gas light turn on before he notices that we’re low on gas, which really irritates me, since it’s my car! This has been a constant irritant for me since we were first married - at first it was just kind of an adorable quirk - “hey honey, look! Didn’t you notice that we’re almost out of gas? Tee hee!” But it’s REALLY starting to get old. Especially when I need to take the car somewhere and find that he tank is nearly empty. I lost my shit at him a little bit this morning - and Reddit, I need to know - am I the asshole for being frustrated at my husband for not paying attention to our gas level?<|response|> NTA. You have constantly reminded your husband to check the gas level. It's not like you kept silent and then blew up about it. It's understandable that you became frustrated after telling him so many times. <|endoftext|>
159872	2	AITA for wanting to send my son to nursery on the morning of my birthday? Family of four, partner asks what I would like for my birthday. So I suggest a day out at a local attraction. I suggested going either soon before or after my actual birthday, so that we can all go together. He doesn't like my suggestion, because he's just not into what it is. He also said that my son is too little for it (2 years old) and will find it boring. After some thinking I agree. My son has just started nursery and is still settling in. Consistency is really important at this point so I want him to attend unless he's ill, at least for the first month, so he gets used to it. I then suggest that we go in the morning on my actual birthday, so that both I get to experience it, and my son won't be dragged round something that he will find boring. His nursery days are fixed, and one of his days falls on my birthday, there's no way around it. My partner then accuses me of being selfish and is shocked that I would want to 'spend my birthday without him'. I feel like I can't win at this point. Was this a shitty/selfish suggestion of mine? We'd pick him up in the early afternoon, and still spend at least half of my birthday all together.<|response|> NTA, I don’t understand what your partner wants you to do? Your child is 2, he’ll probably not remember whatever it is that you do anyway. <|endoftext|>
59722	5	AITA For Wanting To Extend My Vacation While My GF Goes Home? My GF and I live in Canada and are planning a trip to France & Germany. Her work has less paid vacation than mine so she wants to limit the trip to two weeks. Unpaid time off is not an option for her as she has stated that she cannot afford it. I thought a good compromise would be we travel together for two weeks and then I go off and do my own thing for a bit but she got a bit upset at this suggestion saying she would feel like I was abandoning her. The last time I went on a trip without her (which she had declined due to financial reasons) I had offered to pay for the whole thing but was not taken up on the offer. AITA here or WIBTA if I kept pushing the idea of me travelling for a longer period of time?<|response|> Info. How long have you been dating? How old are you each? My leaning is NTA, but if you have been together a long time and are close to engagement this is going to be more sensitive. I am an independent woman and wouldn’t have an issue with my fiancé taking a trip without me or extending a trip we had been on if I needed to head back. <|endoftext|>
177417	4	WIBTA if I don't inform my mum's family when she passes? First let me say I'm adopted and I was adopted almost before I aged out, nevertheless my adopted mum has been my mum for over twenty years now. My mum is, in all honesty, a doormat. She's had everyone walk over her in life and basically thanks them. She's about the nicest person you'll ever meet and she'd give you her last cent if you needed help but she's horrible with knowing when to say fuck off. She has two older brothers who are twins who haven't helped her ever. This might be because she's gay and they're religious bigots or because they're just assholes. (Considering one refuses to acknowledge his kids from his first marriage and the other refuses to acknowledge his son is autistic, I'm going with assholes). When her partner of eighteen years died of cancer, no one showed up to the funeral except one cousin, when she lost her home afterwards (landlord kicked her out as they found out she was gay), neither of her brothers would let her move in as what if their kids needed the space while they were at college? (Spoiler alert: they didn't). Her cousin did let her move in and then stole a couple grand from her and kicked her out while she was recovering from appendix removal. This all happened before I came into her life, since I've been a part of her life they have continued to act like shitheels. She's been unfortunate to have gotten cancer three times. Her brother Kyle showed up when she had breast cancer and waited while she had surgery, he left in a huff when the doctor reamed him out for trying to be bossy as I was the one who was at all her appointments (I didn't prompt the doctor in any way, Doc just didn't like this attitude). Since then, Kyle hasn't shown up to anything and never visited her in the hospital even when she had a stroke. Todd has never showed up to anything health related or otherwise, however, his wife screamed at my mum until she cried as she blamed mum for upping her daughter's chances of cancer even though she herself had breast cancer. As for how they treat me? For the first couple of years, they claimed I wasn't really adopted but was in some weird lesbian relationship with her. Later on, they started to warm up to me as I was dating a guy but turned right around when I had the audacity to get married to an amazing woman. (I'm bi). During the past five years, her one brother Kyle has met my wife exactly once, her other brother Todd doesn't bother. And since I had the nerve to transition in the last three, they refuse to acknowledge me even more (my name is left off everything from them). Due to all this, I don't believe they should know anything about her passing when it comes. I refuse to listen to them cry over<|response|> NTA, they chose to treat her like shit and treat you like shit. Not one of them has earned the right to seek forgiveness even after passing. Them attending the funeral may actually damage your grieving. Tell them after you've had time to recover. <|endoftext|>
187141	2	AITA for not helping my mom get rid of the skunk stuck in her backyard? My mom lives with just her senile mom. She called me yesterday to tell me there was a skunk that has been stuck in the empty waterless spa in the backyard for a few days. She found that out yesterday from her Ring app’s motion sensor history. She is scared of skunks. I was the relative who lived the closest, so she called me to help her take it to the nearby mountain. I told her I walked too close to a skunk before and it smelled like the stinkiest durian so I didn’t want experience that again. She said she had surgical masks and gloves. However, I was firm in my stance that I would not get anywhere near that thing. She called me a coward. I heard from my mom just now that her brother who lived 80 miles away drove over to her house to help her get rid of the skunk. She said my uncle was a real man who could deal with the stink and wishes I would stop being such a scared little kid. I told her that she could have dealt with her own problem or pay someone to do it. She said I needed to become a real man or no woman would ever love me. I hung up after that real fast. I didn’t feel like hearing that shit again. She called me a few more times but I didn’t pick up. She sent me angry text messages for disrespecting her and not hearing what needs to be said. I didn’t return any messages yet either.<|response|> NTA she can’t call you a coward when she’s scared of doing it too. <|endoftext|>
7979	4	AITA for arguing over a homebrew rule in an RPG? If more of a question of if it was justified. If any of you reading have played shadowrun you will know how cyber and bioware works then you can skip the next paragraph, those who haven't played or need a refresher read on, and strap in, it's gonna be a bit of a read. So in the grimdark cyberpunk future there is both magic and technology, but they tend not to mix very well. Every character has 6 essence, it's basicly your soul and the less you have the less "human" you are. (there are fantasy races and such in shadowrun put they are an extension of human so everyone is called a metahuman) What this means for the average person is you start the lose emotions and become more cold and logical in your actions. What this means for a Shadowrunner (one of the player characters) is how much bad ass cybernetics or biological modification (Cyberware and Bioware respectively) you can cram on to your character. For non mundane (aka magical/awakened) characters this is how effective your magic is and if you lose essance you lose magic, you can get it more of it to make up for the loss through exp, known as karma in this system, but most magic users only get very little and only if nessisary. Now you don't lose 1 ESS per piece of 'ware it depends on how invasive it is, replacing an eye takes very little, but replacing your entire nervous system takes a lot, and better grades of 'ware use less ESS as well. I think that covers the basics. **Experienced shadowruners start reading again** So the homebrew rule was as follows: Characters must stay above one essance" normally you have to stay above zero. Now this may not sound too bad but, that's about 15% of your potential for advancement gone as a mundane character, and the ablility to spend essance like that is a mundane's only real advantage, but my big issue was that he didn't put up anything to offset it. It's like in D&D where fighters don't get anything special but they get a metric assload of extra feats and then you take away those extra feats. Now here's where the 100% I was an asshole part comes in, I argued this, for several hours, and enough that the GM was ready to not run the game. Now I didn't inturpt a session, and the game hasn't started yet. He did eventually see my side and we did make up after. But still, I want to know if you guys think this is justifiable or not. I'll be around here and there if anyone needs any clarification on anything I said.<|response|> Eh, I'm tending towards asshole. [Am familiar with shadowrun btw] While lobbying the GM for stuff is a fun part of any game, and something all of my groups do to some extent, you should be prepared to take "no" for an answer. Part of the payoff of being GM is deciding how you want the world. If you want a particular ruling or thing, then you should be prepared to run a game with that. As a rule of thumb, I'll send one "Hey, can we have [thing]?" message, and maybe one "C'mooon, [thing] is totes balanced. Pretty please?" message, if the GM is someone I know well and I really want the thing. <|endoftext|>
192616	3	AITA for leaving the party? A few months ago I went to a frat party with my best friend. It was my very first one, and I wasn’t very comfortable. I stayed for her sake, but eventually she disappeared off with some guy. I called her out for leaving me, to which she replied that she was inside and would be out any minute. She was actually ten minutes away at this guys place, and cut contact for literal hours. I ended up leaving after the first hour of her not answering, because I was uncomfortable and I only knew one person (her friend from high school that I met two different times.) I’m posting this now because recently she made a comment that made it seem like I was the villain of that night, because I left the party. Her whole argument is that she is her own person and can do whatever she wants, and I shouldn’t have left the party without her. Also, that she told me she was leaving and I didn’t offer the same courtesy, except she didn’t tell me she left until I noticed and texted her. My only problem with her argument is that if she doesn’t need me, why should I have stayed at the party? Why bring me at all if you didn’t want to hang out at said party??? I’m really confused and I have apologized for making her feel like I was controlling her, but she doesn’t want to admit any fault from that night. And now I can’t help but think if I should even bother with this friendship if she can’t own up to how much she hurt me. AITA for leaving? AITA for wanting an apology?<|response|> NTA. Your friend is definitely in the wrong here. You felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave. She ditched you. And then gets angry because you don't feel like waiting around for her to un...ditch you? Find better friends to party with. It's unsafe to have an unreliable friend take you out to party when you know no one else. <|endoftext|>
81853	2	AITA for covertly recording the conversations I have with coworkers/boss? For the past year or so, I have gotten into a habit of regularly covertly recording conversations I have with coworkers and my superiors at work. I just use my mobile phone. I usually don't end up reviewing the recordings, but if it turns out to be a heated/high stakes discussion, I do find them useful sometimes, and I \*never\* share the recordings with anyone (this would implicate me, obviously). It's a practice I started in my last job, which was a pretty toxic work environment. I would have meetings that I experienced as going really well, and then later hear indirect reports from others that the meetings went terribly. After this happened a number of times, I felt like I was going crazy, so out of desparation I sneakily recorded the conversations so I could listen back to them later, and have a bit more of an objective view of how they went. Not so I could prove it to anyone else that I communicated well, but just so I could prove to myself. I'm in a new job now, and things are much better, but I still do it occassionally. I don't share the recordings, but I am recording my coworkers without their consent. AITA?<|response|> What you’re doing is possibly illegal. <|endoftext|>
116656	5	AITA for threatening a break up because my boyfriend won't go out with me Okay for a little context, I've been in a relationship with "Ren" for about 10 months now. I wouldn't say it's a loving relationship because I'm practically the only one trying at this point. He's a gamer bi dude that's still in the closet with his family. Now in the beginning he was really sweet, he would move his best friend of 7+ years just so I could sit next to him. He would wait for me outside of my class when they ended. He would text me asking where I was when I was late. But that lasted about a good month and then stopped. But the thing is, over time I've come to actually love Ren despite that. Recently though, he would have times off weeks or multiple days at a time and as an outgoing guy I like eating out and watching movies and maybe the occasional park. He doesn't tell me anywhere he'd like to go so I bring him to places I like, maybe enabling him to develop his own opinion. But nada. In 10 months we've gone on 4 dates alone together. 4. Every other time I would join him in his DND campaigns or get blown off. 20 times I've been blown off and by now I've gotten pissed at him. He would say he's busy but then I hear from his friend that they met up two days in a row. Honestly I'm glad he's spending time with them, but it feels like he'd rather spend his time with literally anyone else. I try to offer to spend time with him at home if he doesn't want to go out but still.. nada. I get that he's still in the closet so I'm not just gonna go up and grab his ass whenever, so like??? I threatened a break up with him he doesn't change this and I feel kind of an ass? Is my psyche just being over self critical again or does/do it/I have a point? TLDR: Boyfrind of 10 months keeps blowing me off. Saying he's busy then meeting with friends. Threatened to break up. AITA<|response|> NTA - Every human being has a basic need to be loved. To feel wanted. To feel needed. He’s not giving you any of that, unless it’s convenient for him. It was great in the beginning. But it sounds like the novelty has worn off for him. If you’d like, and you’re comfortable, you could PM me for a larger conversation. I have experience with this, and I know how gut wrenching it can be to be in this position. <|endoftext|>
186507	3	AITA for barring my American roommate from partying while not stopping my Vietnamese roommate? I (24F) live in a student dorm. We live close to a college that specializes in agriculture and does a lot of exchanges with international students. So I have 1 dutch roommate (I'm dutch too), 1 vietnamese roommate and 1 american roommate. I'm graduating this year and I'm the oldest. The international students party a lot with their friends from their home country, and while I'm super introverted, I don't mind it. The walls are really thin and I can hear basically everything, but as long as they keep it to the weekends I'm cool with it. Now here's the problem: the two party completely differently. My vietnamese roommate, S (20F), has friends over sometimes and they cook and get drunk together. They're loud as hell but always quiet down before midnight. When the party is over, they wake up early in the morning, clean up, leave us leftovers, and sometimes her friends stay and just clean the whole damn place just for the hell of it. Which is too much imo, but you can see why I've got no problem with them. My american roommate, B (20somethingithink M), is the complete opposite. He and his friends are loud as shit too, but they're also destructive as shit, yell weird shit like about how they wanna kill vegans (????? I know this sounds like a joke but they actually do this) and other strange things, just make a huge mess and then don't clean it up in the morning. Every time they have a party I have to lock the door because his drunk ass friends can't differentiate our doors from each other and keep accidentally barging into my room. They're seriously really weird and aggressive and I'm a 5'7" girl who could not defend herself if they started like, moshing into my room or something. So I talked to some friends about this and they said I'd better go to the landlord. I did, and now they're not allowed to party anymore. It saves them money because B and his crew keep breaking shit (he has some anger issues I'm pretty sure), and it leaves me feeling safe enough in my room. But B heard about it and got *pissed*. He called me racist over it. He didn't call me racist towards americans, but he said I was being "positively racist" towards S and her friends, and that I "banned" him from partying but not them because I'm scared of being called a racist. I explained how it's not the concept of parties I'm bothered by, but *how* they both party, and that S and her friends are super considerate etc so I don't see a point in "banning them" from having parties as well. He disagreed and is sulking. I don't think I'm the asshole, but idk how parties usually are in america except from comedy movies and those do look pretty wild, and if the way they party is considered normal because of that I<|response|> NTA. American roommate is being a giant, selfish baby. Race has nothing to do with it. You have considerate, respectful partiers, and inconsiderate, rude ones. <|endoftext|>
110942	3	AITA for getting mad/frustrated at my girlfriend's constant messes/accidents? So this is a spur of the moment post and I'm going to keep it brief. My girlfriend is extremely clumsy and has a tendency to leave messes out hoping that I'll clean them. She basically lives in my dorm room because my roommate lives in his girlfriend's single room. But when my parents came to pick me up for Thanksgiving break they made a comment about the mess that I had made in my room. The problem was that it was mostly dirty clothes and dishes that I hadn't had time to get to. I hadn't used any of those clothes or dishes. She's broken three pairs of rather expensive headphones of mine because she either wasn't paying attention or in the case of one such pair fell onto them. She has lost two different computer mice that I've given her so she could play video games. And tonight she asked me to make her ramen. So after I made her ramen and I hand it to her she stands up, with the bowl, to get something. As she goes to sit down she tips the bowl and it spills all over my futon. I just am getting tired of all of this and feel like a massive asshole for feeling this way.<|response|> NTA. She breaks something or messes something up, it's her obligation to clean, repair, or replace it. That's just fair. She's not taking care of things because she doesn't value them. She doesn't value them, because she is not held accountable for their damage or loss. She needs to pony up, with money, inginuity, and elbow grease. That's just what's fair. <|endoftext|>
96633	4	AITA? was I being a Karen at an all school meeting, regarding wasted budget? I go to a very small (eighty person enrollment) graduate, technical college, which includes a fee in the tuition, $275, for student activities. While we do have small professional organizations, their involvement has significantly lessened over the years because people are just too busy with academia, and part time jobs. During an all school meeting-- which honestly could have been an email, because it introduced minor staff we would never see, and review of academic integrity, our SGA president mentioned 'the legacy fund.' The legacy fund is left over money funded by the $275 charge that organizations have not used; they've somehow accumulated over almost TEN. GRAND (last year I heard they had 6K, sitting there). SGA president wants to use the money for a media platform to streamline the school's 'social media,' ie: institutional events, and announcements, costing $2,500, and then $1,000 annually. We already have a FREE facebook page where a lot of announcements go; sure it's not perfect, but it's not 2.5K. I a. find it disgusting they have this kind of money sitting around, and b. wouldn't benefit from this supposed-god-send-of-a-program anyways as I am graduating this spring. I raised my hand: 'How do you justify having this egregious, growing amount of money, continuing to charge us every year (referring to the student activity fund), and wanting to use it on a pricey program? Only few will benefit from this expense, and the problem that isn't that crucial. Could you advocate for discontinuing a fee we obviously don't need' \-- 'I don't control the billing.' we kinda had a mini stare down following. AITA for critically confronting this massive waste of time, and money? like $275 if half of my rent, and $100 is enough groceries in the month, to put it in perspective, and I find this whole ordeal insane, especially for the many students who work really hard, financially, to be here. THANKS<|response|> YTA a bit for your tone and wording - I don't think 10k is a crazy buffer to have sitting around for a school and certainly not egregious for a college that probably has an operating budget of $1M+. Some activities have 1 off costs for either startup or need expensive equipment replaced, etc. And part of life is always going to be paying for people that come after as businesses and schools upgrade their things. And to put things in other perspectives many professionals (who would probably be setting up these media platforms) charge over 100$/h. 2.5k is not a large amount of money to have a professional media platform. Personally I would be less inclined to enroll at a college if they used facebook as their main online presence. <|endoftext|>
160167	3	AITA for wanting my work removed from a game where I wasn't properly credited? A few months back I made a minecraft noteblock cover of the song "Canzoni Preferite" (More commonly known as the torture dance from JJBA: Golden Wind) and recently I've discovered that the song was ripped into a roblox game called "tower defense simulator". I got in contact with the creator of the game, and it's apparently being removed in the next update (although it remains to be seen if it actually gets removed or not) For context, it's one of the more popular roblox games, there's tons of YouTube videos on it, and it seems fairly well known. My video currently has arround 200K views, most of them being from before the song got ripped, so it hasn't given me much exposure. The song is used as audio for an in-game emote, where the emote animator is credited, but not me, who made the song. I originally asked to be credited, but that was apparently too much, and it would be removed instead. So, the asshole take: It doesn't matter if I'm credited or not, it wouldn't make a difference, and I'm just being a dick towards people who have the emote. It's a cover anyways, and not an original song, and anyone could just re-make the cover anyways The non-asshole take: They shouldn't rip my content like that, no matter how easily replicatable it is, if it's easy to just re-make, then re-make it and use that. Since my cover was used, I deserve to be credited in-game, and since that was too much, agreeing to removing it was the right thing to do<|response|> NTA - I don’t even really understand the details of what you created but that’s irrelevant. Asking for credit is 100% NTA territory. If they don’t want to credit you, fine, they can take it down. I don’t understand why they wouldn’t bother just adding your credit to it but whatever <|endoftext|>
69348	2	AITA for asking someone to wash their hands before touching my kid? I’m not a hypochondriac and I don’t think I’m a germaphobe, but my kid’s just been born 3 weeks ago and her body is just coming to terms with everything in the world. Of course there’s no way I could ever protect my child from all the germs, and I don’t really want to be one of those parents either. The other day, a friend of ours came to visit with his boyfriend. The friend came first and his boyfriend showed up like 40 minutes later straight from work. The boyfriend works at a school that I know is comprised of a high majority of kids that come from homes that deal with lots of drug and alcohol problems. In this school, they deal with all sorts of illnesses - some of which we thought couldn’t exist in a 1st world country. I know this for a fact because my wife used to work at this particular school (left 2 months before the boyfriend started working there). In any case, when the boyfriend arrived, I asked if he would mind just washing his hands first before he handled our child. He seemed to be totally cool with it at the time and we had what was seemingly a lovely time. Later in the evening, My wife gets a text from our friend where he was accusing us of basically calling them filthy. We were completely blindsided by this. I called him up in the morning and tried to explain that I never assumed that they had bad hygienic habits, it’s just that school’s can be full of all sorts of germs, and that school is exceptionally prone to this. I also work at a school, so I explain that I also wash my hands every time I come home just before I handle my kid so it isn’t like I just singled his boyfriend out. The conversation sort of took this weird twist where they thought that I was being homophobic somehow, and I tried to diffuse the situation but seemed to make it worse by doing that weird defensive thing that all the homophobic/racist people tend to do; “my brother in law is gay and we love him. I’m not homophobic”. I don’t know why I did that, or how that would’ve helped the situation, but yeah, it didn’t help and he had to leave and the conversation ended. Anyway, I personally feel like this was completely blown out of proportion. I don’t think I was being an asshole in that sort of context. At the end of the day, if our child gets sick, we’re the ones who are going to have to stay awake all night with an uncomfortable baby who can only communicate by crying and screaming. Does that make me one of those entitled parents? Maybe it was a bit rude? I don’t really know, but I never got the vibe at the time that either of them took offense and we were suddenly blindsided<|response|> NTA completely normal request with newborn <|endoftext|>
145390	3	AITA for not texting my boss back when he text me after work? My boss got real upset with me. Because he'll text me after work and ask me work relevant questions. I.e.what products we have in stock If so and so check in with me about a project. If we have any deliveries coming. And he does most of this after I clock out. I don't text him back, at least when I'm off the clock. I don't use my phone when I'm at work. And I don't feel like work should expect me to essentially work. Or answer work-related questions, if I'm not working. But the second I clock in , i'll open the messages and respond to them. Or I'll go to him if he's available A stray text every once in awhile doesn't bother me. If I got one a week. I would not raise any issue about that. I understand that things happened. But it's just a barrage of texts almost daily. edit #1 I'm hourly. I clocked in and out. I'm not salary Edit #2. Love the people that are telling me to put in a time adjustment form. Might just have to.<|response|> NTA! If he wants you on call, then he can pay you to be on call. <|endoftext|>
18200	2	AITA for ruining cheating ex's chances with other guys? Longtime lurker here, never posted tho! So yeah, I met this girl Sarah close to 2 years ago now, at the end of my last semester at uni and we really hit it off. We started dating after casually going out for a bit, and we ended up dating all the way up until early November 2018, when I found out that she had some sort of FWB type bullshit with a guy we knew at uni, and I broke it off, cold turkey and basically told her to go fuck herself. It still hurts like shit, since this was a fairly long term thing, age considered, and she didn't seem that guilty to me. We do however have mutual friends so we see each other sometimes, and I kept her on my social media stuff, which is how I found out she was flirting with some new guy, Tommy. Tommy's actually a nice enough dude, and since I can't say I trust Sarah one bit, I messaged him telling him about the cheating and all the bullshit she did. He didn't believe me, but we met last month at a party, in which I pulled him aside, and told him all about her, and by the end of it, he seemed pretty turned off on her, and he cut it off a few days later. Despite this, and the fact that things seemed somewhat serious between Tommy and Sarah, she had a new guy just last weekend, at another party. This guy was pretty decent, and when I caught Sarah looking my way with a shitty expression, I just lost it, and told this new guy all about her. They got into an argument, him saying something about diseases and storming off. The room was divided, some were on my side, some were obviously pissed at me and Sarah was FURIOUS. She basically went on a huge rant about how I'm a jealous asshole who can't let things go, and all this shit about me being controlling and possessive, so I just kind of left in the middle of her lecture. She's DM'd me on a bunch of apps, basically berating me/asking me why I did that, to which I've not really responded outside of a "K", or a thumbs up. A couple of her friends have said similar shit, and called me sexist and all that bullshit. So, is she right? Am I a possessive asshole, or was I in the right?<|response|> ESH - she's obviously an asshole for cheating on you but you need to move on because it's petty af for sabotaging her multiple times like that <|endoftext|>
85584	3	AITA if I start a podcast about my family/my life and I use actual names? I want to start a podcast about my life. It would be comedy, with drama and dysfunction mixed in. I would essentially discuss funny stories and the drama of growing up in my family and the things I have faced in life since leaving home. I am from a rather large family (like more than ten children) and I am the second oldest. My family has had a lot of dysfunction between the bunch of us. Whenever I tell people about my family they get enthralled. People can't fathom that that much hilarity and drama can happen in one family. And I am constantly asked what it is like growing up in such a large family. I like the structure of podcasts since it doesn't have to follow a set path, it isn't restricted like a book, and I can essentially discuss whatever I want. I can also invite some of my siblings to banter with me. It will also be a bit therapeutic to put some of this stuff out there. I don't expect to really have a bunch of listeners or to get popular. It would serve as an outlet for me. But some of the stuff is a bit dark and will paint some of my family in a poor light (my mother and I/several of my siblings don't have a good relationship and a lot of stuff stems from that). I would like to just use the actual names of everyone involved. It is difficult to keep track of fake names for everyone involved (including friends and extended families) and the stories will flow easier. I also won't be able to hide all of the identifying info in the stories, such as locations. AITA if I use the real names and it comes back to bite my family members?<|response|> YTA. Come up with aliases for everyone and write yourself a script or outline. You already know the stories, so it’s not like it’s going to sound super forced, but it will help you keep track of the aliases you’re using. <|endoftext|>
43005	4	AITA for not wanting to be around MIL I never had a problem with my MIL before my son was born. I knew she was overbearing and a bit crazy, but I was never really around her. Prior to baby, we only hung around his family for special occasions. And even then, we always made plans afterwards so we would have an excuse to leave early. My H can only take his parents (his mom) in short doses. Fast forward to 2 years ago when LO was born. Everything changed. MIL couldnt make the transition from parent to grandparent. She made it clear that LO was HER baby and that she was going to do whatever she wanted. she crossed all my boundaries. She did not care what I wanted for my child. I would tell her not to do something and she would do it behind my back. She even went so far as to lie about it. I would ask her to her face and she would lie repeatedly. Over time I started to hate her. The mention of her name would send me into a panic attack. I cant even tell you the number of times I've cried over something she did. I wanted to parent my child, but she made me feel less than and that I was inferior to her authority. She has no respect for us. She has said that whatever my H tells her goes in one ear and out the other. In the past he has attempted to talk to her about what bothers me but she doesnt care. When LO was about 5 months old, I reached a breaking point. I felt physically ill and mentally drained. I know MIL will always be a part of my life because she will always be a part of LO's life. Because of that, I seeked out therapy. And I'm doing so much better. I still cant stand MIL but I no longer cry. She has not changed but I have learned how to deal with it better. A part of why I no longer feel horrible is because I distance myself from her. Outside of special occassions, I opt out of activities. If I'm not around her then I dont feel bad. Being around her causes anxiety...which my H knows. It bothers my H that I dont wabt to hang out with his mom. He doesnt like that I dont want to eat lunch with her on a random Saturday. Or that I don't want to invite her to the park with us. To him, his parents are family and even though I dont like his mom, he thinks I should suck it up and still hang out with her. I dont keep LO from MIL. I tell my H that hes more than welcome to have lunch with his mom and LO. I jsut dont want to be there. Am I the asshoke for not sucking it up? I'm always polite and kind when I see her. But it takes alot out of me.<|response|> NTA. You have no obligation to expose yourself to toxic people. However I beg you to reconsider letting her near LO unless H is directly supervising AND enforcing YOUR rules for LO’s care. Your MIL has no business undermining your parenting and if she’s still disregarding your decisions, she shouldn’t have access to your child. <|endoftext|>
8366	3	AITA - Crosswalks and honking I was biking to the bookstore when I was about to cross a crosswalk with a car halfway on it, dropping off someone. The passenger got off, we both started moving, then they stopped and let me cross first, but right when I was in front of it it honked. I turned my head instinctively and saw someone who may or may not have been on her phone out of the corner of my eye. Should I have let them go first? Or were they honking at the other person for possibly being on her phone?<|response|> Not an asshole. At worst this is a traffic mishap, such things are far from asshole indicators. Now, around here you need to be walking your bike to enjoy the rights of a pedestrian. So if you were riding you would have needed the vehicular right-of-way rather than using the crosswalk. <|endoftext|>
7263	3	AITA for questioning the idea behind a subreddit?<|response|> I don't know the rules for sure but this seems too meta for this sub. We aren't for reddit spats, it would just turn to vote brigading. <|endoftext|>
157822	1	AITA for not walking out on my(24M) partner(28F) after a discussion on my mental health? I've been struggling with mental health issues for the better part of a year now, but a couple months ago I met this girl who I have a lot of fun with, she's really cool and quite pretty. I enjoy being around her. The problem is yesterday we were discussing how I feel lost in life and have a hard time answering "why" to existence in general. She proceded to tell me how all I was doing was whimpering and that my problems will be solved if I just go and do something, her argument is basically that I need to act and stop complaining about my lot in life. After this I decided I didn't want to keep talking to her, so I stood up, apologized and told her it would be better if we spoke another day. I left her house while she kept telling me she didn't want me to go but I basically ignored her. I sent her a text next morning but hasn't answered since. AITA for not listening to what she wanted to say? Should I really just go out there and stop whimpering? I'm quite confused. &#x200B; UPDATE (if anyone cares): I spoke to her earlier today, she agreed the way she handled things was immature and not helpful to my situation. I agreed next time I won't run away from my problems, also to hurry up on that psychiatric help. Thanks for all the comments, everyone helped me realize we are not each other's enemies here, we'll be fine for now. <3<|response|> WAIT!! how do I edit the title?? I DID walk out on her! <|endoftext|>
149594	3	AITA For Not Tipping The Nicest Restaurant Waiters Twice? I was at a restaurant four days ago. I had my food, left a tip, and went home. The next day, I noticed that my watch was missing. I kept looking for it for three days before I realized that I might have left it at the restaurant. This was a fairly expensive watch, costing me around $7,000+ when I first got it. I went back to the restaurant and sure enough, four days later, it was still there and they kept it safe until I could pass by and get it back. I took the watch, thanked them, and left relieved that I found my watch. The waiters seemed pretty happy to have done something good, smiling and waving at me asI left and asking me to come again (It was my first time at this particular branch). When I told my friend about this, he asked if I tipped them, and I said I didn’t. He said I was the asshole for not giving them an extra tip for not stealing my expensive watch. So AITA??<|response|> You're now NTA, no one expects a tip for something like this so even if giving them a tip would have been nice you're not an asshole for not doing it, your sincere thanks and appreciation was enough. Speaking of which, thanks for fixing the post. I'm not gonna give you a tip for it though. Previous pre-edit Comment: > YTA for whatever you did to the formatting of this post and making me have to read it like this. <|endoftext|>
189224	3	AITA for asking my sister to babysit my kid so I could have sex? I (20s, f) have a 3 year old daughter with my boyfriend. We both work full time, so when our daughter gets back from daycare we tend to spend all of our time with her, which we both love. We have a pretty active sex life (I think this is relevant to why my sister thinks I am TA), we do it probably four times a week. However, we haven't had a whole day to ourselves in a long time. My sister has been asking if she can have my daughter for a sleepover for ages, but we've never got round to it, because we always agreed that if we were having a weekend without our kid, we should plan something interesting to do that we wouldn't be able to do with her. This was something I'd told my sister, but she didn't say we have to do something cool for her to agree to have her niece. So, recently my boyfriend and I found a show we both wanted to go to. I asked my sister if she still wanted to have my daughter for a night, and she said yes. I didn't mention the show because it was just one of our favourite bands performing in a local bar so it wasn't that big of a deal. My bf and I have both had stressful weeks at work, so we decided we would just chill out the next day. The show was on Friday, we got our daughter at around 7pm Saturday. We got her so late because my sister booked them tickets to go to the zoo, and then they went out for dinner, and then they had to drop my mom home, because she went with them. I didn't really mind when we got her, my sister said she had plans for the whole day. We spent the Saturday just chilling out, watching our favourite show, and having sex, to be honest. It had been a while since we last got the chance to just spent a lot of time having fun in that way; because of the work stress we've been just having quickies. When I went to pick up my daughter, my sister asked what we'd been up to. I told her that we went to a show on Friday, and we basically just chilled today. She asked if we'd been having sex because I looked 'messy', and I told her yes. We're close with things like this, so I laughed a little. She immediately soured, and when I got home I got a message from her saying it's wrong of me to palm my kid on her because I wanted to fuck, and she said that she thought if I was giving her my kid I would be out doing something beneficial and memorable. I said that we did do something memorable Friday, and it's not my fault she booked up the next day, but she still thinks we should have<|response|> Jesus Christ NTA. She said she'd take her and really its none of her business what you wanted to do <|endoftext|>
80987	3	AITA for wanting gf to do 90% of the chores at home? I(26F) and gf(31F) live together. We have lived together for almost a year now. And it’s been mostly downhill ever since we lived together. I’m tired of having to do 70% of the chores. And. Working 50 hour weeks. Whilst gf stays home and takes care of the dog. Here’re some context: 1. I’m the sole income/person working. My gf is a foreigner that doesn’t have Work authorization in this country. (She did move a country for me). 2. I earn enough to let us live a comfortable life. And, my job isn’t stressful, but the hours are long, and it’s still a job. I don’t bring any work home. I work 50 hour weeks, 10 hour shifts. 3. To have a companion for my gf and, at my request, we got a dog (I have wanted one my whole life). She approved, only if we got her dream, DREAM, breed. A hyperactive crazy playful intelligent border collie. I wanted something less demanding. But she wouldn’t relent. 5. She’s a great doggy Mom. Home made food, best kibble, lots and lots of play time. 2-5 hours a day. Even in 4 feet of snow. My dog has a fitness tracker, he runs an average of 20km a day. When I’m off I join them. But I’m working 50 hour weeks. 6. Gf will do two chores at home: make dinner during the days that I work, and wash those dishes. Ensures I have a lunch to bring to work. Dog related maintenance (daily brush, teeth, feeding, playing outside). 7. What I do: drive (she can’t), clean (floor, tub, counter space, stove top, bed), take the dog for first poop/pee before work, take the dog for last poop/pee before bed, cook when I’m off, do dishes when I am off. Laundry (she refuses to go down to the basement alone; nor learn to use the machine). I’m tired. I don’t think our dog need to be at the dog park 3-4 hours a day. I don’t think he needs to run 20km. And I hate how she’s constantly comparing my work to her taking care of the dog. She sets her own standards for the dog; it doesn’t have to be so high! AITA for wanting her to do more for us/me and less for her/dog? To be blunt, because the fact we have a DOG and not a human child, I think it’s fair for me to expect the chore ratio to be like 1:9, where my only chore should be having to drive us everywhere. But, no, she can’t, she’s tired too; for walking and playing with our dog for 4 hours a day, then she needs an afternoon nap, then she cooks, then I’m home. And he’s a great dog, probably because he gets to burn his energy everyday, but greattttt dog.<|response|> ESH. You for wanting 90% when you should be happy with 50/50. And her for not doing her half <|endoftext|>
77723	3	AITA for cursing out a stranger on the subway? Throwaway because my coworkers know my regular account. I (23F) was on the subway coming back from work. It was rush hour so the car was completely full. I had a hand on the pole and the guy squeezed right next to me was not holding onto the pole but instead was using both of his hands to play with a rubiks cube. He was in reach of the pole so it wasn’t like be didn’t have a choice. I thought that this guy was an idiot and that there was basically a 100% chance that he was going to bump into me. I was basically seething just thinking about it because it struck me as so inevitable. Shockingly, the subway came to a sudden stop between stations and the guy lurched forward, pushing himself against me. It didn’t hurt but it didn’t feel pleasant either. It isn’t unusual for people to bump against others in a crowded subway; I’ve done it, everyone’s done it. But this guy didn’t even do the bare minimum to prevent it from happening. He mumbled “sorry” and I snapped, “well what the fuck did you think was going to happen?” He told me to “chill out” and I said, “I’d be chill if you weren’t such a fucking moron.” I mean he put the rubiks cube away and held on at that point but people on the subway were giving me weird looks as if I were the asshole here, which I don’t think I am. I can’t lie, i did enjoy telling him off because i really felt like he deserved it, but idk, maybe I was too harsh. Am i the asshole here? Thanks.<|response|> YTA. You had a massive overreaction. If everyone is staring at you like you're an asshole, chances are you're being an asshole. Edit: can't type. <|endoftext|>
178686	4	AITA for taking notes during a meeting? I've been working at my firm for about five years, three of which have been in my current unit. This October, the Director of our branch tasked our unit with a temporary directive that requires us to travel offsite twice a week. This resulted in significant backlash from my unit and as such, some of my colleagues requested a meeting with the Director (effectively bypassing the chain of command) to obtain an explanation for the directive. The Director accepted to meeting and extended the invitation to the Head of our department and our supervisor. During said meeting, my colleague (let’s call her Vanessa) became rather vocal with her frustrations, even after the Director explained the rationale behind his decision. Throughout the meeting I took notes. Most of which reflects the points brought up by our Director. Which is where I should mention that it’s not unusual for me to take notes as I do so at every meeting. Mainly because it gives me something to do. Once the meeting ended, Vanessa immediately came up to me to convey her discomfort at my note taking. She explained that it made her nervous, stating that she didn’t like the idea of being quoted, and asked if the Director or the Head of the department requested that I take meeting minutes. I apologized for making her uncomfortable, adding that it was never my intention, and replied that no one had asked me to take notes. I did so from my own volition, as I typically do at meetings. She implied that this wasn’t the type of meeting where one should take notes and reiterated her overall displeasure with my behavior. In a gesture of good faith, I offered her my notes and suggested that I throw them away. She replied that she trusted me, but remained clearly vexed with the situation. Now I thought that would be the end of it. I genuinely like Vanessa and I know she can occasionally be hot headed so I didn’t think too much of it. But before leaving for lunch with a friend, I overhead her tell him that she ‘blasted’ me for taking notes during a meeting. So Reddit, am I missing something? Am I the asshole for taking notes during this meeting?<|response|> NTA- you're fine. Sounds like she was all heated up from the meeting and you got hit with some of the spillover. I wouldn't pursue this any further if I were you, it'll most likely have blown over by tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
11080	2	AITA For not letting a pregnant lady on the train first (who was not visibly in distress or pregnant)? Awaiting the commuter train; the train door stops in front of me (commuter knowledge means I know roughly were it stops) so I step forward onto the train and turn around to find some women's friend who was standing next to me on the platform is screaming at me saying 'excuse me she's pregnant!' as if I'd done something shocking. I just said 'oh' and found a seat as normal (there were plenty of seats available). AITA?<|response|> Lol her friend is being weird and dramatic. Some people do think the world stops when they get pregnant though. It’s funny, because if you think about how many births have taken place throughout history, it’s almost the least special thing ever. <|endoftext|>
58615	3	AITA - Not outing myself to my father So I’m 19(M) and ,you guessed it, am gay. A few days ago me and my sister were at our fathers place and spend some time there talking, drinking coffee, etc. At one point my father asks how my girlfriend is doing. My reaction was something like „why do u think I have a gf“? *nervously tapping my fingers against my leg* He told me that he noticed me getting dropped off by a car after work quite frequently (my bf doesn’t work far away from my work so he sometimes picks me up).My sister staid silent all this time while I tried to awkwardly change subjects. Then after we said our goodbyes and left the building she stared at me in shock and asked why I didn’t out myself to him already, to which I replied: „I’m not sure if I feel comfortable doing this yet, remember what he used to say about gay people just a few years back?“ She then replied: „Oh well that was years ago I’m sure he doesn’t think that anymore“. We continued to argue and after me telling her repeatedly that it’s MY thing when I’m gonna tell him it escalated and next 15 minutes just she tried to convince me how horrible it is of me that I didn’t tell him and that I’m just a coward for doing so. So Reddit, AITA?<|response|> NTA. Your sexuality and what you disclose regarding your sexuality are nobody's business but yours. <|endoftext|>
89218	4	AITA for asking my husband to get me stuff when I’m on my period My husband has been working really long hours recently because he’s up for promotion and is about to hit a deadline on a tool he’s working on. I’m on my period today and I’ve been having really bad cramps so I called him and asked him to pick up ice cream on the way home, and he grumbled fine and hung up. When he got home he wasn’t in a great mood but seemed okay and I asked him to scoop some for me. He grumbled again and did it. A little bit later I asked for a drink of water and he sighed loudly and got it. I stopped asking for stuff at that point but an hour or two later when he got up I asked him to do the dishes(he does the dishes and I cook) and he said that he’d do them tomorrow and to let him “just god damn relax”. Now I’m feeling bad and wondering if I was being a bit of a nag? AITA?<|response|> YTA. Asking him to stop for ice cream, sure, not a big deal. Asking him to baby and parent you by scooping it and getting a drink for you when he's had an equally long day? Really frustrating. You are an adult. You can take care of yourself here. Source: am female, have horrible periods. <|endoftext|>
155775	4	AITA for refusing to apologize for telling my aunt to shut up about the year I forgot Mother's Day? So bit of backstory here; my forgetting Mother's Day happened six years ago. I'm 22(f) now and was 16 when this happened. At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior. I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. My aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. We don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time. My mom shuts it down any time she hears it, but unfortunately she doesn't hear her every time. I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. I flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left. The reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in the week since, I've had several people (mostly other family members) tell me I was out of line. My aunt's son (23), even called me to tell me to apologize, saying that she was only joking when she brought up Mother's Day and that she didn't know the extent of what I went through. Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it. I'm also beginning to feel like a dick for telling her to shut up. So, Reddit, AITA here for the way I reacted and for refusing to apologize?<|response|> NTA it might be a considered a joke, if she said it once maybe twice. But bringing it up for 6 years while being told to stop by her sister is not a joke any more. Even if she didn't know about everything that you went through, she could have thought that forgetting it was due to your issue or at least think that bringing up your medical history might trigger you or hit a sore spot. She's an adult, she should have acted like one <|endoftext|>
145618	3	AITA for taking some of my friends drugs that he left at my house, when he moved out of the country? Friend was born in France, moved to NYC when he was 22, and moved back to France recently, hes 28. He was my roommate before he left. &#x200B; He had a little compartment in our apartment which we found after he moved out, maybe 4 weeks after he moved, which had maybe 150 bucks worth of coke. I figured, he moved back to France, we aren't going to see him probably for years, why not take it? So we went out for a night and did it, and had a fun time. I didn't even think it was a big deal at all, considering he was in France and wasn't coming back for a very long time. &#x200B; Anyways, we told him about it, and we thought he would have just laughed it off because what the fuck are we gonna do? mail it to him? Instead, he was really mad. Saying that that was really high quality coke which he was \*eventually\* going to come back to. I was a bit taken aback, because he told us he wasn't going to come back for at least a year, and he very clearly forgot about the coke and didn't tell us about it, otherwise he would have hid it in a place that wasn't... you know, our apartment. So I told him why did he leave it there then, and he got very defensive and said it doesn't matter because it was his, and not ours, and we should have just saved it. He was extremely upset at us. He kept on acting as if it was this unbelievably good coke that was nearly impossible to find, but it wasn't that amazing, especially considering he knows that we could get really good coke relatively easily in new york. &#x200B; I am just a bit confused by this whole situation. Was it an asshole move to take it? Knowing that he wouldn't be here for a VERY VERY long time and that we could have easily replaced it with equal if not better coke if he wanted? I think to him it was more the principle of us taking it than anything honestly.<|response|> NTA - If my friends found my stash when I was out of the county, I'd be happy for them. As long as they got me the same quality and amount of blow after I came back. <|endoftext|>
189328	2	WIBTA for wanting to switch lives with my sons mother. My sons mother is having a hard time in life. She has a lot of major issues go down lately and it has seriously taken its toll on her. We are not together and she has the kid in her house. For context, the house she and my son live in is owned by my mom. She pays rent directly to her, I would just assume that financial role. I want to offer her my life and I will take hers. I want to give her the last few years of child support upfront (it is a very sizable amount). All of it. I want to move into the house she is in with my son. She can then go get her own place. No kids; just her place to focus on herself. I won’t ask for money from her. I won’t restrict her access to our kid. I want to give her everything that she wants all at one shot and take over the entire load. She can honestly take as much time as she needs to find what she is looking for. I don’t want to rush her and direct how she lives her life. Would I be the asshole for pitching this idea to her? Edit: I pay child support now and always have and I am in my sons life and we have a great relationship<|response|> NAH, but don't be too surprised if she declines. <|endoftext|>
142185	3	WIBTA if I told my old roommates baby-daddy that he has a kid? Background: she used to be my best friend but ever since I told her I didn’t agree with her keeping the baby a secret from the father she doesn’t want anything to do with me. She moved back home to live with her parents and the guy has no idea. I don’t know why she won’t tell him, he wasn’t abusive or anything they really only hung out for about two weeks and then she went on vacation found out she was pregnant and left to move back home shortly after that. She has now had the baby and he has no idea that he has a daughter and I feel like he should have the option to be involved if he wanted to?<|response|> NTA, but have you tried talking to her to try to convince her that he deserves to know? <|endoftext|>
4913	4	AITA for not wanting to be in a relationship? My SO and I have been dating for 9 months and a lot of recent times have been fighting. We both have our mental health issues and they seem to clash. We had a long talk and agreed that we would have strategies to work on our issues. However, that still leaves me in the place that I don't think I want to be in a relationship. I don't see a long term future where I'm in a relationship. I brought this up and it was met with words of support but in the longer term it seemed to turn to persuasion to stay. I still want to be friends, and I enjoy the good times we have together. I still want to see them. Is it a dick move to leave?<|response|> You still want to see them but you don't want to be in a relationship well. Well that's going to cause some problems for the other person. It's not bad to want to end a relationship that's not working, but it's not exactly fair to expect them to want to keep seeing you after you've ended the relationship <|endoftext|>
185297	4	AITA for calling out grandma for treating my adopted daughter differently Ok, so long story. In November we were at a family wedding and my 12 year girl old got into trouble with her mom. I was in wedding party so I did not observe anything. My youngest (7 year old adopted) then kept asking the rest of the family at the table “Why her sister was in trouble”. She hit up her uncle, grandma #1, and her mom (my wife) all without incident. When she asked grandma #2 she was told to “Shut her face”. My wife stood up to her and explained that “No one should talk to a 7 year old that way”. She then left the event. This has interaction caused tension for a while. Fast forward 1 month to Christmas. I noticed that grandmother #2 happened to purchase 1 gift for the 7 year old for every 2 she purchased the 12 year old. In the past it had always been even split. I don’t want to seem ungrateful as any gift is a blessing, I would like feedback as I don’t want 7 year old feeling slighted yet I don’t want to seem ungrateful.<|response|> NTA. I'm adopted and this shit sucks. We plan to adopt in the future and I've already told my husband point blank if his parents pull this shit they lose access to ALL of our children. I'm not playing this game. Standing up for your daughter makes you far from TA. <|endoftext|>
27727	3	AITA for not asking my best friend to prom even though she wanted me to? For clarification I'm a boy and my friend is a girl. We've been best friends for about 7 years now and are always honest to each other, even when it's harsh. We were talking about prom and she asked if I was going to ask her. I asked her if she wanted me to and she said yes. My friend has never been asked to a dance throughtout all of high school but she doesn't even want to go to prom that badly. She was only going because her mother wanted her to. I told her I didn't think she would mix well with the group I was going with because a lot of the people in my group don't like her. I also said I was planning on asking someone else. She told me she *really* wanted to go with me and I told her I'd think about it. A couple days later I ask a different girl to prom without telling my friend. My friend texted me saying that she felt like I was embarrassed by her and that I ignore her when I'm with other people. She said she doesn't like being the better friend and that I don't do as much for her as she does for me. She now asked some else to prom and won't talk to me. AITA?<|response|> YTA You aren't the asshole for not asking your friend. What makes you the asshole is that you didn't tell her and she found out from a different source. You should have told her because you said you would think about it. <|endoftext|>
130980	2	AITA for not wanting to deal with this coworker? Long story sorry and I’m on mobile. Names are changed. Ok, so I work for a small transport company. There’s only 2 of us and my boss that are in this small office (the other 3 are at another office) Boss is Bob and coworker, Molly. I got this job last March. It was great up until this past few months or so. Molly started working from home A LOT. She would show up to the office maybe once/week. I kept my mouth shut and never complained, picking up the slack since Molly wasn’t doing all that much. Found out she had some health problems and was going through a lot so I was understanding. Recently, I found out Bob and his business partner Don were planning to downsize the company, consolidating everything into one office, laying me and Molly off. There is one employee at the other office that Bob wants to get rid of because she’s lazy af. Bob offered me her job but the hours are impossible for me as I have a part time job on the side to make ends meet. Bob didn’t offer the job to Molly because he knew she wouldn’t take it. She has a part time on the side as well, bartending. She has bragged about her making hundreds of dollars in one night (because she’s skinny, pretty, and has big boobs.) Bob tells me about the downsizing first because I’m at the office every day, and told me to not tell Molly. He told Molly the next week. I asked him how it went and he said it went ok and told me she’d be in Monday. So I text her on Monday and say I’m going to be a little late and she says since she no longer has a position in the company, she’s just going to work from home until the move. Nothing new for me. So I tell her sorry, then I signed off with a “have a good day! :)” Mind you, I tell her this all the time. Always. This triggers her this time and she gets pissy saying that “it’s real cute” that I told her to have a good day when she’s losing her job and her benefits and then told me not to contact her unless absolutely necessary. After everything I put up with with her being gone and me picking up the slack (which she acknowledged to me) she’s going to treat me like trash, like *I* fucked her over, like it was *my* decision to let her go. I’m losing my job too! I text back telling her she could make in a night or two what I make in a week, how I didn’t give her shit over her not being here and me picking up the slack, and not to treat me like I fucked her over. Anyway, after that I began training an employee from the other office, Cody, to do my job. Well, I find out today that<|response|> NTA - Molly should be grateful that you've been picking up the slack. <|endoftext|>
6282	1	AITA for not punishing my daughter the way my boyfriend would have liked? Today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together. Bf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said "You look silly!" We were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, "oh yeah, oopsie," then turned to him and said, "I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing." I thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said "way too fucking rude, I'm going outside." I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says "outside. now." where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside. I wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked<|response|> Thread is locked. There's consensus and a lot of rule 1 breaking. <|endoftext|>
73325	2	WIBTA if I leave a group that isn't willing to work I am in this class where we need to complete a project about a business we want to open. We were all drafted into our groups and I had the pleasure of being grouped with people that are not willing to work. Now, this by itself wouldn't be a problem; by now I am used to doing everything myself - this is neither the first nor last time I will have team mates that are utterly useless. I take issue with the fact that these people expect regular<|response|> NTA. Group projects are the worst. <|endoftext|>
90388	5	AITA for being grumpy at bf? Been with my (24F) bf (28M) 4 yrs. His friendship group is very “guys only” - not on purpose, they’re just a close group of ~8 guys, been that way for nearly 2 decades, and don’t tend to have their gfs around when they hang out - perfectly fine. Xmas Eve one year into the relationship, they have a tradition of going for an Indian and going to the pub. Bf invites me, I go - only girlfriend there. Felt a little out of place but it’s cool. We go to the pub after and have a good time, still the only girlfriend in the group but the pub is packed with everyone in the locality so there’s other people I know around. Year after: I ask if the usual plans are happening, bf says yes but I’m not invited to the meal part this time. Oh, why? It’s just supposed to be the guys, he says. I got upset. Not because I’m not invited, but because I suddenly felt so awkward about the year before and how I was “that girl” that doesn’t allow guy-time. To find out a year later that everyone was probs irritated and secretly wishing I hadn’t joined really made my heart sink. Led to me having a bit of a meltdown about him going as I felt embarrassed. I wasn’t about to stop him doing something he wanted to and should do, so despite being upset I reassured him into going. He told me to come meet them after but all I could think was “why would I want to go hang out with a group who don’t want me there” but he insisted it was just the meal. I ended up going to the pub and it was fine. The year after (last year); same situation. I explain that I felt so stupid about the previous year, of sitting at home all pathetic, waiting to be “allowed” to join. I know I sound ridiculous, but that’s just how I felt. I had to wait around for them to be done with their boys-only bit, and I felt so so so pathetic while doing it. Why am I, a grown ass woman, sat around waiting for a guy to tell me I can come celebrate Xmas. I was upset but agreed to come out, but the more I sat at home alone I totally lost all desire to go and bailed. My bf kept texting me to please come but I just really didn’t want to. I was asleep by the time he got home. So this year. Same thing is happening, I’m torn as to what to do. I reaaaally hate the feeling of waiting at home before I’m allowed to join in the festivities but spending xmas together is important. My own family and friends are a non-option. I feel like such a sourpuss sat at home like I’m in a sulk and refusing to go out for no good reason, but hate waiting around until I’m “beckoned”.<|response|> Soft YTA. This is up to you to let it go; he's trying to be accommodating, but nothing is good enough for you, it seems. The thing that would help this would be if you let go of your grudge, and I think holding a grudge over something so simple is what makes you the AH. But I can understand why you feel the way you do. I strongly recommend that you make your own plans, then head over when you're ready. Go for a massage, go skating, get food you love and eat it whole watching a favourite movie, whatever you would like to do. Make it something you will genuinely enjoy. Then don't worry about waiting to be invited. If you plan something that will take a little while, long enough for them to eat, just head over when you're ready. It sounds like having some control over the situation might really help. <|endoftext|>
160212	4	AITA for not being more understanding of my colleague's behavior? There's a new guy at my work who's been driving me up a wall. Every interaction with him could be a textbook example of patronizing "mansplaining," and its been both frustrating, and, as much as I hate to admit it, a little demoralizing, to have someone--not to mention someone right out of school, who also works on a different project team with a totally different specialization--constantly question your ability to do the job you've been doing for longer than he's been able to vote. We're on different project teams, and these interactions generally take place at lunch, in the hallway, etc., etc.--so he's a person I can afford to avoid, which I've increasingly been trying to. So, anyway, I happened to mention all this to another colleague, who then suggested that this new guy is likely on the mild end of the autism spectrum--which on the whole seems at least plausible--and who then went on to imply that I'd be a jerk for continuing to avoid the new guy, or for not trying to be more understanding about what are possibly (but still only hypothetically) just neuro-atypical traits. So I've been trying. But the more I've talked to the guy at lunch, the more he's decided that I'm a person who he can show off his own intelligence to whenever he wants--now often lingering in my cubicle doorway, picking up not a single signal that, hey, maybe I'm trying to work, while doing more of the same he's always done: explaining my own work to me, asking me questions about what I'm doing that are posed like exams he for some reason thinks he's in a position to judge me on, telling me that, in the end, the work I do is actually worthless, really, which he knows because he apparently knows so much more about it than me! I've tried being understanding, really. And I've tried strategically suggesting that maybe I, too, know something about my own work--but it never ends, and I'm getting to the very ends of my patience. Even if this is just how he is, and he's not trying to be an ass, it still hurts and frustrates me, and I just can't take the daily cross-examination, the constant condescension. But my colleagues continue to suggest that I'm being a jerk to this person who they claim doesn't really know any better. I've had other colleagues and friends with ASD, so I understand, of course, that some people have non-typical ways of engaging in social interactions that may come off as odd or off-putting to neuro-typical folks. But in this case, I don't just feel off-put, but actively belittled. Ultimately, regardless of his diagnosis, I feel like my colleagues are being jerks for judging me for refusing to engage with someone who consistently treats me like a worthless idiot who's only there for him to prove how smart he himself is. I'm I really the asshole here? Am I justified in thinking they're being the jerks for<|response|> NTA, your biggest problem is that you and your coworker assumed he was on the sectrum instead of an everyday asshole. asshole=/=on the spectrum Your coworkers are all a giant bunch of assholes, the one who you've got constantly belittling you and the ones who are shaming you because you don't want to be around somebody constantly belittling you. It doesn't matter if he IS on the spectrum, you and your coworkers are enabling bad behavior and it needs to stop. You have every right to not be harassed, by Possibly Austic asshole or Run of the Mill Assholes. Try establishing some boundries. "I can't talk right now I'm trying to work." and start bringing headphones, repeated in various ways. Also- INFO, where exactly are THEY in this little scenario? you don't say if they're reaching out dickhead mcgee. Are they just setting you up so you're the fallguy taking all the abuse here? <|endoftext|>
100613	4	AITA: I (21F) told my bf (M23) that I didn’t have the time to talk about his depression and ended our conversation I know this sounds absolutely terrible but hear me out. My partner is bipolar and his meds don’t exactly work perfectly, but they definitely help. He hates therapy and refuses to go/puts off his appointments. For months, I’ve been taking care of him (helping him make appointments, helping him stay organized w/ school work, helping him make dinner, helping him clean his condo, etc.), but I’m a full time pre-med student graduating this spring and I, quite frankly, am going mad. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep a night, I have 2 jobs, I have my own place to keep clean, I’m taking 17 cr<|response|> NTA!! Girl, you need to put yourself first. I know you love and want to support your partner, but you are not a therapist and him refusing to see one does not make you responsible to sift through his upsetting thoughts. From personal experience- stop cleaning for him. You are not his mom, you do not need to enable his reluctance by doing it for him. <|endoftext|>
107028	3	AITA for telling my girlfriend she says I love you too much? Don’t get me wrong, I do love my girlfriend back. But she is extremely affectionate(clingy) and some times she’ll end up saying “I love you” ~5 times within 5 minutes. I always say I love her back, but sometimes I get annoyed. Often I will be focusing on something, and she’ll it, I’ll respond. Then she’ll either say it again a few more times after, or I won’t hear her because I’m too focused. Leading to her being “upset.” (Basically calling me out for not saying it back). Just now, she said it a lot within 5-10 minutes, and I told her that I love her, but she does say it a lot. She immediately turned away from me and became upset. AITA?<|response|> I used to do this with my husband. He didn't tell me straight but he dedicated the song More Than Words to me. And I kinda got the idea, didn't feel too bad. <|endoftext|>
89971	3	AITA: I told my friend his bf seems possessive? Hi, any mistakes with grammar are because English isn't my mother language, and also I use fake names in my post. Emil (23m) is my (23f) friend since college. He's been going out with Gregory (26m) for almost one year. Gregory seems nice on first meeting, because he's funny and kind of shy guy. I think he's really in love with Emil when we met (although it was almost 6 months after they started going out, which was a little weird because we live in the same city...) but because of some things that happened since then, I think he looks a toxic partner. Some examples: he forces PDA to Emil. So to explain, Emil is a very shy and introverted person and doesn't express his feelings easily. Only when he feels safe. I noticed that Gregory basically hugs and kisses Emil when we're outside in a cafe or street, and Emil doesn't like it but he tries to play off as joke. So I asked Emil once, Emil are you really fine doing PDA now (cause before he didn't even want to *talk* about anything gay in public) and he answered that it's difficult but you have to sacrifice things in a relationship. I said that's not very healthy but he just laughed it off. Plus... Gregory likes to pick up Emil early from when we hang out alone, just us friends. He's suddenly near with his car doing errands and Emil has to leave. It happens too much that it'd be an accident. And when they were at Emil's sister's party, Gregory was angry when Emil talked to his family's friend too long because this person is also gay. Doesn't matter this person is a 50+ year old man, with a husband and has been Emil's parents' friend forever... Gregory started the argument because since they came as a couple, they should be spending all time together. Anyway I recently told Emil his relationship with Gregory doesn't look healthy at all. It seems like he's possessive and doesn't like Emil to have any other friends. Emil got mad because I'm seeing everything wrong, they communicate about everything (so that must mean it's healthy?) and he pushes him out of comfort zone. We had a fight and now he's not answering my messages. So was I the asshole? Am I wrong and should I apologize to my friend.<|response|> NTA, you were worried about your friend. However, telling someone "Your relationship is unhealthy" rarely goes well. It might have been better to voice your opinion as a worry and less of an accusation. Good luck. <|endoftext|>
141662	4	WIBTA if I told my girlfriend to just chill on trying to be ‘woke’ Definitely not a shitpost, but if the mods require I remove it I’m happy to. I’m just looking to gain a little perspective here. I’m a black woman, and have been queer my whole life it seems. My girlfriend, about to be my fiancée (hopefully) and I have been together for 4 years. She’s my best friend, my woman, my ride or die, my fucking everything. She’s also not a native of London like I am, and came to the city VERY sheltered, not just in terms of sexuality, but her views on blacks, Muslims, fuck it, even had an opinion on how flying the St. George’s flag isn’t racist etc. We were both lifeguards at a leisure centre which is how we met, and we both just bonded so hard and fast. Long shitty hours + dry reccing is boring, and we just hit it off and I fell in love HARD. Anyway, she’s the love of my life. I’m proud of her for how far she’s come, I’m proud of her for fighting the good fight and opening her eyes to so many injustices that I never thought she’d be capable of understanding opinions on. However, nowadays social justice is....100% all she talks about. We come home from work, I’m trying to cuddle and rock her world, and she’s waving around her MacBook telling me we have 3 petitions we need to sign and how she told off a white girl for wearing her hair in braids today. I’m like... okay. Babe. This isn’t something you should need to police. Like I said, I’m proud of her, im stupid in love, but it seems that this is almost like a personality change and I just want my chill girl back who wants to show me bunny videos and ask me if we can get a fuck sized meat loaded pizza from dominoes instead of constantly telling me we should order from calabash which is our local Caribbean mom n pop place. There’s no real way of me asking her to chill on this, and even if I did- how the hell do I go about it. WIBTA if I gently steered the convo away from the topics that she gets heated up on from now on and told her to chill a little?<|response|> NTA If you're not an asshole about it. "You need to chill" = Assholish behavior. "I'm proud of how much you've grown and try to do for the world, but I also think it's okay to take a step back and enjoy the good in the world, like us and our relationship, cute bunnies, and the feel good flavors of pizza. I want both with you and I feel as though I'm missing part of the girl I fell in love with. The part that can snuggle up and be with me. I love the driven parts of you, but I'm missing my relaxation partner." = non-assholish behavior &#x200B; Tell her what you love and miss. Avoid "chill the fuck out" though that may be how you feel. You won't be an asshole. <|endoftext|>
114432	3	AITA For being mad at my friends for playing a game without me Im a college student and games are my main source of entertainment. I usually play single player games but I enjoy playing with others too. I usually play on my PC and PS4, but my friends C and H play on Xbox and have been telling me to get one to play with them for the longest, so I splurged on Christmas and got one to play with them. &#x200B; From since I got my Xbox up to this week I've had to initiate any game sessions with my friends and it wasnt often since we each have our own responsibilities. They have another group of people they play with and tell me they are "always on" but they really arent. This week H told me to download a new free to play game so the three of us could play together, we did on Monday and I had a lot of fun. H said we could play again after he got off of work the next day, but then later clarified that he got off of work at 1 am, so I waited for him only for him until 2 am but he was tired and wanted to go to bed, which I 100% understand and wasn't mad about. &#x200B; Yesterday at around 8:30 he said he would be on to play, C said he would be ready in 30 min and H said he had a quick errand to run. So I waited, and then 10:30 rolled around and I asked where H was, he said he was running errands and would be back home soon. Another hour passed and I was tired but still excited to play, so I asked him again what was happening and he told me to get online. I got in a party with C and H and asked for an invite to their session, they told me to wait because they were in the middle of a game. I said something along the lines of "You told me to get on and started without me?" and C admitted that they had already played 2 rounds of the game before inviting me to the party. &#x200B; So I turned my Xbox off and went to bed. H tried to invite me to the party again and I said no, I was pissed off that I had been waiting around for 3 hours fighting off sleep only for them to start without me. C jumped in to poke fun at H for pissing me off but I told him "Fuck you too", as I had been talking to him while I was waiting for H to return and he didn't tell me they were playing either. &#x200B; I admit that I'm not good at first person shooters and they carried me when we played, and I understand that they would want to play without me so they dont have to babysit me while I learn, but I would have appreciated it if they<|response|> NTA It's one thing if they just happened to be playing without asking you first. But given that you were all planning to play and C was kind of leaving you hanging for 3 straight hours when he said 30 minutes and then started without a simple message first is a dick move. Just because it's an online thing doesn't mean you don't follow basic etiquette about being late. They are assholes. <|endoftext|>
56322	5	AITA for disliking the fact my father keeps lending money from my account for bills? I'm a 19 year old college student, who's currently unemployed. I live at home with my parents in a fairly middle class area. We've never really been hurting for cash- or at least that's the impression I've always received my entire life up until fairly recently. I worked retail for about half a year and as such, was finally able to have a bit of savings in my bank account. Since then, my father has slowly been utilizing my account as a sort of "loan bank". He'll take money out for small bills every now and then without telling me, and when I approach him about it he assures me that he'll always pay me back. He has, thus far, always done so. However, the amounts he keeps lending from my account continue to grow larger as time passes. The first few times this happened, I was fine with it. Taking out a couple 25$ to pay a quick fee or whatever, I can understand. However, it keeps happening and I'm becoming a bit weary. I just received a text that he'll be taking out 300$ to pay an insurance bill, and will pay me back sometime in October. I understand that money can be tight, and that it has to come from somewhere, but it's honestly beginning to piss me off that he would just take that much out from me like I'm some kind of offshore bank account. I don't doubt that he'll pay me back come October, but that's still a huge chunk of money missing from my account till then. AITA for feeling this way?<|response|> NTA. I can see both sides of it. You live with your parents and in their eyes, are helping them when things get tight. Although they are really helping themselves. He’s paying you back. However, they should be mindful that it’s yours and not just take as they please without asking. <|endoftext|>
83520	3	AITA For being mad that my gf went through my reddit? So, before we begin, some backstory. Also, we're both adults, living separately. Reddit has always been a private place for me, and I am a very private person. I told my gf this at the beginning of our relationship, and this was fine. She didnt even ever ask me what my reddit was, despite being quite active on the site herself. However, I guess she found out from me showing her a meme or something, cause she told me recently she went through all my posts and was "worried and upset". Now that part, rightfully so I suppose. I've made posts about my depression and several of my gf and I's relationship troubles on reddit, either asking advice or seeing how I could better myself for her. I can see how she wouldn't be happy to see those things. However, my reddit has always been anonymous and strictly for me. I've never let anyone else that I know see it, or have access to it, and even told her as such. As a result, I feel massively violated in terms of privacy, and I told her as such before storming out of her house. (Edit since so many people are up in arms about this. The proper summation is I left angrily to go for a walk outside to calm down. I then returned and talked, but we could not agree so I left for the night.) I don't have many friends or much of a support system, so reddit is my go to for this stuff with the safety that it is anonymous. She apologized, and said it was dumb of her and that she did it because she was massively self-conscious about herself, but I don't really think that justifies violating my personal safe space. I feel like a teen girl who just had her diary read. AITA here?<|response|> Here's the problem, we're not a diary. You are taking your private life (which also means \*her\* private life, when you're talking about the two of you) and sharing it for OTHER PEOPLE. Diaries don't talk back.. They don't run the risk of being someone's co-worker or parent or teacher. Diaries are inert places where we can shout our insecurities, depression, hopes and fears into the void, safely expecting that they are privately tucked away from anyone. This is not that. This is a public forum. She didn't break into your account, she didn't lie to you, you shared something with her and she was curious and she did something that I could do right now to read your posts.. If you do not want anyone to see what you write on Reddit, don't write it on Reddit. This isn't a private forum, it's a fairly anonymous one, but it is a very public space, and as a result, is going to be seen, sometimes by people we know. YTA, sorry. <|endoftext|>
54685	4	AITA for telling my girlfriend to go find some friends Girlfriend is 20 and Im 24, she is amazing and I'm really happy. I've been having trouble only in the sense that I barely get to see my friends due to my work and when I do she gets mad I don't invite her, all of my friends are guys btw and we are all 23-25. When I do try to invite her she declines, or even worse when she does come she just sits there and will literally say nothing at all. We aren't these hard out drinkers either all we do is grab a burger and go to the waterfront and stuff like that, maybe watch sport or just sit somewhere and chat, these are all friends I've had since childhood - age 5+. It just hurts when she doesn't make an effort with any of them they're all really nice, have good jobs, nice partners and I feel like some of them could very easily be her friend (exception being the moody one) I get that people can be introverted and that it's difficult talking to people (my dad is very introverted and I'd be lucky if he even said hello to me as a kid) but these are people she knows and has met before and whom are all really friendly and really do try to communicate. But her excuse for not talking is "because I don't want to talk to your friends", SO WHY COME AIYAAA?!. It's like if I don't invite you, you get mad, if you come, you're mad, if you don't come, you're mad and if I invite you, you get mad. She got really mad at me when I said I'm not picking friends over you but I do have to see them sometimes. I feel like her attention is a bit 100% focused on whatever I am doing and because she has no friends irl, has a few online friends, she feels fine criticising my friends and my small social circle - about 5-6 of us. I'll spend 5 days with her in a row, tell her I'm meeting a friend for lunch during work, her response will be "why didn't you invite me". -------\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_------- AITA for saying she needs to find some friends as well? This post makes it seem like I'm hanging with MY friends everyday, I'm talking honestly once a month, we grew up together and all lead busy lives so we try and make at least one day a month to see each other. &#x200B; Idk probably should have posted in relationship advice lol<|response|> NTA. This sounds like she's trying (consciously or not) to socially isolate you, and is a massive red flag. It's not healthy for either of you, but you need to be really careful with this. <|endoftext|>
45258	5	AITA for kicking my roommates girlfriend out of our house? My roommate, we'll call him Steve, has a girlfriend that he's been seeing for a few months now, we'll call her Amy. She is over at our place 7 nights a week. Yesterday was my day off. I woke up around 830 after my other 3 roommates had gone to work, excited to have the place to myself for a few hours. When I walked out of my room, Amy was sitting there in the living room in my roommate's t shirt drinking coffee out of one of our mugs. She looked a little surprised that I was there. I asked her if Steve was here, she said 'No he left a half hour ago.' I told her that I dont think it's appropriate for her to be here if Steve isnt and I asked her to leave. That night I bring it up to Steve and he informs me that she was spending so much time at our place lately because she couldnt afford her apartment and had to terminate the lease prematurely so she was basically homeless. I kicked my roommates homeless girlfriend out on to the street. AITA? Edit bc I think Steve is being unfairly demonized to some extent: he didnt ask her to move in and none of her stuff is in the common space. I think she keeps it all in her car. I think he just opened up the house to her to have a place to stay. He probably just said to her 'Hey you can chill here for today.' I'm not sure how many other times he has extended the same offer but this is the first I saw of it. Mods can we lock this post? My roommate frequents this sub and I dont want him to happen upon this and get salty with me.<|response|> NTA - she's not paying to live there, and also your roommate did not give you a heads-up about the situation. (But INFO: how did you ask her to leave? politely? how did she respond?) He just assumed that she would be able to live there for free without consulting anyone. Perhaps you guys can work something out, but seems like a lot of issues can arise and you guys can get in trouble if your landlord finds out about an additional tenant. <|endoftext|>
93888	2	AITA for not chaperoning my sister A little background, my(19F) sister (21F) (let’s call her Ashley) goes on a lot of first dates. She’s the kind of person who will go on a few dates and say the relationship has lost its “spark” and move on (no judgement here). Usually the guys Ash meets are from friends or blind dates and she likes to have me there as backup incase the guy is a creep. I genuinely don’t mind doing this. For the double date part she says it feels less awkward if I’m also “on a date” so Ashley usually finds a guy for me to go with or I bring a friend. I always like to make sure the people she sets me up with know I’m not interested in anything with them and I’m just there to support Ashley but lately they haven’t taken the hint and IM the one left dealing with creeps. I’m also talking to a guy and while we aren’t in a definitive relationship I know he would be uncomfortable with me going out with someone else even for the purpose of helping Ashley. So this is basically how our text conversation went: Ash: Double date on Sunday (place and time) Me: Alright sounds good can I bring (my guys name) Ash: Already promised another guy he would be your date maybe next time Me: I’m not exactly comfortable with going out with strangers anymore, would you mind finding someone else this time? No response. An hour later she gets on social media and talks about how some people are so unreliable and basically a long rant pointedly talking about me. My other siblings noticed this and told me that I was a jerk for cancelling on her and I should stop being a child and just go. I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong but now I’m thinking I shouldn’t have left Ashley hanging so AITA?<|response|> NTA?? You have valid reasons for not wanting to go. Tell the other guy to not come and bring your guy If she wants to see this specific person she’s talking to? <|endoftext|>
130947	3	WIBTA if I Ignore/Reject a Disabled Girl’s Friendship I am currently in college (19F). I met my very close friend E in high school. E and I still talk although our colleges are three hours apart. G was/is E’s best friend. (E and G both were in special education classes but E got out of them while G’s condition was more severe) G does not have any social skills and I have tried conversing with her in high school. We never clicked and I never hung out with her unless E was there as well. Now G messaged me on facebook asking if I liked her and why don’t we talk anymore. I know she has insecurity issues (I didn’t like her because of those issues she can be maniplulative and clingy). I responded I think she’s a great person but we do not talk because we have never talked. Now she has messaged me on everything asking to add her on snapchat and instagram ( I used to have her on there but she would spam me constantly). WIBTA if I tell her I do not want to do these things? I just have no interest in becoming friends with her since we 1. Have never really hung out before 2. She lives in my hometown (2 hours away) 3. She has spammed me in the past. I don’t know whether to ignore her, politely decline, or just accept.<|response|> NTA there's no forcing a friendship now when it didn't happen while you were face to face. I would just say you aren't interested in someone spamming your social media again and don't engage in further explanation. <|endoftext|>
25360	3	AITA For Not Involving My GF in a Large Purchase I made? I'm 25, she's 23 and we've been together for about 2 years and living together for 1 year. I had a hectic year at my job and it was stressful as fuck, I make amazing money about 250k last year and wanted to get something for myself. I bought a vintage rolex for about 15k CAD, as a gift to myself and I picked it up yesterday and when I got home I showed it to my GF and she was super pissed, she said why would I not tell her about this, why did I not involve her etc. And was even more mad when I told her how much it costs, she called me an ass for not telling her about it or anything but I didn't think it was big deal. I think it may have to do with the fact that she makes like 50k a year or something. AITA?<|response|> INFO. How exactly committed are you guys? How intermixed are your finances? Do you have any other large financial burdens or commitments coming up? If you guys were married, and on a shared family budget, this is the kind of thing that everyone would call you an asshole for. Since you're still just dating, the picture is less clear. <|endoftext|>
81730	3	AITA for keeping my roommates deposit, even though I am the reason he is moving? I (26 f) am in charge of the finances for a house of 7 people, a common living situation in the city very expensive city we live in. I think its a pretty good arrangement as most of us work bar jobs and its nice to have company upon returning home at such late hours. While most of can be pretty heavy drinkers, one roommate had a pretty big problem he’d go to work absolutely tanked, always had a drink in his hand, and get pretty emotional. He paid rent on time and compared to the guy before him didn’t cause much trouble. Anyways about 7 months ago, he was rushed to the hospital and after a week long stay was told by a doctor he could either 1) never drink again 2) die. He chose life. Everyone in the house was extremely supportive of his sobriety . And it was amazing watching him blossom. Outside of fair weather gatherings, we stopped keeping excessive amounts of booze in the house. When it was time to renew the lease, he told me he wanted to stay and was very happy where he was. I offered him dibs on the open room which was only $50 more and twice the size on the third floor where sound from main living area didnt travel as much, so he wouldn’t have to hear us if we were gonna hang out and drink. He declined and said he liked his room and didn’t mind. Flash forward to only a few months later, slowly he has become more aggravated by everything, If we make noise when we come home or talk at a pretty regular volume he screams at us from the top of the stairs. Clearly, this situation is no longer working for him, and thats fine. His position of alcohol has changed and appears he no longer considers himself in recovery. He instead scoffs at us because we don’t fit into his Straight Edge lifestyle. He has been spent more nights with his gf. Which has been nice for everyone. Anyways, last night we thought he wasn’t home (he said he wouldnt be) and let loose, turned up the music, and bought some beer to celebrate a special occasion. Turns out he was home and he comes and screams at us, we apologized and turn down the music. This morning I receive a long text telling me, how pathetic we are that we drink and he’s moving in with his aunt (where his gf is currently living) in two weeks. I told him that it was fine, but because it was such short notice, it was his responsibility to find his replacement and if he didn’t find one he wouldn’t get his deposit back as I would be paying next months rent for him. He absolutely refuses and it not his responsibility since we’ve been devastating to his mental health. Like as a meet him halfway point I asked if he<|response|> NTA. He's breaking his lease and not cooperating in finding a replacement. You don't get a pass on following your lease because people have damaged your mental health, *especially* when he had an out a few months ago. <|endoftext|>
12039	4	AITA for cancelling a date So 2 weeks ago I met a girl on Tinder, and we hit it off pretty quickly. We had similar taste in music which was a big plus. Here's the thing though, she lives about 200 miles from me. She told me her location was set to where I was because she didn't want her clients to see her on tinder. She's in the mental health field, so apparently she needs to keep her work and personal life separate. She said she was about 2 years away from moving to the city I'm in. I didn't think much of it at the time. So we started chatting a lot, and after a day or two it turned into every day. We had similar chatting style so it seemed like a great match so far. One weekend goes by and then she tells me she's coming in town for a concert on the upcoming Friday, and then she'll be free the next day on Saturday. We both wanted to Bohemian Rhapsody, so she bought tickets to the movie at a theater right by my place. Last Friday approaches and I start rethinking the date. I had told her before that I wasn't looking for anything serious, but whatever happens, happens ya know. She was at her concert so we didn't talk much Friday night. Saturday I wake up and start to worry about the distance. Where she lives it's about 3 hours from me. 3 hours isn't 'too' bad... But it's far enough to be a pain in the ass. So I decide to cancel the date. I didn't bullshit her, I sent her an apology message. I also sent her $20 through fb messenger for the movie tickets. I told her that the distance was too much for me. She was ok with it at first, then she got upset and told me how shitty it was for me not to give it a chance. Also shitty that I told her I wasn't looking for anything serious, so why not just make a new friend. I told her sorry again and let her know that I guess I was looking for a more serious relationship. Then she once again wouldn't let it go and told me I was an asshole. AITA for being honest with her and cancelling? I just figured it wasn't fair to her to go into the date knowing I wasn't ok with the distance. Or should I have just given it a chance? tldr: I cancelled a first date with a girl that lives 200 miles away from me on the morning of the date. I sent her money for the movie tickets she bought. She told me I'm an asshole.<|response|> YTA for cancelling on the day. That is way too late when she’s travelled all that way- regardless of how badly you think the message would have affected her if you’d told her earlier. It doesn’t sound like you were up for it from the start really. If she hadn’t had told you she was coming to your town, would you have asked her out and offered to take her out near/ in her area? <|endoftext|>
48526	2	AITA for not wanting to spend 4th of July with my husbands family Apologize in advance because I am on mobile So for context my husband and I are moving to a different state in a couple of weeks. It was a little unexpected as we knew we were going to move but didn’t realize it was going to be so soon (like two weeks soon). My husband didn’t know for sure when we were moving until the day before yesterday (Tuesday) and so we talked about and agreed it’d be the best option for us. Anyways yesterday we told my family as they live like 2 blocks from us and they didn’t take it well. My mom started saying things like “good I’m glad you hated us anyways” “good thing cause you were a terrible person” “now you really don’t have a reason to visit us other than you don’t like us” Keep in mind that I am an introvert and I try to socialize with them once a week but that’s not enough for them. So by the end of the night I was crying from there constant insults and just general dislike they had towards me. That I just got up and let mid conversation. So fast forward to today, I was at work and I knew my husband was going to spend time with his family and tell them the news of us moving. Well I got off early and he invited me to go celebrate with them. I said I didn’t really feel like it cause I didn’t want to be reminded of family since mines really had me down. I just went home after work and watch shows. Then he comes home with his family to try and convince me to go out (he didn’t give me warning mind you) and try to make me feel bad since it would be the last time we see them. (It wouldn’t be, we’re moving an hour an a half away). But again I said no that I don’t want to be reminded of family because I’m still hurt from mine and that seeing how family is suppose to be made me sad. He got upset with me and said I was being an asshole for not coming out with his family. But I think my reason is justified. So Reddit, am I the asshole?<|response|> NTA. He’s being TA for pressuring you and not taking your feelings into consideration. <|endoftext|>
181544	2	AITA for peeing in a bottle? A female coworker and I were on a company road trip the other day. We had been driving for about 4 hours when we hit a parking lot on the interstate. A bad accident had happened ahead. We sat there for over 4 more hours. About the second hour I told her I really had to pee and she confided that she did as well. Another 30 minutes and I told her I couldn’t wait any more and peed in a bottle that was in the car. She said it wasn’t fair for me to pee when he couldn’t nor to expose myself to her. I explained the options for cover were limited, and I literally couldn’t wait any longer.<|response|> YTA She's right, you shouldn't have exposed yourself to a coworker like what the fuck dude. Enjoy your impending HR investigation. <|endoftext|>
155042	3	AITA for asking my boyfriend to commute 1.5 hours for a job he's excited about? Mobile, sorry. Also throwaway because my boyfriend knows my account. My boyfriend is currently in the interviewing process for what is almost his dream job. The problem is, it's in a small town three hours from the major city we currently live in. He doesn't want to move there without me. He says I am more important to him than this job so he'd rather not take it and stay with me than move without me. This puts a lot of pressure on me because obviously I want this job for him, but I don't want to move. I'd be uprooting my whole life to go to a place where I don't have job opportunities or friends, and not even people my age to hang out with (small town with mostly older people). I would more or less stay home all day. I also have a history of depression and anxiety and I'm really concerned with moving to where I'd be by myself and bored 8+ hours of the day. As a compromise I'm asking to move to a town 1.5 hours from where his job is, which is the nearest city. The town his job is in is in the middle of nowhere, this is the only town with a population of over 20,000 and where I could maybe find a job, restaurants, etc. I know it's a long drive for him but it is really the only way I can see myself being comfortable with moving. Lots of our older friends act like I should just move with him and it will be fine, someone even got upset with me and said that I shouldn't need more than him and our pets. I'm wondering if im being unfair. AITA for asking him to commute? Edit: right now we earn equal amounts of money in our relationship. If we moved he would become the sole earner because I would have to quit my job. Edit 2: we've already discussed it and he's on board with it, he was the person who brought up the idea in the first place. It's other people commenting on it that is making me second guess. Edit 3: We haven't actually lived together yet. We were searching for an apartment together when this job opportunity came up.<|response|> 3 hours a day on the road is too much. That’s going to be freaking brutal . Y’all live apart and spend the weekends together Maybe he could negotiate a work from home type of deal for a couple days a week to make long weekends <|endoftext|>
39063	3	AITA for getting mad because my aunt ripped my shirt in the middle of a birthday party? First of all, sorry for any mistakes here. English is not my first language. So, it was my uncle's birthday party and he decided he would just want a little family reunion at my house (i live with my mom and my grandma), order some pizza and a little cake. Since it was just a casual thing i decided to wear something confortable, and i have this old shirt that i really like, it had 2 little holes in it, one in the back and one in the stomach. At the end of the "party", we were cleaning up all the mess and my aunt decided to rip my shirt from the hole in the back when i was distracted, everyone laughed and thought it was funny, but i did not. I got really mad at her and started to argue saying you don't go off messing with someone else's stuff just because you feel like it. She said it was just a joke and she didn't thought i would get mad over a ugly ass shirt and that i should stop using it already, then started getting mad at me asking if i wanted her to pay for it and didn't apologize. My mom and my grandma are now saying i should go talk to her and say sorry because "it was just a shirt", but i refuse to do so. So, AITA? EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking your time to comment here, really appreciated.<|response|> NTA. She literally destroyed your property. She can try to laugh it off that it was just a shirt, but obviously it was a shirt that you liked enough to wear to a party. She should buy you a new one and apologize <|endoftext|>
179834	3	AITA for not wanting to help my mom pay bills? AMIA for not wanting to help my mom pay the bills? So I (17f) just started my job for the first time. I get paid weekly and I work 3 days a week, 6 hours a day, $8 an hour. My mom recently moved away from my dad and is taking care of me and my brother alone. I don’t have my own card yet and when asked for it, she told me that she would let me get one but I would have to pay my brother’s daycare bill ($200). Earlier that day she asked to borrow some money from me when she found out I got $30 in total from tip. She’s had a history of “holding” my money for me. Although I would help her, I also want to be able to have spending money for myself too. I definitely wouldn’t be so hesitant if she had asked first if I could help pay bills instead of demanding me to do it if I wanted a card. As it is right now I’m really annoyed and unsure if I want to pay that $200. Am I the asshole?<|response|> NTA at 17 you should not have to contribute to household bills. If your mom wants to charge rent when you turn 18 so be it. You’re definitely nta though. If I were you, I’d try to save as much as possible while you can so you can move out if necessary once you turn 18. <|endoftext|>
106277	3	AITA for screaming at my sister my sister is 14, im 19. she has always been very nasty to me. I was having a good day and i came home from work, i saw that we got a new couch and i go to sit on it she tells me, patronizing me like she does all the time. Dont you even sit here with all your nasty germs. she was very nasty. something in me just snapped and i screamed. "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING TO!I AM YOUR BROTHER! Shes the kind of person that would bump into you in the hallway, yell dont touch me, and start swinging at you. but AITA for yelling at her?<|response|> NTA. The way you describe it seems like typical angsty sibling behavior. <|endoftext|>
34371	4	WIBTA for contacting my estranged Dad? Basically, yeah. After all of 20 years doing some digging and asking around, I finally have the identity of the man who helped make me but didn’t wanna stick around. I’ve never known him and he hasn’t reached out to me. I found him on Facebook recently and added him. He added me back instantly. He has two kids and is engaged according to his profile, and seems to be doing well. I really just want to get to know him. I don’t want a relationship with him. I really just am interested in getting to know who this guy is. I don’t hold anything against him and know pretty much nothing else about him. Would I be the asshole if I sent him a message on Facebook? Just stating that I think he may be my biological father and I’m open to talking over coffee and getting to know each other. I really don’t know where else to turn with this, any advice would be appreciated. EDIT: I am 100% this is the guy. My mother confirmed it for me by showing me his facebook page yesterday. We had talked about him (a very rare discussion) and since I’m an adult now, she agreed I should know more about him. Also, yes, he does know that I exist. He (23 at the time) got my (18 at the time) mother pregnant on accident at a party. All consensual, just totally unplanned pregnancy! She broke the news to him and he skidaddled. He lives in the same city as me now, oddly enough. EDIT EDIT: I messaged him. He wants to meet me!!!! He says he’s been waiting to find a way to contact me since I was born. We’re meeting tomorrow! THIS IS INSANE! Thank you Reddit for giving me the courage to contact my DAD!!!!<|response|> NTA. go for it! the worst thing he could say is no. if y’all meet up and it goes poorly, at least you’ll have your answers. if it goes well, thats great! i don’t think there’s anything wrong with sending him a message at all. <|endoftext|>
40855	4	WIBTA If I don't go to my nephews high school graduation to avoid an ex? So you all get the full picture, I am gonna start from the beginning four years ago. I was graduating from a private christian high school, and had just broken up with my girlfriend of two years. Her and I simply didn't have plans for the future that coincided. Plus, I was moving away to go to college where I had gotten a great scholarship in theater, so I ended it even though I really loved her. To this day it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. However, during those two years, my girlfriend and I never moved passed kissing (Her choice. She was very religious, me not so much), so I came out of the relationship brokenhearted, sexually frustrated, and a dumb ass. Then I found a FWB in the theater I was involved with soon after, way too soon after, like three days after. (I know I'm an asshole for not waiting longer.) At first our relationship was fine, having clear rules laid out, but then things changed. I had a sit down with one of the heads of the theater at the college I was headed to and he told me "Don't go in to theater if you ever want to be able to support a family.", So I decided to go to community college instead and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. When this happened I fell into a really deep depression, and my FWB said she had feelings for me. I said "fuck it" my life is a mess anyways why not go for it. I'm gonna keep this part as brief as possible. During the year our relationship lasted I was miserable, I was horribly depressed and anxious. I had given up on my dream of a career in theater/acting, and started an addiction to nicotine and alcohol. During the relationship I became extremely dependent, and she was very independent. My emotions were constantly a mess and she had no idea how to handle it. She would constantly make me feel like trash, and I don't even think she meant too. I don't really wanna go to much further into it because I get super anxious just thinking about it. Anyways we didn't part on good terms, and I got even more depressed and anxious. I started hanging with a really bad crowd and started messing with some things I shouldn't have for about 1-2 years. Then I cleaned up my shit. In the last year and a half, I've gotten healthy, beaten my addictions, picked up MMA, moved on to a state college, I am working on professional film sets and started dating the most amazing weeb in the world. Needless to say I am good now. Now we get to the point of this whole mess. It turns out my ex's (the bad one) little brother is graduating at the same time as my nephew. There are only about 25<|response|> YTA I have been the person whose family didn't come to important events because of issues with others. The only message your nephew will receive is that he us not important enough to you to show up. You will be uncomfortable but it is not about you. Also, being the better person and treating the girl with cool respect could give you a confidence booth. A healthy person cannot let others control their feelings. No one can you feel things unless you let them. <|endoftext|>
20616	3	WIBTA if I emailed my teacher about her actions This week in school we got to chose classes for junior year. I signed up for a few AP classes because I am already in accel classes and these would be the next step in the line of the curriculum. I also ended up not signing up for drama 3, and instead, chose to have a free period to study because of my AP classes. So come this last Friday, our application slips are due for our classes, and I turned mine into my counselor. Not even a few hours later I get an email from my drama teacher, let's call her H, saying that she wanted to "talk with me" in class. I go to drama class and halfway through the class, once we've split up into our groups to do our scenes, H comes over to me and my partner, let's call her A. H: "so did you yell at him yet" A: she didn't quite understand "uhhh, no" H: "he's not signing up for drama next year" A: "why aren't you signing up" Me: (I'm quite awkward and shy so I suck at conversing) "I don't know, I just have too many classes and don't have the time" H: "you need to sign up for drama 3, you are taking to many AP courses and are gonna be overworked. You don't want to be studying all the time, do you?" Ill give H credit here, she is right, I probably will be stressed, but I can deal with it, and I get it. H: "A, you are going to make him write an email to his counselor and he is going to drop a course for drama. You don't need to take computer science, its a useless class and are going to be overworked." At this point I'm angry, but, I don't say anything. She walks off and me and A talk about whether or not I should drop physics. She tells me how it's hard, and that's understandable, but the math class I'm taking works hand in hand with the physics one, so if I drop it and take it senior year, I may not be too well off. Additionally, I wouldn't have a science course credit which is needed to graduate. Class comes to a close, and I never got around to writing that email. I find it so annoying how H just comes all up in my business and bosses me around, and barely lets me defend myself. Also, I find it super creepy how she was able to see my class list, I don't know how that works. I'm going to email my counselor, without context n the situation, and ask how a teacher may find my class list. Also, I probably should note, I didn't audition for the musical, for reasons unrelated, and she also emailed me a similar "lets talk in class thing." Not only this, but some other kids in my class didn't sign up as well for drama, and they got the<|response|> NTA, you aren't obligated to do drama, and if you want to do computer science, go for it! Also, send the email, a teacher shouldn't be acting like that. <|endoftext|>
61086	2	AITA for correcting my girlfriend? My girlfriend does art commissions online as a job but when she tells people about her job she tells them she is a “freelance artist” which is not at all correct. Being freelance implies that she is a professional artist (she is very very good, don’t get me wrong. I would even say she undercharges for her talent) and has worked with companies and such. She works with individual people online. I didn’t say any of this to her in a mean spirited way, I just didn’t want her to mislead people. She began defending herself and said “Why does it matter if I work with a company or a single person? How does that make me any less professional?” (Again, I said she was very good but I mean professional in a sense that you work professionally with a company) and she went on about how she’s done hundreds of commissions over the last 5 years and how that should be considered professional enough. But I again went back to my point and just said she is a commission artist not a freelance artist. I made sure to say that doesn’t make her any worse at art or her job, she can be just as good but she is just not a professional. I told her she was good and she should definitely seek professional work if she really does want to be a freelance artist but she shouldn’t just continue to mislead people. And she just told me she’s happy as is working with these people online and she loves making them happy and bringing their ideas to life and she doesn’t show interest in working for big companies. She’s upset with me now but I really wasn’t trying to be mean. I kept reminding her that she was still amazing at her art. AITA for correcting her?<|response|> YTA. Also, YTwrong. Your tone is very much "this poor girl is misleading people about her professionalism" which first, take that and shovel it into the hole it belongs, and second, is wrong. As in, you are incorrect. So unprofessional of you. A "professional" is someone that gets paid for what they do on a regular bases. A freelance artist works for themselves generally on commissions. Sometimes those are from businesses, sometimes not. You may not have been trying to be mean but you were diminishing her work, her accomplishments, and her honesty. "Seek professional work and be a freelance artist and shouldn't continue to mislead people." Yeah. YTA here buddy. <|endoftext|>
114166	3	AITA for offering to push a man in a wheelchair? I was in an airport terminal after landing when I saw a gentleman in a wheelchair, his lap laden with bags. We were at the base of a pretty decent incline about 100 yards long(the incline allows aircraft to taxi under it). He seemed to be alone and a little tired from the lengthy trip to this point. I noticed a slight hesitation, started to walk over, and asked “Would you like a push?” His response was a curt “No thank you”. After his response I noticed the push bars I normally see on wheelchairs were not on his wheelchair. I can only imagine that he gets this frequently, and that the interaction could get old really quickly. Is there an unwritten(or written) etiquette for offering to help someone in these kinds of situations?<|response|> NAH from what I gather you were trying to be nice and if he said it ina tone that was acceptable as nice to you here was no problem. <|endoftext|>
189730	4	AITA for being "picky" when it comes to food? I was brought up on a Mediterranean island, so my childhood diet was basically that of fish and greens, with salt and olive oil. Since my parents didn't cook with spices stronger than pepper, I never warmed up to "hot" food... I also rarely eat meat other than fish and chicken for the same reasons. The reason I'm bringing this up is because I live and work in continental Europe now and my colleagues like to order out lunch every now and again. However, normally I end up with the short end of the stick, because they're always craving Indian or Mexican or Chinese food. I don't like the spices and grease in that food and whenever I try it, it upsets my stomach. This isn't an all out office war type of issue, just an inconvenience because my colleagues laugh at me for being so "picky" and tell me I make them feel bad for ordering from places I don't like. I bring my own food anyway, so I tell them not to fuss about me when they're planning to order something out, but I guess they still feel some sort of guilt since they keep mentioning this? So do you think I'm the asshole for this behavior, should I suck up my food sensitivity for those few times for the sake of colleagues? Or are they overreacting since I've already told them I don't mind if they order without me?<|response|> NAH. You could try to adapt to brown spices if you wanted to expand your palate. I have garbage tolerance to red spices and can only handle basic hot sauce on a good day. But brown spices, like cumin and other spices used in basic brown curry sauces, are just fine for me. That's a 'warm' heat versus a 'I'm going to strip your tongue down layer by layer' heat. Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be a group issue here. Do they not like Mediterranean food? <|endoftext|>
46088	2	AITA if I tend to schedule workmen to the house when my wife is home alone? Throwaway since she is pretty active on Reddit. As the title says, we’ve had some stuff go wrong with the house lately, plumbing, gas and central heating stuff. Whenever I get someone to come and fix it, I tend to do it when my wife is home, often it turns out she’s home alone. At first she used to say (we’ve been married 10 years) that she’s not comfortable with this, but now she just looks resigned, I suppose? I feel like she’s just being a little dramatic and just doesn’t want to have to deal with it, to be honest. The thing is, we both do shift work and she’s on permanent early turn, so she’s always home before 1400, so it’s just easier to schedule afternoon appointments rather that look at my shifts to find out if I’m on or not. So, AITA?<|response|> YTA and omg the edit makes it worse. You knew all that and *still* ignored her concerns? Wtf. I guess at least you finally learned the lesson <|endoftext|>
83129	4	WIBTA If I changed my name? (Obligatory first post/on mobile, sorry if there’s any errors.) Alrighty let’s start off by saying I have a VERY generic last name. Literally the white bread of last names. I love my first name, I think it’s very pretty and has a good story behind it, but then my last name is just bleh. I obviously got my fathers last name as did younger sister. But I’m not close to my fathers family... at all. I’m 18 and the last time I saw them was in second grade. While my mothers side is my FAMILY. We spend summers and Christmas with them. I grew up visiting my cousins (first, second, and like the whole second cousin twice removed stuff) I love them! My great aunt is like a grandmother to me. I will also add that both careers I’m considering have your last name as an important detail. So the aesthetic of it kinda important to me. And my mother’s family name is very interesting and not common. I’ve brought up changing my last name to some people. My cousin thinks it awesome because the name is slowly dying away (marriages and things). My sister doesn’t want me to because she thinks it will make us less of a family. While my mom thinks it will hurt my dads feelings. And I really don’t want to hurt him :( WIBTA If I changed my last name to my mother’s family name?<|response|> Nta! Carry your moms name out! Or do what I did, I put my moms last name as my second middle name (could do that as your dads last name). <|endoftext|>
2347	3	AITA if I report somebody for repeatedly parking in front of a fire hydrant. I have neighbor whose nanny parks right in front of the fire hydrant in front of their house. There is actually a lot of street parking but just not a lot directly in front of that house however there is usually space across the street or a few houses down. I know it can be a pain in the ass to haul a baby car seat down the street when you’re trying to go somewhere. I think the Nanny and the family should work out a better parking spot for the Nanny in front of their house.<|response|> Fire hydrant access is pretty serious. You should put in an effort to talk to them and if they continue to do it then you should definitely call. <|endoftext|>
150465	3	AITA for wanting to reach out to my kid's deadbeat dad's wife? Here's the situation: I have an 18 year old son. My husband (his stepdad) and I have been together since he was a baby. My husband has always taken care of him, supported him, and acted like a father. His biological dad saw him a couple times right after birth, but abandoned him totally at 3 months old. He's never provided a single thing for him, monetary or otherwise. I've totally forgiven his dad, and tried to raise my son to sympathetic to the situation and simply appreciate that his stepdad has always been there for him. Again, we've NEVER asked or expected a single thing from this guy. The last year or so has been super shitty for my son, with some major physical and mental health issues. My husband reached out to bio dad on social media (private message) to simply get some answers about where these issues may come from, and what health history may be in his family. Bio dad saw the message then deleted all social media accounts. His wife is still on. Would I be the asshole to teach out to her to see if she can help at all? There's a chance she has no idea my son exists.<|response|> NTA. That’s your son’s mental health and well being; it’s worth it to reach out. <|endoftext|>
125345	4	AITA For getting back in line? My friends and I (4 of us total) went to a Victoria's Secret Pink event at the mall that's exclusively for college students, there are giveaways/extra tickets for the first 15 people in line, the first 40 people in line, and raffle tickets for everyone to use in the giftcard raffle. We got there early, so I had one of my friends stay in line while we went shopping and went to get ice cream. When we came back, there was an hour left before the event started and there were some new people in line; we stood by our friend in the front and never really got "in" line I guess. When the people working the event told us to get in a single file line, we tried to shuffle in line but this girl who was 3rd in line (she wasn't there before we left) stopped us from doing it so we just stayed to the side of the line where we were anyways. A few people were agitated and said we should get at the back of the line since we came late, but our friend held our spot in line so we should have been good. We became part of the first 15 & first 40 to get certain goodies and the event went smoothly. Now someone is calling us out on social media for cutting in line and not following the rules, calling us selfish and greedy... Is it really that big of a deal that we got back in line with our friend or aita for not going to the back? I really just wanted to enjoy the event and make sure I got the extra stuff since we were there so early. TL;DR, We got to a giveaway event early, had a friend save our spot in line while we left to shop, and the line was bigger when we came back and stood with our friend at the front of the line, people didn't like that, said we were cutting and should have went to the back.<|response|> YTA &#x200B; One person holding the spot for multiple people isn't really fair on those behind. If you want to take part in the event then you should have to wait like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
96192	2	AITA for wanting specific birthday cake? Hi all, I need to know opinions of strangers on this. My son will be 1 soon and me and my family are planning birthday party for him with cake. Because it is going to be in different country it is my mom and sister getting cake and they asked me, what I want and also send me some pictures of lady who's baking. All those cakes looks amazing, but they are all covered with fondant (or similar icing) and I don't like that. So I told them, that I want something without fondant, only cream and some cure decorations, so it's looks nice and also taste nice. I told them that not only I, but my boyfriend also agree, that these types of icing maybe looks good, but that's it. I have never had cake like that tastes good, they were mostly dry and fondant always taste like chemicals. My sister got offended and so did my mom. They both told me, that they only wanted nice cake, since nobody eats them anyway. I don't know what they told to that baker, but she doesn't make cakes without it, so they had to cancel their order. My boyfriend is with me in it, but my mom and sister almost refused to help me pick cake (or find bakery or baker as I don't live there for years and I barely know anyone and my friends are also all around world). Do you think I should step back and go for cake I would definitely not like, or stick to what me and my partner wants for our boy as birthday cake?<|response|> NTA. Fondant is gross, so it's obvious that "no one eats them anyway." <|endoftext|>
92933	4	AITA For lying to my dad during his divorce Backstory time My mom and dad were married for a god 25 years or so. They didnt have the perfect marriage but they did what they could and tried their best. Now for the present. My dad was caught cheating on my mom with a coworker of his. My mom being the saint she was tried to make things work. But when he kept talking to her and interacting with her my mom had enough. So my mom and brothers left and moved to a different state not to far but a considerable distance. My older brother switched sides and went back. My mom then cut all communications with him. He keeps asking me if i can get ahold of her "which i can". But to try and save my mom some heartache i lie and say no. Am i asshole for lying to him? Edit: my mom told me to lie to him<|response|> NTA for trying to not hurt your mum. However it's best to come clean and just tell him you don't want to and it's up to her if she wants to talk to him <|endoftext|>
152534	3	AITA for asking my co-worker not to clip his fingernails in the office? I work at a small company. I share a tiny room with a co-worker. He always clip his fingernails in the office. Not even during lunch or anyting like that. He just pulls the clipper out without warning then it's snip snip time. This annoys the shit out of me. He's working at a standing desk too. Which is twice as annoying. I asked him politely once, then not so politely couple more times over time. He told me to "fuck off" since it's none of my business. I asked my boss to maybe mention it to him in passing, but he didn't want to get involved in "our drama." Is it too much to ask? What's he going to do next, move on to the toenails?<|response|> NTA. not only is that unhygienic and inconsiderate of your shared space, the way he handled his response was disrespectful <|endoftext|>
128665	1	AITA for being upset with my (f18) boyfriend (m19) for forgetting my HS graduation and planning a trip to England? TLDR at the bottom. Context: My (f18) boyfriend (m19) and I have been dating nearly two years. We attended the same highschool together for six years. Last year, I attended most of his graduation dates. I stayed at his rehearsal for graduation, attended the senior chapel, and his graduation. We have never had any major problems in our relationship except his inability to schedule or be on time. A recent example is our senior prom. For his senior prom, I showed up to his house three hours before when we needed to arrive. I asked him to be ready to leave for class pictures when I got there. I arrive and he is showering. We miss class pictures, and nearly miss our reservation required dinner as well. I let it slide because it was his prom and he had freedom to do whatever. For my senior prom, I let him know the date months in advance so he could ask off work so we could do pictures and have a rolling schedule because that's what works best for us. He didn't ask off for work because he forgot about prom. He let's me know a week before so I have to reschedule our pictures and not attend our class dinner. I really wanted to attended the dinner because I have a class of 17 students and we are very close. Cut to today. Last night he let me know that he forgot to let his dad know my graduation dates so they wouldn't plan a trip overseas during that time. So he is missing my senior chapel, senior breakfast, graduation, and graduation party. I let him know how upset I was and that I was mad at him. He asked me to "give him some slack ... it was a human mistake." I had let him know many times when my graduation was and how important it was for me to have him attend. I sent his family announcements to my senior breakfast and graduation and I talked about it a lot. Am I the Asshole? TLDR: My boyfriend forgot to let his dad know when my graduation is so they wouldn't plan over it. I'm upset with him, am I the asshole?<|response|> NTA clearly and wtf "We attended the same highschool together for six years." How? did you both fail a grade twice? <|endoftext|>
33223	2	AITA for accepting an insurance settlement against my friends wishes? So about 2 months ago I was in a car accident with a good friend of mine. We have a FWB type of relationship. I'll explain why that's relevant in a minute. The car was totaled and both of us were injured. He had a concussion and I hurt my ribs pretty bad. The police came and took both of our vitals and our information. So here's where the issue lies... he was buying the car from his ex girlfriend and everything was still in her name. She isn't the most mature person imo and they have problems consistently despite being broken up. As a result he didn't want her to find out I was in the car with him because of OUR dynamic because she would freak out. I didn't end up going to the hospital even though I wanted to because I didn't want the bill to get charged to her car insurance. He asked me to lie about why I was hurt so I just didn't go because I was uncomfortable with doing that. A few weeks after the accident the insurance company began calling me asking for a statement. The first time they called I asked him what he wanted me to do. He said, "Just be like 'I don't know what you're talking about.'" I was also uncomfortable with that. So I ignored them for awhile. The next time I talked to him about it he asked me to ignore them. I told them I wasn't sure what I was gonna do yet. Today they called me again and I finally answered. I gave my statement and they offered me a 1000$ settlement for my injuries which I accepted. I feel like it's important to mention that the money could also REALLY help me right now. As soon as I was done talking to the insurance company I called him and let him know what was going on. He is FURIOUS with me now because I gave a statement to the insurance company and now his ex is going to find out I was in the car. My thing though is it's already on record that I was in the accident with him and the police have my information. So I don't think I'm massively fucking him over in any way. And I WAS actually injured so I don't think he's being fair by asking me to lie or turn down the settlement. So Reddit, AITA? EDIT: I'm going to make a doctor's appointment now regardless since a lot of people are urging me to do so in their comments.<|response|> NTA. You sure she's an ex? Doesn't sound like an ex. <|endoftext|>
97560	2	AITA If I don’t switch rooms with my roommate? My roommate and I have been roommates for almost two years now. It’s been good and I have no complaints thus far. On our first day of moving in we were discussing who should get the bigger room. I was willing to flip a coin or something in that nature to determine who gets the room. My roommate INSISTED that I take the bigger room given that I had the bigger bed, dresser, tv unit etc. Also I’m also a bigger guy than him, so he thought it made sense for me to have the bigger room. I didn’t argue with him. I accepted graciously and that was that. Fast forward to now, I have been sleeping on the couch in the living room for the past few months. Last time i slept in my room was about 2 months ago. I often joke with my roommate about how the couch has become my new bed. I sleep on the couch often because after a long day of work, I like to kick back and watch movies til I pass out. It’s sort of becoming routine. The other day my roommate texted me asking me if i would be willing to switch rooms given the fact that I don’t really sleep in it anyway. I told him that while i don’t sleep in there very often, I still do hangout in there to use my computer and stuff and that if he wanted the room, he should’ve let me know from the beginning and we would have decided fairly. In the beginning I would have been fine with either room. But after almost two years, I’ve gotten comfortable with this one and i don’t really feel like switching. I explained this to him and he seemed fine at first, but he’s starting to act a bit strangely distant from me. We’ve become very close and now I’m starting to wonder if I’m being an asshole here. What do you guys think? AITA? Also just wanted to add that my roommate is in a relationship and spends the majority of his time at their place. So I feel like even if we switched, he wouldn’t be using the room much either<|response|> NTA for not switching. YTA for sleeping on the couch like a gross teenager. Roommate is never there because of your lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
177255	4	WIBTA If I stopped paying the bills I decided to, to help my mom while I don't live there because she is allowing tenants downstairs to stay even though they owe her and have missed payments ? I got a contract job that has moved me an hour away from the city my family lives in. I have this job for only 6 months, but it was great pay increase and allowed me to live on my own for the first time. I am 26F. My mom to put it simply is horrible with money. She leaves payments to accumulate and go to collections, only makes minimum payments, and has a hoarding/shopping problem. Always buying useless things and the house is filled with them. She raised 6kids as a single mother and did a great job, but she is so used to buying things for 7 people - she hasnt stopped even tho 4 of my older siblings moved out years ago. Finance is always a battle for her. We have a house (mortgage) and her and my step dad barley make enough to pay the mortgage monthly with their income alone. I was helping out while I was in school/working but put paying off my students as my top priority as I don't want debt. Once I finished doing that - I took over two bills (by adding them as a payee, not putting into my name) since Feb, I have been paying atleast 400-600 a month. I never told anyone I finished paying my debts as I would look like a walking bank machine. I have no reason to gloat. Back to me moving out. My monthly pay is about 3500-4000/mth. I negotiated my pay to where I was able to afford rent / save / necessities / helping my mom. It has been about two months now, and I usually go back on the weekends to see family. I was talking to sister and talking about our family dynamics/struggles/etc. She brought up that the two people my mom has living downstairs are not great tenants. (One is my aunt's father. The other is a distant family friend I think - I don't ask) my mom charges 500/each - including everything and their own rooms - but shared bathroom and kitchen. For a long time now I told my mom that was stupid cheap but she didn't listen to me. I found out from my sister yesterday that the distant family friend still owes my mom money for the two months he left and went back to the Caribbean and is still late on the recent months. AND he brought his son down which means more usage in the house. At this point I am pissed. I don't even live there anymore and I'm upset that I am now taking money out of my paycheck that I could be saving (as this is only 6months) and the people whole live there are not getting shit from my mom or even seem to care. My mom is 60 and my step<|response|> NTA You are 100% within reason to stop paying them. They aren't your responsibility and you do not gain from paying them. Equally I understand the need to want to support your family and make sure they are well and good. But if your mother and father are not willing to take matters into their own hands and sort out their current tenants, just because it's easier to collect money off you, you need to show them that they can't just use you as a piggy bank. With that said. Congratulations on the job and you're a great child for supporting them for as long as you have done. <|endoftext|>
126536	4	AITA for telling my engaged friend I think weddings are dumb? Over a year ago I (29F) was invited to dinner with my 2 best friends since middle school. My friend C and the other friend K are engaged. I happen to be divorced for 2 years. At dinner, C and K can't stop talking about their weddings, which are over a year away, and I end up feeling excluded. I try to bring up other topics, but they keep only talking to each other and just about weddings. I get tipsy quickly and annoyed. I sigh loudly and try to redirect the convo to something ALL of us can partake in. This doesnt work so I start drunkenly running my mouth about how weddings are a waste of money, marriage doesnt change anything between them, how if their relationship is shitty before the marriage, it's not going to change after the marriage (just in general, not directed towards them). I realize that THIS occurence was me being an asshole. C, her fiancee, my man and myself went to dinner together about a month after this. Everything seemed fine. That was April '18. Fast forward to January '19 and I hadn't seen C since the time we went to dinner in April. I sent her a message asking if she was upset at me, thinking she couldn't POSSIBLY be upset over what I said at dinner still. It took her a week to respond. She admitted she was mad at me for what I said at the dinner. I apologize PROFUSELY, stating that those were my opinions and had nothing to do with my feelings about her and their wonderful relationship, which I'm supportive of. She also cited other incidents where she had seen me checked in on FB in our home town where she still lives and the fact that I didn't text her to say hey. I said that the majority of those times I was in town was during a weekday day and she works m-f 9-5 so I knew she couldn't hang out. I cited times I had seen her checked in on FB at the farmers market next to where I live and I never took offence to the fact that she didn't say hey to me either when she was in my town. I asked her to have dinner with me so we could sort this out face to face. I wasn't about to let 15+ years go down the drain over something stupid I said. At dinner I made sure to let her talk as much as she wanted to about wedding. We seemed to have ended on good terms. She made a big deal about being tired and heading home. I didn't mention my plans after dinner, but I was meeting with another friend for drinks. While out, I saw C at the same bar I was at. I was taken aback, seeing as she made a big deal about going home, but didn't let it ruin my night. This was Feb. I haven't<|response|> YTA. When people are excited about something, raining on their parade is not cool. You gotta let go of that bitter betty attitude surrounding weddings if more of your pals are going to get married. I don't have advice on how to fix it, sorry. There are subs like r/relationshipadvice that would be helpful <|endoftext|>
119722	1	AITA the asshole for refusing to do a list a chores my gf left for me? Gf and I have lived together since October. We share in the housework on weekends. We usually spend Sunday doing a deep cleaning and doing any other errands that need to be done. It’s worked out well for us. This week I’m on vacation from work. When I woke up this morning I found a list of things my gf wanted me to do today. I’m really bothered by it. I’m not her child. It’s so insulting. Honestly had she asked me nicely the night before if I minded doing some of these things I wouldn’t have had a problem, but to leave me a list of chores is just rubbing me the wrong way. I crumpled the list up and did my own thing today. When gf came home she was annoyed that nothing got done. She doesn’t see the difference between asking me with a shred of respect to do some things and leaving me a list like she’s my mother. She’s been grumbling and moody all night, but I’m not going to apologize. I think my feelings are justified.<|response|> YTA Jesus dude she left a fucking list because she left before you woke up and probably wanted to help you remember what needed to be done. You’re acting like a fucking child over this. Grow the hell up, leaving a list isn’t infantilizing. You’re throwing up big red flags tho and I wouldn’t be surprised if she left you quite frankly. <|endoftext|>
24431	2	AITA for refusing to forgive my younger brother? A little backstory: My brother and I were always extremely close up until 3 years ago. When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma’s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn’t want to see me anymore. I was upset but I gave him space thinking I’d talk to him and explain he doesn’t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it’s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more. I get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don’t feel he is entitled to forgiveness. I apologize if there isn’t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn’t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree.<|response|> YTA. He was 12 years old, forgive him. <|endoftext|>
42849	3	AITA for telling my Mom to mind her own business about my spouse? For context, me/my spouse and my side of the family live 3K miles away. 1. My spouse did not travel 3K miles to attend a 3-hr baby shower on a Sunday for my sister. I was deployed at the time, and in the process of moving back home with her family she forgot to RSVP. When she responded, my Mom told her she “would be lying if she wasn’t disappointed.” She’s still not over it. 2. While deployed, I encouraged my spouse to have fun and not worry about me. My wife has her own career. What she wants to do with her money and her weekend is up to her. My Mom felt her posting pictures on social media with her friends was incredibly disrespectful to me and my service while deployed (it’s not), stopped talking to her because of it while I was gone, and still isn’t over it. 3. I didn’t have a functional phone immediately upon returning from a deployment so I asked my wife to send a text to my family saying I arrived safely and would talk to them the following day so I could spend the evening alone with my spouse. My Mom sent my wife a text back saying “congratulations…you won. It’s not all about you”. I suppose my Mom thought it was a malicious attempt on behalf of my wife to keep me from contacting them (?). If anything, that’s on me I’m not sure why my Mom directed her anger at my spouse. 4. My wife is a germaphobe. It’s not easy, but she meets me halfway on this. My Mom believes this is a personality deficit I guess vs. an actual disorder and took offense at the answer when she asked my wife why she wasn’t eating a cookie from a communal tray in our own home while they were visiting. 5. My mom accused my spouse of being jealous of my sister for not liking/commenting on the FB posts of her child enough, believes she’s waging a war to keep me from seeing my family, and accuses me of doing nice things for my wife just so she doesn’t leave me (...incredibly offensive). Additionally, my mom has thinks my spouse had nothing before she met me, has everything now, and is ungrateful for it. 6. For reasons including but not limited to the above, my wife probably won’t join us on a family vacations this year. I don’t necessarily agree with her decision, but I understand why she feels that way and the bottom line is she’s an adult who can make her own vacation decisions. My Mom told me that I needed to do something about it. I don’t plan to. Bottom line is I told my Mom that my relationship with my spouse is none of her business, to keep her unsolicited advice to herself, and to stop saying negative things directly to my spouse. I know deep down my Mom just wants the best<|response|> YWBTA if you actually go on that family vacation while your family is treating your wife this badly, show some solidarity man <|endoftext|>
193991	4	AITA For refusing to keep taking care of my friend's puppy after sayin yes I have a friend that was traveling for a month because of work (23M). He had bought a puppy a week before traveling and he had asked me (25M) to take care of him although i have no experience with dogs he told me it's going to be easy and that i will have fun and he gave me food and told me this will be enough until he is back and that she is trained to piss and shit on a pad and that i shouldn't worry about her missing my place up he is known for being careless After he gave me the dog next day he traveled and i found out that the dog food she is eating is not suitable for her and i had to go buy new food that is for her and couple more things she needed and that all was from my money not his. Fast forward a couple of week i live in an apartment in New York and my apartment always smells like shit and piss and when i talked to a vet he told me that she is still no old enough to be on her own and that she should live with her mother also she requires a vaccine that is kind of expensive and he didn't give me any money to spend on her. After a couple more weeks i couldn't take it anymore and told him to find her another place to stay at because i can't take it anymore he gave her to one of his friends and my friends are telling me that I'm the asshole in this situation and that i should've kept my word. Am I the asshole?? Edit: After i knew she was so small to even be away from her mom i bought formula milk for babies and made her drink it until she was old enough to eat normal puppy food and also i bought her clothes because i read if puppies get flu it can end their life, keep in mind that I'm going through a really rough financial situation i tried to give her all the things i can<|response|> NTA The friend should never have left a brand new puppy who hasn’t even been trained or vaccinated with someone else. He’s clearly a careless pet owner and you should tell these things to vet/animal control. The dog needs to be Re-homed to someone who can properly take care of her. Edit: autoincorrect <|endoftext|>
179991	3	AITA for telling my husband I hate his tattoo I love tattoos. My husband has two sleeves while I don't like some of his tattoos they all mean something to him and he loves them so that's all that matters. But recently he been wanting a SMALL tattoo behind his ear. I told him to go for it as long as it's small and not a neck tattoo. Today he surprised me with it but I almost wanted to cry when I seen it. It was a f**king giant rose on his neck. It took half of his neck and almost touches his face. We always talk about it and he knew I didn't care if he gets any tattoos as long as from the neck up he was clear. I was upset about it and I told him I didn't like it. It's a well done rose but it's so big for no reason. He said he'll get it removed if I really didn't like it but I can tell his sad about it. Am I the asshole ?<|response|> NTA he knew where you stood with the positions of his tattoo. The other people who say his body his choice are absolutely right. But that does NOT make you the one in the wrong for hating it. <|endoftext|>
127146	4	AITA for letting my mom help out around our house My wife and I have been married 5 years and have 2 kids (4m and 1f). Our older boy has a rare condition that causes him to have to stay home from day care a lot. My mother, who lives in the area, frequently helps us out on these occasions by coming to our house and caring for whichever kid or kids can't go to day care. If it weren't for this, either my wife or I would probably have to quit working, because even between the two of us we just don't have enough sick time for one of us to stay home as often as we'd have to. I work two jobs totaling \~55 hours a week, and my wife is a teacher, which is pretty much like having two jobs also. Mom has a tendency to want to do household tasks while she's here, especially since both of our kids are still young enough to frequently take long naps. After one early occasion when she did my wife's laundry uninvited, certain boundaries were established, namely that mom doesn't mess with my wife's stuff. To find the best balance between their feelings, I normally find a task or two that I would otherwise have to do, and give it to Mom to do while she's watching the kid(s). We have a basement space in our house that is mainly only used by me, as my office/man-cave (wife has some things stored down there and would basically only ever go there to get them and then leave). Like most spaces I occupy on my own, the place is a festering cesspit of evil, featuring clothes and other items strewn on the floor, week-old used dishes, dust, man-smell, and general clutter. This is by explicit agreement with my wife - I try to keep the common spaces of the house in a condition that's congenial to her, but I can keep a mess in my happy place. Last time my mother came over, she went to the basement to get some of my laundry to do, at my request. While she was there, she sort of tidied up the room, picked up a bunch of stuff from the floor, took any dishes she found up to wash them, stacked up various papers in neat piles, etc. Later in the evening I was in the basement and she came down and was completely furious that "I let my mother clean up my office but I wouldn't let my own wife do it." This is a slight misrepresentation, but not too bad. We have tried to clean the place up as a team a couple of times, and it always led to fighting, because while I was willing to accept help in tidying the place up (even though I don't care at all whether it's tidy or not), help from her in cleaning a space always leads to a design conversation, "don't you want to replace this ratty old chair" etc. I did not<|response|> NAH. It's understandable that your wife feels like your mom is encroaching on her territory. But it sounds like your mom gets bored when she's babysitting. And if you want her services for free, then you can't be mean to your mom. You can reiterate what rooms are not to be cleaned. <|endoftext|>
16155	4	AITA For calling my wife a leech? I (27F) have been working for our entire relationship. She (27F too) was supposed to get her degree in the first 4 years, and get a decent job to support me to look for a better career. She didn’t. Instead she has been unemployed majority of the time with a few minimum wage jobs that she hardly showed up to. I understood when our son was young, but he is 6 now and and in school most of the day. The house only gets cleaned when her mother announces she is going to be over or after I flip out and snap at her. A year ago she said she was going to join the army. They rejected her until she lost the excess weight. Yesterday I brought it up and asked what was her plan? Which turned to a heated discussion when I called her a leech. We have been married 9 years during which she racked up so much credit card debt on our joint cards that I don’t believe I can afford a divorce. Update #1: A lot of people are pointing out we got married at 18. Yes. Was it stupid. Yes. Do I tell any teenagers that are "madly in love" to learn from my mistakes? yes. People told me, but just like any other teenager out there "I knew better than a bunch of adults" Let's not focus on my age of marriage anymore please.<|response|> ESH. You're the less-big asshole though. You said something that was hurtful (and, possibly, a low-blow) out of frustration and anger at an unresolved circumstance that has stretched on for some time. Your wife is a leech. So yeah, you're wrong for being rude out of anger. Anger doesn't give you a free pass to insult people. But your anger is fully understandable, and fully justifiable. <|endoftext|>
23690	3	AITA for sending my friend medical marijuana from my state to his state (where it's not legalized at all) and using "Arthur Morgan" for the fake return address info and insisting that the name had nothing to do with it getting compromised? Throwaway account. My friend paid me $50 to send him an order from my local dispensary. There was about $350 worth of product in the package - flowers, concentrate, and edibles. It was my first time, but I had been convinced that if we did everything right, there wouldn't be any issues. I used USPS, made sure nothing smelled, just sent it regular ground shipping, and used an existing address for the return, but not my own. And I put "Arthur Morgan" for the return name as a subtle reference to RDR2 because my friend had been playing it and raving about it recently. The package showed up about 3 days later than what it was originally predicted to arrive, and everything had been stolen out of the package. The bottom had been cut open carefully with a knife and then retaped very neatly after the goods were extracted. We both knew there was a chance of this happening, so we both agree that using AM for the return name wasn't the only thing that could have led to this happening, but I'm not convinced using that name significantly increased the odds of it getting ripped off. My unfortunate friend and a few other people have instantly said I shouldn't have used that name when they heard the story. AITA?<|response|> ESH You shouldn't have tried to ship him drugs when it's illegal in his state. He shouldn't have been trying to buy drugs in an abnormally risky way (getting your drugs delivered by a federal company is a lot riskier then getting it delivered by your local plug) Edit: Two letters <|endoftext|>
12922	3	AITA for not going to rehab Before you judge to harshly im not asking if im the asshole for being an addict but for refusing rehab now because of what happened. I stayed off drugs for 14 months thanks to methadone but my parents pressured and demanded i come off it. I didnt think i was ready to make the step but they fought me on it and made me give in. I relapsed after coming off and didnt tell my parents because i was mad at them for making me come off and I didn't want there advice. I was going to get back on methadone after the stress of Christmas and tell them when the time was right but they caught me and now are demanding i do rehab and saying that this is proof that I didn't make progress because I relapsed when I came off it. Methadone gave the most stability i had and i think going to rehab now is a waste of money and a big step back for me after ive reestablished a career. That and im mad at them for pushing me to come off when i wasnt ready. My actions are my own but part of me blames them. No one is taking my side because for being an addict im always made out to be the asshole in any fight.<|response|> NTA, it's your life, you have the right to decide that you don't want to go to rehab. <|endoftext|>
23091	3	WIBTA if applied for a job & didn’t tell them it’s temporary? I just don’t know what the proper, non-asshole way is to approach this and still get some place to hire me, so I turn to you, Reddit. I have a clinical rotation thru school for 10 weeks in a city in which I have no connections. I would like to find a weekend job as a hostess at a restaurant since I have past experience doing that. It will be summer time, I figure places can use the extra help anyways, but after trying to find a job for maybe a week, I will probably only be working there a total of 9 weeks. Would I be an asshole if I just give my two weeks notice at the end? What is the least asshole-y way to approach this but also not turn places off from hiring me?<|response|> NAH If an employer actually cared about employees staying long term they would offer them actual employment contracts. But as long as employers reserve the right to fire you at the drop of a hat you get to quit at the drop of a hat. This is a business relationship and not a personal one, treat it as such. <|endoftext|>
156465	5	AITA for getting rid of a dog my gf wanted to adopt? Okay, so me (28M) and my gf (23F) went travelling earlier this year. We made it to Indonesia for our last stop and we stayed for 3 weeks. The first day we got there, we were on a beach and a small puppy approached us. He was small, underfed and in a bad way so my gf got it some puppy food and fed it. I told her this was stupid as this would draw in other dogs and that she's gonna get attached. The next morning, the puppy was still on the beach near our apartment - again, my gf decided to feed it. Over the next few days she kept feeding the dog and grew super attached to it. We were due to travel to our next hotel in a different city and the dog followed us all the way. Like, it literally followed us on the taxi, through cities and to the apartment. The dog kept crying outside the hotel so the next day my gf took it to a local vet, got it's rabies vaccine and tests which all came back clear and then the next night when the dog was crying, she let it in the apartment where it slept. My gf then hit me with the bombshell the next day that she was going to spend a further 3 months in the country so that we could get the dog back to the UK. She'd spent hours researching and decided to break the journey home up into two very short flights and a ferry so that it's less stress for the dog. She knew we needed to get the dog tested and vaccines and then keep it in the country for 3 months or it'd be quarantined alone when back in the UK. This was set to cost thousands of pounds. Money we don't really have as we've just spent 6 months travelling. We have no jobs secured for our return, so I don't think it's responsible to get a dog even if she has the money to pay for it all. My gf went to do a day massage course and left me with the dog. I decided enough was enough and took the dog for a long long walk, put some food down for it before hopping on my bike and going back to the apartment. The dog didn't find me after that. My gf returned, I'd packed up to go to the next place and she panicked about the dog. I told her the truth, and why I'd done it and she was hysterical and went looking for the dog, like searching everywhere. She ended up breaking up with me, calling me a psycho and abandoned me in our apartment. I think I did the right thing but AITA? **TL;DR** Gf got attached to stray dog, wanted to bring it back to the UK costing thousands. I got rid of the dog by luring it elsewhere and gf left me.<|response|> YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. I'm not saying any of this to hurt your feelings, but I'm gonna be completely honest with you: 1. You probably killed that dog. It was starving before she found it. Most dogs don't make it long without humans or a pack to take care of them. You need to sit with that. 2. For the record, she was absolutely right to break up with you. Abandoning a dog and breaking her heart are major red flags for future abuse. I would have told her to run from your relationship as fast as she could. 3. The fact that you don't realize what an asshole breaking your gf's heart and abandoning a puppy makes you is really worrying. That kind of behavior is unacceptable. You didn't just hurt her. You, again, probably sentenced that dog to death. Be better than this. Be a better boyfriend to your future partners and a better fucking person, dude, because, what the fuck? Why? Why would you do that and think it's ok? <|endoftext|>
135361	3	AITA for not telling my FWB I'm casually dating? Throwaway. I'm friends with benefits with a friend from college. We live in different states but are in each other's cities a several times a year for work. We keep in casual friendly (non-sexual) contact the rest of the time, mostly in a group chat with mutual friends. When we're in the same city we hook up. We've both been clear from the beginning that this is a purely friendship-and-sex situation, no romantic feelings or commitment. We wouldn't be compatible romantically for a million reasons and neither of us is actually interested in dating the other, but we're good friends and the sex is nice. I've been dating casually this whole time. Here and there, not all the time - a big part of the reason we started this setup was because we're both really focused on our careers and unwilling to put the time into dating properly. I don't really talk to my friends about it because it's very casual and sparse and I like to play my love life close to the vest, so I didn't explicitly tell him this, but I thought he knew and assumed he was doing the same. Recently I met somebody that I would like to try to be more serious with. It's new and we're not making any big commitments, but it's at the point where I would feel inappropriate dating/sleeping around and expect to have that "exclusive" conversation soon. So I gave FWB a heads up that I'm dating somebody, just so he knows that when he comes to town next time we won't be hooking up. And also because now that I have some actual news to report on the romance front, I thought he'd like to know, as my friend. He got upset. He said he had no idea that I had been dating at all, and that he hasn't been dating. He is mad that he missed so many "opportunities" (the way he said this is suspect to me but ok) because he thought he wasn't supposed to be dating. I \*never\* made that request of him and we have discussed that our situation is purely no-strings-attached over and over. We were careful to have boundaries and to be clear with each other that this is NSA. At first I thought that maybe he was upset because he thought I'd been sleeping around and might give him STDs or something. This seemed like a fair concern to me so I told him that I hadn't been having sex in between our encounters, just going on dates (not one for casual sex with strangers). New partner is the first person I've had sex with since we began our FWBship, and if things had fizzled I would have told FWB about this before we hooked up again. BUT that wasn't his issue. He really just has a problem with the fact that I've been dating, "feels like a chump," and feels like he "missed out on opportunities." I feel like this isn't my<|response|> NTA - You made it clear what your intentions were, it’s his own fault for assuming exclusivity in a casual relationship <|endoftext|>
136736	5	AITA for disobeying HRs demand that I dress in more loose fitting clothes? Firstly, yes this is America 🙄 I'm a trainer for a big telecom company. I train engineers and I'm very respected and qualified in my field. Now, since I was 14 or 15, I've been body shammed for having big boobs. By 16 I was a DD. Now at 31 I'm a triple D. Not to humble brag (this detail is important), but my waist is naturally pretty tiny. My measurements are, 33DDD-24-37 at 5'2" 125lbs. Now my job has me teaching groups of mainly male engineers at least for 1-3 weeks of the month. I travel a lot too. Anyway, we aren't requested to dress to formally, in fact our company has a very lax dress code, especially during training. Lots of the guys wear t shirts. Most of the instructors wear polos, shirts and maybe a t-shirt on Fridays. We're casual too but not as casual as the guys we train. Anyway, I don't dress casual. I wear mainly form fitting shirts and polos. A problem I've had anyways with clothes is that because my boobs are so big, even though I'm technically a small or extra small in top, I'm forced to buy a medium or large. This means I'm forced to alter almost all my tops by taking them in additions around my waist. If I don't, sure to my petite size, I look like a fat blocky person. It's not flattering and it really affects my confidence. So apparently, I've got at least 3 complaints to HR that I'm accentuating my breasts to much and that I need to dress more conservatively by wearing less form fitting clothes. This is so hypocritical of them. Firstly there are several other equally attractive (some far prettier than me) female trainers who wear even tighter tops than I do. They just get away with it because they've got smaller breasts. Secondly, a few of the make trainers here are into fitness and wear very very tight slim fit t-shirts and polos. My clothes isn't even that tight honestlty, there's like 4-6 inches of room in my tops around my waist. I wasn't told to comply, but they director of HR in my office said he STRONGLY recommends I try to dress more modestly. I was 100% against it and told him I'd think about it, but that would require an entirely new wardrobe and it's not going to happen anytime soon. He said, he can give me some company t-shirts to help my transition. I left the meeting really really upset. It reminds me so much of how as a teen my highschool teachers would single me out to wear less tight tops to school. It made me feel so ashamed of my large breasts. Yesterday I read the opinions of many on that 15 year-old girl wearing a cheeky bathing suit to a communal pool at her grandparents. I fully thought OP was an asshole, but do many of you agreed that the circumstance and venue<|response|> NTA!!! I am also a big breasted woman and I sympathize with you over this. Unless you’ve ever had large breasts you have NO clue how hard it is to find tops that fit properly. As long as you don’t have extensive cleavage hanging out then you are FINE. If your top is form fitting- too fucking bad for everyone else. Make sure to save any emails regarding this matter as well as check to see if your state allows 1 party aware taped conversations. I would record all interactions in case they try to come at you. You could have a harassment case against them. Stay strong girl. <|endoftext|>
165750	3	AITA mom flips out hard. did i do anything wrong here? so, i'm a relatively low-key streamer on twitch (2k followers at the time) and had homework to complete that night. i said to my mum that i was planning to end the stream at 10:30 to give myself half an hour to complete the homework and she agreed. at 10:31pm she busts through my door right as i am saying goodbye to the stream and wrapping up and just starts screaming at me. this isn't a rare occurrence either and she is trying to convince me that i am just a toxic asshole whenever i call her out on it. she also refuses to sit down and have a conversation about it. i just want to know, did i do anything wrong? i feel as a parent you should at least give your child some leeway when it comes to stuff like that. especially if you know they are broadcasting themselves live while you do it. i had to apologise to my viewers the next day on stream as some of them are quite young and it disturbed / scared some of them. Please let me know, i want to know where people stand on this.<|response|> We've only got the one side here, you paint this picture of being an A pupil, never does anything wrong, your Mum flies off the handle for no reason, it sounds as though only hearing half of the story. You should have done homework before going online, what aren't you saying? Had your Mum asked you to do some chores, hang your uniform up, move something? Flying off the handle for 1 minute seems harsh. You've got good grades at school, what about behaviour? Are you always getting into trouble at school? <|endoftext|>
46140	3	AITA for telling my spouse they can't have a weekly game night? After we married, my spouse started a bi-weekly game night leaving me solo (I was invited to join, but declined). Game lasts 5ish hours and game night is sacred it’s a long term RPG & everyone tries hard not to miss &#x200B; Then we had a kid and spouse took a break. When kid turned 1, my spouse returned to the bi-weekly game leaving me to parent. Off week was family time. After a few years - about the time our kid got past the terrible 3's and became a cool person - spouse said "Hey, you're (OP) getting a bi-weekly solo night with kid. I (spouse) want solo time with kid. Lets do this, every other week I'll (spouse) do game night and you (OP) get solo kid night. On the game off week, I'll (spouse) do solo night with kid and you (OP) get night to yourself to make up for game night" &#x200B; Kid #2 came and kid #1 starting doing extracurricular stuff outside of school. Spouse took 2-3 months off from game night after kid #2 came along. Once game night restarted, the new plan was to use baby sitter. Game night week, babysitter got baby, I (OP) got solo night w/ older kid, spouse did game night. Off week, babysitter got baby, spouse got solo night with older kid, I got night to myself &#x200B; As we move forward, the amount of family time we have erodes. A year ago kid #1's sport schedule changed and a new family schedule started - kid 1 has practice early on a weeknight, too early for fam dinner (we lose another evening as a family) . Spouse says "I'll (spouse) take kid 1 out for dinner and then to early practice, you (OP) and kid 2 do your own thing". Then spouse realized they were getting 2 solo nights with kid one so they converted the non-game-night night with kid into solo no kid night for just them. I was OK with this because spouse would invite me to join (date night!) or since this solo night was not as sacred as a game night it was open to being canceled to make up for family time &#x200B; Then, spouse makes a friend who learns about game night and says "I haven't done that in years! We should do one". And they do on what was the "off week". So, now my spouse is playing in 2 games, 5 hours each and now game night is every week. I was invited to join, I declined because I'm not into this stuff. &#x200B; This is where I said it was too much. My spouse claimed I can't tell them what to do with their time. This night (the game off night) was their night and I have no say about them doing a game. I said it was only your solo night b/c of some changes to the packed schedule and I have the right to ask for more<|response|> INFO. This is a bit hard to follow for me. Your partner is doing a five-hour game night every other week, and on the off weeks, your partner is watching the kids so you can have time off. Is the partner just wanting to devote time they had free to another game? So if this was a day your partner was supposed to have to themselves, what's the issue if that free time becomes a second game rather than just being used for other alone time? <|endoftext|>
29338	4	AITA here? Girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic and I sent it to his gf. So... yeah. LOL. Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M. &#x200B; Girlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months. &#x200B; Last night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption "Miss you, do you miss this?". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol. &#x200B; I then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's "seen" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so "in your face" about it. &#x200B; Am I an asshole for what I did? I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.<|response|> NTA for sending the pic but a bit TA for the sneaky way you went about it. You should have talked it through with your gf rather than stealing it off her phone when she was in the shower then covering your tracks. <|endoftext|>
134318	4	AITA for how I hung up on my mom? For a little background my mom and I were never exactly best friends. I’m in college now so I don’t live with her, but I blame our disagreements on our different personalities. It’s not like I hate her or anything, we just aren’t compatible. I don’t call her as much as I call my dad, which I feel guilty about, but most of our phone calls end with her saying something that ruins the mood. Like we’ll be talking about our day and she’ll say something condescending to me when I get vulnerable or start venting. So this morning I called my dad to vent because he gives me advice without making it sound like I’m whining. He put me on speaker and my mom basically took over the conversation by nagging and lecturing. I said “I didn’t call for this”. In hindsight it was rude and my delivery was disrespectful, but this is something I say to my dad all the time because we have the kind of relationship where he knows I’m joking. Anyway my mom said “Then don’t call anymore” and I responded with “I won’t” and hung up after there was no response. Like I said, I know I was being rude, but it pissed me off that I called my dad to vent and she hijacked the conversation with her condescending nagging. So AITA?<|response|> NTA. You’re never okay to fight fire with fire, (Albeit feels necessary sometimes.) It’s unneeded for your mother to show hostility towards the end of a conversation. And given the opportunity, I would ask why she’s acting this way, (In the least condescending way of course), To which you two should then fix your given issues and furthermore, MOVE ON. <|endoftext|>
190096	3	WIBTA if I (33M) married a 20 year old woman (arranged marriage)? I'm Indian-American and my mom randomly asked me if I wanted to marry this girl. I was skeptical at first because 1) cultural differences - she recently moved over from India, whereas I moved here 20 years ago. 2) age difference - 13 years between us which is a big gap in life experience. My parents have been harassing me to find a wife for years, so I agreed to meet her to keep them from disowning me (joking, but my mom insisted and I was curious ). Well, turns out that she is quite attractive and I felt a spark ad connection. mostly just physical attraction but she seems like a nice girl as well from what I have seen (talked to her in person for an half an hour, and we have been constantly messaging each other for the last week ). She's also pretty smart, she's finishing up her college degree & wants to do masters. so now, I'm seriously considering it. but I also feel like a bit of a creep. I haven't told any friends/colleagues yet. I don't know what they'd think .. WIBTA if I went ahead with marrying her?<|response|> INFO: What does the girl think about this? <|endoftext|>
83881	2	AITA -Thanksgiving family drama I’ll try to make it short. I have two aunts, one is terminally ill with cancer and is in hospice 5 minutes from my house. My other aunt and I are her primary caregivers since she has no children and her husband died. My healthy aunt and I agreed we would have thanksgiving at my house early ( my aunt, myself, cousins, husband, and uncle) so we can go be with her right after. She was making the bird, my cousin some sides and I would make some sides, a joint effort and simple. Well this morning my aunt decided “it’s too much for me to set a table and be bothered” so they are all going to have dinner at her house ( 40 minutes from me) then bring my husband and myself a plate of food when they go see my other aunt in hospice. I am disgusted and outraged and my feelings are hurt. Redditors, what are you thoughts?<|response|> NTA what the hell she just ruined your plans. Asshole family <|endoftext|>
86270	2	WIBTA for cutting ties with my parents? My relationship with my parents has always been a little bit rocky but it got worse when I came out to them as gay a few years back. They've calmed down a bit since I told them and decided they just wouldn't ask about it. It hurts that I don't get the same treatment as my siblings but I've accepted that for now that's how it is, I've always hoped eventually they'll show an interest in my happiness. There are some passing slurs or insults by proxy but honestly, it's just white noise these days. I tend to visit them every other week as I live nearby and my dad likes to exchange EastEnders theories. My sister mentioned she has a boyfriend the other day which sparked conversation. My younger cousins have recently started to develop their own thoughts and will ask me about it - one of the cousins asked me if I'm seeing anybody, I didn't make a big deal out of it and just tried to quietly let her know I have a boyfriend (Alan). My parents heard and got upset, saying that I should've told them but I pointed out that they've never made me feel like I can tell them about these things. They said that despite finding my "way of life" disgusting that they still have a right to know about these things and I had plenty of chances to tell them, I said they're free to meet him if they're going to keep their thoughts to themselves in front of him. They agreed and we organised a dinner where they could meet my partner. The dinner was last night and Alan showed up with me as he's recently been spending most nights in my flat. It wasn't bad but at the end of the night, my dad asked Alan how long he'd been "a fairy". I said, "dad, don't," and my mum told me not to be rude and that it was just a question. I told them it was a rude question but Alan still answered. I will be fair to them and say it wasn't as bad as it usually was but they kept using offensive terms despite knowing they're offensive and framed the words in questions that would otherwise be welcomed. Each time they said something, I told them it was rude and they just brushed it off. Once we left Alan admitted he expected worse and that he was sure he could warm to them after some time. I texted mum and dad to say that Alan would like to meet them again. Mum replied this morning with this: "No, we don't want to meet [Alan] again. Dad and I have talked and we want you to keep that to yourself. We still want you in our lives but we don't want anything to do with your fairy life." I don't know if I want to continue a relationship with them knowing that there's no hope for them showing an interest. Alan said that<|response|> NTA. They can always rejoin your life when they fully accept it. <|endoftext|>
125337	4	AITA - For wanting to remove our roommate from our house So in November last year I moved into a flat with 3 of my other close friends (Been close mates for 5+ Years). All of us at this stage had a job and where living super easy, the Rent was split 4 ways and so was food. In about December it came to my attention that one of my flat mates (We will call him Jack) Had missed a rent payment. That was fine at the time as he worked in construction on a hourly rate and it was the holiday season so he wasn't working, so we moved some money around and was able to make do. HOWEVER it was just 1 rent payment, soon Jack had racked up a solid $1600ish NZD worth of debt with us in back payments for rent and food. We bought this to his attention and he seemed to sort his shit out. How ever about 2 months ago to decided to quit his job and has since again been living in our house again living rent free and eating all of our food, while the rest of us are out at work trying to "Get this bread" to the feed the little shit. We then recently gave him a month to move out and that time is almost up. Are we an asshole for the following 1. in 4 days we will be putting an eviction notice on his door 2. The day after the date supplied on the door half of his room will be packed up and moved to the street and his family will be contacted about the situation and our locks will be changed 3. If none of the following will work we will be contacting the police to have him forcefully removed from the flat &#x200B; tl;dr someone lives in your house and doesn’t pay rent. Soon after quits his job and has thousands in debt to you. Cheers Orangepeal<|response|> ESH you got to check rental laws in NZ so that you are complying with the law when you evict him. There are often regulated ways on how to go about this. Touching his possessions is a big no.... Anyway check the legalities first because he last thing you want is for him to have the upper hand or for you to cop a fine. Perhaps the real estate can guide you as to where to get advice? <|endoftext|>
35951	4	WIBTA If I told the delivery driver for my restaurant to do his job? I work in a mexican restaurant and we get weekly deliveries for our groceries. The drivers used to change all the time but in the past few months it's been the same driver. This driver isn't rude or necessarily bad at his job, but he has a bad habit of talking. He'll start out asking how my weekend was and sure that's fine but then he goes on and on as he comes in and out of the store about really anything that comes to mind. He's told me stories of his dad, when he used to work at a hotel, etc. I'm the only employee there in the morning while I get everything ready and I enjoy my alone time. I can't stand hearing chatter while I try to listen to my music in the morning and for conversation without any interesting details no less. So now I'm looking for a solution. WIBTA if I told this delivery guy something along the lines of "I'm here to do my job and so are you so let's just cut the chatter."? If I have to hear about his Magic The Gathering cards again I'm going to gouge my earballs out in front of him.<|response|> YWBTA if you stated it like that. Not sure why you go straight to incivility rather than planning on saying "I've got a ton of work to do in the mornings that I really need to concentrate on. I hope you can excuse me." or something similar. <|endoftext|>
31862	5	AITA For thinking its werid sex stops at the exact same spot. Ok so me and my gf have been dating for 2 years. Its all been great, but one thing that always bothers me is that sex usually ends in the same place. Either of us will initiate sexy times, we have foreplay and teasing. I always go down before, but right before i even put it in she says "can we stop?". I end up confused and frustrated because everything has been going good and every time she ever wants to stop its always in the same moment. After I've done everything for her but as im taking off my bottoms. Ive tried bringing it up and asking whats wrong and all i get is an "i just dont want to anymore" followed by her getting upset because i asked why she stopped .I know i shouldn't expect sex and she has a right to change her mind. I get that, but AITA for thinking its weird its always at the same exact spot after shes gotten all the pleasure?<|response|> I can’t believe I’m the first person to bring this up - it’s very possible she has some kind of sexual trauma associated with penises specifically. You need to have a clothes on talk with her about what she’s feeling in that moment you reach for your pants (revulsion? panic? fear? distaste?) and what you can do to work through it because this isn’t sustainable for you. The other way to figure out if this is what’s happening is obviously to have a different order to sex so it doesn’t start in the same way, like saying you want to try going down on her after PIV or try 69ing or something. If she’s fine with that then yeah, she’s just selfish. <|endoftext|>
30610	4	AITA for trying to "sabotage" my twin's relationship with my best friend. She took an abstinence vow and it's a core value. My brother has never gone to a party and left without hooking up with a girl. If he's bored at home, he'll just hit up a random girl in his phone "and find something to do". He's dating my best friend who wants to be abstinent until marriage. They've only been seriously dating for a few weeks now. But they def liked each other for longer. This is the same guy who had a competition with his friends over who can get the most head in a month. The hotter the girl, the more points. This is the guy who will laugh and brag over scratch marks on his back. He HAS cheated on girls in the past. She is very religious and will not have sex until marriage. She's 19 and hasn't had her first kiss yet. She says that her first kiss needed to be with someone who she cares about. Her first KISS needs to special to her. She got so mad when her prom date tried to kiss her, because of that boundary she had. I have never seen her more upset and she LIKED him. We're best friends and I know all her values on sex and romance. They are very important to her. There are guys she really crushed on that liked her back. She never gave them a chance because of her values. He's going to break her heart, I know it. Even if he doesn't, shit will go up in flames. Then I will be caught between the two people I care about the most. I don't want them to be unhappy. This is a bad thing. They are NOT sexually compatible. I know he can't wait. He knows about her abstinence till marriage thing. He keeps saying that he doesn't care and it doesn't matter to him. That he likes her too much and he's willing to respect that. He does not see another girl for him and has never felt this way about a girl before. But like, he's only saying this now. She was telling that she wants to have her first kiss with him soon but she wants to wait for the right moment, so it's sweet and special. I told her that was cute and asked her if she ever planned on doing anything more. She asked if I was asking about her abstinence. She said it's a core value of hers and she will never change that for anyone, no matter what. I asked if she thought my brother was okay with that. I asked how she thought that'd work out or how long she thought he was willing to wait. She just changed the topic. Apparently she texted him later saying that she was worried if they were a good idea and asked if he was sure he was okay with her abstinence. When I saw him, he screamed at me. He's furious with me<|response|> INFO: is your friend aware of your brother’s actions and antics? Did she make the choice to be with him with full knowledge of who and what he is? <|endoftext|>
40081	4	AITA for saying my(23F) sister's(26F) BF(38M) should not be a drug counsellor? TL;DR - My sister's BF shared a patient's confidential secret and I think it proves he should not be a drug counsellor. &#x200B; My sister & her BF, Dean, are both studying to be drug counsellors. Dean currently works in a halfway house for recovering addicts, and he acts as a mentor/unofficial counsellor to the recovering addicts. My sister's friend, Bob, found out where Dean works and asked them to help his addict brother, Jay. Months after Jay started his recovery, my sister brought up seeing Bob, to which Dean stated that Jay had confided in him that Bob had assaulted Jay when they were younger. My sister believed him and his insistence she stays away from him, and asked my mom and me how she can cut ties with Bob without drawing attention to the fact that she knows something she shouldn't. Dean has been sitting on this info for a while, so it wasn't a warning; he could have said, "I can't tell you why, but that man is dangerous and you need to avoid him," and she would have listened immediately. An assault survivor confided in him, privately (not in a group environment) and he reiterated it. If it ever gets out, Jay could seriously hurt himself or relapse. Recovery is a life-or-death situation and this isn't the first time Dean has side-stepped rules on a whim; he once almost posed as a qualified counsellor because he "felt ready" though he isn't qualified (but he chose to bring in a professional to co-counsel with him). Now, this is where my potentially being TA comes in: my mom's stance is that my sister is Dean's only person (he doesn't have any family) and he's 'human' and needs someone to confide in. When I said all therapists have therapists, and he has a sponsor, she told me I was being callous. She also said there is a difference between gossiping and it being shared amongst people that won't reiterate it - which is bullshit, as I'm typing this shit up right now. I'm studying psychology and my mom decided to turn this into a "teaching moment" about how I lack empathy and should stop thinking I'm better than people, but I know assault survivors and how much it destroys them when their stories are shared and trivialised. Dean and my sister are both recovering addicts, and the system they got sober in is run by recovering addicts (which really works, especially for people who haven't responded well to conventional treatment) but the community is so tight-knit that if one person finds this out, everyone will know. My mom keeps insisting that Dean has had a hard life and maybe he needed to share this info to help with his own demons, to which I (admittedly, cruelly) said that if he can't separate his life from the rules of being a drug counsellor then he is a danger to addicts and he should not be a drug counsellor. Hit me<|response|> NTA. You are absolutely right that his current attitude makes him a danger to drug addicts. Him having a hard life doesn’t change the fact that he put another addict’s recovery, life, and safety on the line to “deal with his demons”. There’s now a risk that Bob will find out and retaliate against Jay, or that word will spread and Jay would feel publicly humiliated. Not to mention the fact that Dean is jeopardizing his career by doing what he’s doing. Even if no one else finds out, that was still a huge betrayal of trust. It took a lot of courage and trust for Jay to open up to Dean; if he ever finds out Dean told anyone, even if they kept it secret, it would severely damage his trust in other people and make it harder for him to reach out when he needs help. Like you said, there were other ways for Dean to warn people about Bob without exposing Jay’s assault. He also could’ve encouraged Jay to seek out a qualified therapist to help him work through his assault, and could’ve reached out to one himself and said “hey, a recovering drug addict just told me they were sexually assaulted as a child by a family friend; how do I proceed in a way that protects both them and my family?” <|endoftext|>
161394	1	AITA for pushing for foods that myself and coworker are allergic to be banned? Hi all! I am incredibly allergic to avocados. If I am in the same room as in that’s been cut open I break out in hives and my throat swells. I am allergic to many different fruits, but avocados are the worst. My other coworker, let’s call him Mike, is allergic to peppers in the same way. Most people in my workplace are very respectful of our allergies, and don’t eat anything or cut anything around us that we’re allergic to. Except this one woman, let’s call her Katherine. Katherine regularly brings in guacamole, whole avocados, etc. she tells me just to not eat any, despite me constantly telling her that being around that is bad. I’ve had bad reactions at work because of this. Last week, Mike walked into the kitchen and Katherine was cutting up some bell peppers. Immediate anaphylaxis for Mike. Katherine was complaining about it, saying she has a right to eat what she wants where and when she wants. Am I an asshole if I go to upper management about it? Katherine says she has a right to eat what she wants, but don’t Mike and I have a right to not die?<|response|> YTA for lying on Reddit about a fake allergy. Your symptoms are in no way associated with an avocado allergy. Shit post. <|endoftext|>
128518	4	AITA if I don't accept returns on ebay? So I had some games on ebay and recently sold one. Great! unfortunately (something thats been very common for me selling on ebay it seems) the buyer messaged me two days after saying they made a mistake and bought the wrong game and wanted to return it. I don't offer returns on the ebay, I clearly stated what I was selling, offer multiple photos of the game, and provide the retailer description of said game. Ebay wasn't going to cover the shipping fees in the refund so why should I lose money because the other person didn't double check the game? I feel like a dick but it's not like they can't resell them game themselves, I was selling it below market value and as long as they didn't open it they should be able to get back what they paid for it. just thought i'd update, they messaged me yesterday night asking for a refund again, and I again refused on the grounds that "I do not accept returns, which was clearly stated, and that I provided the publisher description and multiple photo's so that there would be no confusion when buying"<|response|> NAH. If you had it marked as "No Returns" then they should have done the due diligence to ensure they were purchasing the correct item. I don't think they are an asshole just for asking, but if they are pushy about it, I'd definitely say NTA instead. <|endoftext|>
51151	3	WIBTA if I report a guy from the dealership who texted me? I (23F) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. I was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s M) put the wipers on. We had a short, friendly conversation and then I paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. However, later that evening, I received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. I feel like that’s a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could’ve just done it while I was there in person. So WIBTA if I report him? I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. I don’t want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.<|response|> NTA I'm going to say I'm 99.5% sure the dealership has policies in place that tell staff their customer info (you) is private and not for personal use. This would be a violation of that policy. If they don't have a policy, they should. <|endoftext|>
188259	2	AITA for not wanting to be a sudden father? Backstory- Five years ago, I was in a relationship with "Amy" that had run its course. I was 22 and working for $8/hour at one of my uncle's gas stations and living with my parents. She wanted to start a family immediately and I was not ready for that in any way. We split amicably and she goes on to date Allen, a friend of a friend who worked on the oil rigs. Amy gets pregnant almost immediately and almost nine months later she and Allen are parents to a baby girl, Amelia. Fast forward to the present. Unfortunately, Allen was killed in a work accident. Amy ends up calling me not long after and tells me she thinks Amelia could be my daughter. The timing was close enough that she could have been pregnant just before we split up and nobody would have known any better since she was dating Allen only a week later. Amelia definitely looks more like me than Allen, so it's not out of the question. It also happens that I am now financially secure enough to support a family now that my uncle has retired and given me a stake in his business to keep me around to run things in his place. I know it looks like Amy is just trying to find someone to pay the bills, but I believe her when she says there's a good chance Amelia could be my daughter. At the same time, I've barely met this kid. She was raised for years by Allen and by all rights that makes him her dad, not me. I feel bad for Amelia not having a father, but I don't really see why I should swoop in to become dad. Am I the asshole for not wanting to find out whether Amelia is blood related to me and wanting to leave the past in the past? I don't want to be a replacement dad, I don't want to be financially on the hook for a kid I have only seen a few times in five years, and I don't want to be the piggy bank for Amy to not go to work. I don't hold any grudges over this and I don't blame Amy for doing anything she can for her kid, but this isn't my circus and these aren't my monkeys as far as I see it. Edit- I will speak to a lawyer about this as some people have suggested. If I have a legal obligation then I have a legal obligation, but I still think Amelia is Allen's daughter regardless of blood. I'm going to step out and let the crowd judge, but I'll respond to info requests if I see them.<|response|> Wow, this is a really messy one... Amy probably got or will get a payout from the company for Allen's work-related death. So I don't think she is digging for gold. She probably *is* digging for emotional support and a parenting partner. Amelia is innocent in all this. I think you should get a DNA test and find out what the situation is. If you are the bio-dad, you should take up the mantle. Amy sucks for the deception, so N TA I guess. But also kinda Y TA if you run from this. Final verdict: ESH except probably Allen and defintely Amelia. <|endoftext|>
161454	3	AITA for cutting off ties with a girl that still wants to hangout? So long story short, I started dating this girl about 5 months ago, initially she mentioned she just wants to see where things go. Well soon after (a couple weeks after we met) it was very obvious there was a lot of chemistry between us, we would makeout, cuddle and hold hands often, calling each other hun and babe. After about 4 months of this, she recently admitted (a week ago) to having developed feelings for me, and wants to keep doing what we were doing. Fast forward to yesterday and she admits she had let things go on too far without telling me, and would very much like to be platonic friends since enjoys my company so much. I then informed her Id like to cut off all ties as I feel I was led on.. am I the asshole for doing this?<|response|> NAH: You don't owe her friendship and she doesn't owe you a romantic relationship. <|endoftext|>
110921	1	AITA for accepting both the GI bill and financial aid So I'm in my senior year of college and receive both the GI Bill and financial aid. Since currently I am without a job while concentrating in school I get a good amount of financial aid. I'm living a good life style where I'm able to afford food, books and nice clothes (among a nice pair of headphones and computer). Compared to my other counterparts in college I'm living good with no school loans to worry about. I feel guilty about receiving so much financial aid which was awarded to me. This guilt has kept me up at night. I feel like a government leech! I'm I an asshole?<|response|> NTA <|endoftext|>
39493	3	AITA for shutting him down and making him move Last year I moved to a new state and offered a friend who was also moving there one of the spare rooms in the house that I purchased. I admit, it was a terrible idea, as we had dated on and off before, but were broken up at the time. I agreed to let him move in on the grounds it would be as roommates only until he found his own place. He promptly caught feels again. I didn’t. Last December I asked him to move out and, in great detail, told him I have been considering taking my pets and just driving away or even hurting myself due to my depression which had gotten much worse since starting to live with him. I tried to be as clear as possible that it wasn’t anything to do with him as a person, but I’m incredibly introverted and having no space to myself for months on end in order to recharge was making my mental health rapidly decline. I genuinely adore him as a person, but I can’t stand living with him. It has been almost seven months. He has spent months that, any time he isn’t at work, He is playing video games, asking me to go on dates, talking about the future, etc. I remind him he should be looking at places to live on his weekends, that I don’t want to go to dinner and he should be saving money for a security deposit anyway, and that I don’t want to hang out with his friends as his soon to be Ex landlady. I have bluntly told him I need him to leave for my mental health. According to him, he has looked at only two places in that time, and only in the last two months. When pressed about it, at first he insisted he was looking, but now he gets very angry, says he is “at his breaking point from work” and that moving out isn’t even in his top three priorities right now. I have gotten rather resentful and spend all my time in my room with the door shut whenever he is home.. At this point I just want him gone and, as much as I’d like us to stay friends after this, I’m beginning to resent him so much that I loath having weekends off at the same time when I have to be in the house with him. I have even offered to sell the house to him and I would move, but he says the house would just be a burden on him (even though he makes more than I do.) So, AITA for becoming hostile and insisting he needs to be looking for somewhere else to live, despite his apparent stress at work? Edit: I feel like I should add, in his defense, he isn’t totally bumming either. He does pay rent, albeit it is still much lower then he would pay to rent a place on his own. Buying a house here<|response|> NTA you need to start an official eviction process. This guy isn’t leaving until you force the issue. I would be looking at your local laws for evicting tenants and following that process. <|endoftext|>
39475	3	AITA for thinking/saying my friend is racist? My friend (F), other friend (OF) and I got into a bit of an argument the other day and it's been 'haunting' me since. We're all mid-20s, white (this matters for the story). I consider myself to be quite liberal in my views which is why this situation has been eating me the past couple of days. F has a thing for black guys. Her past two BFs (short-term) have been black, she's dating exclusively black guys (with the exception of one Hispanic dude), and on dating apps, she's swiping almost exclusively on black men. That would be alright, since everyone has their type, but it's gotten to the point that she'll exclaim about black guys on the street (we are bilinguals so she doesn't shout it in English) or when watching a movie. Just picture this: a shot with a black guy comes on-screen and she goes insane with how cute/hot he is. Even if he's a 60-something man. The thing is, she never displays this sort of behaviour about any other race. If a conventionally hot white/hispanic actor shows up in the movie, she's silent. The other day, she went on a rave about how hot 'black guys with british accent are' even though she's never seen one in real life. To me, this comes across as racial fetishizing. I'm not going overboard when I say I've never heard her say a white guy is hot - not a single one. On the other hand, chances are that if we run into a black guy on the street/watch a movie with a black character, she'll exclaim how delicious/hot/sexy he is. She's been trying to convince me that she's not fetishizing anyone and ranting about how everyone is 'accusing' her. The argument started when I said I was in a traditional African restaurant and OF, jokingly, said 'I bet F would've loved it'. F went ballistic - like, she literally exploded saying 'why does everyone tease me about black guys? It's so annoying, and it's very racist and offensive'. Well, TBH, I think she *is* being racist: she's fetishizing an entire race ('black guys are so hot', 'black guys with british accents are so sexy'). Especially since she's trying to convince me and everyone else she's into the 'type' (the one portrayed in music videos, etc, which is just as icky and racist IMO) and it just happens that black guys adhere to this type. She's creating an entire story about the guys she's dating just because they're black - like, they come from shitty neighbourhoods and single-parent homes, etc, etc, so this explains why they're fucked up and treat her bad (her words). So AITA for thinking my friend is racist? WIBTA if I bring it up with her and confront her that dating/fetishizing people because they're a certain race is just as bad as discriminating people based on race?<|response|> NTA at all Anyone who says this isn’t fetishizing please explain > She's creating an entire story about the guys she's dating just because they're black - like, they come from shitty neighbourhoods and single-parent homes, etc, etc, so this explains why they're fucked up and treat her bad (her words). <|endoftext|>
183657	5	AITA for refusing to buy my kids a Switch? My kids (6&9) say they want a Nintendo Switch, cuz that's what most of their friends want. My husband and I can afford to buy this for them, but I know that in a month it will be a dust collector. My kids aren't heavy into electronics. We have a couple game systems now and they usually only play them when they have friends over (which isn't often). Aside from their tablets, they rarely look at electronics/video games. So I vetoed this gift. My Mom thinks I'm being a grinch. She thinks I should buy the switch regardless because that's what my kids want. She even offered to put it under the tree from Santa if I couldn't afford it. I said no. Money is not the issue. Yesterday she informs me she bought my Dad a switch for christmas. I know this is just a cover. My Dad certainly didn't want/won't play with a switch. I asked her why she would get it for him and she says "well if he doesn't like it, you can always take it home for the kids". I told her no, she can just return it. She says I'm being ridiculous and to just accept it. I'm sticking to my guns refusing it. Now there is a rift between us over a stupid game system. So AITA for not buying/not wanting the game system?<|response|> YTA. I understand where you’re coming from and if it wasn’t a “Christmas gift” I’d say do whatever. But your kids have requested this Switch as their gift. If it ends up collecting dust, then that’s a wasted gift opportunity on their part to get something better, but it won’t be your fault. You warned them, based off previous behaviors, and that’s all you could do. When they lose interest, maybe they’ll learn not to want what everyone has and to focus on their own interests. Or maybe they’ll really enjoy it and use it all the time. Either way, it’s their lesson to learn. <|endoftext|>
161634	4	AITA because I want to go to the gym by myself without my husband and toddler? UPDATE: Hi all. Thanks for your advice and insights. I just wanted to give you all an update. Last night we had a talk about the gym situation, and as someone had said there was absolutely something “cooking” underneath it all. My husband started by saying he needed to be more supportive of me and my career and asked how he could help more with caring for our toddler. I was a bit taken aback and said he’s beyond more than supportive enough and that I felt that I needed to help more. After which he said that his previous comments and gym time were selfish and through tears said I was the most important thing to him and he had to do more at home. Again I was quite take aback because this man is not the type to wear his heart on his sleeve. I asked if there was more going on that was bothering him and be admitted that he suspected I was having an affair. I absolutely am not but with my crazy hours and being distracted at home I absolutely can see why he may suspect such a thing. We then had a very long talk about life and goals and what we each wanted and where we saw ourselves in a few years. It was refreshing and long over due. In regards to actual gym time, we decided on all three of us twice a week during earlier times where we feed toddler just a quick drive through dinner guilt free and acknowledge that we both may not get the best work out cuz we’ll be minding toddler but that being together was more important. As I had said in the comments earlier our gym has a kid-friendly area but no daycare but we will deal. And this way toddler can get to bed still at a decent hour and we can spend time together and we both still get our alone gym time two or three times a week. I brought up starting date night and husband said that’s less important to him at least at this point and that spending time with me just a few times a week at the gym will make him happy. So anyways, yes there was something more going on with him and I’m so glad we had this talk. Clearly our communication and connection was waning and needed a check-in. Thanks again all for your thoughts and insights. ORIGINAL: Last night my (32f) husband (41m) and I had a disagreement. We both go to the gym regularly and take turns every other night because we have a toddler and toddler needs to get to bed and is a major disturbance at our kid friendly gym. Lately though we’ve gone together and taken toddler with us so we can parent tag team and generally it goes pretty well. However, it still requires a lot of keeping a close eye on toddler because I<|response|> NAH both sides are very valid. Why not alternate? Go twice a week together and take turns going the other days a week? That way you have the alone work out to look forward to and he has the couple work out. This way both needs are being met. It’s important to have self care but it’s also important to do things as a family. Best of both worlds... <|endoftext|>
19607	2	AITA for not removing weights on the bench press bar? Generally, at the gym, after bench pressing, I’ve always left a 45 pound plate on each side of the bar so the next person (generally benches at least 135) wouldn’t have to restack the 45s. Today, some guy stopped me and told me that I should take all the weights off next time and looked pissed. There are three bench presses available at my gym so there were two that he could have used. Just to add, this guy was bigger than me (and lifts more). He ultimately took the weights off the bar and used the bar for another bench press type (incline). In ten years of working out, I’ve never removed the one set of 45s as a courtesy to others that lift at least 135. Am I the asshole here?<|response|> YTA. Clean up after yourself m8 <|endoftext|>
81075	4	AITA for telling my wife she's sometimes too obsessive about her body hair routines? My wife is lovely but her genetics haven't been kind. Gorgeous pale skin but a truckload of hair to make her life difficult. I genuinely empathize. However, it's one of my best friend's visiting town with his wife and we wanted to have a couples evening. He had another engagement later that night so generously made time for an early dinner. My wife immediately shoots it down because she has to go to her spa appointment. Look, I love that she takes care of things, god knows how much of an annoyance things can be for her and for me, but priorities right? She said she'd moved the appointment once and they won't do it again, and she was going to skip dinner. I got a bit mad and told her that she was obsessed with it, prioritizing the wrong things, and I got a little worried how her attitude might affect future daughters we might have. Sadly that was the end of the conversation and we're at a stalemate about this. She said she'll let me know if plans change but unlikely and ended it there. AITA here? This isn't the first time. She often turns down sex for the most trivial reasons because she didn't shave recently or like something else. It doesn't matter to her that sometimes it doesn't matter to me. That's what makes it obsessive imo.<|response|> YTA because a) she already had plans (an appointment) and b) while you’re saying she shouldn’t care about it, you are simultaneously reinforcing why her natural body hair is a negative to you. I’m on mobile so I’ll edit to quote some exact phrasing you’ve said in a second. Edit: >My wife is lovely but her genetics haven't been kind. >god knows how much of an annoyance things can be for her and for me >It doesn't matter to her that sometimes it doesn't matter to me. You are saying that you _do_ have an issue with how she looks but that it shouldn't matter to her when it is inopportune for you. You're also putting your friend in a positive light whereas you are putting her in a negative light. So your friend is "generous" when he sticks to his previous engagements, but your wife is high maintenance and obsessive when she sticks to her previous engagement? YTA. <|endoftext|>
139700	2	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to massage a particular person? This is a person we both use to work with and i want to make it clear that is not the reason i have a problem with this. She is free to massage whoever until there's a conflict of interest to our relationship. We met at Jimmy John's and she was one of those girls everybody wanted including this particular person. We've both moved on since to other jobs and professions. This is where the problems begin. He knows I'm dating her and one night when we were all out at a bar with coworkers he tried to dance on her while she was extremely drunk. First action of disrespect. Once she noticed she pushed him away. No big deal. She did what she needed to so nothing needed to be said. This was about 6 months ago. Next problem came about a few days ago with this guy. I was playing on her phone and he texted her saying how he's excited to smoke and drink with her for his massage. She's told me about everyone else she's planned to massage but him. We don't snoop through each others phones but I became alarmed and curious so I looked through their messages. I found where he tells her how good she looks and cute knowing she's dating me. She sends emojis and thanks. I feel like she should have said "thanks but would you say that if my boyfriend was around?" He wouldn't. In my eyes that's disrespect. And let it be known its completely different if its someone she doesn't know coming in for a massage telling her she's cute. That does not bother me. Its the fact that he knows im with her. Also since she's still in school for massage therapy she does this privately at her home not in a business. If it wasn't private i probably wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. I have a hard enough time getting her to do massages for me topless because in her words its not professional. To me getting drunk and high with a client is also bery unprofessional. She thinks im asshole though because she's "just trying to network" for when she gets out of school<|response|> NTA She hid it from you....go with your gut on this one <|endoftext|>
126905	3	AITA I’m a Muslim and don’t want my kids around my non Muslim parents due to them not respecting my wishes? I became a Muslim 12 years ago when I was 22. when I accepted Islam my parents hit the roof and disowned me. They assumed it was a phase, called me a terrorist, my dad threatened to shoot me, my mom said I wasn’t her son anymore. I was close to my parents so I was hurt, I can’t lie. But my religion was important to me. I moved out of my hometown, got married 7 years ago, & had my first kid. In that time there’s been radio silence. I got in contact with parents at the urging of my wife once our second child was born in November 2018. She knew I really wanted closure. Since January I have flown twice to see my parents who seemed overjoyed to hear from me. They totally ignored all religious talk and for a while it seemed like it could work out. Wife has not yet come along as she had a c section and has complications so she is on a no fly from her doc. However she gave me blessings to take the babies to go see their grandparents. I explained to my mom and dad that the kids and I can only eat vegetarian food. Now this isn’t strictly the truth, we *can* eat halal and kosher, but there isn’t any halal or kosher food sources around in my tiny lil hometown. They seemed to accept it, however over the course of our 3 day stay I noticed that mom kept acting shifty around my 4 year old. I tried not to be too overbearing bc I wanted to show I trusted her. Yesterday tho, my brother angrily came storming into the backyard and told me that he’d caught mom feeding my 4 y/o pork. He had confronted our mom and she said she’d been feeding him it since the start of our stay because he was ‘malnourished’ Now, I’m a hella involved dad and mealtimes I’m the one feeding my kids and cleaning up after them. She hadn’t been feeding them pork then. She’d been waiting for when my dad would ask me to go work on his car in the garage or shoot the shit with him, *then* she’d give the kids haram snacks. It’s not that she’s feeding the kid pork. I don’t really care if you do it by accident. Accidents happen. It was the careful, deliberate, spiteful way she’d gone about doing it. I confronted my mom and asked her why she’d try and fuck up our relationship all over again. She yelled back that it wasn’t American to not feed our kids meat and that my son wasn’t a Muslim at the age of 4 anyway. I told her that we were done, and that we weren’t gonna be in her life anymore. I took the kids on a red eye back home. Since then I’ve had phone call after phone call from<|response|> So NTA. It wasn't a mistake, it was deliberate. Unless your mom comes back with *huge* sincere apology (where she actually fully understands what she did wrong) she doesn't deserve another chance. <|endoftext|>
181364	4	WIBTA if I told my friend he has bad breath. I am a university student (F 25) and I have a friend, let’s call him Billy (M 19). Billy is super nice and sweet. He’s the kind of guy that is everybody’s friend and he’s “the life of the party” kind of guy. The thing is Billy has horrible breath and likes to lean in when talking to people. And even if he does not lean in, we need to sit away from him not to smell his stinky breath. I thought I was the only one who had noticed until some of my friends came to me asking if we should tell him but no one wants to hurt his feelings (because he is so nice to everyone). At first I thought that there is no way that he doesnt know or that someone hasnt told him already, but if he knew he wouldnt lean in so close when talking to people, or you know... brush his teeth better. I know that some people have stomach problems and there is nothing that they can do about their breath, but Billy has braces and it is very visible that he does not bother brushing very well. This is a particularly bad issue during exam season where we all study together and have to whisper to each other in a packed library. One of my friends (who also has braces) very casually mentioned that she has a hard time brushing her braces but there is “this and that” she started doing in order to brush them properly (i had braces myself, it is not that difficult not to let them stink to high heaven). Billy did not get the hint at all and just said “yeah, but it’s too difficult”. I think that maybe if he knew his breath stinks horribly, he would take better care of his teeth. He is a good looking guy with a great personality and unless he made some deep personal decision to remain single, this might be the reason he never gets girls ( not that this is any of my business, at this point I might just be piling on reasons to tell him that his breath stinks). So would we be A-holes if we just came out and told him? Obviously we wouldnt gang up on him or anything, we would just pick the most gentle person in the group to just plain tell him that this is an issue. It’s just that he is such a nice guy that we wonder if this is something worth hurting his feelings over.<|response|> NTA but prepare ahead of time what you tell him. You can say this happened to you when you had braces and someone told you about your breath and now you're passing on the favour and advice. <|endoftext|>
110081	3	AITA for flattening all four SUV tires? Am I an asshole for flattening all of some persons expensive SUV tires? I was married to a girl in a wheelchair. We went to the mall near Christmas and parked in a handicap spot. She had a motorized wheelchair and a ramp van that was installed on the passenger side. We ate dinner, looked around and decided to leave. So we see that is raining, pretty heavy. We discussed my getting the van and bringing it around, but we both decided to just run for it. When we get to the spot there is a black SUV in the unloading area next to our spot. I had to get in, back up to lower the ramp. By this time she is drenched and I'm pissed. I went over to the illegally parked SUV and kicked out all for valve stems. Not a difficult fix, but huge inconvenience the week before Christmas. I never felt bad for this, which I guess is a potentially other am I the asshole.<|response|> ESH. The owner of the SUV sucks for parking illegally, and you suck for taking justice into your own hands. <|endoftext|>
35210	2	AITA for telling a customer to get to the back of a (short) line after he misread sign on self service? This happened yesterday at a medium sized retail store. A guy, who only wanted to buy two items, went to the self service (which has multiple signs saying card only) to start getting his items scanned to pay. Pretty soon after that a couple of customers lined up to be served at the normal tills where cash could be used. I had started to serve the first customer when the guy on self service started to look around confused and soon after asked where he could enter cash. I was still serving the first customer but had almost finished, and the customer already waiting in line had two items which would have taken no more than 20-30 seconds to serve. I told the guy at self service it was card only, showing him the signs telling the customers that it's card only. I then said I would void the transaction and serve him on the tills to pay with cash if he wanted to. He then stepped over from the self service and pushed into the line ahead of the customer who had already been queuing. I then told him he'd have to go to the back of the line as there was a customer waiting. He then said that he was here first. I then said (which I think is the potentially asshole part) that it wasn't the other customers fault he had misread the sign so he would have to queue behind the customer already there. If the customer had a huge basket I would have maybe understood but if the other customer had only a couple items and it would take no time at all, is it fair for him to push in because he's first? And is it fair of me to tell him to get to the back of the line because of (at least what I think is) basic etiquette? &#x200B; Thanks for any replies!<|response|> NTA if he was an asshole about it. He miss read the signs so it's on him. <|endoftext|>
132572	5	AITA for wanting two weddings? My boyfriend and I are of different faiths. He’s Jewish and I’m Hindu. As such, neither of us has any intention of converting in the future. We decided to each stick to our own faith. Great! However he expressed that he only wants a Jewish wedding. I told him that when my family has interfaith weddings, we always have two. One day would be the Hindu ceremony and the next would be the Other. It makes me upset to think that I wouldn’t be able to have a wedding that I’ve dreamed of for so long because he sees it as an inconvenience. I’m willing to do all his ceremonies and their wedding practices but it makes me frustrated that he won’t do the same for me. And now I’m wondering if I’m overreacting because of it and maybe two weddings is going to be a burden. AITA for wanting to have two weddings instead of one?<|response|> NTA at all and I think I speak from pretty personal experience. I'm Jewish and my husband is Jain -- the wedding was difficult to plan because neither of our families were happy at first and there were a lot of tears from both sets of parents, but *we* were always on the same page and tried our best to compromise. The compromise and support for each other is key. If he's not willing to consider other options... well, that doesn't bode well for the future, especially if you're planning to have kids and you have particular views about how you want them raised. Also, speaking as Jewish person whose culture and religion are important to them, your boyfriend is being an unreasonable jerk about this. Intercultural issues in marriages like this don't go away after you get married either, you know? Your family is always going to be coming from one cultural place and so is your husband's. It's not going to get any easier from here if he can't work with you. In our situation, what we ended up doing was a one day wedding with the Jewish ceremony (about 20 minutes) around noon, a light lunch, a shortened Jain ceremony (about 1.5 hours) in the afternoon, and then everyone went immediately into cocktail hour and the reception. It was a long day and we had to cut a lot of corners to make it work with our budget, but ultimately I think everyone had a good time. Both of our families look back fondly on it, and both of our families participated in each others' ceremonies. ETA: I know Jainism and Hinduism are not the same religion but he’s from an Indian family and the wedding ceremonies, as far as I can tell from personal experience, are pretty similar. <|endoftext|>
143621	4	WIBTA if i go over my area directors head to the owner? So, i went to the ER today with massive chest pain. (Good news not heart related, bad news, could be as bad as lung cancer or something like that). Spent a couple hours in the ER, was sent home and told i needed to go to my gp for more testing. My doctors note says i cant return to work til the 13th (currently the 11th). I told my area director this and she tells me she cant work all weekend and texts another stores gm. Other stores gm texts me "why cant you work tomorrow? You have plenty of people and wont have to do anything." Explained whats going on, so on so forth. And she says "you know we dont have anyone trained to close for this week". I have yet to respond to either of them cuz im so upset about this. And if they try and guilt me more tomorrow, im gonna call the owner and tell him whats going on. Would i be an asshole if i did that? I live in Texas<|response|> NTA-Your health comes first, and you did call and let them know the doctor's orders. If they can't get anyone to close then it is up the area directors to cover that time period. Call the owner and tell him the responses you got from the Director. <|endoftext|>
76617	2	AITA for taking money out of my wifes dead dad coat pocket? My wife's dad who died like 5 years ago, used to always wear these old hats and suits with coats almost everyday. Before he died, he left money in his that pocket. nothing much at all, only like $40. Something came up where I needed cash, we usually keep some in the house but I needed the cash as opposed to using my debit card so I just took from there. I took that $40 and used it. I don't think it was a big deal. I needed the cash quick and we had no money in the house. I was gonna put money back in there, in case she checked. But for some reason with my luck she checked for whatever reason lol. She noticed like a week later and asked me if I took money from there and I said yeah. My wife said How could I do that and what's wrong with me, and how could I do such a thing. I told her it's just like $40 and she needs to relax... it's not like I did it to hurt her or disrespect him or anything. He wouldn't care trust me, he wouldn't want us to just leave $40 in his pocket forever. Whatever, she's furious at me and genuinely upset. Did I do a bad thing? What are we just going to leave that money in there forever? I only used it because I really needed it.<|response|> YTA-It wasn’t the money. It was the sentimental value of that particular money. <|endoftext|>
37590	3	AITA for grabbing a girls ankle So FYI i am in 4th grade high school during biology class The teacher calls on everyone to come in front of the classroom and this girl ive known and weve been semi good friends come and sit on the desk at my back and she made a joke saying i dont bite. We had a laugh and i told her that she didn't know that and i lightly grasped her ankle. They suddenly said nothing and the next day they started acting like absolute assholes and saying i groped her etc. i am very confused as to why they are being so hostile against me its not like i hurt her or abused her. Am i the asshole here?<|response|> YTA. Don't touch people without permission. <|endoftext|>
89291	2	AITA for refusing to remove videos of myself pole dancing from YouTube? Hey all, mostly a lurker here, never thought I’d have an AITA issue. But yet here we are, LOL. My BF and I have been dating for four months now. A few days ago I offhandedly mentioned that I used to do pole dancing for exercise. This was a few years ago. He seemed interested and I showed him a couple of videos from my YouTube of old routines I did. I want to mention that the videos are not sexy stripping videos, they are videos of me with all of my private areas covered doing some pretty complicated dancing moves. He asked me if the videos are public, I said yes. He freaked out and said he didn’t want people seeing me half naked doing a sexy dance and said I had to make them private. I don’t really WANT to make them private. I’m proud of my routines and the work I put into them, I think they look really cool. I like looking at the comments I get, I still get some sometimes from people. It’s not like these videos are posted all over the internet, they are not super popular videos, most of the comments are from instructors or other people who do pole dancing for fun. He’s really upset at me for not “being loyal to him” by taking them down, he says he’s “reevaluating the future potential of our relationship.” I feel like he’s being super controlling over something that isn’t a big deal. I don’t know if I’m being an asshole for choosing this as my hill to die on. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it, including a couple of friends who DID pole dancing, and they were basically like “yeah he’s being controlling but it’s not really that big of a deal, it’s normal for him to feel this way.”<|response|> NTA. This is controlling and jealous behavior. Can you see yourself putting up with this if this is only the beginning? <|endoftext|>
138460	2	AITA for not letting my abusive father come to my 18th birthday dinner. My father has been horrible to me for as long as I can remember, he was never supportive of who I am, and took advantage of me financially and in other abusive ways. He recently text my mother (they're separated) and said "tell the wean I still love her" this was especially hurtful as I am a transmale, and the reason I actually stopped living with him was due to his transphobia. My mother and step father have asked me multiple times if I want to invite him to my 18th, I've refused every single time as I don't want him in my in anyway, but they have repeatedly told me I'll regret it. AITA? edit: i've invited my gran, his mother, because i'm still close, she knows not to bring him or invite him, but i still feel bad.<|response|> NTA and you probably won't regret it. <|endoftext|>
193335	3	AITA for not letting people kiss my baby? Okay, this post won't be very long. I'm 9 months pregnant with my first, literally due in 3 weeks and I cannot wait for this to be over lol. Anyway, with our son coming so soon my husband and I have made rules for people. The rules are as follows: 1: if you don't feel comfortable/ know how to pick up a newborn, sit down and either me or my husband will hand him to you. 2: if you're sick with anything you need to wait until it's gone to be around our baby. 3 (mostly for my family): don't let your animals lick my baby. 4 (most important to me): DO. NOT. KISS. OUR. BABY. We told these rules to our families and most of them understand. But my in laws disagree with the kissing one and think it isn't fair that they had to wait so long for a grandchild and now they aren't allowed to kiss him when he's here. I tried to explain that I just don't want anyone transferring germs to my newborn baby and that even my husband and I won't be kissing him for the first few weeks/couple months. They still think it's unfair and they feel like we're calling them "dirty" when that's not even the case. I'm starting to feel bad and like I should just wave this rule for them even though it's important to me and my husband. So, AITA for having this rule? EDIT: this is not the full list of rules that we have for our baby. These are just a few of them. I should have cleared that up in the post my apologies.<|response|> NTA. I'm a nurse who cares for sick babies in the hospital. Babies can get herpes, RSV, or flu, among other things, from people kissing them and these can be deadly. Stick to your plan. <|endoftext|>
25477	4	AITA for hooking up with my ex-boyfriends brother? I broke up with my exboyfriend last summer and we haven't kept in touch as we don't really share any friends and he goes to a different college than me in the same city. His brother goes to the same college as me and he's a few years older than us. My ex and his brother live together in a 2bdrm apartment. Last night I was out with some of my friends and saw my ex's brother and we began to talk and catch up because it had been a while since we'd last seen each other. Anyway one thing led to another and I left with him to his place. After we hooked up I was getting ready to leave then my ex walked into the apartment. I just squeaked out a 'hi' and ran out. Now I saw that my ex blocked me on social media (instagram, deleted me off facebook). AITA? It's not like I'm dating his brother it was just a one time thing, I currently don't regret it but I'm not sure if what I did was bad.<|response|> ESH. Bro code dictates you shouldn’t sleep with your buddy’s ex without an ok. So it may have been a dick move on the brother to sleep with you. (That being said maybe he got a go-ahead Based on your awkward and hasty retreat this morning you knew it would hurt your ex to know you’d been fucking his brother. Even if it wasn’t a revenge hook up it might have the same effect on you ex. Mildly dickish don’t expect to be friends with this ex but it’s also not that big a deal. Your ex will get over this. <|endoftext|>
135037	3	AITA for visiting other countries during a trip to my brother? Context, my brother moved to Thailand this summer to be with his fiancee while she finishes college. They invited me to visit them for a month this fall, and offered to pay my way regardless if I can afford the ticket or not. I just have to pay ticket insurance and my own food/spending money. It's way cheap to travel to other countries from Thailand, namely I want to visit Singapore and Japan again so I want to spend a few days there during the month. Because it's cheaper, I offered to pay their way and board if they want to come along. Our parents and mutual friends think I'm being out of line not spending the entire month in Thailand since they want to pay my way to visit. So, AITA?<|response|> NTA I get sick of my relatives after a week. As long as you're in that part of the hemisphere, might as well do some sight-seeing. <|endoftext|>
115413	3	AITA For Ruining my Boyfriends Friendships So this happened like three years ago, but I still feel guilty about it. My boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) met and started dating. After a month or so, everything is good so I start to meet his friends. Initially, it was all fine. He had six friends, a little group, and lived with two of them. Well, as time went on we got a bit more serious. My boyfriend started taking his job more seriously, as I am an intense workoholic, and I tried to relax and party more like him. His friends are INTENSE partiers. They're all now in their late 20s/early 30s and still go out every other night and drink until utterly smashed. Things started to go wrong between me and his friends by then. They blamed me for him not going out more (we went out every friday and Saturday with them), and just generally started to complain. The main complaint they had about me was I'm too opinionated and annoying. There was also an incident in which I yelled at them for drunk driving home from a bar with my boyfriend passed out in the back with no seat belt. Still, I tried to stay positive and went out of my way to be friendly, making dinner and baked goods for them and staying home alone so my boyfriend could have more guy time. Didnt work. They started a "campaign" called "Make (OP's boyfriend) Single Again" and teased me about stupid stuff like where I went to college, my accent, and my anxiety disorder. This really pissed me off and I stopped spending time with them, and my boyfriend stepped back a bit. So when my bpyfeiend and I moved in together I told him point blank that the only one who could come over was the non asshole friend. My boyfriend could go see them, but I would not be uncomfortable in my home. My boyfriend just stopped being friends with them. I didn't really think I was an asshole until a few months later when (small town) someone said to my friend that they heard I didn't let my boyfriend to have friends and that I was isolating him and manipulative. So, AITA?<|response|> NTA. I think that's totally fair. I also think your boyfriend should stand up to them for this behaviour. Edit: he should have stood up to them earlier when this bullying was going on. It's good that he cut them out though. <|endoftext|>
120596	3	AITA for fighting with my sister about something racist her boyfriend said/did in a public family gathering? Just looking for some clarity on this situation because it is getting very muddy and convoluted and I can’t think straight about it anymore. At my one sisters 18th bday party at a Japanese steakhouse, my whole family came out to celebrate. At the end of the meal the manager came by to say hello and that she hoped we’d enjoyed our meals. when she walked away, my OTHER sisters bf (we are all in our twenties, he is in late twenties) pulled his eyes back and mocked what she had just said, talking in a fake Japanese accent. IN A PUBLIC PLACE WITH PEOPLE RIGHT BY US. It was hibachi so there was a whole row of people facing us. I was mortified and so was my other sister whose birthday it was. I told him it was not acceptable. Then we all moved on. (My sister whose boyfriend it was just laughed along with it, which baffled me). Two days later (Hoping it would some space between the situation so that no one gets their panties in a bunch) I asked that sister via text “how did (her boyfriend’s) imitation at the restaurant make you feel?” . I asked her about it because it bothered me but I didn’t feel comfortable approaching him directly in case he took it the wrong way, so I just wanted to see if she had addressed it with him so that hopefully he would know for the future that our family doesn’t tolerate that. She then replied with an insult totally unrelated about my boyfriend. All hell breaks loose. I say really mean things. I was trying to be nice and lost it and instead went full blown telling her exactly how I felt, that what he did was immature and embarrassing and racist. A week goes by. She asks for an apology. I apologized for losing my temper, then followed it up with the fact that I still stood by my stance that she should have condemned his behavior instead of changing the subject to attack my bf. All hell breaks loose again as she replies thanks for the apology BUT I have decided that I don’t want to discuss my relationship with you anymore so you don’t get to ask me about that. It devolves into a giant mess of her accusing me of wanting to control his behavior and her reaction to it, and results in him texting me that I am a horrible person and I have no sense of humor and that I can’t infringe in his freedom of speech (he is extremely right wing) and how it was just a joke. Now we may never speak again. She told him literally everything i said, even texts where I was upset after she attacked me and was being very harsh about everything. She says it’s not my right to dictate if she approves or disapproves of his actions and it’s none of<|response|> NTA - Racist jokes aren’t funny. It doesn’t matter which way you lean politically, a racist joke is still racist. It sucks that your sister doesn’t see that. Maybe, in time, she will. <|endoftext|>
191102	2	AITA asking my roommates girlfriend to chip in on rent My roommate has been dating this girl for a month and it has got to the point that she averaged spending 5 nights a week at our apartment the last two weeks? She gets here after she gets off work and leaves for work in the morning. So she is eating two meals a day here, showering here, and even doing laundry here. Would I be the asshole for asking her to chip in some money toward rent and utilities?<|response|> NTA- if she’s eating food outside of just your roommates, and she’s showering/laundry, then I think that’s totally fair. <|endoftext|>
47844	4	AITA because I referred to a local pizza place by it's acronym like the locals do (I'm on vacation) or was the group that called me out way out of line? My family and I are currently on vacation in Taos, New Mexico. We wanted to see the museums, tour the local artists galleries and museums and get some outdoor time in the mountains. The scenery and things to do have been amazing but it's probably one of least friendly and least welcoming places I've ever been. However we discovered a local pizza place that has been absolutely amazing. The food is fantastic, our kids (who are picky eaters) love it, they raw bring dough for the kids to play with, the staff has been friendly and courteous so we have eaten here three times in a week. I don't want to say the name of the place but it's complicated to say. I'll make up a name for the purpose of this post and say its: "Taos Pizza Among Willows" but everyone at the place says "T-P-A-W" (again that's not the name but I'm hoping you get the idea). We went into another local restaurant for lunch today and we were talking about our experience with the waitress. She was distant but polite and asked our son what sort of food he liked since he was having trouble deciding. He said "I like T-P-A-W!" She said she didn't know what that was so I told her "oh we've really enjoyed Taos Pizza Among Willows" she said that she could probably get her chef to make a French bread pizza even though its not on the menu. I said to my husband "well at least she's almost as friendly as the people at TPAW." There were a group of locals (all men in their mid 20s) next to us and I could definitely tell the were murmuring about us. I could hear one of them say "fucking Texans" and I turned to look at their table. One of them looked at me and said "hey only locals get to call local things by local words, that's a real asshole thing to do for Texans." I didn't want any sort of confrontation so I turned around but I continued to hear them mock and make fun of us until they left. I hope this isn't seen as a validation post because I am not good and not used to confrontation and the experience has really left me shaken. Did I violate some sort of "locals only" rule that I should have been more sensitive to? Or should anyone get to say whatever they want even though there may be a "local" way of doing things? Hence was I (or we) the assholes?<|response|> I'm just wondering why are you telling a local restaurant all about how great another local restaurant is? And comparing the friendliness of the staff between the two restaurants openly at the table? You are NTA for using the acronym - but I wonder if the group of men just overheard your comments and thought you were tacky for making them while still in the restaurant. Maybe they are just friends with the owners/employees at the restaurant you were in, and were trying to defend it in some off handed way. Or maybe they were just drunk and being shit heads. I wouldn't take it personally. <|endoftext|>
37348	4	AITA or lazy spouse? For the most part, the relationship my wife and I share is great - much laughter and general merriment in our day to day, even with 3 kids running around. We've had ups, downs, and complete shit shows over the years and still managed to keep it together somehow. However, recently, it's been getting to be more and more apparent that my loving, stay at home wife, the mother of my children who dedicates her entire being to their well-being, has begun to think that maintenance of the household chores no longer applies to her. That's not to say I won't help out because I do, even after working an average of 16 hours a day in a high stress prison environment I make a point to do some of the day to day tidying up after the kids, and her, have gone to bed. But it's not uncommon to come home after work or watch on my days off as the laundry continues to pile up, dishes remain scattered and dirty throughout the house, and children (7,3,&1) go wild until midnight (which is the time I typically come home each night). I'll begrudgingly do the chores that annoy me simply because the spouse refuses to get off the couch or Facebook long enough to be productive or contribute anymore. I've mentioned to, and probably berated, her that she needs to get things done and been met with combative responses. So currently I only do things that benefit me or the children. I wash our dishes, clothes, and pick up our messes of clothes or toys or shoes while leaving her stuff strewn about and dirty. She's mentioned that she has no clean clothes or whatever, and yells about it. I just tell her then she needs to take care of her responsibilities like she should be and things would be where they need to be. So, AITA for expecting someone who stays at home to be domestically proficient and productive?<|response|> NTA, but it sounds like your wife might be depressed from someone who has lived through a similar situation, so that might be something to speak to a psychiatrist about. <|endoftext|>
42601	3	AITA for screaming at a farmer for plowing fields loudly at 10 pm? My house backyard is directly up against a large cornfield. This happened last night. I was in my bed and I heard a loud noise that almost sounded like a jet engine. I looked out my bedroom window and I see a large tractor plowing the cornfield. It is late out and I have work the next day. I got annoyed but tried to ignore it. After hearing it for more than 20 minutes, I went out in the backyard and waved a flashlight and screamed as loud as I could to get his attention when he came towards me. He saw me and stopped. He said "can I help you?" and I asked him why are you plowing the fields loudly at night? I need to sleep. He said he was just doing his job. I told him why can't you do it during the day? He did not answer and said "is there anything else you need or are you going to let me get back to work". He had an attitude to him which made me more angry and I screamed at him and told him that he shouldn't be a noise nuisance at night. He turned his tractor back on and drove away and continued plowing the fields. I cursed at him loudly knowing he couldn't hear me. I talked with some neighbors about it today and they said that they heard it but it wasn't a big deal and I overreacted. AITA for yelling at him even though he was doing this late at night?<|response|> YTA Don’t live in farm land if you don’t like it. He was doing his job and you got mad at him for it. He can’t move the farm. <|endoftext|>
2464	3	AITA for not Tipping Hotel Housekeepers Just to make one thing clear, I tip very well at restaurants and on delivery. I tip a little less for "car-side-to-go" type meals, and I tip a dollar per drink and a buck or two on take-out. I live in the USA and our stupid culture has decided that's how we compensate food-service employees, and if I'm going to do it I want to do it right. My question, however, pertains to hotel housekeeping staff. I never leave a tip for hotel housekeeping. I noticed an envelope labeled for tips at a hotel recently, and when I asked a friend about it I was informed that such tipping is strongly encouraged. When I said I didn't think it was mandatory, I was (jokingly) called an asshole for all the poor housekeeping staff I stiffed. I still, however, think that I'm not the asshole for not tipping hotel staff. I paid for the hotel, and housekeeping staff are paid a full wage, not a servers wage. When I arrive at a hotel, I usually hang the do not disturb sign as soon as I arrive, because I really don't want/need turndown service, fresh towels, etc. The 6 towels in the room are usually quite sufficient. So my thoughts are that the only cleaning/service I receive is when I check out and they turn over the room for the next guest. That's the service I paid for when I booked the hotel. So set me straight. Am I the asshole for not tipping hotel housekeeping staff when they don't come in my room at all during my stay?<|response|> I only ever tip them if I made a mess that they have to clean up beyond what would be expected of them normally. Otherwise, they make at least minimum wage. They can deal. Not the asshole. <|endoftext|>
16519	2	AITA For being slightly put off by a girls 'enthusiasm' in sex, despite generally enjoying it? This is gonna be NSFW btw. I have been seeing a girl I met on tinder for about three weeks, on and off. This has basically been a bunch of hook ups, and we've been sort of inching into actually dating territory. However, now that we're getting more serious and im getting to know her as sort of a pseudo girlfriend, I am starting to look at her a different way. Things I didnt care about before are becoming apparent, namely how she performs sexually. She is a freak in bed, to put it mildly. Like she goes all out. For instance, when she was giving me head, she actually started licking my balls. No girl has ever done that, but she took it a step further and actually placed them in her mouth. She also gets off on being called derogatory names, like "whore" and "slut". Not to mention the fact that she straight up asks for anal sex. She licks nipples, she asks for spankings, she wants to call me daddy, ect. She even told me she cuckolded (with his consent) a previous boyfriend, in addition to having threesomes. So, my thought process is, "huh, this is awesome", but also "man, where did she learn this stuff, how many guys has she been with, do i want to date someone who is so "experienced"? Like, is it possible for her to be a girlfriend, instead of a fuck buddy. Am I wrong for thinking this way?<|response|> YTA you have a great sexual partner and have a problem that she has had sex before you? <|endoftext|>
30514	2	AITA? My (25M) sister (22F) just broke up with her boyfriend of almost 8 years. She asked me for support and I don't want to give her any. I and my sister (let's call her Brenda) spent our adolescent/teenage years in southern California. I joined the military out of high school, and while I was in my family moved to Texas, much to the dismay of my sister. She had a social network, including her BF, and hated my parents for relocating. She maintained a long distance relationship with the guy back in California (let's go with Thomas). Despite the long-distance relationship, she decided she needed something closer to her, so she started ANOTHER relationship with a guy (Brad) in Texas. Eventually Brenda moved back to California to be with Thomas and that's how things have been for the last few years. With a bit of background established, here's the situation in present day: This weekend I was spending time with my mother when she gets a phone call from Brenda, who is in hysterics. Apparently Thomas had decided to go through her phone while she was busy with something else. He found her text message history with Brad and lost it. I didn't ask for details but my understanding is that Thomas cut ties with Brenda completely over the inappropriate (IMO) relationship she had with Brad in Texas (which for some reason had continued even after she moved back to California). I brushed it off as more drama from Brenda (she and Thomas have a "breakup" every 1-2 weeks) but apparently this the one, the last straw. She reached out to me asking for support, but I really, REALLY don't want to talk to her at all. Aside from this fiasco, she's manipulative, disrespectful, entitled, and shallow. She has been using her relationship with Thomas as a means to avoid work and still lead a fairly comfortable life as a college student (he makes a fair bit of money and shares with her), which I find reprehensible. I said as much to her, and am waiting to see if she replies. I want her to change how shitty of a person she is, or at least acknowledge the fact, before I want anything to do with her. AITA?<|response|> NTA not your circus, not your monkies <|endoftext|>
52565	3	AITA for banning my sister from the Netflix meaning that my parents can't watch it. so I'm in a bind here and honestly feel I majorly fucked up so I wanna know your side. I (22f) had come up to visit my parents and my sister (14f) after only being up there for a few days I was becoming shocked at her language. here is an example. I had expressed some annoyance because someone in a group chat was only responding with voice messages instead of typing it out. (so I had no clue what they where saying as i forgot my headphones) my sister decided to respond in the most snarky voice ever, "mabey there phone is broken and they can't type, did you ever think about that? no I bet you didn't. and then proceeded to smirke at me. whenever I said something she would add a snarky comment, when I would call her out for her rude language she would give me a horrible death glare and then go on her phone. I got fed up with being shat on the whole time I was up and as my parents are trying to tell me its normal teen language they are refusing to punish it. so I signed them out of the Netflix before I left. my parents are mad and have been telling me to put it back on my sister is a mess as she just started stranger things s3. AITA? I pay for the Netflix myself they contribute nothing.<|response|> You're a baby for calling that "language" when she didn't even curse. You don't owe anyone your Netflix account if you pay for it all, especially some sister who is being a brat. NTA for the Netflix thing but ESH because you're trying to make it an issue about your sisters' "language" when her language is fine, the problem is her attitude to you (and she's within her rights to hate your guts, if that's what she wants). <|endoftext|>
166958	3	AITA for not helping my dad pay back college loans he took out for me? My dad owned a small business that was relatively successful but hit by recession just about the same time I was choosing a college to attend. The deal had always been, generously, that I should should just worry about getting into what school I can and that he would pay the tuition. I applied to schools and got into and put my deposit on an out-of- state school with a good business program that I got a small scholarship to attend. About a month before I left for school my dad told me he could not afford to pay the whole tuition and asked me to get a loan for 50% of the cost. I was okay with this ( I wish I had known prior and it might have shaped which school I choose but at that point I was set on where I wanted to go.) fast forward 10ish years and I proudly tell my dad I paid off the total loans I had taken out (about $55,000 over the 4 years.) My dad then tells me that he did not pay his share, that he got loans for it which he has been deferring or making very meager payments on and know that he has about $100,000 worth of loans, his business is doing bad and asked me to start sending him $2000 a month to pay toward those loans. &#x200B; I said no and he got into a huge fight and have not talked since (about a month ago.) He thinks I am being selfish because the loans are for my education, but first of all I never knew he took out loans to pay. 2nd while I was living frugally, with roommates long past I would have liked and a hour and a half commute for cheaper rent, my dad goes on 2 vacations a year, eats out every meal and lives in a 3 bedroom apartment he rents by himself. I would consider paying toward the loans but I feel like I have to see him cut back on his lifestyle first. is that fair? am I an asshole?<|response|> NTA. He can't just up and change his mind and create a contract where there is a wasn't one, before. He decided to take out loans and it's not on you to pay it back. It was a gift. He doesn't get to turn it into a debt. Fuck him hard. <|endoftext|>
138537	2	AITA for not telling the cashier he undercharged me? Today at the dunkins drive thru I ordered my regular thing, some wraps, hashbrowns and a coffee. I pull up to the window and he says it’s $2 and some change — I said something like really? And he asked if I had one or two wraps, I said two. He updated it and it came to $3 something — I said “and that’s with the coffee?” And he said yes. I was still a bit confused but gave him my card, he ran it, gave me the bag of food. I waited for a second and he said “I think everything’s in there” and I reminded him I had a coffee too. He said “oh you had a coffee?” And I said yes, he handed me my coffee that was on the mat. I know he must’ve only charged me for my food, but I didn’t say anything at that point. Mostly I’m just thinking this is some mild bad karma. I doubt he’d get in trouble but am wondering if semantically I did the wrong thing.<|response|> NAH - Dunkin Donuts won't hurt over a couple dollars. <|endoftext|>
6613	4	AITA for Introducing my GF as a Model? So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything. She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor. So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said "Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about. I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money? \*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends. \*\* I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has. I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant. &#x200B; \*\*Final Edit At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post. I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was<|response|> Okay, this has become an issue on this thread. #Do not suggest OP's girlfriend be violent towards OP. Please also be sure to follow rule 1, even if you don't like the person or don't think they "deserve it". Thanks for your consideration! [Message the mods] if you have any questions or concerns. <|endoftext|>
54937	5	AITA for scolding my mother for not preparing home-cooked meals on time This might seem like a mundane situation, but hear me out. Work is quite far and my commute to work requires switching between two public transport routes. This means that if I miss the first bus, I will be late to work by upto an hour, or have to use a much more taxing route (to reach earlier but still not on time). Also, my mother has taken it upon herself to cook lunch for me every morning. This is because the food options near my office aren't too great and she is always concerned about my health. I love the sentiment and the food she cooks tastes amazing, but here's the thing: She always takes a little too long to prepare the food. This will often lead to me missing my intended route. Now. I've tried telling her about the problem gently (still keeps happening). I've tried asking her to not prepare lunch for me if it will take too long (she takes this as me not appreciating her efforts). I've tried leaving at the last moment I possibly can, leaving the food behind (this makes me feel the worst). All of this has lead to this scenario: I wake up, remind her to finish cooking earlier if she is doing so (She would already be up at this point). I freshen up, remind her again. I get ready for work, another reminder. As my time to leave gets closer I get more stern and she gets more frantic. Eventually, this leads to me scolding her when it gets too close to leaving time, and her rushing to try and hand me the lunch before I leave. This will make the next couple of days go by smoothly after which the scenario repeats again. Everytime this happens, I always wish I could take back the words I said, right as I leave the house. I feel like such an asshole for chiding someone who is taking such pains for my sake. ***Edit***: A lot of people think I'm an asshole here, so point taken. There is certainly some ideas here which I will at least try out. * For the people asking me to make my own lunch, I will need to learn that first. So I can start doing that by helping Mom out in the kitchen during the mornings until I start to get a hang of it. Who knows, maybe that will be enough to see to it that lunch delay isn't a problem anymore. * I like the idea of storing lunches for the next day or preparing them the previous night too. (Mom will put up some resistance to this, she only likes to give me fresh food). This can be my backup if point 1 doesn't work out some days. Thanks everyone for your opinions and help.<|response|> NAH Tell her you are leaving at 7.45. If she chooses to make lunch for you by then, thank her generously. If she tells you, It's not ready, thank her and ask her to keep it for tomorrow or for dinner. If she tells you she cannot make it in time, then make your own. I also have a mom who is perpetually late in a way that impacts her favors. Eg, offers to babysit, shows up an hour late, we miss the movie. Offers to drive me to airport, gets mad that I'm mad when she is 45 min late. If I have something time-critical - like your bus situation - I either lie about the timeline to allow her lateness, or don't rely on her. <|endoftext|>
53629	2	WIBTA- If I ask my sister to not post my kid on social media. My sister is big on social media and she always post her children on IG and FB. I don't care about what she does with her kids but I need help on how to ask her, to not post my newborn on social media. &#x200B; She makes her living off of making clothes while using her kids as models. She feels comfortable to do this but I do not want her thousands of followers to see my child. My child can decide to post pictures when she is the appropriate age. &#x200B; How do I word this so I do not piss off my sister? She will take this as a direct insult because she makes a living off of selling clothes and using her kids to promote them. I just want her to not post my daughter for her followers. &#x200B; Background information: She is usually combative about anything with me. I am usually very blunt when I speak and I can come off as a rude person. My sister would take photos I sent in a group text and post them online (that hurt me). She never asked for permission to use my photos online. I want a good relationship with my sister so I cannot be mean in my response.<|response|> NAH. This is not an advice sub, I think you would be better off in another sub meant for advice. Perhaps check out r/relationship_advice Have a nice day. <|endoftext|>
179140	2	WIBTA If I denied my Mother in Law going to my son’s “graduation”? Ok so as the title says, my son”s “graduation” is coming in a few days (in quotes because he is 6 and he gets promoted from kindergarten(?) to Elementary School(?) (in question marks because Im trying to find the equivalent for my country) So, the problem is, due to the current circumstances of the country, the ceremony will be hosted in the same kindergarten and only 2 persons per child can assist, meaning usually Mother and Father. Now for some context, my mother in law and I have a terrible relationship, not just disliking each other. A kind of summary would be the following. She took horrible care of my SO when she was a child, neglection, anger, mostly everything you can think of, though she never straight up beat her, she harmed her emotionally in a way she is still affected. She also got against me when I tried helping my so out, taking her to medic appointments, etc. Under the argument of “she is gonna do whatever the hell she does, if she does something and she dies its her problem” even though I wasnt forcing anything. Recently(End of July ) we had a huge fight, where my SO ended up leaving her mother’s home to mine. There where aggressions from her to us, both physical and verbal, even her partner (not so’s dad) attacked me. She also tried to put my son against my so the whole time she lived at her home, saying things like, “Don’t listen to her” “She is not your mom, I am” and yelling at her when my so tried to correct any bad behavior. Spoiling him to the point of him not having a clue of self care and having different issues related to learning, speaking and thinking. My so and I are 21 y/o, and as you can probably guess, she gave birth at a really young age, a delicate topic. That being said, she was still at school and at the same time she worked at a program we call here “technical” in which the school kind of pairs a student with a company and hires him as an intern. So if she wasnt at school, she was working in a mining company, which meant that she woke up at 4am and came back at 10pm so she couldnt be a lot of time with my son Even in that situation, mil attacked her. Though she did take care of him while my so was absent. Now as for me, Im not the boy’s biological father, I met her in beginnings of 2018, but ever since we’ve been together i’ve been trying my best to be a father and a good one. Especially now that we live alone in a house that we rent. She has some “leverage” since she was the one with him his whole life, but I really believe she has done more harm than good, both to my so and to my son, even<|response|> NTA, there's only two tickets, you are the two parents. Would be unfair to the kid not to have you there. From the sound of it, MIL is gonna have a fit about something either way. <|endoftext|>
42074	3	AITA for telling my future mother in law to shut the f*** up? My fiance and I got engaged about 7 months ago and we have been through a lot over 4 years of dating but have always found a way through it even with a pretty significantly long "break" in the middle of our relationship. We have moved on from the past and there are no problems there. Long story short, her mother goes out to an event with her family without us and invites a man my fiance cheated on me with (Keep your thoughts on cheating to yourself) . The mother says he was her last resort and she had to have someone. As my future mother-in-law I felt extremely betrayed and felt as though she didn't give a shit about me or her daughter. We were both very angry towards her mother and the mother said "I don't see why it's a big deal since you both are over what happened." Implying that we weren't actually over it. This made us much more angry to the point where we cut her out of our lives for about 2 weeks before she texted me while she was drinking and said "Be careful, she's only with you for the money, don't say I didn't warn you." I replied with "Shut the fuck up" and blocked all communication with her. My fiance and I split rent and both work full time, so the mother was referring to my parents money which is more than average but not overly substantial. They take us on a trip or 2 a year but make me rely on myself the majority of the time. &#x200B; Edit: Her mother did not know the guy before and has no reason to communicate with him. And once again I am not here for advice on cheating, that topic is resolved.<|response|> NTA. Sounds like she just wants to cause trouble. It might be worth you and/or your fiancee to visit r/JustNOMIL, because it sounds like she's pretty crappy. <|endoftext|>
57018	3	AITA for having sex while a guest is over? I have a friend of mine staying with me that is from out of town. She is here for a few days and is sleeping on the couch in the living room (we don’t have a guest room). Yesterday we all went out (I also have a roommate), and we met up with my boyfriend eventually. When we get back that night me and my bf go in my room to sleep (guest is on couch in living room outside my door, my roommate is in her own room), we decide we want to have sex. For reference we have never gotten scolded before or been told we were too loud, and when we had sex last night we made sure to keep it quiet since my friend (guest) was right outside the door in the living room. I guess she must have heard a little something and got pretty upset. She confronted me just a bit ago asking why we were being disrespectful and why we couldn’t wait to do it after she left (she is here till Sunday). I didn’t really respond, I just nodded my head and said sorry. Maybe I’m wrong... but I feel that I should be able to have sex at my place with my boyfriend. It’s not like we get super wild if we know others are here, my roommate has also never had an issue with this (and I’ve even brought it up with her just to make sure she’s comfortable in our place!). So AITA?<|response|> NTA - she scolded you for having sex in your own bedroom in your own house, while she was staying for free as a guest? Oh hell no. <|endoftext|>
54020	3	AITA for being more worried about a dog than a human? My best friend’s ex got into drug dealing, got busted, and is set to be sentenced next month. With mandatory minimums, he is looking at a minimum of 4 years behind bars. This same person owns a very sweet, 3 year old border collie who is a rescue dog. When my best friend told me his ex was going to jail, my immediate response was to ask who was going to take care of the dog. I was then told that I was “kind-of being an sh&$head” because I’m more worried about a dog than a human. And I’m like, “the dog is the only innocent party here”... A mild argument/debate ensued between us. So, AITH for being more worried about a dog than a human?<|response|> NTA >“the dog is the only innocent party here” <|endoftext|>
158630	4	AITA for sharing private messages to a group chat? Tl:DR My DM (Dungeon Master) whose friends always let him get away with everything was harassing my boyfriend and I for months via Facebook and I finally decided to let the rest of the group know what he had been saying to us after he got mad I didn't put his game above my grandmothers funeral. We joined a local RPing group about 8 months ago with a guy we had played with before. We had never had him as a DM before, but thought it would be good to go out and make friends. It started a little iffy as one of them told us that they don't argue with this guy over anything and always just let him get his way because he has a tendency to 'sulk' (an understatement). I'm not into doing that to anyone. If they are in the wrong, I will let them know privately but I won't let them just keep acting up. When we started in Pathfinder it was clear that he didn't read the rules and was making it up as we went along. This lead to us having to keep clarifying what we could and couldn't do with our characters as some things had been removed and some things had been added. Eventually he stopped acknowledging us when we spoke and would constantly take control of our characters. It was essentially a 4 hour session of listening to him ramble on. It got worse as we moved to Fantasy Flight where he 'fixed' the entire system so nothing but the tech skills worked without telling anyone in advance. This meant that we had characters that couldn't be used. When we asked him about it he said 'too bad'. Several days after asking for clarification we were bombarded with messages asking if we were mentally handicapped (but in less polite terms), said we were mentally unstable, told us not to bring 'baggage' with us (reading the rules and asking for clarification at MOST twice a session after he decided our characters couldn't use their skills), told us we were problem players, and that we were wrong for asking about the rules. The part that pushed me over the edge was when he told me I was a bad player for putting my grandmothers funeral over the game. When we eventually confronted him about it through a private chat he went on a tirade. We admitted that perhaps we could ask less questions and he said 'we make DMing a nightmare' and 'this is the best I can do with people' when we pointed out how rude he had been. My boyfriend and I finally decided he wasn't worth the others (who were nice people, so it was sad to leave them) and decided to part ways. Before that, however, I wanted to let everyone know how much he had been harassing us and the stuff he had been saying as he has a tenancy to make himself out to be the victim. I wanted<|response|> Nah, he’s TA. You called him out, you showed others what a jerk he is. You are not obligated to coddle, protect or cover for abusers. If you wouldn’t say something or act a certain with with someone in front of a group, it’s probably not ok to do it in private. Good for you! <|endoftext|>
190842	4	AITA for not doing the dishes right away Petty in the scope of things but I finally have something to post here. Throwaway because reasons. The basics: Wife is disabled, doesn’t work because it’s more hassle than it’s worth to get a part time job. So she is home all day a lot. We do not have children at this time. I work a very physical job that can have me on my feet for 9- 10 hours a day. I also take online classes because my back is killing me and I can’t do this another five years. I do help around the house and do almost all the yard work. I’m not lazy. I will do stuff including laundry, dishes and whatnot. Usually on a day off though since by the time I’m done at work I’m just kinda beat. I’m just not built for construction on the bad days. The issue: It takes her 2-3 trips to do dishes and she does them 4-5 days a week. Last night I had worked about 10 hours and I was in pain from it. I was on the couch after dinner with a massager on my back and an ice pack on my knee. She asked me to do the dishes because she just wasn’t feeling up to it. Ok, we’re both having a bad day. I told her I’d do them tomorrow (today) because I am off. I was In pain and also wasn’t up to cleaning the kitchen. She got mad and said they had to be done today. I told her it could wait until tomorrow. I want to watch this show and rest my back. It wouldn’t hurt anything to soak until tomorrow. I get called lazy, I was wrong when I said she was using her disability as an excuse and she didn’t want to not that she couldn’t when she could clearly see I was in pain. That just made her mad and I did apologize later. She winds up doing the dishes herself, slamming things around and I just let her go. This morning we had a talk about it. Her mother was apparently supposed to come this morning, but she didn’t tell me that. She doesn’t like the house dirty because her mother already thinks we can’t do anything ourselves because of one incident over three years ago. Okay, I get it, but MIL didn’t even come until about an hour ago. The dishes definitely could have waited until I was waiting for the coffee pot. I guess that’s not the point? She COULD have come at 9 like she said and would have seen the kitchen a mess. I told her she didn’t even say MIL was coming. To which i get called an asshole and she doesn’t need to announce every time her mom comes around. I’m not saying she does, but why wouldn’t she tell me that’s why she really wanted the kitchen cleaned up last night? We could have tag teamed it or something. Who is in the wrong<|response|> NTA- she needs to communicate better. If something is important to get done she needs to convey the message. You saw you were wrong about the disability comment and apologized. She needs to rethink and reevaluate the situation. <|endoftext|>
69295	4	AITA for asking my coworker ''What the fuck is wrong with you?'' aggressively? A coworker of mine, we'll call him David for the sake of it being easier to explain my situation. So me and David grew pretty close and hung out a lot. For about a year, things were fine. We've never argued, we've never had a fight or anything like that. We would hang out every other weekend and sometimes after work. Having fun and enjoying each others company. A few months ago he came to work without saying hello. Something that's good to mention is that I work as a receptionist, so when you leave and come to work, you walk pass me. At first I was a bit confused, but didn't think much of it until he, on that same day, avoided me. He would walk pass me quickly and not even look at my direction, ignore me and just go out. This happened for a few days and I always called him after work to make sure he was OK, I started getting worried that maybe something had happened that made him sad or so. When we talked on the phone, he was normal. As time went by this started happening more and more frequently. Some days he would treat me like a stranger and some days he was back to normal again. This was really hurting me. For a long time I tried to tell myself and think ''Don't take it personally, maybe he's just going through something behind closed doors''. But no, I quickly realized that he was doing this specifically towards me. He would treat me like a stranger but with other coworkers, he was himself. Happy, talkative and basically himself. Even to coworkers he barely talked to! And I'm supposed to be one of his closest friends? We could sometimes hang out on the weekends and as soon as Monday came around, we were back at square 1. Even if he took the initiative to ask me to hang out. I've tried talking to him about this SEVERAL times, at least 5 times. Telling him how it really hurts me, asking him why, asking him if I've done something and I always got the same answer. ''I have nothing to be mad about, you haven't done anything''. He would literally laugh and try to sweep it under the rug every time so I eventually gave up. One day I just looked at him and didn't say hello, he looked me like something was wrong with me and said ''what?'' in a pretty rude way. I then snapped and asked him ''what the fuck is wrong with you? You've been acting like a dick'' in an aggressive tone, but I wasn't loud at all. He has used this as an excuse for his behavior even tho he has done this SO MANY TIMES before I snapped. This started bothering me so much that I took a step back. Now days we don't hang out or talk. I've yet to know what I've done wrong.<|response|> Strongly leaning towards NTA. Getting verbally aggressive on him while your working wasn't wise but his behavior is odd as fuck. You know each other well enough that he slept at your house but he blatantly ignores you when your at work and has no explanation as to why? Incredibly bizarre. <|endoftext|>
95065	3	WIBTA - taking a baby to an empty movie theater I (33F, if that even matters here) am getting a long-awaited visit on Friday from my best friend from high school (34F). We’ve been dying to see Cats for like a year now (don’t judge; the heart wants what it wants) and had planned to catch an early afternoon showing, when hopefully no one else would be in the theater, so we could have unguarded, unmodulated reactions. Unfortunately, because it’s Cats, only one theater around here is even still showing it, and their only showing is at 3:30 pm. That puts me in a bind, because I have to pick my one-year-old up from daycare by 5:30. Her dad doesn’t get off work in time to get her that day, and none of my other backup childcare options are available. So... WIBTA for just taking her with me? We’d leave immediately if there was anyone else in the theater (I doubt there will be; again, it’s Cats and an afternoon weekday showing), if the big screen/sound stresses her out at all or she just gets over it and is too restless. She also really loves singing and cartoons, and I actually think she’d enjoy the movie. She can be mortified later when she finds out this was her first movie. AITA for even considering this?<|response|> You are going to see cats... The baby will be the best part of that theater <|endoftext|>
96	2	AITA for getting mad at someone for stating his opinion on someone else's sexuality? [Context 1] [Context 2] [My posts] I got a bit upset here, and I wanted to know if anyone thinks I was justifiably upset, or if I was overreacting.<|response|> You're a massive asshole. He's allowed to have opinions on whatever he wants. <|endoftext|>
