87042	3	WIBTA if I kept the knife? Background: So, I have a relatively large circle of friends in my hobby, and it's become a tradition to celebrate everyone's birthday. Now, I've become the person who is generally in charge of this, which involves finding a gift, collecting money from people, making a card, and sometimes organizing a surprise or cake. It's a decent amount of work, but I genuinely love doing it. The issue: The latest gift that I ordered for someone's birthday came with a tiny pocket knife as a "free gift" with the purchase. Nobody knows it came with the gift, so WIBTA if I kept it as a small reward for always organizing this stuff? The knife is 7 euro value, and the gift we bought was around 60 euros. I feel like I deserve it, especially since I put a lot of my own money into wrapping/cards/cake, and that often times I end up one or two people short for being paid back. But also I feel a bit like I'm stealing. So, tell me, would I be the asshole if I kept it?<|response|> I would say this breaks rule number 8 Op, you are obviously NTA. It’s just a small pocket knife, do you really believe your friends are going to care that you kept a €7 pocket knife? YTA, however for your comment that you believe you deserve it. You are the one who offered to do this, you volunteered and, unless there were stipulations you really don’t deserve anything. <|endoftext|>
47233	4	WIBTA if I made my gf return my gift she got me? So today I was browsing online and I found a jersey half off that I’ve been wanting for a while now (300 down to 150). So I told my gf that I was going to buy it. Well, it was weird because she was telling me not to buy it. Anyways, she comes over and she shows me the gift she got me. It was the same jersey, however she got one that was lower quality (we don’t spend that much on each other for gifts, it ended up being the same price). So basically, this deal online is so good I feel like she got ripped off. She knows that I want the one that I was looking at today and she’s willing to return it but I just feel so douchy if I “say ya return it and get me this one. “ But I just feel bad because she spent so much on the lower quality one when the top quality one is the same price (and I really want it lol). WIBTA, if I agreed with her to return it and get the one on sale. The jersey that’s on sale is a Toronto maple leafs st. Pats authentic Johnny t jersey for only $150 cdn. It’s a steal. And the one she got me is the same one but the fanatics line (much lower quality).<|response|> NAH - she was doing a nice thing, and you just want to make sure she doesn’t really get ripped off for it. I feel like this is a reasonable request, obviously as long as you offer to pay for any return shipping costs. <|endoftext|>
106661	4	AITA for asking a friend not to text me at night? I have a friend who's always been a bit needy and clingy, which is fine and even endearing sometimes, but lately she's been texting me all day, every day. It doesn't bother me that much during the day, it's nice to have the company and whatnot.... but when I get home from work and I'm winding down I kinda just want to chill and watch a movie or play a video game and not worry about responding to texts. I started just trying to let the conversation die in the evening, but if I dont respond she will just send me another text saying something else or trying to strike up a new conversation and it's progressively gotten worse and more aggressive to the point where she started calling me out for ignoring her or taking too long to respond. A couple nights ago I admittedly got frustrated when she called me out for not responding, and told her that I want "me" time in the evenings and that I didn't want to carry on casual small talk conversations all night. I told her not to text me after 8pm unless it was an emergency. This upset her a ton and she accused me of only being her friend out of pity, and that real friends can talk to each other whenever they want, and that I was incredibly rude. She told me that she didn't want me as a friend if she had to worry about what time of day she was talking to me. To be fair, I was annoyed and blunt when I told her that I wanted me time and I could have probably put it in a much nicer and easier to swallow way... but am I the asshole for wanting to chill without interruptions in the evenings? I sure feel like one after the reaction she gave me.<|response|> NTA, I always thought it was an unspoken rule that after a certain time you don’t pester people, and once I had a job, don’t contact after 9/10pm unless it’s an emergency, or at least don’t expect a response... I think your friend is being a bit self centered. <|endoftext|>
113356	4	AITA Boyfriend not timely and I struggle with this more often than I'd like to admit but I tend to feel super insecure or hurt when sex doesn't end up happening. For starters bf and I were unable to have sex this past week for various reasons. On Wedneaday I notified him that I'd shaved my legs and had been told to stay home from work for a couple hours due to icy conditions. Too late. He apparently already came 2x that morning. He had no idea I was going to stay home so I was annoyed but understood. He told me we'd have sex the next day. The next day I didnt have an appointment until mid morning and I told him that. I woke up at 730, he remarked that this was early considering I didnt have to be into work until 10. But I woke up early with the knowledge of getting dirty as aforepromised. So we shower and watch TV and then nothing. His hand on my knee. Nothing more. Then an hour before I need to go in, i.e. as I'm getting ready, he decides now is the time to grab ass and try to get me to bed. This ability to ignore me until the least timely moment is annoying and something he does. I was pissed but didnt say anything to him. Am I wrong to be so fucking upset about this? If he wanted to fuck me he would have. I had expectations to have sex as he told me we would. I was furious crying on the way to work because I can't make sense of him or the situation. Tldr; sexually frustrated, s/o keeps missing opportunity to fuck. Am I the asshole for being annoyed with him?<|response|> NTA for being mad, but at the same time YTA for not speaking up about it There is nothing more annoying than dating someone who holds everything in, then blows up one day. If you never say anything, he’ll never realize that it pisses you off. If you want it so bad, initiate it. Also: men aren’t ready nor willing to go at all hours of the day, contrary to popular belief. Maybe he doesn’t like the idea of scheduling sex-I know for me, it feels much better if it wasn’t something I penciled into a timeblock on my planner, lmao. *”12 PM: Sex with Jane”* <|endoftext|>
62073	2	AITA for not moving my roommate's stuff to our new apartment I'm an American who lives abroad in Europe and live with 2 other Americans. My lease was up at the end of July and one of my roommates moved back to the States. My remaining roommate (let's call her Matilda) and I decided to look for a new apartment (rather than stay in the old one) and have a friend (let's call her Ashley) also live with us (therefore, 3 people again). I did all of the searching, viewing, speaking to landlords, etc. and found us a place (yay). We couldn't move in until August 15 and Matilda was back in the States at the time visiting family. In the 2 weeks I didn't have an apartment, I stored mine and Matilda's stuff at Ashley's place and another friend's place and crashed at those 2 apartments as well. Ashley has her current apartment until the end of August. &#x200B; Now, flash forward to August 15: Matilda is back, but now Ashley is on vacation until August 26. Matilda and I move all of our stuff out of Ashley and our other friend's place and into our new one. Neither of us have cars (none of us do in this city really) and so we pay for ubers each trip there with our stuff. Ashley asks us to move her stuff as well (despite having 6 days when she returns from vacation in which she could move it herself--we are teachers and work doesn't start until Sept) but we are nice and we say "yes, but can you pay us back for the ubers?" &#x200B; This seems to make Ashley LIVID. I know that I stayed at her place for 2 nights and stored some stuff there, but it doesn't seem that crazy to ask for her to pay for ubers for us to move her stuff when she could do it herself. She also used the fact that I was really sick one of the days I stayed at her place against me. When I was sick she bought me a Gatorade and a ramen noodle packet (I didn't ask for these and didn't actually consume them, but the thought was nice) and said "Tit for Tat--I got you gatorade and ramen so you owe me anyway" &#x200B; So that's the story..AITA?<|response|> NTA. Sounds like she's going to be fun to live with. <|endoftext|>
170653	2	WIBTA if I called the police on my friend's BF? He's a racist, once told me to never talk about black people to him or my friend. He also said that black people are generally dumber than white people. He's homophobic. He says that he accepts me as gay but would never let me near his children. He says that he was raised to see gays as freaks and wants the same for his kids. He isolates her. He made her stop seeing most, if not all of her friends. He has a gun and used to be part of a gang. He talks trash about jews. He gets drunk and calls my friend a slut for no reason. Why would I call the police on him? He's always smoking a joint at a local bar, so I guess I could call the police and give them his description and tell them he has drugs on him. He'd probably go to jail as he already has a record. I just want to help my friend. She's been on this relationship for months and I worry for her. He doesn't have a job and she pays everything for him. He has no education or any perspectives of getting a life.<|response|> YWBTA. The police aren’t your personal revenge dealers. Your friend knows her bf is a piece of shit. Obviously she is ok with that. Maybe she shares some of his views. Maybe not. Mind your business. <|endoftext|>
142866	1	AITA for defending my best friend Steven by exposing a fake baller friend? For context, we all graduated a couple years ago from the same college. Recently, we reunited in Las Vegas for EDC 2019. Now, EDC offers a few different ticket options, and Steven(M25) along with a few others expressed right off the bat that they had the budget for only the general admission. Respecting their choice, the rest of us obliged. It really wasn't that big of a deal. Cue the night before the first day of EDC when we all arrive. Now, another friend Derek(M26) has had a grudge against Steven due to them rushing the same Frat in sophomore year, and Derek not getting in. Derek is a fake baller type of person. The majority of our friends group came from affluent families and had high paying tech jobs (We were all CS grads from a top 3 school) , and as a result a good chunk of us were fortunate enough to afford our dream cars out of college, etc. Keep in mind that we didn't do it to flex, but rather because of our passion for cars. Now, Derek( lazy and cheated his way through college, ending up making only about 2/3 of what we made) , in an effort to fit in, bought a 2013 Acura ILX with 90k miles (Keep this in mind for later). He made it a point to rub it in Steven's face as Steven was the only one who owned a non-luxury brand (Brand new 2018 Accord Sport 2.0T in a gorgeous Ocean Blue). In addition, Derek resorted to repeatedly blaming Steven for keeping us from buying VIP tickets and that he was living a peasant life. These remarks always made things awkward for the rest of us, and the last straw for me was on the third night when we were deciding how to carpool to a club on the strip. We needed to take three cars, and the last car choice ended up being between Steven's or Derek's car. We decided the Accord was a better choice due to it being larger in size. Derek straight up says, "wtf, why would you want to take the Honda?" in a snobby voice. I lost it, and went to town on Derek, telling him that he should shut up about his used ass rebadged/restyled Honda civic that he bought for 10 grand tops. I also pointed out how one could literally buy 3 of his car for one Accord, so he shouldn't be talking shit. I also told him he literally bought the ILX because it was the only 'luxury' vehicle one he could afford to buy and maintain in the first place, and that he had no business talking about other people's car choices period. If anyone was a peasant, it was him, trying hard to look rich, and that he wasn't fooling anyone. This was the first time that someone had put him down, and I really felt I had to do it as I couldn't stand to<|response|> ESH all this over cars? jesus christ <|endoftext|>
122	3	AITA for disagreeing with my boss over my apparent responsibility towards reimbursing a customer who shoplifted $150 of smokes? I'll keep this vague, since as of yet I don't wholly know whether a crime has been filed with the police and whether or not my employer wishes to follow through with his initial inclinations. All I know is that yesterday, Saturday the 3rd, a customer at the convenience store/small mom-and-pop sized pharmacy I cashier/stock at walked out with two ~$75 cartons of cigarettes an zoomed off in his still-on car. I was the attending cashier, but the carton theif made particular certainty to distract both another clerk and I with several legitimate questions on price an expiration. He claimed he wanted his mother to decide between the two separate brands, but took the cartons in hand toward the door. I joked with my coworker that it would be startling funny if he just left while we examined his other potential purchases; when he actually did this both my fellow clerk and the one attending pharmacist raced out to stop him, but to no avail. I remained inside as other patrons were still in the building. Now, with the position that my placing of the cartons on the cashier tables was negligible, my manager said both over the phone and in a conversation with the aforementioned clerk after I left Saturday afternoon that the $150 and change lifted ought to be redacted from my upcoming paycheck, the equivalent of about 3 of the 5 hour shifts I do on days I work. At no time in my training was I informed that this was to be avoided; I've been working there for about a month without any similar incident occurring. I still have yet to speak with him in person, or be enlightened on the extent of his and the owner's pursuit of law enforcement, but right off the bat I disagree heavily that I was culpable enough to be more or less fined the lost cost for my inability to spot and stop a criminal act during work hours. I live in NJ and I have very little knowledge of how a business' liability insurance decides these cases; I'd like very much to soon come up with a rational position to take when I speak with him tomorrow afternoon. AITA for not feeling responsible for my workplace's loss of money and for believing that the owner is capable of recuperating these losses without my reprimanding?<|response|> As far as I'm aware, most (if not all States) have laws preventing companies from doing what yours is threatening. You are not at all the asshole, and I would contact police yourself, as in my mind he's trying to extort you. <|endoftext|>
182058	4	AITA for buying water that I can't carry myself? I live with my boyfriend (B) and a roommate (R). B works 8 hours at a physically taxing job, and R works inconsistent shifts. I am the one who handles grocery shopping for the household because A) I'm the only one who's not exhausted or working on the weekends, and B) I'm the only one with a car to go to the store with. I tend to be a cost-conscious shopper, opting to buy in bulk, or buy cheaper. One think I buy in bulk is bottled water, usually 35 or 40 count packs. Obviously, these are extremely heavy, but each pack lasts the household about 2 weeks, and it's cheaper than buying smaller packs every week. However, I am not a strong person, so I usually need help from a store employee to get the packs into my cart and into my car. B is way stronger than I am, and I often ask his help when I get the big packs of water, or when I have a lot of heavy grocery bags. He used to be fine with helping, but his attitude has changed over the past few months. He made excuses for why he can't help me. "I'm playing co-op in [game] with [friend], I'll do it later." "I'm not feeling good. I'll do it later." "I'm on the phone. I'll do it later." "I was about to shower, I'll do it later." Normally I ask R to help after B says no, but she's not always home, so I have to make two or three trips to get all the bags by myself... But the water is still a problem. We recently had an argument about this. He didn't have a specific reason, but he said he didn't want to help with the bags. I agreed to take care of the bags by myself, but I told him I still need help with the water. I explained to him why I buy such big packs of water, and all he said to that was "Okay, fine." I bought another big pack this past weekend, and told him I need his help. He said he couldn't right now, but he would do it later, so I left it at that. It took him FOUR days of constant reminders and me asking for help before he finally got the water from my car. When he brought it in, he slammed the pack on the floor, then stormed off to our room. I said thank you, but he just grumbled under his breath, and refused to look at me. I don't know if I fucked up. He tells me all the time that I struggle with understanding context, and that I always misunderstand his actions and emotions. So I look to you all for help with understanding. Am I the asshole?<|response|> NTA. I was gonna go with ESH because of the lack of a conversation about why you would need a huge pack of water as opposed to a filter system or a pitcher of some kind, but if B is in a huff and has the nerve to say you don't understand context or don't understand his emotions, especially after he shrugged off your attempts to have a conversation about it, then he's avoiding responsibility, and quite possibly gaslighting. You're doing the work to shop for the household, you deserve to be heard about the trouble you're running in to. (And video games are NEVER a good enough excuse. He's lucky to have you.) <|endoftext|>
25275	4	AITA for naming our group "lonely bitch" and then making all members leave except one? This happened last Wednesday, we are 6 best friends (me and 5 others), one of them, let's call him (Z), didn't even wave when he saw us sitting together, and continued talking to a group of girls he was already sitting with, so we thought as a comeback, we'll just do a harmless joke(my idea), so we named our WhatsApp group "lonely bitch" then left, he tried calling later that day but we ignored him. Next day, prank's over, we tried calling him to let him know that we are going Sushi later that week, but he didn't answer any of our calls or texts, eventually he did answer my texts and I told him it's a joke. He started saying he kept crying that day, and that his old friends abandoned him and that we will never become the same again. He then asked me some really odd questions, such as if i regret introducing him to the others (as they liked him more) and if i was jealous and wanted to ruin it. Of course i denied that because that's simply not true, he himself is one of my closest friends. Now he's just being a dick and not answering any of our calls and messages, last message he sent was "I understand it's a joke, but I'll never be the same again with any of you" and "give me time". We made a new group and added him but he left.. I think he's overreacting to a harmless joke, i mean he also did mean jokes before and I never took them this seriously, but at the same time he appears to be very insecure towards this scenario.. I don't want to lose this dude, he's a good friend, but i was thinking of confronting him on Sunday and telling him how he's overreacting.. Am i the asshole? What should I do to reclaim this friendship? TL;DR: Named our WhatsApp group "lonely bitch" and then made all members leave except one as a joke, the guy took it seriously because of his insecurities and is really mad about it even after telling him that it's a joke. EDIT: you guys are absolutely correct, i fucked up bad.. really bad.. I'll properly apologize to him in person next time i see him. Thank you.<|response|> YTA - Sorry to say it, but you were really mean to someone you say is one of your closest friends. You and your group blackballed him, even if only briefly. and made him feel like an outcast, and then when he was understandably hurt, you're now invalidating his feelings by saying he's overreacting. I'm sure you didn't mean to be that hurtful, and perhaps he did take it too hard, but you can't hurt someone and then choose how they react to it. <|endoftext|>
175007	3	AITA: I make house deposit for one son and fiancée although not my other solitary son Excuse please for my English. I make effort but perfect is no man. I want to start that no man is to demand unearned things! I have two(2) sons. Let us use the names Pawel and Lech. I love both my sons. Pawel is in middle thirtys(30s). He is always solitary in life without company of women. Maybe this is not true but I have have never seen anything arguing against this. Never a woman but I know he is not a warm brother! Lech is end twentys(20s). He has acquired one fiancée. Together for many times they have for a house looked. Together they have a house found and a payment deposit of fifty(50)% I have made. Family and children is traditional and is important to me and a house brings much help. When fiancée happened and for Lechs nameday I have bought a brand new Subabru (very safe!) for children in future to come along. Pawel had with me aggrivated gotten. He had for many times explained over a small apartment to buy. Small home cannot have family! I say to Pawel when he with no family makes a life, then I am not in support of non-traditional choices. If Pawel does want solitary life (no wife + children) then he must support for himself. For only traditional family lifestyle I am comofrtable making support. Let us use Example: Pawel makes work and then is sick and recovers and makes work again but to his life status no betterment. This grants no support! Pawel also argument made for not having car status in equality (over public transport he complains). After this incident where we talked, it has been since four(4) months Pawel has not talked again. My wife makes agreement with me but my brother makes arguement. He talked that to my children I am not making fair choice. Our parents had with us fair choices made. I talked back I have my hard work earned money and that I can spend it with my values. My brother said that I can on the internet put this for the opinion the crowd. Opinion please?<|response|> I think this might be a shit post, but in the off chance it isn't, YTA. Everyone else has covered why. You also shouldn't be basically paying people to create babies, it's disgusting. <|endoftext|>
1829	4	AITA For Being Mad at my Parents for Firing Me (very long) No, I wasn't fired for cause, I was let go when my parents sold the business. My performance was always, to my knowledge, well above average. I worked for my parents for 10 years, so this will be long but I will stick to pertinent points and be as brief and as objective as possible in summing up what has happened. I am now in my late thirties. In my mid twenties, I was looking for a new job. I had quit my job in commercial maintenance. I had my own car, apartment, and a few months of living expenses saved up at the time. I never have asked my parents for anything. They never payed much attention to me after elementary school and I never expected them to send me to college or anything, and they didn't, so I was one who didn't qualify for anything because my parents made plenty of money but neither would they pay for it. No big deal, they aren't required to do it, I am just making it clear that I have never expected much from them. They just didn't talk to me much, and I had stopped calling them in my early twenties because my mom would never answer or call me back. She is kind of anti-social and has never had a single friend that I know of, so I think she also didn't answer a lot of calls, but I don't really know. My dad was basically absent for a few years while they had some marital turmoil. At some point we we started doing family holidays (xmas and thanksgiving) again, though. So, at this time in my mid twenties when I was looking for a job, my dad was needing help at his insurance agency. My mom and dad had lost their entire retirement in the stock market crash, so my dad had started a new business (he had sold his other for all that money they lost). As soon as he bought the business, they lost tons of clients due to taking over right as the company got a big rate hike, and so his revenue was not really enough to pay the bills and properly run the place. To further compound problems, he didn't actually know how to do anything anymore, because it's complicated and there are a ton of changing rules. The one employee and her sister were taking extreme advantage of him, holding him hostage because he couldn't fire them. It was a bad situation, and if the business failed, my dad was too old to start another one. My mom was too old to get hired at a new corporate job. So they both invited me over to talk, and they asked me if I would like to come work for my dad, explaining all of this. So, they asked me what I would need to be paid. And I told them a very small figure. It's what I had made the previous year<|response|> No, but your parents are a pair of pricks. I recommend you file for unemployment immediately, assuming you're in the US, and see if you can still interview for The better insurance position you had the chance at previously. <|endoftext|>
168439	3	AITA for discouraging my daughter to be adopted by my husband My first husband and I got married when we were both 22 years old. He was my high school sweetheart, we were both fresh out of college and in love. We have a daughter a year after when we were 23. She’s 15 years old now. 7 years ago when my daughter was 8 yo my husband passed away in a car accident. We were both so devastated. He was a wonderful husband and father and I still miss him terribly until this moment. 2 years after that I met this wonderful gentleman at church and got married 6 months after. He was a widow in his early 40 and never had a child. Him and his first wife tried for many years but was never blessed with one. His first wife passed away 5 years prior to us meeting each other due to cancer. Being a working single mom was too tough and I was incredibly lonely. And I kinda know him around the church for years just never got close or anything. It’s been almost 5 years of us being together and it has been wonderful. Him and my daughter are super close. Maybe because it was due to the fact that he has always wanted kids but he is really good and close with her. He spoils her to death in a good way and be a very good father figure to her. 3 years ago we were also blessed with having another daughter. My husband doesn’t play favor between his two girls and I can tell that he loves them equally. For the past couple of month my daughter has been showing me heartwarming videos of kids asking their step dad to adopt them. And I was like cool. But for the past month she has been quite persistent asking my permission to allow my husband to adopt her. She wants to change her last name to be his last name. I said if your dad were here he’d be completely devastated. And I honestly couldn’t do that to him even though he’s not around anymore. My daughter said then why did I change my name? And it was hard for me to explain. And I don’t even know how to do the whole adoption thing because I really don’t want her to do it. I’m just putting my shoes if I was dead and my husband remarries. I would want them to be close to the new wife but I want my legacy still. And honestly my first husband was a great dad and it’s not his fault that he can’t be around. So AITA for discouraging my daughter to be adopted by my husband?<|response|> YTA, if your daughter loves your husband enough to want to be considered his daughter that's something you should be ecstatic about. Right now you're kinda saying that even though he loves both of your daughters equally as you claim, that your oldest will never really be his child. You're being an asshole to both your daughter and your husband. <|endoftext|>
121093	3	AITA for rejecting a girl and having a new girlfriend the week after? Gotta admit there's more to it than the title says. Last semester a new girl (lets call her Sarah) joined our school and she was pretty alone which is why i brought her into my friends circle. I've had a girlfriend at that time and noticed that the new girl was crushing on me. She kept a lowkey flirty attitude and said it was all fun and games (i played along sometimes). Throughout the semester we got really close and helped each other out a lot and talked more. Midway through my gf cheated on me and broke up, told the new girl about it and she spend a lot of time with me trying to get through this etc. A week later Sarah confessed her feelings to me but i rejected her since i was still having heart ache from my last relationship. She took it cool and nothing really changed and we kept talking, sometimes pretty flirty. This went on for 2 more months till the semester was over. At the last day of school we went into a nice bar and spend about 4 hours just talking on and on. Sarah eventually asked me if i could imagine being in a relationship with her but i took quite some time to think of what to say. She rephrased her question and asked if i want to move our relationship into more of a friend level or into a closer one. I told her that i would rather be friends for now since I'm still pretty fucked up from my last relationship. Although it looked like she died a bit on the inside, she was still happy to talk to me and nothing really changed. We had a week of holidays in which we still texted each other but never really managed to meet. The first two weeks of school she even helped me to make my own schedule and she helped me with some other school stuff as well. A few weeks later on a weekend i was out with friends and met a new girl(lets call her Kate), it was more or less love on first sight but i couldn't bring myself to tell Sarah about her. I was at Kate's place and got to know her parents and we eventually got together, Sarah didnt know anything about it and we still kept talking. A week ago on Monday i went to school with a bunch of love bites on my throat/neck and Sarah noticed, quite visible sad but didn't say anything. We still talked but she seemed rather depressed whenever she saw me. On Wednesday we stood outside and another friend of mine came and asked me about Kate while i was standing next to Sarah. Sarah just walked away and i haven't spoken to her in about a week and dont really know what to do. Am i the asshole? Sorry for the textwall and for my grammar. Edit: The reason for this<|response|> YTA. Im not saying you should have gone out with her, but using being fucked up from your relationship as an excuse leads her to think that you do love her, you just need time. You should have told her a straight up no if you didn’t have feelings for her. <|endoftext|>
102864	4	AITA for not being friendly to my coworker who makes me feel uncomfortable? I am 24. She is either 32 or 34, I can't remember. We work in a small retail environment, and I am manager. I don't really boss people around, so a lot of times it's more of a seniority thing than an actual position. But technically I am her boss, and it's kind of awkward when she's almost ten years older than me. Anyway, she has worked for the business for a few months. My first impression of her was positive, but it quickly went south. Numerous times she touched me, such that if the genders were reversed it would probably be considered mild sexual harassment. She doesn't seem to understand the concept of personal space either. She is also just really socially awkward. Think Michael Scott, but with less charm and lovability. When I have her do something she doesn't want to do, she says "Ugh you're such a butt!" (1996 insults, anyone?) She also makes jokes like "I bet you missed me a lot, didn't you" and "I'm going to hit you" which also make me feel uncomfortable. I don't respond positively to these jokes, yet she keeps making them. It's gotten to the point where even being around her is stressful. Like really stressful. I normally try to be friendly with all my coworkers, but when I'm friendly to her, she starts these endless nonsensical conversations with me that I really, really, don't want to have, and with her personal space issues, I feel like I'm backed into a corner. My workspace is a desk with only one opening, so sometimes it's literal. If she has any work related questions or comments, then I answer them normally. However, if she asks me questions about my personal life ("Do anything fun this weekend?") I answer evasively to make the conversation over as quickly as possible. I feel like a dick for not being nice to her, and I've made an effort to not be explicitly *mean* to her. I believe that all people should be treated with love and respect, and I'm having a hard time doing that with her. I'm trying to act the absolute bare minimum of respect/civility. I just really don't want to socialize with her or be her friend. I've worked at this business for a few years now, and I've loved all of my coworkers before her. So I'm thinking it's not just me.<|response|> You are not the asshole. You don't have to be friends with your coworkers. It's great when you can be friendly, and it sounds like you've been close to co-workers​ in the past. The minimum you have to do is be professional regarding work matters. It sounds like you already are, and have set boundaries for your personal life. What complicates this is you are technically her manager. Your responsibility is to ensure work continues smoothly for everyone under you. Frankly, it wouldn't hurt to have a professional chat regarding her behavior. For all you know, she could be making others similarly uncomfortable. It wouldn't hurt to drop a line to HR or your manager as well before chatting with her, see if they have any advice on how to handle the conversation. <|endoftext|>
116650	3	AITA for expressing an ultimatum: go to therapy, or this relationship is over? Asking because in my book, using ultimatums **is** an asshole move. I never thought I'd end up here and it sucks. But as the title says, I gave my spouse that ultimatum because they are unwilling to work on their issues and have made me responsible for helping them out with unfucking their life. That's too huge of a burden, I am not a therapist, despite them treating me as their live-in therapist because I do not work due to disability, and according to them "I also have issues", which is true! Issues for which I have gone to therapy, read books, and improved in other ways even my friends have noticed. My spouse has also noticed I have become a better person, strangely enough. My spouse has tackled the easiest problems so far, with my help. But they refuse to face the fact that I am not a therapist, and I cannot help them overcome the more serious stuff. The more serious stuff has been causing damage between us for years now. How would I even begin to know how to help them with this, I have trouble helping myself sometimes. My spouse has not been able to help with my issues since they are due to chemical imbalances. I am recovering from depression and complex PTSD due to childhood trauma. It's been either me alone, or therapy helping. My spouse also has a history of familial trauma, yet they insist they don't need therapy, they just need me to help them and for me to "be patient". It's been 6 years and we keep having the same fights over and over, over the same things, because they won't get help. I'm at my wits end. I know I do not have it in me to be patient forever. Am I the asshole here?<|response|> NTA. Ultimatums aren't always asshole moves. "Seek help for your heroin addiction or it's over" is perhaps a harsh way of saying "I can't enable your addiction anymore, nor be tied to someone so reckless who will harm themselves or me" but it's effectively the same thing. <|endoftext|>
104045	4	AITA for how I treat my live-in boyfriend's dog, and refusing to get a 2nd dog? Sorry, this turned out longer than I thought. TL;DR at bottom. Some background. I'm 32 and I've never had a pet in my life. For one, I am allergic to cats and dogs. And two, because of my diagnosed OCD, I am obsessive about having a clean house. It's difficult for me to handle pet hair, slobber, dirty paws, etc. My boyfriend has a 12 year old German shepherd, and we moved in together a few months ago. My boyfriend obviously knows about my allergies and OCD. We talked about it in great length before we moved in, and I agreed to move in with the dog. Even though I don't like having a pet, I do my best to make sure he's taken care of. I work from home, so I've basically become the dog's primary caretaker. I always make sure he has food and water, I let him outside regularly, I take him to the park every day (weather permitting), and brush him every day. Beyond that, I've started taking extra allergy and OCD medication to lessen my symptoms. I spend about 1.5 hours every, single day cleaning the house to get rid of any pet hair or dirt that he dragged in. It's been a difficult adjustment for me, but I don't complain because I love my SO and knew what I was getting into. Here's the AITA part: I do not display any affection for the dog because I honestly hate living with him. I don't pet him, I don't give him treats, I don't play with him. I am not mean or abusive by any means. He's never in a cage or tied up. I make sure he gets everything he needs, but other than that I prefer to ignore him. However, my SO regularly gets upset with me for not petting or cuddling with the dog. When we're watching TV, he'll call the dog over and insist that I pet him. Or try to hand me a treat to give to the dog. When I say I don't want to, he gets upset with me. I've explained that touching the dog or food/treats triggers my OCD for cleanliness. He just says I'm being mean, and that I need to treat the dog nicer. He gets upset that I don't greet the dog when we come the door. Beyond that, he now wants to get another puppy, and is mad that I said absolutely no. I feel like he doesn't appreciate how much I've compromised and adjusted already. I don't think it's fair that he inisists I have an emotional attachment and show affection to the dog. I think my allergies and OCD are acceptable reasons to not want to pet him or get another dog. I especially don't want another puppy because I work from home. AITA? TL;DR. I don't like pets. I'm allergic and have diagnosed OCD. I recently moved in with my SO and his dog. I work<|response|> I don't think you're an asshole for not having a desire to emotionally connect with the dog. I do think you're an asshole for ignoring something that might make you and your boyfriend incompatible for living together. He is, too \- if you were clear about how much you were going to hate it and how much it was going to affect you. If you led him to believe it would be okay if you upped your medication and that you could make it work, then that's extra assholish. You also agreed to make these compromises but are resentful of the animal every day, which isn't really fair but also is setting yourself up for a few years if not a lifetime of misery \- either you will be miserable because eventually you give in and he gets another dog, or he'll be miserable because he wants another dog and you say no. Your medical conditions are completely justifiable reasons to not have a pet \- trying to ignore them so that you can have the other things you want is not reasonable at all. People who keep pets don't just keep one pet. He's probably going to always want a dog around. That's probably why he's thinking about puppies now \- a 12 year old dog doesn't have too many years left. If you truly never want another pet after this one has gone, you need to make that clear now and have a serious talk about it. <|endoftext|>
366	3	AITA for drunk banging my best friend's Ex? A couple days ago I went over to my mate's house for a little kickback. A few other people were there, including an Ex of his. They were on good terms, or so I thought (Why would she be invited if she wasn't?). Anyway we all have a bit too much to drink and next thing I know I'm making out with this girl. Me and this girl were never super close, but we definitely had history. Mostly through the mutual friend hosting the party. Things got out of hand, one thing led to another, you get the picture. After the party she leaves the next day for some family vacation. Now, he wouldn't outright say he was mad. Initially when I told him he said it was "fucking hilarious" and that he actually wasn't mad. I believed him and agreed to chill with them the next day. I hang out with my friend and his new girlfriend, and they're both giving me a lot of shit for having sex with his Ex. Making jokes in really bad taste, asking really prodding details (He knows I don't like bragging about any sort of escapades). Not your typical "How'd it go" shit, but like really personal questions. Like to the point where they're actually making uncomfortable and having me look for an excuse to leave. I don't regret what I did, but I felt like I could've gotten the OK from him before all this happened. In that regard, I may be the asshole. But the way he acted towards me was inexcusable. Seriously unlike I've ever seen him in our six years of being best friends. It was backhanded, mean, and so unlike the guy I know. The only reason I could see him being so upset over this situation is if he wasn't over his Ex. Him and the new girlfriend of his have talked about moving in together, and his Ex was at the party by invitation. Was I the asshole for doing what I did based on the situational queues?<|response|> You left out pretty much the most important piece of information... how long ago did they date? edit: Actually, when's the last time THEY hooked up? <|endoftext|>
167421	3	AITA. My dad wants me to put a sticker on my car. I don’t want to. TLDR; at the bottom My father, who is a priest, mentioned that he has a new sticker from his church for me to put on my car ( or what he refers to as “my [his] car that I [he] lets me drive”). I just don’t see the point in me having this on my vehicle. I do have a sticker from the school I go to so I’m not against stickers in general. **edit** the sticker is the church logo and it has a number on it. **it is also his car. He pays for it, etc etc** TLDR; my dad wants me to put a sticker on my car. I don’t want to.<|response|> Sorry, but as HE pays for the car and it is HIS car, he can wrap the car entirely with advertisements and paint the rest of it 'Glory Pink' if he wants to. YTA - You want to drive a car without your dad's input. Get a job, buy a car and insure it, and you're golden. <|endoftext|>
53391	4	WIBTA if i blocked my now ex-friend from contacting me because i think she'll ask for the six flags tickets i got her So I've had this really toxic friend for 10+ years now. She would complain that i never cared enough about her and would get mad at me if i wasn't texting her 24-7. It felt like I was in a relationship always trying to make her happy even if it meant i wasn't happy. Today she told me that she "doesn't want to be friends anymore" which was a breathe of fresh air for me. I don't have a backbone so even though i knew our friendship was very toxic i felt as if i couldn't leave the friendship for whatever reason or another. but anyways her birthday was last Wednesday and i surprised her with tickets to six flags which she was always telling me she wanted me to take her. Her partner also bought tickets for the day but since i bought hers she doesn't have her own ticket. WIBTA if i blocked her number and her partners number to deter her from asking me for the ticket and would i be a bigger a-hole if she DID manage to ask me for the ticket would i be wrong to tell her no and take my partner instead? &#x200B; sorry if this doesn't make much sense.... edit: theyre e-tickets and can only be redeemed by me so even if i gave them to her we'd all still have to go together because it's my name on the ticket not hers<|response|> Oooooof. This is tough. I'm gonna say NTA. I think if she decided to end your friendship without getting the ticket you had planned to gift her first, she is effectively ceding her claim to it. That being said, it sounds like this is someone you should block, ticket or no ticket. Be glad they are gone from your life and don't give them a chance to weasel their way back in. <|endoftext|>
155669	4	WIBTA if i cancelled our adoption? i don’t know where to start but i guess i’ll start by saying my husband and i have been trying to fall pregnant for nearly 5 years. i had twins at 20 (the father is not my husband) and after that i was told it would be hard to fall pregnant again (because of some other issues i had, as well as issues with my twin pregnancy). the twins are now 12 for info. about a year ago we decided to just stop and look at other options. ultimately we decided against ivf etc. and go down the route of adoption. we put in our papers and everything and we were selected by a pregnant teenager with twins. it was surprisingly fast how we got picked (according to our lawyer) and we were so over the moon as well as my older twins. last week we found out i’m pregnant. i’m almost 22 weeks so we found out very late. i wasn’t on birth control because of horrible side effects and the doctor told me i should be fine. the twins are due in nearly 10 weeks but the doctor has told us that he will likely want to induce her nearing 32-35 weeks. if we cancel the adoption now i could not imagine what this poor teenage girl would go through. we talked to our lawyer and because of some law things that she probably will not be able to put the twins up for adoption until after they are born now. once the twins go up for adoption it could take up to a year for the twins to actually be taken off her. she has no baby equipment, anything etc. to prepare for these twins. wibta if i cancelled our adoption? tl;dr: hubby and i are planning to adopt newborn twins who are due in 2-5 weeks but we just found out i’m also pregnant. wibta if i cancelled the adoption?<|response|> YTA. It’s hard and it may seem unfair, but you made a commitment to that young girl, and she is relying on you. With you walking away from the adoption, that girl is going to face even more trauma than she was already going to go through, the babies are going to go through even more trauma than they were already going to go through, You’re the only one who walks away with no pain. It’s what’s going to happen, obviously, but it’s horrible. <|endoftext|>
50727	2	AITA for not watching some random kid? (btw, congrats to everyone on 1m potential assholes!) &#x200B; This is a lot crazier than my last stupid little post, so let's start. So a few days ago, I went to this party. My mom absolutely loves parties and has so many friends that I don't even bother to keep count. It was a birthday for this kid aged 6 at the time of this birthday, so lots and lots of children. Lots of parents as well. I was the only teenager, there was a girl who looked around 11 but that was the highest. So I'm goofing around on the playground, cause the party is in this public park with a giant playground, and I climb up to the very, very high slide and wait behind these two girls. There are around 5 kids in all using the slide, though most are at the bottom. There's a adult up there, probably the mom, sitting on her phone, obviously watching the kids. The man at the bottom is also watching, probably the father. The younger girl (possibly 5?) asks the slightly older girl to push her, and so she does. I assumed that since this kid is around five, she would be fine, right? Nope, she slides down and when the sliding sound of skin against metal stops, the girl is screeching. The mother asks to go in front of me and quickly slides down. I follow shortly. The girl doesn't look too banged up, just a few bruises and a scrape, and her parents are cleaning her up. I awkwardly shuffle away to my mother, who has witnessed the whole thing. She tells me that I should have at least told the girls to be careful, but I think that's totally unfair, since there are at least 20 adults here, why am I supposed to do that? But at the same time, I feel really bad about it. I really don't think I'm the asshole, but I have this nagging feeling. Help?? I just want to see what y'all think. &#x200B; Also, later we ate cake. I tried to give some to the kid, but the flavors were ube and pandan, which makes the cake colors purple and green, respectively. Most of my mom's friends are Filipino. She didn't want it. Probably freaked her out.<|response|> NTA You said the mother was right behind you, yeah? She didn't predict the future of her own kid - why on earth would you be expected to? <|endoftext|>
38753	3	AITA for removing my co-worker's drink from the microwave to microwave my own drink? Today I when I was entering the break room in my workplace where the amenities, coffee, drinks, snacks, and microwaves, are located, I saw that the drink currently being microwaved was just about to finish, about 5 seconds left on the clock. So I waited in front of the microwave and when it finished, I removed the drink, placed it on the counter next to the microwave and placed my own drink inside to microwave. As I started to microwave my drink one my co-workers who was in the break room came up to me with a very annoyed look and just ask, "Seriously?" and just stared at with an offended/annoyed attitude (hard to tell). I wasn't sure what she wanted since the only thing she said was "seriously" so I asked her if it was her drink. To which she responded that she was going to microwave it again. I had already begun microwaving my drink at that point and since it was just water it was going to be like a short 45 sec microwave. But she had this annoyed/offended look so I just took out my drink and left her to use the microwave. So TL;DR AITA for removing my coworker's drink and using the microwave immediately after the previous timer had finished. I think she was standing near the microwave while her drink was microwaving but I didn't notice her until after I had begun microwaving my drink.<|response|> NTA - don’t walk away from your food, especially if it’s a short cycle like heating a drink. Your time is not more valuable than anyone else’s. Making them wait for you to get back is rude. Might be five seconds might be five minutes. They have no way of knowing. If you can’t be arsed to stand there for thirty seconds while your mug heats you don’t get to demand they stand there for thirty seconds while the microwave stands there idle. <|endoftext|>
34929	3	AITA for not producing I.D. to a stranger on a public street? I’m on mobile, so if there are formatting issues, sorry. For starters, I’m a PM for a large contractor in CA. I regularly make residential visits for inspections. In today’s case, I was in the bay area of CA, in a neighborhood where crime is a bit higher than other neighborhoods. I arrived ten minutes early, as I always do, and parked on the street in front of the home in which I had an appointment. The clients agent had not yet arrived, to kill time, I began to respond to some work emails on my phone. I had the feeling I was being watched, so I looked up, and right there at my drivers side window was a young woman, just standing there, staring at me. Smoking. (Not particularly relevant. I’m an ex-smoker, I typically tried not to invade peoples space while I smoked). I rolled the window down and asked a bit apprehensively if I could help her, and from the get go she was a bit animus and hostile: Her: “Who are you?!” Me: “my name is X, again, can I help you?” Her: “uh, I’m a resident of this neighborhood and I’m asking who you are” Me: “I’m a contractor, and I have an appointment at this home” Her: “this home? This home is vacant” Me: “that might explain why my appointment is with a realtor...” Her: “people have been breaking into homes here and I don’t believe you, show me your identification” Me: “ absolutely not. You can have one of my business cards if it makes you feel safer” Her: “just forget it, I’m not the cops and you’re obviously going to be a dick about this. I can’t make you “ Me: “that’s correct” At that time, my clients agent arrived, and the hostile resident began shaking her head, muttering something inaudible and walking away. I grabbed my tools and clipboard, stepped out of my truck, and hostile resident looks back at me from across the street. At this time I asked “is this sufficient proof?” To which she responded “you’d feel differently if it was your home being broken in to” I said “you’re right, but I also wouldn’t immediately and rudely accuse every unfamiliar individual I see” Her final comment struck me off guard “oh so now you’re going to be a typical white male and brutalize me? Fuck you” I get her position, if she’s being truthful anyway. But I believe she didn’t do herself any favors in being an absolute dick in the way she decided to ask. If she had been civil at all, I may have even obliged her request for ID, but given her accusatory and hostile tone from the on-set, I wasn’t in any mood to actually comply. AITA?<|response|> NTA "Brutalize"?? Gimme a break. You don't have to show her your ID and she was pretty aggro about it. If she was just nicer and less hostile the whole situation would have been way different. <|endoftext|>
175091	3	AITA for asking my roommate to pay more towards the heating bill compared to my other roommates and I Hi friends - I’ve had a frustrating past few months living with a certain roommate. I live in a small apartment with two other girls, let’s call them Anna and Sam. We live in the middle of Wisconsin, so this time of year our apartment requires quite a bit of heat to stay warm and comfortable. At the beginning of the winter season us three roommates got together and discussed how we could ensure the heating bills stayed reasonable the next few months. We decided we would continually heat the kitchen and family room, as that is where we are the majority of the time, and that it was up to each of us to heat our rooms ONLY AT NIGHT/or when we are home. Our apartment is set up where each room is set to its own thermostat, so we can individually decide when to turn on/off the heat to our rooms. A few weeks into the cold weather, Anna goes into Sam’s room to feed her fish while she is gone for the weekend, and she finds Sam has her thermostat cranked up to 80 degrees. We become quite suspicious, and then begin to check every few days (when she’s not around) to see if there is heat coming from the crack of her closed door. I kid you not, her room is a SAUNA. Ultimately, this means even when Sam is NOT HOME, her room is constantly being heated. Meanwhile, Anna and I have yet to turn on our rooms heat even ONCE, as it has not yet been unbearably cold. This months bill came in and it is quite expensive. Would Anna and I be the assholes for asking Sam to pitch in more money? Is there anyway to determine just how much money she used by heating her room constantly? What is the best way to address this situation?<|response|> Last month is what it is, but it costs approx. 25 cents per hour to run one of those room heaters. 24 x 30 . 25 =... Almost 200 bucks just for that room, maybe more. Have a roomies meeting and present the numbers, and give her the choice. Does she want to pay more, or control the heat, because this is unacceptable. <|endoftext|>
128241	3	WIBTA for asking out a guy I rejected years ago? So I rejected this guy in middle school for no particular reason other than the fact that my parents didn’t want a middle schooler to start dating (good call tbh). I did tell him at the time that I like-liked him because we were so close as best friends, we told each other everything. The thing is, my parents don’t want me to date til college/after college. However, the next year, I was like “fuck it” and I dated this amazing guy for 5 months because I was lonely lol. I digress that yeah that was kinda an asshole move of me. At that time, my best friend started distancing himself from me (biggest heartbreak of my life) My bf and I broke it off though because he was going to a different school and I didn’t want to do long distance. So fast forward, I’m in high school and I have been trying for a while to reconnect with my best friend again. We play Tabletop Simulator on the weekends now :). But it’s clear that our friendship will not be like what we had, which is real sad. The spring fling of our school is coming up, but would it be a bad idea to ask my friend out despite rejecting him? Edit: I really appreciated the replies and I think I have somewhat of a consensus. Furthermore I must confess something...I’m definitely not his first when he like liked me back in middle school. The story is a bit complicated so my wording may not be crystal clear. basically back in middle school, he was trying to choose between me and my really really good friend (the three of us were basically a trio friend group) and while yes I liked him back, I knew he was happier with the other girl (In hindsight, I was right. Him being with her was prob the happiest I had ever seen him) However, my best friend had to break it off with her for the same reason I broke it off with my bf; school troubles. So it wasn’t like I left him in the dust buttttt I still agree with the people that said that I was the asshole back then. Completely true. The great thing about our friendship was that I helped him through his breakup and he helped me through mine. I feel like me and him drastically changed and have become more mature since those middle school days. My consensus is that I’ll give asking him out a shot but I don’t want to pursue a relationship. I want to wait until way later if me and him are still friends and I want him to be cool and comfortable with a relationship. For now, consider us friends. I hope that clarifies some stuff. maybe I’ll do an update post idk yet Edit: grammer?<|response|> Eh, you're NTA right now, but because you acted like TA previously don't be surprised if he says "no". I say go for it. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. <|endoftext|>
45206	3	WIBTA if I didn't want to adopt a cat So long story short, my grandfather passed away and he had a cat. None of my other extended family wanted to take the cat so my parents and sisters have been discussing potentially taking his cat. I am frustrated with this for a few reasons, one being that I have pet birds that have been in my household for 9 years and their safety is my priority, two being that I'm scared of cats, and three being that I think cats are smelly from their litter box and four being that I think our household has enough animals already (a dog, my birds, and a few reptiles). AITA for not wanting to adopt the cat? I suggested that we take the cat in temporarily and try to find it a good home rather then take it to the shelter.<|response|> NAH. Your opinions are valid, but unfortunately it's not your house. And it's a little different because this is your late grandfather's cat, not just any cat. <|endoftext|>
130596	3	AITA for telling a black kid in my class that affirmative action got him into college? Before giving judgement, please read the post. My parents are from China and emigrated to the US when I was seven. Growing up, people often bullied me for my race. They would stretch their eyes out, made fun of my last name, and laughed when I mispronounced words. The white girls in my class would always talk about how pale I was and that I looked like a ghost, while my Asian relatives always talked about how dark I was getting. Also growing up, my parents didn’t make a lot of money; we lived in a crappy neighborhood. People would always make faces when you told them that you lived there, because it’s known for being in the “unsafe part of town”. There’s this kid in my class we’ll call Phil. Phil’s parents live in the very nice part of town. The most expensive house in their neighborhood cost more than all \~20 houses in my neighborhood combined. The average house in it cost $700k+. He always comes to school with new clothes, new shoes, and the newest iPhones. Meanwhile, the most expensive phone I can afford is an iPhone 6. I also work a part-time job after school and on breaks to help pay the bills while he’s never had to work a day in his life. Phil got accepted to Yale with a 32 ACT while I was rejected from all of the HYPs with a 35 ACT (and probably similar GPAs). I wouldn’t have cared that much because I still got into a good school, but he talks about it **everyday**. I try not to seem jealous (even though I kinda am), so I don’t ever tell him to stop talking about it. This is relevant for later. A scandal happened in our school where a fellow classmate posted on his Snapchat story some racist crap at a party where they were saying the n-word. Parents complained, and the kid was suspended for 2 days. Phil said something like “the kid deserved to be expelled for the things he said”, and I defended the kid and said that two days is already harsh, and they shouldn’t suspend him for saying words in the privacy of his own home. He responded that I’ve never faced discrimination, so I couldn’t really have an opinion. I said that’s bullcrap and that he has way more privilege than me, and that being black isn’t all that bad because it helped him get into Yale. He told me to fuck myself and even my friends also say that I was out of line. Meanwhile, I used to get bullied everyday for being Asian. Nobody would say racist things to the black kids because teachers actually gave a shit about the black kids. I’ve actually experienced true hardship because of my race and class, and he was basically born into privilege. Maybe I just lack perspective, but he doesn’t really seem to be suffering because of his race, but<|response|> YTA. He is a bit because of his comment about you never having faced racism, but that's only a drop compared to your bucket of dickishness. You seem very bitter about him getting into Yale while you had a better score than him (I'm not American, I assume ACT is just the test score you ended school with right?), but if I'm not mistaken a lot more goes into getting into a school like Yale than just scores and race. You have no real reason to believe that is what happened (in contrast to, for instance, him *nailing* his interview for it). You just sound racist. <|endoftext|>
102474	3	AITA for slamming the door in my neighbor's face? This is a little convoluted so as background information, I live in a very small HOA run community. Our rules state that no resident may park in a way that could impede another from exiting/entering their residence. Everyone tries to be courteous but we only have one car spot in the 2 car garage (since our washer and dryers and water heater are located in the garage and state law says a barrier to prevent a car hitting the any of that must be in place before a car may be parked on that side of the garage). We also have a parking lot of 11 spaces for 12 units that is always packed. So this all started the day my boyfriend and I moved into our new house. Now, I grew up in the South and maybe things are different in other places, but generally you welcome new neighbors to the neighborhood. We bought a house in California and day one, while we're moving in, our neighbor comes over and tells us not to park in the left spot in front of our garage because she has trouble pulling out of her garage if a car is there as the houses sit perpendicular to eachother. No hello, no introduction, no welcome to the neighborhood, just "Don't park there." Okay....nice to meet you too. Of course, I don't want to make a stir, because I'm not one to cause a scene so I just smile and ensure her we'll make sure not to park there. And we don't. It's super inconvenient for us because at the time we had three cars so one goes in the garage, one on the right side of the drive and the third just has to hope there's a spot open in the parking lot. We've lived here for over a year now. Twice a car was parked there out of necessity (my boyfriend) because there were no spots available. The first time, she came over and asked that we move the car. And I moved it for her right then and appologized. The second, much later, I left the house to get the mail and she is standing there waiting and starts yelling at me about needing to leave her house and having to wait on me. Apparently she had rung our doorbell, which had broken a week prior so I had no idea she was waiting for me to move my car. Why she didn't knock, I have no idea. I have dogs and they would have barked a few times if someone knocked so I know she didn't. My boyfriend had moved my car to do some work in the garage and forgot to tell me so I had no idea there was a car in her way. Her attitude was passing me off but I again apologized and moved the car for her, very politely. Now I want also add that this lady leaves her house maybe once a month and a car in<|response|> I can't tell from your description if the spot you're talking about is in front of her garage, if so, then you shouldn't park there, correct?? <|endoftext|>
14540	4	AITA for making my dad pay tip? Title is pretty self explanatory. Dad wanted to take his girlfriend and I out to eat. Went to a really nice family run Cantonese restaurant, the staff were friendly, the food was great and they even gave us a complimentary dessert. At the end my dad paid and I noticed he didn’t leave a tip and I called him out on it, I would’ve left a tip but he said he was paying for the meal so I didn’t bring my wallet and I would assume that paying would include the tip? Anyway after calling him out he left a tip but was mad at me for the rest of the night, am I the asshole here?<|response|> NTA, don't offer to take people out to eat and then expect them to pay. Good on you for calling him out on the lack of tip. When people don't tip, often times the server has to take a loss because they owe other tipped staff a percentage of their total sales. <|endoftext|>
33080	4	AITAH for not moving in with a friend? Hi folks, looking for some perspective on this situation. Personally I feel like TA and am wondering what I can do to make it better? I recently started a new job in a new city (Feb 2019). Since starting, I've been commuting (1- 1.5 hours there and back). This isn't a new city to me - I have friends who still live there, including my friend "S" who is one of the kindest people I've met. (She's my friend's older sister's BFF but we all hang out together) S and I were talking about apartment hunting; how places are either in bad areas or expensive - a friend mentioned she was looking casually at apartments too. I ended up asking her if she would be interested in looking for places together, emphasizing that there was no pressure for her to say yes. She did end up saying yes but said she was fine if I continued looking for something for myself too. It turned out harder than I thought to find something that fit for both of us. S has been living in her current apartment for years and has a very low rent (less than $1000). She didn't want to go higher than what she was currently paying, while my budget was a bit higher. I had been sending S a bunch of apartments while she was travelling for work (for most of March 2019) I wasn't getting a lot of responses (possibly because of her travel schedule at work). This made it pretty hard to actually look and secure something. I felt that it wasn't a priority for S - she had somewhere to live that worked for her, but for me it was a bit more urgent. While travelling, S offered me her apartment to stay in, which I took her up on and even asked to pay for her month's rent (she refused). Because she didn't let me pay her for staying, I ended up doing a really nice gift basked of things she likes ($150+) and planned to take her to dinner. In the end I found my dream apartment and after getting some friend's input, I ended up asking S if it was alright if I went for the apartment and she was fine. I feel like a jerk because she put me up in her apartment and I feel that I kind of bailed on her. We have't had a chance to hang out (conflicting schedules) but a friend's husband made a joke about how it was a jerk move to bail on her - which makes me think I was TA. Am I the asshole? What else could I do for her to say sorry/thank you? TLDR: Moving to a new city and asked a friend if she wanted to move in together. I ended up finding my dream apartment, and after her OK went for the new apartment solo. AITA?<|response|> NAH. Your gift basket was a very thoughtful gesture. S would have had to pay rent whether you were there or not. S was ok with you looking for something for yourself while also looking for a place to split. You may be over-analyzing, but if you still have guilt, definitely take S for a nice dinner. Quit feeling so guilty! S did a kind gesture and most likely isn't keeping score. <|endoftext|>
167776	5	AITA for not going to my uncles funeral I’m sensitive and I can’t handle seeing people cry or else I’ll break down. The last funeral I went to was open casket and I had to see the body and now the only thing I remember bout my grandma is her body in the casket, my sister keeps trying to make me feel bad about going and I’m starting to thing what I did was wrong.<|response|> NAH Edit: even though I can't grasp this concept, I don't really think it's fair to call you an asshole for it. If someone dies and their loved one says I need you there but you don't go cuz it will make you too sad, then I'd say YTA. I can't grasp this concept. Someone posted something similar last night. Funerals are for the living but they're for EVERYONE living. Not just you. People constantly say "I don't do well at funerals" around me and I don't get it? No one likes funerals. But death is a fact of life and sometimes you may have to do something that makes you slightly uncomfortable. If one of your close friends says my mother died, I need you at the funeral. Are you going to say no because I'm uncomfortable? If you don't want to view the body, then don't. I'm sorry I just don't understand. <|endoftext|>
104720	4	AITA for chewing out my old man? As a little background my father basically abandoned his first family (me and two brothers) when he got remarried to the point where my mom had to take him to court so he would help pay for my brothers college but gave his stepdaughter his house when he moved to Florida. This week I found out he had been in town for two weeks from one of his friends but has spent all the time with his stepdaughter and “grandchildren”. I told him he was a shithead for not even telling me and spending time with his fake grandchildren instead of his actually kids, not to mention he never asks about my daughter (who’s now ten). I then went on to chew him out about being a shit father and basically warning him that if he kept it up he would die alone and brought up the fact his own mother wrote him out of her will because of how shitty a parent he was, giving us his inheritance instead. It was a lot of stuff that needed to be said, but I feel kind of bad about it. I don’t even care that he’s more “generous” with his new family, I’m just annoyed that after age 16 (I’m now near thirty) my old man just started acting more like an uncle who only checks in on occasion, before he got married again we were best friends. Am I the asshole / did I go too far?<|response|> Not an asshole in any way. Sounds like your dad got what he deserved and I can’t blame you one bit for snapping at him. I hope he realizes what he has done before it’s too late, it’s not already. I’m really sorry you had to get to that point though. <|endoftext|>
139918	4	AITA for not going with my GF to help find a stray dog? We were heading out to a ranch party (aka in the middle of bum fuck nowhere). Just a place where a couple of young people to be as loud as possible and drink a shitton. On our way there, we passed a poor looking dog roaming the streets near the highway/freeway. I felt bad, but not as nearly as her as she is a very big animal person. Her: "should we help him?" Me: "how? where would we take him? Also we're like 60% done with our journey to the ranch, would we bring him back there?" Basically just me being kind of calculated and not appealing to emotions. I understand she's very caring so I tell her not to worry and sure he'll be fine. We reach the ranch 30 mins later and she tells me shes going back to try and find the dog. I'm a little peeved, but also sympathetic, but I decline to go. All of our friends ask where she went after she dropped me off. I told them she was going to find a stray dog we saw a whole back. She comes back an hour or two later with no dog, AITA for not going with her to find the dog? Tldr; I go on journey. I see poor dog on journey with gf. I go aw. She go AWWW. She want help dog. I no help. We go party. She feel bad. She go back to help dog. I stay<|response|> I’m gonna say NAH. I’m a big animal lover too so I understand where she is coming from, but unfortunately it’s not always feasible to help a stray animal if you are away from home, don’t have anywhere to take it, etc <|endoftext|>
140755	2	WIBTA if I tell my boyfriend that I don’t want us to be in the same professional field because his accomplishments make me feel insecure? My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. He’s kind, thoughtful, fun to be with and very intelligent, in the lazy genius kind of way. In college we took a bunch of classes together, and while I spent hours upon hours studying to eventually get a 3.9 GPA, he played video games and watched Netflix. His GPA was 3.8. I was proud that he could get that GPA without even studying, but at the same time, part of me felt disheartened that I spent so much effort to achieve something that he was able to achieve almost effortlessly. This continued when we started reviewing for the LSAT. He got great scores for his initial tests, while I got not so great scores. I was honestly happy for him, but I also felt insecure about the whole thing. For the last few weeks, the only thing I could think about is what I would do if he gets into to the school we want and I don’t. Which is a very realistic possibility. Yesterday I suddenly thought that I don’t want to go to law school anymore. I'm still thinking about it, but right now I feel like I just want to take another career path, one that’s different from my boyfriend’s, so that I won’t feel pressured or insecure about his accomplishments. I will have to tell him that I've decided not to go to law school anymore if that's what's really going to happen, but I don't know if I should tell him the truth or just make up a reason. I want to be honest to him because he is my SO, but wouldn't I just be making him feel that his accomplishments are bringing me down if I do? Edit: I know that there are always going to be people who are better than me and there are always going to be lazy genius types in every field. I don't feel the insecure about other people's achievements, just with my boyfriend's.<|response|> NAH I think you’re better off working on your insecurities than anything else in this situation. <|endoftext|>
117256	3	AITA for asking my twin sister for asking why she never wished me a happy birthday, a week after our actual birthday? So on Monday, February 25, my twin sister and I turned 20 years old. We are both in college, although she lives on campus at hers, which is about two hours away. I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. This year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?” Her response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??” I’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. Me: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?” H: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.” Me: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.” H: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.” Me: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.” Her: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.” Me: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.” Her: “Whatever.” So AITA<|response|> NTA - she never once apologized or acknowledged that she was a dick. In fact, she got YOU to apologize. &#x200B; She seems emotionally manipulative. I bet she'll make some husband very miserable someday. <|endoftext|>
24521	3	WIBTA If I requested a driving instructor that ONLY speaks english? So I've done all my hours and am doing my test in april, I've set aside money so I can have a driving instructor do a lesson for me every day for a week leading up to the test so I'm as prepared as I possibly can be. I've had one lesson from an instructor and he had a really thick indian accent, and I'm sh*t at understanding accents. The whole lesson I was focusing more on trying to figure out what he was saying rather than actually focusing on the road and driving, which made me feel really unsafe. I didn't learn anything from the lesson (a waste of $60 too, which for a broke student is a hell of a lot of money) and am anxious about driving with another stranger, especially if they have an accent. Anyway, I was going to call a bunch of driving schools today and ask if I can specifically have an instructor that only speaks english, as I don't want a repeat of the last lesson and I don't want to waste my money. Is that an asshole move? TLDR; WIBTA if I asked to have a driving instructor that only speaks english? Edit: I phrased the previous question very badly, as an update, how do I ask for someone with little to no accent without seeming racist or ignorent? I don't want to offend anyone but I also want to be able to understand my instructor<|response|> NTA. As long as you make it known that this isn’t some “personal preference” thing, and you are genuinely concerned for your safety, it’s not an absurd request. You’re a new driver. You need to be able to concentrate as much as possible and understand instructions clearly. <|endoftext|>
17410	2	WIBTA for leaving my girlfriend for getting an abortion? M27 F28, both graduated and have stable jobs. Been together 7 years. So, long story short, I am pro-life. When we learned that she was pregnant(around two weeks ago), I immediately resolved to be there for her and support her through every stage of the pregnancy. Then, two weeks later, she tells me she wants an abortion, because she doesn't want the responsibility of having a child in her life just yet. As it goes against my beliefs, I don't want her to have an abortion. But, I want to respect my girlfriend's right to choose. I want to propose an ultimatum. The abortion or me. I am willing and wanting to sacrifice everything for this child, but if she isn't willing, then I don't want to impede her. I also don't want to be the dick that proposes an ultimatum. WIBTA?<|response|> I feel like this is a bit of a SHP. OP, is this genuine or is it just a front to get everyone riled up about a controversial topic? <|endoftext|>
59652	5	AITA for not wanting to work the week before uni starts? I've (19F) been working at my uni which is \~40 mins away for minimum wage ($10/hr) for the summer MTW; 9-4:30pm. On Thursday and Friday, I shadow at a hospital closer to where I live. The semester starts again the week of the 26th and even though its summer I still feel super tired and I keep waking up in the middle of the night and by the time morning comes, i feel like shit. I don't want to start the semester feeling this depleted of energy, so I set my contract to end this Wednesday, August 14th. When I told my parents about this (i commute from home) they kept on asking why I ended my contract so early and I got frustrated and exclaimed "Because I just want some time off for once!!" and their response was "Oh you want a day off?? Please don't give me that bs" and "i can't believe I raised you to be this spoiled" and "i can't believe you're leaving money on the table". Then they went to tell my sibling who was in the other room and most likely heard everything "you better not grow up to be like her". I can understand why they believe im leaving money on the table but I dont think its unreasonable to end work early in exchange for rest. To me, rest > money. &#x200B; AITA?<|response|> NTA Ask them why they’re taking vacation days from their job. Is it because they need a break? Hmph. Everyone needs a break once in a while. I had class on a Friday Friday, graduated college on Saturday and I went to work on Sunday. I didn’t even have a full 24 hours break. I’m TIRED. I’ve been tired for the last year working this job. All I want is a break but I need the money. Don’t listen to them. Are you paying them rent of any kind or helping with bills? If you can afford to take the week off, do it. Depending on a work schedule and major, it may be a while before you see another truly free (no work, class, homework, internship, errands, etc) day again. My usual advice with sucky families is find a way to support yourself and move out. <|endoftext|>
64460	2	WIBTA if I didn't go to a friends wedding? UPDATE; I replied to to RSVP that I will not be attending. Thanks everyone. Here's the jist of it. I have a friend(F2) that I met through a friend/coworker(F1). I've known this person for probably 4 years or so now, and we've been to parties or events together, but never actually hung out just the two of us. Any time we are around each other its because I was invited by F1. So F2 is getting married, and I honestly was not expecting to be invited to their wedding, but alas, I was. Now generally that would be fine, but the wedding is going to be in the middle of winter in the mountains about an hour and a half away from my house. I do have a capable vehicle and winter tires, but I hate winter driving. Another reason why this sucks is that F1 and I work at a very small company and the likely hood of us both taking (and getting) a day off for this is low. The wedding is on a Sunday which we are closed so in theory I could just go and return that night, but I'm confident that there's gonna be some drinks involved and I am not gonna drink and drive, but I also don't wanna pay for a hotel room. I saw F2 like a week and a half ago, and they reminded me I need to RSVP as soon as possible, and again today I was sent an email to do so. When they saw me they did tell me I better be coming, to which I replied 'maybe'. I can see them being pissed if I don't show up. So WIBTA if I don't go?<|response|> YTA if you continue to delay RSVPing. You’re not the asshole for not wanting to go to the wedding. Let’s be honest, you not being there isn’t going to impact her day one bit. <|endoftext|>
166041	4	AITA for wanting to kick out 23 yo housemate My husband & I decided to rent out a spare room to help ease our finances so we went online & found one who seemed like a good fit. Had C over to get to know him & thought that he was a good fit- young, keen for a job (he'd get welfare from the govt to help him while he's unemployed & that's what he planned to use for rent- jfyi) & seemed like an amicable enough bloke. Asked us to hold his room for 3 mos bc he'd only move in Sept as that was when his folks were moving interstate hence his need to find his own place. We decided to hold it & upon moving in, we noticed C had some odd practices. First, we decided not to do a household cooking where I cook for all of us bc A. We can't afford to feed him on our dime & B. I'm not his mother so why should I C eats NOTHING BUT PIZZA- he'd buy 3 boxes of it, freeze it & eat it the entire week. If he gets tired of it, he eats Heinz beans. Now you must be thinking, "C clearly doesn't eat well, why not offer to feed him?" Did that once & the next day he came out, EXPECTING me to feed him again- bowl in hand. Other odd practices we noticed are: 1. He only bathes & changes clothes every 2 days 2. Talks to us as if WE'RE the ones renting (demanding things like our lease- which is illegal here btw) 3. Insults us (told him a joke I made to a friend & C said to me "I'm surprised YOU are CAPABLE of wit") 4. When he needs help, he'd do a melodramatic act instead of just asking directly (his car broke down shortly after he moved in & when he needed to go to his sister's place wc was a 30 min drive, he went "Ok I'm going. 2 hrs on public transport & having to use a bus & 2 trains.." looking at us while we just watched his poor-me act) The practice that really set me off is his refusal to do the dishes properly. Hubs & I don't use our dishwasher bc we procrastinate & know deep within us that if we used it, it'd take us a long time to unload it so we hand wash all that we use. We explained this to C & he was ok with it until one day I saw him scrape food off the cutlery & plates he used for his pizza with his nails, rinsed it & put it in the rack. NO USING OF SOAP OR SPONGE THAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM. I asked him nicely why he didn't use the soap or the sponge & he said that he scraped off the food so it's clean to which I replied that what he did is the same as me scraping the rice off my<|response|> NTA. This guy sounds like an absolute nightmare and slob. I'm not sure where you're at and what the laws are like, but I would tell your husband that you're 100% done and want to (legally) get him gone. <|endoftext|>
36173	3	AITA for being loud during someone’s presentation? I had to make some business cards for a presentation yesterday. It was an hour before I had to present and I needed to cut out my business cards, so naturally I go to the print lab where the paper cutters are. When I get to the print lab, the lights are dimmed and there is a class using a projector at the front of the lab to give presentations. I didn’t think much of this, as the room is already kind of noisy because of the printer sounds, so I went to the back of the room and began cutting my business cards. About half way through cutting my business cards a person who isn’t a part of the class that was presenting comes up to me and tells me to stop cutting because it’s loud and people are trying to present. I stop for a few minutes and to wait for that person to leave and I begin cutting again and no one else said anything (the class presenting didn’t even seem to notice me). I thought that if a class is presenting in a print lab, wouldn’t they accept that there’s going to be noise from people using the print lab? I wasn’t being abnormally loud when using the paper cutter and I couldn’t really wait for the class to finish presenting. On top of that there’s a room right next to the print lab that has a projector that they could have been using. Am I an asshole for doing this?<|response|> NTA - it's a print lab. It's for work. They don't own the space and likely aren't allotted that space during that time, they chose to have their presentations there. Don't get a massage at a rock concert. <|endoftext|>
44634	3	AITA for kicking my brother out of home? I feel like I know the answer but hear me out. My brother (we'll call him Colm) has an issue with drinking. He's been kicked out of his girlfriend's house, she just had his second kid. I'm living in my Mam's house, which is five minutes walk from Colm's family. For the past year he's been living in my dad's house. Due to his behavior over the drinking and drugs he's not only been kicked out of his girlfriend's but also my Mam's house so his last resort was dad's, which is rough I won't lie. The house isn't very nice, they both are kind of just drinking and living in filth. I've tried everything with my brother but you have to understand that years of addiction takes its toll on not just the individual but also everyone around them. Colm has stolen all my anxiety medication right before my final year college exams, resulting in me missing all six of them because I couldn't control the panic attacks and didn't have enough money to go to the doctor again. Which I'm still kind ofnpissed off at. I worried he's going to affect my repeats because the house is tough when he's here. I know he just wants to be in a house that's clean, with good food and also close to his family. But he's an asshole on drink and has no respect for the house. I just got a scholarship for a Master's and this is a once in a life time opportunity, that I've worked really hard for. This is my ticket out of here. If I don't pass these August exams no scholarship. So I need to stay calm so I don't fuck up again with the panic attacks. My Mam's on holiday for a week and Colm just arrived with a gear bag, all his Washing and says he's staying for awhile. He's smoking joints in the kitchen, having cans and cooking food and it's like almost 2am. I made him dinner, washed his clothes, made him a lunch and prepped his breakfast. Its cool for tonight. But.. I want to tell him to fuck off because he's fucked me over enough and I do enough for him but I think he's trying to manipulate me and make me feel guilty so I let him stay. Am I being a bad sister here? Edit: Fixed spelling of name<|response|> NTA. It sounds like he’s burned a lot of bridges. If he can’t get his act together and be sober and a productive member of the family, why should you support him? <|endoftext|>
11492	3	AITA For reporting my sons father to child support? My son's father and I broke up about 5 years ago. He refused to pay child support so I had the state take over to make sure I got it. The only reason i get child support is because the state takes it from his check. I realized a couple of weeks ago that my child support was late. I called my sons father who insisted it was being taken from his check and there must be a "glitch in the state." Well after a week of all that i called the state. No payment has been made and i also found out he quit his job without another one lined up. This definately puts me in a bad position. I feel as though he could have at least been honest with me. The issue is that after 30 days of nonpayment the state will suspend his professional license. If there is still nonpayment after 60 more days he loses his drivers license. Apparently my ex did not know this when he decided to quit. (And somehow thats my fault too.) I am now being made to feel like a total asshole. My ex, his gf, his family and my family are all running their mouths about what a horrid person i am for telling the state he quit his job. According to all them I am a bitch that is just out to ruin his life. I have nothing to do with this. The state wanted to know why im applying for emergency assistance. So I told them. Im so tired of hearing what a bitch i am tho. What he paid isn't a lot. But it did help. I didn't even have a chance to save up to cover what he isnt paying. Even if he had been honest i would have had to apply for aid and tell the state. I guess i shouldnt have counted on child support but i did. And here i am. The asshole as usual.<|response|> You are not the asshole (think you already know that) and you did right by reporting him. Dad's do that shit all the time to get out of paying and it sounds like exactly what he tried to do. He's a dick. <|endoftext|>
20334	2	AITA for yelling at this kid for staring at me I was getting groceries at stater brothers and this kid kept staring at me. I have gauged ear lobes, a lot of piercings, and I have I'm covered in tattoo's. As a result, it happens. What do you expect? It's just that they usually look away after a while. Nope, he just stared. I told him to look away, he did. He then started going on a trivia spree and asked me one million questions. I answered a few of them but I started becoming sarcastic and impatient after a while. His mom then told me not to be rude because he's just curious. I left the isle, but we encountered each other at checkout. He then started staring at me again, I told him to look away again. This time he did not. As a result, I yelled at him, telling him to not look at me like an alien and to move along. His mother defended her child, as expected and called me a string of curse words. They left, the cashier avoided eye contact and looked uncomfortable. I just don't get how I'm the bad guy here. I encountered that little fucker twice and both times he acted as if I was a foreign species. Warned him both times, I'm not his father so I don't get why I had responsibility for setting him straight.<|response|> Yta. Get over yourself mate, if you're going to have body mods that this kid isn't used to he's going to state. Kids stare. They stare lots and you need to get the fuck over it. If you'd yelled at my kid I'd have cursed you out too. You've got no right to treat another human being with such disrespect when they're just curious. <|endoftext|>
111105	4	AITA for not going to my parents house? So yesterday my dad texted me out of the blue asking when I was going to come over with my kids, and I told him I would soon. And he texts me back and says “see you tomorrow”, so I texted him back and I was like “tomorrow?” And he’s like yes at 4. So I didn’t text him back because I was flustered and confused. So today my mom texts me and asks me if I want to reschedule because of the predicted snow, and that she also asked my sister, (didn’t know my sister was even coming) and so I called her and she said she was going anyways. My daughter does get off the bus until after 4 anyways, so my mom texts me at 430 asking when I’m coming over and I told her I wasn’t coming and my daughter wasn’t even home from school yet. And then she texts me to come after, well my boyfriend has my car right now, so I tell her I can’t. And then she texts me that I’m making her sad because she was looking forward to this all day. I don’t feel like I even committed to coming over, but yet I feel like an asshole.<|response|> NAH. Your Dad probably just wanted to see you and the kids. I don't know your situation or how often you see them but some people leave it way too long. You shouldn't be confused or flustered talking to your Dad. You should have text him back to tell him yes or no. Or to rearrange. <|endoftext|>
184679	4	AITA for cancelling Christmas? Sorry, long story ahead. Back story: My sister (28) and I (F34) have had a rocky relationship. We were best friends and shared a flat for years, but drifted apart, especially since she's been in an abusive relationship and refuses to acknowledge that fact and asks the whole family to play along. I told her I'd like to rekindle our relationship, but don't want anything to do with the guy and we left it at that. The incident: a few weeks before Christmas out of the blue she announces that he's coming to Christmas and I was stunned. The next day she texts me that he'll be joining in with a collective gift from my sister and me. I tell her no thanks and that I kinda have issues with having to celebrate Christmas with her abuser and expected to pretend nothings wrong. She went off on me, dragging up a past relationship of mine that was psychologically abusive, attacking my mental health issues (over a decade of depression and anxiety on top of childhood trauma and spousal abuse) and mocking me for not 'just getting over it'. It got so bad I had to block her for a bit. The aftermath: My partner and I decided we had no choice but to not go. My mother decided to play along with them and when we went to visit the next day (after sis and BIL had left) she kept defending them and she thinks I'm overreacting and should just apologize to keep the peace because I'm the older sibling. I think this could be fixed in the long run, but not without an apology from sis first. I feel like I have nothing to apologize for, but I'm willing to accept my judgement. Being alone at home again after all this I can't help but wonder... Am I the asshole?<|response|> NTA! You are being protective of your younger sister and honestly, YWBTA if you played along and encouraged your sister's dangerous relationship. OP, I am going through the exact same situation right now with my younger sister that I am very close to. Her boyfriend of two months recently put his hands around her neck out of anger and for some reason she has not kicked him to the curb. I know this is going to put a strain on my relationship with my sister, but I can't be friendly to an abuser. When will people learn that they deserve to be loved and valued in relationships! <|endoftext|>
146499	2	AITA for not wanting to help a friend like this? I have this friend; we're awesome buddies who have known each other since high school. He wanted me to help him move and I said "sure, I'll help you." I assumed he needed help packing his bags and furniture into his car and truck. He called me the other day to confirm that I was going to help him. Apparently, he wants me to not only help him and his gf pack stuff, but he wants me to drive over 8 hours out of state to help him unload it also, he wants me to pay for my own hotel, and furthermore, he is not offering me anything. He's a good friend, but AITA for not wanting to spend all of that time and effort for something that has no benefit for me?<|response|> NTA. Tell him to hire a moving service! <|endoftext|>
179574	5	AITA telling a coworker that i’m pregnant when she’s been trying for 9months I’m on mobile fyi. So i’m 12 weeks pregnant and a coworker of mine has been trying to get pregnant for a lot longer, for this reason I was nervous to tell her but it had to be done. I waited until we were on a shift together and told her privately so she didn’t hear it through word of mouth, she acted happy and excited to my face but I guess she was very upset. She’s been telling other coworkers that I’m insensitive and was rubbing it in her face. I just told her and didn’t bring it up again unless she mentioned it first. I don’t know if I shouldn’t have mentioned anything at all. AITA?<|response|> NTA Your pregnancy has absolutely nothing to do with her and you have the right to be excited about it. I feel for her struggle, I really do, but she is being unreasonable. Try to understand that she is lashing out due to the stress of her situation and try to not take it too personally. <|endoftext|>
144977	3	AITA for not giving money for my son’s birthday party? (Not Me) A really close friend, asked me to write in this sub since i am always talking about reddit and she does not understand english. Her story: Ever since I started dating my now ex-husband, my ex mother in law has tried to make my life hard. I’ve thrived in my own business and have some to spare, and My ex-husband’s family has always asked me for favors and money and still does, To the point of charging me for everything my children need while in their grandparent’s house. If they order Pizza I have to reimburse the money for my children’s pizza. What it Angers me the most is that my ex mother in law always says I don´t care for my children, and that they always pay for my children expenses, kind of a compulsive liar. So fast forward to today, They say they want to throw a birthday party for my youngest and invite some friends from school and soccer team (he is a goalie), and that they are going to need X amount of money, so I told them that my son wants to go to swim with dolphins to Cancun (which is true) and that I am taking him there as birthday present, and that I am not giving them any money. If they want to throw a birthday party I would go and let my son go, but I am not sponsoring their plans. Am I The Asshole? TL:DR My family in law wants me to pay for the birthday party they planed for my son.<|response|> NTA they are not his legal guardian(s) YOU ARE and they have been using you for too long! If they want to throw him a birthday party they can pay for it! <|endoftext|>
104626	3	AITA for not going to court to "help" a friend So, the details here are long. So let me get to it. A few days ago my best friend from my home town was arrested, some kind of domestic charges and criminal menacing (he threatened to kill his dad in front of the police) he resisted arrest, fled, but ended up in custody. His girlfriend (they have a baby together) bailed him out and they took off, his dad got a protective order, he went to his mother's, ANOTHER fight took place. On Wednesday morning at 4am his girlfriend tricked me into getting him out of their car to "talk" while he calmed down, she then ditched him here. My house is exactly 500 feet away from the house of the person he threatened, so as long as he was here he wasn't violating the protective order that had been placed. Unfortunately he decided he needed to wander around town instead of staying here, and technically violated it. He wanted me to tell the court he was here, and hadn't broken it, but he did, he went to my neighbor's house to try to get her to help him, and he tried three times to call his dad, thus breaking the order. I just... I don't want to get involved, he NEEDS help and I feel like if I bail him out, nothing will change, and he'll end up arrested again on worse charges, or worse, he'll end up dead. The court is trying to get him to take a plea deal which would get him a small sentence in county (my county has an excellent facility, he'd have a better quality of life there than I do in my own home tbh) and then would put him into therapy and get him medicated for his mental issues.. So... Anyway, am I the asshole for not going to court to "help" him?<|response|> Def NTA. Don't lie for your idiot friend. He already screwed up the protective order and there's evidence of it with the phone calls, so how much could you even really help. There very well may be other people who can testify to what he did that night (i.e. if seen wondering around alone, if the neighbor he went to saw him, etc.). So you'd be sticking your neck basically so your friend doesn't get mad at you, which isn't a good reason to stick your neck out in such a serious situation. Also something to think about: he's obviously a sloppy mess right now. He's not going to be able to trick the cops. So it's going to be obvious pretty quickly that you're lying, bc there's no way someone that foolish is going to pull off this scheme. <|endoftext|>
58091	4	WIBTA for attempting to unlock my partner's phone? Just after a bit of a clue So, my partner and I have been together for over ten years, we're not married, due to kids coming along and generally, just life. She's always been a quiet type, very private, pretty anti social, and I've always been lucky to just understand that and know when to leave her be. She allows me time to myself, which I find unusual, as I'm far more social than she, and I almost feel guilty for taking that time to do something. Anyway, we've recently been on vacation at my parents and this time she's being just a bit too far off the radar and I'm not coping with it. She's added security (pin code) to her phone, as well as standard fingerprint which she says is to stop the kids, but won't let me in on, despite her knowing mine, and has started taking walks out of an evening, telling me 'not to worry' as she goes, because she's just dealing with a few things. This has happened the last 3 nights. She's insistent that she's going out just because she needs the space. She's managing to be just secretive enough this time though to raise my suspicion. And the other night while out walking, my sister found her talking to an old work colleague on the phone (late Saturday night). Which is totally against how she always is. She's currently asleep next to me, drunk. AITA for considering getting her phone and unlocking it by using her finger print? Something just doesn't seem right, and she's flat out refusing to give me answers. EDIT - Turns out I was the AH. I did it. Curiosity was too strong. Uncovered a 3 year affair. 3 fucking years. When you think all is well you know. Like, fuck. This world sucks.<|response|> NAH. At least yet. You need to be upfront with each other. The sneaking around and distrust in both parties only grows. You should sit down and have a levelheaded conversation. Don’t make accusations or come off as confrontational. Just tell her how it makes you feel that your not trusted enough to see her phone and that she has been acting odd <|endoftext|>
110635	2	AITA (+Friends) for all ditching this guy at once? So me and my friend group is pretty large, but close knit. It's a odd group, it's mostly odd misfits just kind of mashed together, but we are generally all very close, think of it like an old western gang, that all stick together, through everything, despite everyone being from radically different walks of life, and such. This guy, A, is one of the senior members I suppose. He's known a few of the more prominent folks since they were kids. I only met him last summer, since I basically made my way into the group in the last 8 months or so. Despite that, I can probably say that I'm a big part of the group now. I'm one of the people that is basically up for whatever, and as such I've gotten to know people fairly well. A, however, comes and goes as he pleases. This is fine, lots of people do this, but he seems to think he has this huge amount of authority in the group. Like, if there's a problem between two people, he's the one that goes and fixes (not) things, wether he knows the people or even the first thing about the situation. He basically inserts himself in whatever happens, without asking, and sort of hangs on until you ignore him, like even deep seated family shit. He also has no sense of what's socially appropriate. Once, he randomly sat down with me and the girl I was seeing at the time, and basically sort of nagged his way into helping me and her with her essay, despite her never even having even met this guy before. Also, he's a HUGE leech, he basically refuses to clean up when hanging out, and refuses to leave if you let him stay over. The last straw was this week, when he apparently decided he wanted to become a shaman. All of the sudden everyone's FB walls were filled with shaman nature shit, and videos of him doing "shaman rituals". This is nothing new, last month he was apparently a pagan, and spammed pagan shit, despite knowing that there are legitimate pagans in our group. We ended up gathered and just ripping on that shaman shit, and we got to discussing other things about him, and his behavior, which is interesting but not really interested in sharing here. AWTA? TL;DR - A friend recently became a shaman or whatever, me and my friends got to talking about him in general after having a laugh about the shaman stuff. Turns out we all think he's creepy, a huge leech, and we all made sort of a group decision to stop associating with him en masse. Am I, and my friends the assholes? &#x200B;<|response|> NTA. You're not the problem. <|endoftext|>
136776	5	WIBTA if I refused to let my BIL join my wedding party? Hi all! I'm getting married in January, and have started making some decisions about our wedding party. My fiancee has a small family, no siblings or cousins, and a small group of good friends, whereas I have 4 older sisters (I'll call them Jane, Amy, Mary, and Ann), a younger sister (I'll call her Sophie), and 3 younger brothers (I'll call them John, Mark and Joe). We wanted a traditional wedding - bridesmaids and groomsmen - so we decided to 6 bridesmaids/groomsmen on each side so that he could incorporate both my 3 brothers and his 3 closest friends, and so that I could include all of my sisters and have a non-familial MOH so none of my sisters feel like I'm playing favorites. I felt that it was very respectful and diplomatic, especially because my family has a tendency to be competitive. All of my sisters were really gunning to be MOH, especially Mary, and when I told them that I had chosen my childhood best friend (who I've remained very close to), they all were a bit disappointed. Mary talked a bit of smack about me to Sophie, who totally tattled to me, but I didn't confront Mary about it. I also got a lot of pressure from my siblings to have a flower girl and ring bearer, but as most of my siblings have multiple children , I didn't want to pick, so we decided not to have any. Of course, I got flack for that and Mary had a meltdown, accusing me of not thinking her son, who was bit in the face by a dog last summer and has bad scarring, is handsome enough to be part of the wedding. I told her I didn't want to have to pick between my nieces and nephews, and don't want them to feel I'm choosing favorites. She understood and apologized, saying she was feeling a bit emotional about her son's injury, which I understand. The other day, Sophie came to me and said that Mary had started a group chat of all of our siblings, except me. The first message she sent was asking for opinions on whether or not it would be okay for her to ask me to put her husband in the wedding party, so that she could walk with him. She told our siblings that she didn't want to be photographed walking with another man, because it would "start rumors" (which I think is bullshit). She said that I've been excluding her from the planning process like dress shopping (I invited just my mom, grandmother, and stepmom), and I didn't let her have any input on choosing bridesmaids dresses (nobody got input on bridesmaids dresses), and she thinks this would be a nice olive branch. Jane, Ann, Mark and Joe agreed with her, but Amy was against it and John wanted to stay out of it all together. Mary was really unhappy with her own wedding, so I feel she might be feeling<|response|> NTA. Mary is toxic and really ruining your wedding with her drama. Makes me wonder why if she’s just like that or maybe eloped and wishes it was her wedding. You either need to shut it out or confront her about it depending on how reasonable she is. Otherwise this will not stop. My SIL pulled similar stunts and it really ruined a lot of memories for me surrounding my wedding, especially finding a dress and the rehearsal. She caused a lot of drama and stress when you already have enough just planning a wedding. It is your wedding. The only people with say are the people getting married. Don’t feel bad or cater to others. <|endoftext|>
168137	3	AITA I have my teenage child one weekend a month, I have asked my wife to have her teenage child, same age as mine, to please not make plans on the weekend my child is with us so we can all spend time together. Am I wrong for getting upset when this does not happen? Our kids are the same age, there were some rough patches in the past several years ago, but they get along really well now. I'm trying to keep it a little vague, sorry if it's hard to follow. My kid looks forward to hanging out some the one weekend a month, but my wife's kid is often instead making plans with local friends they see nearly every day. Today my kid is home and excited to see my step child, only to find out after several hours on the road to get here that the step sibling is staying overnight at a friends house who they see every day at school. My kid was visibly hurt and wouldn't do such a thing because that's not their upbringing. But my wife's kid doesn't seem to understand, but is admittedly quite flighty. Am I in the wrong for being upset that they don't seem to care about how much they are hurting my kid even though they talk about how much they miss and wish they could spend more time together?<|response|> YTA for expecting another person’s child (for that matter, any child) to make sure your kid feels good. No one else has an obligation to spend time with your child except you and his mum. You are also condescending in saying that “that’s not how my child is brought up”. I get a feeling that the other kid is actively trying to avoid your child. I’m sure the other “flighty” child doesn’t want to sit around and wait for your prince to descend on your household and grace with his presence. <|endoftext|>
87240	4	AITA for staying in my room while on medical leave? Context: My sister gave birth on Thursday and had only been discharged on Monday. My aunts from across the country came over to the house to help take care of the baby and my sister. This means that at the moment, there are 6 adults and 1 baby staying in the same apartment. 2 of these adults, my aunts, are very loud, no matter the time of day. On top of that, there are guests going in and out of the house to visit my sister, or a masseuse to massage my sister. All of these adults, except for me are either on maternity/paternity leave (for at least 3 weeks each), or are not working. &#x200B; I'm working in an office job (Monday-Friday) and take night classes after work. Recently, I had an arts performance the day after my sister gave birth. I was already pretty tired then, with no chance to rest between commuting to work, the hospital, and the art school for rehearsals. &#x200B; The fatigue really stated to kick in two days ago, after I had heat exhaustion after night classes. When I got home at 11pm, there were still guests in the apartment and the house was still very noisy. I tried to sleep that night but couldn't as I kept waking up due to the noise. So yesterday at work, I tried to stay awake but just couldn't handle it. I texted my sister about the noise and she agreed with me that it was too noisy. It wasn't the baby that was making all the noise, it was the adults around the house. It was really a struggle going home after work. I was already exhausted, was having migraine, and was ready to throw up anytime during the commute home. I bought some comfort food for dinner on the way back. When I got home, my mum and aunts noticed the dinner I bought and chastised me for not wanting to eat whatever they cooked (super spicy stuff that might be enough to give you a stomach ache). I just gave them a tired, pissed off look and went straight to my room. When I got to my room, I started to break down and cry (I cry when I'm really exhausted). I had to drag myself through my night-time routine. Even though I was completely exhausted, I got woken up by noise at least twice in the night. &#x200B; Which brings us to today. I applied for medical leave at work today and have been staying in my room. Migraines are still on going and the noise can still be heard in my room. Apparently according to my mum, I'm being selfish for staying in my room, that it's my fault for going for night classes and being tired after that. I've been going for night classes for months and have been alright the next day, I'm even able to wake up earlier for morning runs before work). I'm using headphones to play some music<|response|> NTA. Your family is the AH, not only to you, but to your sister as well. She just gave birth and must be extremely tired and fed up with everyone’s noise. She has a baby to take care of and they seem to be non stop in everyone’s face. I get that it’s an exciting time, but maybe you should talk to them about toning it down for her sake as well as yours. <|endoftext|>
104821	3	AITA for asking my co-workers to change the type of coffee they drink at work? I work in a small building with poor ventilation. My office is on the other side of the building from the lunchroom, and I usually eat lunch at my desk in order to answer emails while I eat, but the lunch room is close enough that I can smell it from my office (very small building). I am also allergic to tree nuts, badly allergic to almonds and walnuts but any tree nuts will give me a reaction. About two weeks ago a coworker brought in a coffee maker to the lunchroom and has been making hazelnut coffee everyday. About the same time, I started getting a rather sore throat everyday at work. I didn't think they were correlated, but today I had a meeting closer to her coffee maker than my office normal is and not only is my throat sore but I've also broken out into hives. I asked if she could stop making hazelnut coffee and she said no, and that I should just stay away from the lunch room. I'm thinking of going to manager and having them tell her to get rid of the coffee maker, but would that make me the asshole? I don't want my allergies to affect what others can eat, but I also don't want to keep having a site throat everyday and I'm worried that with too much exposure my reactions will continue to get worse (as repeated exposure usually exasperates my almond reactions)<|response|> NTA. Even away from the lunchroom you are having an allergic reaction. It's not that you asked her to stop brewing all coffee, just one with nuts. A small reaction such as a sore throat can quickly change to a much worse reaction in a very short time. Time to take this to management. <|endoftext|>
152782	3	WIBTA if I didn't order my partner a takeaway? On Fridays my partner and I like to order a takeaway and watch a film. It's usually between pizza or Chinese, but we tend to do pizza as it's cheaper. We have a monthly grocery budget which usually allows for one takeaway, however some months (like August, where there are more weeks between pay days [paid monthly]), takeaways aren't budgeted for from the grocery budget. If we want it, we have to use our personal spending budget, which is fine. Last month my partner had already spent their personal spending (combined with previous month's) on some new music equipment, so I have paid for the last two takeaways, which is no bother as I got to order Chinese last time which is my favourite. Today my partner mentioned something about how if I wanted takeaway I would have to pay for it, but they would still order too. I can't remember their exact words, but to me they said it in a way that implied I would be paying because they didn't really want takeaway. I sarcastically said that I would just order for myself and they could have whatever they wanted at home. They then replied I would be an asshole, presumably sarcastically. This got me thinking though, if they don't want takeaway, and I do, but they don't want to pay, WIBTA if I ordered just for myself? EDIT: I thought I should add that my partner and I both know neither one of us was serious. This wasn't an actual argument, it was banter. There will be times when they pay and when I pay, for whatever reasons, for takeaway/date nights. I posted as I am genuinely interested in what people think of this specific scenario as I know finances/budgeting is a hot topic amongst people/couples.<|response|> YWBTA - you guys live together right? You're in a committed relationship and want to continue doing so? If you're gonna get that petty over a fucking takeaway then there is no hope for your relationship. <|endoftext|>
53397	3	AITA for not paying for shoes and clothing when my cousin offered to buy them? Alright, so I’ve been visiting California for about a week to spend time relatives and one of my cousins (the oldest) scheduled today to be a shopping day. I had planned to buy two pairs of shoes and a hoodie with MY money because it’s much more pricey in Canada. We went to a mall and I found the hoodie I wanted. I gave it to the cashier and my cousin offered to buy it for me, I asked “Are you sure?” and she insisted that she’d pay so I thanked her, she bought it, and we left. Next up, we made it to a shoe store. I couldn’t find the first pair I wanted but I found the other one so I brought that to the cashier and once again she offered to pay. I asked to make sure if she was genuinely willing to pay and she said yes. So she bought it and I thanked her. Once we finished shopping I didn’t think about it at all until we went home. My aunt cooked dinner for everybody and we ate together. I finished early so I took my plate away to clean. When I finished washing my plate, I went to the living room to go on my phone and my younger cousin came out to tell me that they were talking about me. He overheard them saying how I’m going to become greedy in the future because they paid for my hoodie and shoes and how I wanted two shoes instead of just one. Turns out my aunt paid my older cousin back for the stuff she bought for me. Ok wait a minute, I planned to pay and my cousin offered to pay instead of me. I made sure to confirm that she was willing to pay and she didn’t seem to think anything of it so I agreed and thanked her. I’m thinking of giving them the money and just leaving the topic alone but am I really the asshole??<|response|> NTA. When you leave I would hug them goodbye and as you go to leave hand your aunt some cash and say “although cousin offered to buy these at the time now I felt it would be best to return the money based on the conversations I overheard” and watch all their eyes get wide. What a rude family you have. <|endoftext|>
48971	4	AITA for saying the N word as a white guy? I am a counselor at a summer camp and in my group there happens to be a lot of Chinese, Albanians, and other foreign students who don't speak english too well and aren't too familiar with America and are just here temporarily. They listen to American rap music which often says the word nigga and occasionally nigger in them. I see some of the albanians and chinese rocking out singing the music together and just saying the word nigga. I go up to them and i explain that they should be careful and its best to not say the word. I explain to them the word nigga comes from the word nigger and that is a racial slur that shouldn't ever be said because someone will take it out of context and call them racist when i know they're just innocent kids. Low and behold, someone overheard it and reported me to the higher-ups. They basically told me that it didn't matter the context, someone overhead me saying that word and that i need to be fired. One of the kids even went up to the higher-ups and explained what happened (he was black) and told them i wasn't being racist and the higher-ups basically said that it didn't matter because i said a racist word. To be honest i don't think the higher-ups believe this shit, i think they know I'm not actually racist but they're firing me because that person was a parent who threatened to pull their 3 kids out of the summer camp they were enrolled into for the entire summer, resulting in them losing 7000 and i was expendable. Some of my coworkers who are my level went off about how I'm a white privileged asshole and needs to learn my place and shit. &#x200B; I want to know though, was it really wrong for me to say the n word to let kids know what it is so they know not to say it? Im absolutely sure I'm NTA but i want a sanity check here.<|response|> NTA No you were not in the wrong. It's fucked up you even have to think that. You didn't go around and call someone Nigger, you explained saying the word "Nigger" is not ok. that's it. >and the higher-ups basically said that it didn't matter because i said a racist word the higher-ups are complete morons. as are the parents. <|endoftext|>
87553	2	AITA for only getting one of my roommates a gift? I moved into my current place in August. One of my roommates (who owns the house) is also a coworker of mine. The other roommate I have barely spoken to. I know she is a vegetarian because I am as well and she commented on my veggie burgers. Other than that I may have spoken to her twice. I got my coworker roommate a small Christmas gift and was going to discreetly give it to her when my other roommate wasn't around, but I'm not entirely sure if this is acceptable social etiquette. I don't have much spare cash this year, aka none, otherwise I'd get her a gift card or something. Is this an asshole thing to do?<|response|> NTA - Christmas gifts aren’t a necessity at all! If they get you something, maybe consider getting them something. But if y’all don’t talk i don’t think they’ll get you anything. <|endoftext|>
172129	3	WIBTA if I took a developmentally disabled individual, who loves to make vocalizations, out to a restaurant for an eat-in meal? I am the counselor for the individual in question. He is a young adult on the autism spectrum. Let me clarify what I mean by "vocalizations". Most of the time, he isn't loud enough to disturb anyone, he just seems like he is talking to himself (he quotes cartoons and movies constantly . . . it's a pretty common behavior for autistic individuals called scripting). However, sometimes he will randomly let out a shout. Both behaviors serve sensory fulfillment purposes. I have been working with him on pro-social behavior in public (sitting down for the duration of the meal if we're out to eat, not approaching strangers to touch them, etc). I'm very satisfied with his progress so far, and his birthday is coming up, so I'm considering taking him out to lunch at one of his favorite restaurants to celebrate. However, I do have some reservations, namely about being considerate of others. He has markedly improved in how he deals with strangers, but we have gotten dirty looks in public before over noises he's made. It's his right to be out in the community, but people at the restaurant would also be entitled to eat in peace. Removing him from the restaurant like you would a noisy toddler would not really work because it would break the trust I've spent a long time building with him; he would see it as me promising a meal at his favorite restaurant, only to renege on my promise. This trust is the key to working with him and making progress. I have considered other options like getting him takeout from this place and having him eat at home or at the park or something, but I feel like this defeats the purpose of him learning how to be out and about in society. tl;dr: Want to take autistic individual out to lunch for his birthday and to also reward him for making progress on his behavior in public, but don't want to potentially disturb those around us trying to enjoy their meal since he makes noises sometimes.<|response|> INFO What type of restaurant is it? What's the environment like? <|endoftext|>
91894	3	AITA for making my husband pick? My husband and I have been together since 2012. For almost 3 years we lived jointly with his mother with me helping take care of her. When we go to get married everything changes. What I thought was a great relationship between her and I turned very sour, very quickly. According to her and her friends I was lazy, self entitled, using her son, a horrible cook, worthless mother, anything negative she could say or point out about me she did. Obviously never around her son. I finally broke down and told him. He talked to her and of course she denied it. After a few weeks I finally told him I was moving out this was done after we had gotten married. I just couldn’t take it anymore. This woman broke my toes on purpose by refusing to walk. Caused me health issues by ensuring I couldn’t see my doctor because I had to take her to her doctors because she would purposely schedule the same day and time and then cancel right before having to go. We gave her 6 months of bill money (full 6 months of bills) and 3 months notice we were moving. AITA for making him pick between her or me? Even after we moved out we had to take a loan to cover the 6 months of bills she refused to pay...<|response|> When you marry someone, you are picking your spouse over everyone and everything. You aren't making your husband pick. Your husband already picked you. NTA <|endoftext|>
46979	1	WIBTA for dating my Ex's Best Friend? Hey reddit. So for a long while i was dating "M". We had a decently rocky relationship, but it was a very loving one as well. We didn't end up having a huge fight, we just drifted apart quickly due to mutual (I assume) dislike. I know she still has strong feelings for me, and she has contacted my friends to ask about me on 2-3 occasions. Now I met M's best friend "J" a few times, at most 2-3, me and M were mostly alone when we hung out. Anyway, about 2 days ago I matched with J on Bumble, and started writing. I knew from the outset that she was M's friend, she has an unusual name and whatnot. We're talking about meeting up and I'm honestly considering putting in a bit of effort here. She's not the hookup type from what I gather, so if it went somewhere, it would be a BF/GF type deal. Would I be the asshole for dating J? As I said M still has feelings for me, and given that she was absolutely CRUSHED when I looked at another girl, I'm wondering how she'd react to me dating her best friend. It shouldn't matter at all really, but I guess I still have a bit of sympathy left for her. **WIBTA if I dated her?**<|response|> Yes <|endoftext|>
128412	2	WIBTA if I emailed a hiring manager to tell them best practices when phone screening candidates? I just began job searching after 2 years at my current organization. I put in a resume at a local social service agency last week and got a call back two days later. The founder/president of the organization and I spoke for about 20 minutes and at the end she enthusiastically asked about my availability and said verbatim, “I’d like to have you come in for an interview.” I said my schedule was very flexible so she said she’d send me a few dates the same day via email. I usually email the person I spoke with to thank them for their time but opted to wait since she said she’d email me. No email came that day. Or the next day, or the next day. Finally on the third day I emailed thanking her for her time and asked, “please let me know if you’re still interested in setting up an in person interview.” She emailed back quickly saying “I will let you know.” I took that more as “I’ll let you know if I’m still interested,” not “I’ll let you know about my schedule.” Nothing else since then. It’s now been a week since the phone interview and I finally get a brief email saying that “you are not qualified.” I meet about 75% of their listing requirements. I’m a hiring manager at my current position and conduct hiring every three-five months. I train my assistant, who handles phone screenings, to never tell someone that they would be getting an in-person interview, but that someone would be in touch if they are moving forward in the process, which I thought is standard. I feel like it was very unprofessional for her to ask my availability, tell me she wants me to interview, never reach out to me, and then give that short response when I email her. But at the same time, I understand that it’s her agency and she can do what she wants. My question is: would it be appropriate/worth it for me to email back to tactfully let them know that setting up an interview with someone and then changing their mind but not reaching back out isn’t best practice when hiring? Or should I just move on (I have already set up other interviews, but the whole situation is just so bizarre and unprofessional to me)? I would definitely feel like TA to do it since it’s her organization and she can do as she pleases, but this is just bugging me. Thanks in advance!<|response|> YTA what you are trying to tell them isn’t going to be tact , just move on. <|endoftext|>
145612	3	AITA for not giving my brother a loan to save his business? My brother recently asked for a loan to save his business. He has done this before 4-5 years ago, and I have given to him then. "I'll pay you back in a week" ended taking about a year and a half to get my 12k back. I never hear from him except when he wants money, which I knew would be the case when I got a txt message from him earlier in the month. We have polar opposite personalities and he is the risk taker, and I am the opposite. He has got pretty far with that mentality surprisingly, but its caught up with him now and he needs money to save his business again after some frankly very stupid decisions that I cannot fathom. I am not rich but I save my money, so I could loan him the 30k and it wouldn't be a problem for me. But I have two different parts of my brain fighting against each other, one saying "why should you, you know he's going to take forever to pay it back and it will be a battle to get your money back" and the other saying "He is your brother and its his business and livelihood on the line, what if he loses his house?". I told him I would not loan him the money and he called me selfish and that "I will remember this" and "see if I ever help you again", (whatever that means as he's never helped me). I don't know I guess I am 2nd guessing myself because he is family..<|response|> NTA. As you've said it yourself, he has a recurring habit of asking for money and not returning it on his own will. It's your money and nobody should have to make you feel guilty about not giving them any part of it when they don't intend to pay it back on time. Look at it this way... Suppose you have a major emergency and need a ton of money but you already gave a large chunk of it to your brother. Would he get you that money on time if you were in a dire situation? Considering his previous money handling situation, I guess you could put more faith in a miracle happening. <|endoftext|>
57927	3	WIBTA if I make a pub adapt their business routine to me? Just to give you some background. Me: I moved in London to finish my studies, last year of medicine. I come from a very small town of a very small country, and I realize that I was one of those “sheltered kid” my entire life. Never had to rent an apartment by myself. Background: months ago I rent a room next with a family. That went south quickly as the police came and threw every single one of us out (reason I can’t disclose). Instead of sleeping in the street I put myself on the lookout for an apartment ready to rent, and I found this sweet deal for a 1 bedroom apartment. I took it. The problem is that I didn’t scout the area around, and this apartment faces a pub. This pub plays loud music every single night. Some nights, when they do karaoke, I can hear the people singing down to the lyrics, from my study room. They do this every night until 1 am, and some nights until 3 am. I have contacted the environmental health department of competence, and to their credit, they did intervene and requested the pub to lower the music down to a certain level. What they do now it’s totally random, sometimes the music is really high some nights is low. When I contacted back the department, they told me that that’s all they could do, unless I was willing to take it to court and all, which is costly. So I decided to post on reddit, here on AITA and on legaladviceuk. I’ve been called asshole both time for not scouting the area and pretending that a business would adapt to my needs. As of today, I basically adapted my study routine around them. I stay in the library from 3pm to basically 1am or 2 am. Not ideal at all since I don’t like altering my routine. Now the situation is this. I’ve been lucky enough to meet through tinder a lady who works for a solicitor firm. She told me that I could record the noise and she gave me some regulation to follow so that those recording would be considered proof enough from their solicitor firm to take my case. She told me that, as the firm likes easy wins, they would price me for discount (40% of what I would normally pay) and that she was ready to speed up the case for me. So I did all that, and in less than a week they prepared a “cease and desist” form to be sent to the pub. They called the solicitor firm saying that it is so unfair as they are there from before the apartments were built and that they are a pub targeted at a very particular minority group, so that could be considered harassment on my end. Also, they tried to reduce the volume before, but they had way less customers in that case and they were about to fail, so reducing<|response|> YTA. This isn’t like moving into a neighborhood and finding out your neighbors throw loud parties every night or have a dog that barks non-stop. You moved in across the street from a bar, presumably because the rent was cheap. You know why the rent was cheap? Because it’s across the street from **a bar**. <|endoftext|>
187019	1	AITA for not agreeing with my mom and my lying sister? So my half sister is looking for a job. She could easily fall into choosing beggars but this is where I’m putting this one. My father (not her real dad) used to own a trucking company, owner operator, out of my state. He did all his logbooks himself and would do multiple runs a day and he’d have to fill in his logbook as he went. I personally can vouch for him because from three months old I rode with him and I’m currently in my late teens. She has put in an application for a government/state job and she put his company/name in the application as past experience without him knowing and he and I have been put into it. I was put in as a witness to her working on the weekend with him filling out the logbook (that’s not how it worked then, this is before electric logs) and if he got pulled over before he filled out his logbook he could receive a hefty ticket. My mom told me about it and I told her I wouldn’t sign off on her paper saying she did it because that’s falsifying information for a government job. My mom said it’s petty of me for saying that I wouldn’t lie about something but is cool with her doing so. AITA or am I correct in what I did? I was raised to tell the truth not to lie so, as Luke Combs says, What you see is what you get.<|response|> NTA <|endoftext|>
98301	4	AITA for telling my mom that I didn’t care that she was sad about my dead father? Throwaway. F 19 here. So my father passed away suddenly due to a stroke in May 2019. It was devastating, and no one was hit harder than my mom. Although they were in a partnership for many years, they had only been legally married for 9 months. Naturally, she fell apart. We moved houses because she couldn’t function in the house they shared. She worked less, smoked more, cried, slept a lot. I have two younger siblings (11 & 17) and I took over most of her responsibilities in terms of cooking, cleaning, getting school supplies in the fall, etc. I also went back to work the day after he passed because my mom was convinced we’d get fired if we all called off (the two of us & 17 yr old work together). This was hard on me. After his funeral I never worked less than 60 hours a week (between 2 jobs). Now, frankly, i’m at my wits end. Since I left for school (in sept) my mother has broken her sobriety. She drinks all day, works maybe three days a week (as a waitress), blows my father’s (very limited) inheritance, brings drugs and strange men around my little sister- and just voids herself of all responsibility under the guise of ‘I’m sad because he’s gone.’ The straw that broke the camels back is she refuses to give me her tax information so I can fill out the FAFSA. I’ve been asking her since October, and I’ve been kind, understanding, and empathetic. But this time when she said “I can’t. I miss your father” I straight up said, “Mom, I don’t care. This is non negotiable. I NEED this for my education.” She blew up at me, called me ungrateful, said ‘I didn’t understand’ her ‘actual REAL problems’. She also said I very clearly didn’t care about her or what she was going through. Of course, I GET IT, even if I don’t get it because I didn’t lose my husband. But losing someone doesn’t give you a freebie on every basic responsibility. tl;dr AITA for telling my mom that I didn’t care that she was upset over the lost of my dad? EDIT: Wanted to clarify based on a few responses: I’ve asked my mom for this info almost every week since the FAFSA opened in October. It’s less that I didn’t care about her feelings, and more than I didn’t care that she was using it as an excuse. I don’t disagree with ESH but I thought that distinction was important.<|response|> NTA. Your mother isn’t the only one dealing with a loss - you and your siblings are now left to mourn the loss of your father *and* your mother as you knew her. Please consider enlisting the help of any relatives you have who may be able to help you all deal with this situation. <|endoftext|>
11938	4	AITA for not wanting to stay friends? Edit: Thank you for the advice. I'll get to work on it soon. Backstory. I've known this friend, let's call her Mary, since my first day in public school. First day of primary school, we're friends. Primary school was a mix of on/off friendship because she always got upset and claimed we weren't friends. Next day, she's acting like nothing happened. She said later in life that she was like that because her mum was, and I accept that. But then she kept doing that through school. Ie, she got pissed at me because I wouldn't help her cheat on important tests. When I went through a rough breakup, she stayed friends with my ex who had cheated on me. Mary's defense? "She didn't break up with me, she's my friend." I'm still sore from that despite it being four or so years ago. Last year she got a boyfriend. Okay, cool, I'm happy for her. Quickly turns out he's toxic. Possessive as fuck and encourages bad behavior to the point I didn't want to be associated with her in any way. Not that I could anyway--her boyfriend barely let her hang out with other people without him. I think it's because he was paranoid that I (M) would take her from him. No one had such intentions. I, and many other people, tried to tell Mary that her boyfriend was really bad for her but she called us "jealous haters" and blew us off. Now, almost a whole year later, she's realizing that we were all right. She's talking to me more often and... I don't know if I want to respond. Im very close to Mary's family (her grandparents see me as a grandson) and I've known her since I was 6 but I'm feeling like I should be done. She has something bad happen every few seconds it feels like and she complains *so often.* I understand people have baggage but she never talks to me about anything else but her problems. I feel like she comes to me alone for advice. WIBTA if I cut contact? (Obligatory mobile apology, and I didn't proofread)<|response|> NTA. The same thing happened to me and a friend (we knew each other since freshman year of high school) and I immediately cut ties with her during senior year of high school cause her asshole behavior and boyfriend drama wasn’t good for my mental health. The good news is that we did end up reconnecting 2 years later after high school and by then she has become WAY more mature than she was in the past! I think it’s just best for you to take your leave and maybe try reconnecting with her after she’s had time to think about her actions and work on herself to be honest. <|endoftext|>
147615	4	AITA for not standing up in church Last Saturday my parents dragged me to church for my aunts months mine, if you don’t know what that is, it’s the 1 month after a funeral service. We were up near the front, and a couple of minutes into the mass I got upset (EDIT: by upset, i mean silent crying) I wasn’t allowed to leave so I just stayed sitting, my dad was highly upset over this, but at the time I was too upset to even register what he was saying. The mass was only thirty minutes, and near the end I tried to move across to my mom who, had also not been standing, but my dad put out his hand and said I couldn’t move. After the church my grandmother pulled me aside to tell me I was a disgrace and was embarrassing her, and that her friends were asking why wasn’t I standing. My dad backed her up. My mom didn’t say anything but she was fairly pissed that my grandmother caused a scene. After we got home my dad yelled at me for a solid 30 minutes about it. It’s been almost a week and he’s still mad. And I have to go apologize to my grandmother on Sunday. AITA?<|response|> INFO - why is it disgraceful to stay seated? I really don't understand. Whatever the reason, they clearly place great value in appearances if the group was murmuring about the scandalous seated person. Shame on you for sitting, but they are all in for gossiping and judging! Sounds like very selective priorities and self-righteousness. <|endoftext|>
190222	2	WIBTA if I told my smoker colleagues that I do not want to shake hands with them anymore, because my hands are going to stink? Basically the title. I am not even sure that I have the guts going through with this, but I freaking hate the smell of my hand after we shake hands. I usually just get up and go to the bathroom to wash my hand, I never said anything. I feel bad about saying something like this to them, but I also hate the fact that even though they are a minority, the majority of us has to go through everything bad related to smoking because they don't care. If I let a smoker use my computer, the keyboard and the mouse is going to stink too, so every time there is something to work on, I am trying to get tho their computer, instead of using mine. So, reddit, WIBTA if I told my smoker colleagues that I do not want to shake hands with them anymore?<|response|> YTA. Wash your hands afterwards? <|endoftext|>
130586	3	AITA for not caring about my mom’s wellbeing? Throughout my life my mom has been the perfect narcissistic Asian parent. She provides for us and pushes us while tearing us down. She supports us wholeheartedly but only if we become what she wants us to become. She works her ass off to pay for our tuition but only if we do exactly what she says. She’s exceptionally proud of us but only around other people. The list goes on. She’s narcissistic and manipulative and I can’t fathom how someone who is genuinely caring or kind could get so much pleasure out of making other people miserable. If you call her out on it, she denies, deflects, then blames us because we deserved it somehow. I’m older, I have my own life, house, husband to care and worry about and I’m constantly being dragged back into family drama. I try not to tell my husband so much anymore because I don’t want to upset him or make him dislike my family more, so all he knows is I’m sneakily typing away on reddit and/or texting whenever things like this happens. Quite frankly, I’m sick and tired of it and I don’t care anymore. I’m tired of other people playing into her games of manipulation. Unfortunately, I’ve been trained into feeling bad/guilty any time I go against her wishes, which means I feel bad/guilty for not caring whether she’s ok or not. Am I the asshole for no longer caring?<|response|> NTA Cut them out of your life. Seek some counseling on how to channel those feelings of guilt into a positive outlet if it weighs heavily on you. <|endoftext|>
117594	1	AITA married his best friend I had been on and off with a guy for 8 years and He and I moved in with his mum and sister to help support them, I lost my house I was renting which was nice and just as big as the house we moved into. We got Rats and I babysat for his family, as well as driving them all around. A few weeks later I started a business and he no longer had any work... I worked my ass off and still helped around the house and drive everyone everywhere... picked the sister up from school and made sure everything was taken care of. He eventually a job for 6 hrs a week and decided I should continue paying all the Bills since it was more convenient as I was receiving regular income. He would use my money for games and stuff and at one point I got him a gym membership to help raise his self confidence (his request). His best mate started helping with my business as it was far too much for just me, and we all started going swimming at night and hanging out with friends just to keep our minds stimulated. My partner at the time declined until a girl began joining us (keep in mind he had cheated on me in high school before we had had sex... sexting etc) and I was always working or seeing friends or babysitting or driving. We had a discussion about children and I said not until I have my life sorted. He asked the other girl and she said she wants a kid now, so they talk and get closer... eventually i said she could use him to help her BUT I want a written contract that we have no emotional, mental or fiscal responsibility to that child and nothing is to happen until that is drawn up. A couple of weeks later he actually abused me. I forgave him as I thought maybe it's just stress, but one day he buttdialled me and he was with her (he told me he was going to the gym, and they weren't to be alone until the contract was written up because I wanted no responsibility for raising her child). He came back and made up some story about how it was my fault and I basically told him we were no longer together. I would stay to help support his family but that's it... and he was to leave the shared room asap, and move up to his old bedroom. I didn't care who he fucked but it wasn't me and it wasn't in my bed. Part 2 in comments<|response|> I continued helping his family out and working on my business with his best mate, and then he and I found more and more common interests. This began our friendship. His best mate had never even hugged a girl and suddenly had this girl crying on him out of fear... he held me while I slept, and this began us falling for each other. We didn't want my ex to know because he had a habit of flying off the handle and was already angry that the girl he planned to be with, had decided to go out with my ex fiance ( now best friend). So we talked about moving out and talked with his mum who knew my ex cheated. He got my rat and gave it to his sister, because 'you can't separate them and since you get my best friend I get your rat'. I cried for weeks about losing my rat. I also started hooking up with some friends and my ex found out and lost his shit and punched me, this sparked an entire thing where I reminded him that he fucked up not me and I was free to sleep with whoever I wanted. Mind you he asked me to help him find a girl the same day I dumped him. 3 months later his best mate and I started living together. He then demanded that we pay for his birthday and we did. He then got banned from the restaurant we had the party at for excessive noise and vomit. We paid $300 for his dinner and even more for the arcade after. We stopped talking to him for a while afterwards and got engaged and I got my own rats and started setting up my life again. His sister wanted to come see me and I took her out to lunch. His sister accidentally told him i was engaged and he asked who to, and I said his old best friend. He lost it and I called my now husband and he ran 4 blocks to make sure I was ok. Things calmed down and we invited him to the wedding and he said we were to leave and we haven't heard from him since. <|endoftext|>
77742	4	AITA if I decline moving in with my mom My mom recently found a house that would fit she and my sister and my family (me..my husband and my 4 yr old girl). She says its best if we would move in together to save money and so would not need to worry about a sitter for my baby. Me and my hubby simply are not comfortable living in the same house as my mom. I feel like she would treat me as a child and I would want to live separately. AITA?<|response|> NTA. If you have a husband and child why would you want to live with your mother? I get some people might be in a situation where they don’t have a choice <|endoftext|>
67196	3	AITA for refusing to give an older lady a ride? I definitely feel like TA. I was stopped at a place to pick up a to go order, but I had not gone inside to get it yet. This lady knocked on my car window and asked me for a ride to her house, which she said was a few streets over. It caught me off guard, and I was sort of afraid if I let her in my car she’d start asking me for money or telling me about Jesus or something, so I said “No, I don’t really give people rides. Sorry.” She frowned and started walking in the direction she had told me she wanted to go. I live in a safe but poor rural area. I didn’t like feel unsafe with this lady, but I didn’t want some kind of shakedown. Now I think she was probably really just needing a ride and I feel like a terrible neighbor (she was walking in the direction of my house, and I think she probably lives in some crappy apartments across the street).<|response|> NTA. How did she even get there in the first place? If she could walk to there, she can walk back. Also, stranger danger is very real and isn't just true for small children- it applies to everyone. <|endoftext|>
111800	3	AITA for getting frustrated at my new age-y friend for constantly talking about her beliefs? I’m a super pragmatic person, I’m an atheist that believes solely in science and what has been proven. I have nothing against religious or spiritual people and completely respect their views and beliefs. My best friend is the typical Los Angeles new age girl, crystals, tarot, reiki, faeries, astrology, etc. She knows I don’t believe in any of these things and still she talks about them with me ALL THE TIME. I basically sit there trying to take her seriously, while she goes off about spirituality talking about it all like it’s all real and based on facts. It’s incredibly uncomfortable for me and I’ve politely told her multiple times to try to talk about these things with her other friends because all that goes through my mind when she brings it up is how it’s all fairytales. But I never say that, and still listen and try to be supportive. I think it’s a little disrespectful to constantly talk about her beliefs with someone that doesn’t believe in it. Earlier today, she asks me if I want her to read my tarot, then later we were walking our dogs and she points to the sky and says: I wonder which one is my star (she says she’s a pleidian starseed), and babbles on about that for a while, then she was telling me how aliens introduced reiki to someone in Japan and how people believe acupuncture and all these things were taught by aliens. And I lost it, I usually just smile uncomfortably, but I started laughing out loud uncontrollably. She took it really poorly. I told her that if a Christian person was constantly preaching to her about God it would probably be uncomfortable and she said it wasn’t the same situation and acted offended. She went on saying that I’m a bad friend, and I have the need to feel right all the time, and I just have a superiority complex, and continued with personal observations about who I am. I starting feeling really bad and emotional so I just walked out. She won’t talk to me, and I know it was rude of me to laugh at her beliefs and feel really bad about it, but AITA here?<|response|> NTA, you've said politely that you aren't comfortable with the topic. If she respected you, she wouldn't continuously bring it up knowing that you don't share the same perspective. <|endoftext|>
164760	1	AITA for bringing my boyfriend with me to a catsitting job? A few months back I (27f) had a gig to cat sit for a family in town while they went away. We didn't discuss anything beyond basic care for the cats and their medications, as well as a few household chores such as getting the mail, turning off lights at night etc. I love animals and was happy to send text updates with photos of the cats periodically to the owners, even though this was not asked of me. They were gone for a few weeks so I was over there a lot. My boyfriend (29m) came with me to the house a couple of times to help expedite the chores when I worked a doubleshift at work. He is also a catlover, very responsible and loves to clean, I didn't think twice about it when he offered to help. I used all their cat litter so I spent my personal money to buy them a mew one, and I picked a bouquet of flowers from my garden to leave as a gift and a short handwritten note thanking them for opening their home to me and trusting me to care for their loved ones. The owners messaged me thanking me for all I did, and I asked them to please keep me in mind for future reference when they travel. It's been about 5 months and no word. Now I'm overthinking things and worrying that I may have breached their trust by bringing a "stranger" Into their house if they had somehow found out. I didn't intend to lie but I also never asked if it was cool. I want a second opinion because I feel kinda guilty, AITA for bringing my boyfriend over to their house even though I was there with him the whole time?<|response|> > Now I'm overthinking things and worrying that I may have breached their trust by bringing a "stranger" Into their house if they had somehow found out. NAH. That's a serious leap you made there. Time to shut down those thoughts and accept that you likely aren't thinking logically. Give me one piece of evidence that backs up your theory and shows that it's not absolutely nonsense created SOLELY in your brain. <|endoftext|>
60458	3	AITA for insulting and threatening to leave my mentally ill spouse? OK, so I've been married for twenty-five years to a woman who has been seriously mentally ill for the past dozen or so, with episodes prior. She is schizophrenic but will not take medication or seek treatment. She does not work and has not tried to for at least the past decade. She cooks for herself and occasionally for me and does housework sporadically. She is also addicted on and off to online shopping and between that and cigarettes alone she costs me a couple thousand a month. I used to afford this fairly easily but lately times are harder and I could no longer support the shopping stuff- it truly is just showers of worthless trinkets- and canceled her accounts. Anyway, today I discovered that online shopping has once again come up and she's been funding it through various deceits- things I should have realized but somehow let slide- and has gone through another few grand. I blew up and called her every name in the book and told her I was done and did not consider myself married anymore. Now that I am cooled down again, I wonder if, by not listening to that little nagging voice telling me to keep a closer eye on the accounts, that it was my own irresponsibility to allow this to happen in the first place. I am supposed to be the sane one and insulting someone with a personality disorder is never a good idea. I begin to suspect that I was in fact a huge asshole after all. Is this so then, AITA?<|response|> No man that’s some hard shit. She needs to fix it because that isn’t healthy <|endoftext|>
85459	3	AITA for boarding a plane early due to frequent flyer status and leaving my co-workers at the gate? I (30 M) am travelling for work with two of my co-workers from my team, Johan (M 30s) and Mary (20s). We work very closely together since we are on the same team at a tech company and even shared an Uber to the airport. After waiting for our Jet Blue flight at the gate, the gate agent announced that Mosaic (Jet Blue frequent flyer status) customers were welcome to board first. I excused myself from the group and boarded the plane so I could secure a spot for my hand luggage. Mary and Johan did not have Mosaic status and so had to wait until the end to board. Johan ended up having to check his bag because there was no overhead space left. Mary ended up sitting next to me which was a little awkward since I had left them at the gate at least 10 mins ago. When we got to our destination (short 1hr flight) Mary and I met up with Johan at the gate. Johan was grumbling that he had to wait for his bag and Mary said "Not all of us have Mosaic status" sarcastically. I said "Oh c'mon" and then we had a long discussion on whether it was rude to have left them at the gate and boarded early. Johan and Mary said I should have waited at least until general boarding. AITA? (P.S. On re-reading this, it sounds like the perfect setup for a Curb your enthusiasm episode 🙂)<|response|> NTA- they are both adults, they can wait ten minutes. You didn’t leave one person by themselves or something. Them being there doesn’t prevent you from using privileges that you have earned. <|endoftext|>
39695	3	AITA for getting mad at my parents for making me babysit my siblings? Every other day or so, my parents say that they “need time away” and go away for a few hours, usually to run errands, often taking my sister (15) with them. I (17m) am always left in charge of my siblings (12m, 7f, and 6m). We are all homeschooled, and live in the middle of nowhere in the country, so I rarely actually go into town. My two youngest siblings have some behavioural issues, so they are not the easiest to take care of. My parents work at a summer camp, where we live, so my dad is in his office for 8 hours a day. My mom goes there to work every other afternoon, leaving me to watch the children for that time, and then they go into town on those evenings, too. I have to do my schoolwork in this time, and it is hard to do that when watching the children. My mom goes to the office because she says it is hard to work and watch the kids at the same time. She then gets mad at me for being behind in my schoolwork. I usually have to cook dinner for everyone, too. The other day, I told them I wanted something in return for watching their children like pay, or at least time away from people. They said “You do get time away. You take the dog for a 20 minute walk everyday, and you go to youth group every Friday.” They usually pressure me into taking one kid with me when I go for a walk. Yesterday, my mom told me I have to focus entirely on schoolwork for the next couple of weeks, because it is my fault I am behind, because according to her, I hardly do my school. She then told me I had to watch the kids that evening. I said no, and she called me a jerk and ungrateful. I am wondering who is the a hole here?<|response|> You're definitely NTA, if I were you I'd discuss it with them (which I imagine being impossible with parents like this) and just getting out as soon as possible <|endoftext|>
150396	2	AITA for practicing piano at 7 in the morning? **Context:** I'm a serious pianist (not professional yet) with two examinations for my diploma coming up (if that makes no sense: essentially, I need to practice a lot because I have a Big Piano Test). Therefore, a moderate amount of practice is required (about 2-3 hours a day). I am also a morning person and find I practice best and am most mentally alert/motivated/whatever you want to call it in the morning. By the afternoon I have to make lunch, do various errands, and prepare for the written part of my exam, etc. However, I live with my family and most of them don't want to hear me stumbling through Chopin at 7 in the morning. I've offered to close all the doors in the piano room and use the "mute pedal" on the piano (I own an upright) (basically a pedal on the piano that drops a felt cloth over the hammers so the sound is quieter). As a side note, the piano is downstairs while my family sleeps on the ground floor. Usually, I'd be fine with practicing later in the day (after 1 pm, as my family says) but due to my upcoming exams and the fact that I feel best motivated and ready in the morning, I'd prefer to practice in the morning. I'm being called selfish for not valuing the fact that my family needs sleep and I'd rather prepare for my examinations (which I've been working towards for most of my life). I feel like I may be the asshole because I am actually being selfish for not sucking it up and practicing later, maybe you guys could help sort this out? &#x200B; **TL;DR -** I have an important piano exam coming up and practice best in the morning. Family doesn't want to hear me play piano in the morning because they need to sleep, they are calling me selfish and telling me to practice later. I've offered to play as quietly as possible and use various methods to soften the sound (Closing doors, using pedals on piano, etc.). AITA?<|response|> YTA. You can’t cut into the sleep time of others because of preferences. Get a keyboard and headphones. <|endoftext|>
113517	5	AITA for not wanting to fly home for the weekend? I (38 M) live on the west coast of the USA, and I travel 10 or so times per year for work. Next month I have two trips to the east coast which happen to fall really close together. I have a week of meetings in DC followed by a meeting in New York the following Tuesday. I'm thinking it would be a lot easier (and possibly cheaper - although my company will pay for it either way) to just stay the weekend in New York rather than spend all day flying home on Friday, only to turn around on Monday and spend all day flying across the country again. Problem is, when I brought this up with my girlfriend (36 F) she got pretty annoyed. We live together and have been dating several years, and we normally spend weekends like that together just hanging out. But we don't have any specific plans for that weekend, and my kids are with my ex wife, and like I said it just seems more convenient. And, to be honest, I live in a smaller town and I do enjoy spending time in the big city. But her response made it clear she's mad about this and there is a full blown fight in my future. She said that I'm being "weird" and "avoiding my real life" and "being a workaholic". I don't know if she's being insecure, or if she just doesn't want to spend the weekend alone, or if I'm actually being weird about this. I mean, I do enjoy being in the city and I have some work friends I might grab drinks with while I'm there, but most of the time I'll just be alone in my hotel room that weekend. So maybe it's objectively kind of insulting that I'd choose a lonely weekend alone in a hotel over a weekend of Netflix with her? I honestly don't know. tl;dr I'm planning to stay the weekend in New York rather than fly home between work trips, and my girlfriend is upset about it. Edit: A couple of people pointed out I could offer to fly her to New York to spend the weekend with me. I have offered that several times over the past few years and she's always turned me down (although with other trips the situation was different - the choice was between me coming home Friday, or her coming to wherever I was and we spend the weekend away). I even tried really hard to get her to come out to Chicago 3 years ago because I love the river walk and the architecture and the food there, but she turned me down because she doesn't like the cold (and finding someone to watch the dog is a pain, etc). I did fly myself and her daughter out to Boston last year to meet her on one of HER business trips, and it was super fun. But that cleaned out my frequent flyer miles, and between Christmas and<|response|> NTA maybe NAH You're flying out 10 or so times a year so I can see where she might feel a upset as it's not a one time thing in terms of you being away and then you have your kids which you need to also spend time with. But I get that traveling frequently is a drag and it happens to be convenient for you that it's DC and NYC back to back. Have you offered to fly her out for the weekend if you don't want to fly back? <|endoftext|>
48092	3	AITA For Not Wanting My Friend’s Friend (A Stranger To Me) To Come To The Strip Club With Us? Okay, this is silly and not a huge deal but I am wondering if this is like an R-rated Seinfeldesque faux pas I am committing. My (30 F) friend (also 30F) and I sometimes go to strip clubs (female dancers.) we’re both attracted to women and we don’t like going to club-clubs. We also go on days and times when it’s mostly empty because we hate people, but I digress. She wanted to take me to our fav club as a belated bday present but then mentioned she was bringing a new friend (F or NB? 20’s or30’s) My description shows how much I know about her friend except that they are in the same radical socialist group together (which I did not join because they’re really pro gun and into militia stuff and I am not.) My friend is married to a man, who is totally pro “titties” as he calls it when we go to the club. (He prefers to stay at home with his kid.) I felt weird going to a strip club with a stranger because it’s kind of weirdly vulnerable, I think. I backed out of the strip club and we have decided on brunch (the two of us) but then it sounded like her socialist friend would accompany. I just want to spend 1:1 time with my friend because we haven’t caught up in months and additionally I don’t want to talk about politics since we differ, and I feel like that will just be annoying. I think my friend has a crush on the fellow socialist (although she’s monogamous and wouldn’t act on it) because she sent me photos of her saying “Isn’t she hot?” (She is.) I just think it’s odd she would keep taking this comrade with her when we’re trying to hang out together. Oh and I don’t have any romantic interest in my friend. This is a bit of platonic jealousy tbh but mostly this is just odd because she has never been insistent about bringing people places. tl;dr Was it a dick move to back out of strip club night because I don’t want to meet someone and then get lap dances?<|response|> NAH - do you think she’s trying to set you up with said friend (even with the differing political views)? <|endoftext|>
90605	2	AITA if I don’t want to see my untreated mentally ill family member over the holidays? My brother has multiple untreated mental disorders and my family wants me to bring my husband and children to the small holiday family gathering this year. I know that he is in a manic state right now and he has reached out recently to other family members about spiralling and feeling close to another psychotic break and that his voices are very loud right now. He refuses to seek treatment (doesn’t trust doctors, “immune” to medication, etc) and our parents don’t push it. My mom will probably be heartbroken and very angry with me if I don’t attend for this reason. Should I feel guilty for it? I don’t want to be around him when he’s manic - he’s not likely to be violent, but he says terrible things. My kids are young and don’t understand. I also think maybe if we show him we require him to get treatment, maybe it’s more likely he will try it? Or am I being the asshole and I should I be supportive during his difficult time and just deal with it?<|response|> NTA. You are not obligated to expose your family to that environment. Hope you have a nice peaceful low key Christmas. <|endoftext|>
87036	4	WIBTA if I don't let my ex's family stay with me for 10 days in a new lease? Without getting into too much breakup detail, there's a lot of complications here. We have a kid together, and I have lived with my ex's grandparents for years. Her Grandpa died recently, but had already sold the house with intent to move. Now they're moving somewhere else but have ~10 days before they can move in after the closing here. She broke up with me a couple weeks before her grandpa died (still trying to start healing tbh) and I just moved into my new apartment on Friday. She's been helping me with the cleaning, moving, etc., even with a broken foot. I'm fine storing some of their shit at my place, as it's actually bigger in terms of room space, but WIBTA if I don't let them (ex, mother, grandmother, and my daughter), all stay with me for the next two weeks, and possibly end up homeless (obviously not my daughter or her mom) or having to pay >$1k to stay elsewhere? And WIBTA if I let them, even though it would be at least one violation to my new leasing agreement (pets people parking)? Halp.<|response|> NAH but at the end of the day you are going to be in a relationship with these people for a long time due to your daughter. Your ex seems to be being mature about it and even helping you out. Is this the hill you want to die on by not doing her a favor in return? <|endoftext|>
138369	4	AITA for suggesting my mom get rid of her dog? Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my mom has a 95-pound shepherd mutt who’s been nothing but problematic... As a puppy, he was great. Social and sweet, but somewhere along the line, something snapped in him. He is friendly to his family, but will growl and bark and snap in crowds. Things took a turn for the worse two months after I had my son. We went over for a visit, and before we could even take our coats off, this dog shoved past us, put his nose into the car seat, and snapped at the blanket covering him. We left immediately. I was under the impression the dog would have been put away before we came in, but even after he had been locked behind a gate, he was growling and trying to get past it. My mom recently moved into a larger home, and insisted we try to come over one more time. She had him behind a heavy duty gate. I was bouncing and playing with my son, and he was squealing. The dog started up again, snarling and barking. My mom told me to... stop playing with my son and be calmer... being calm and quiet isn’t exactly in a baby’s skill set. A couple weeks back I suggested to my mom that maybe she should rehome him. This dog is taking over her life. She says she can’t be away from home more than two days in a row because it will upset him. The dog will attack her other two dogs if they get more attention than him. She has spent over $1000 on his medicines and psychiatry appointments for him (I kid you not... A dog psychiatrist.) She previously put him through a $500 training course. I understand loving an animal, but this is extreme. My mom, sister and father vehemently defend their decision to keep the dog. Saying that no one else would take in a dog with special needs, and that he’d inevitably be put down. But I think if he had a house where it was just him, no other pets and no kids, he would be much happier. And if not... maybe he should be put down if he’s that much of a threat to people. I don’t want to take my son over to their house anymore at this point. Am I the asshole for telling my mom that the dog needs to go? EDIT: The dog has injured her other pets in the past as well, including tearing open one of her dogs eyes, breaking another’s legs and trying to bite her parrot. (More in comments below.)<|response|> NTA. You aren't saying she should get rid of him because he smells or barks too much or is too hairy...He is dangerous! Dangerous to her other pets and to babies, kids, guests... If she could find him a home with adults only and no other pets it sounds like a better situation for everyone. I mean, the dog can't really be enjoying this, either. <|endoftext|>
55141	4	AITA for not going to my old best-friend's sisters funeral & not even reaching out to offer my condolences? Currently 25, met Graham 12 years ago. About Graham: has Asperger's, handles social situations very poorly, and has a very short fuse. There's been **many** incidents with Graham exploding. Looking back on them it's clear this wasn't normal, however growing up and being a young teenager none of us thought any different of it. A few that stick out: * Headbutted a hole in a door because he was stressed out about planning for a camping trip. (age: 16) * Two old high-school bullies were chirping him at a park, he chased them with his car and threatened them with a knife. He was arrested. (age:18) * Screamed at the top of his lungs at our other best friend, James, because he was asked to move his car and wouldn't. Tried to fight myself and James. (age: 18) * We were at a party and he began to jokingly chirp me, as guys do. I gave it back and he threw a tantrum, calling me names and threatening to punch me. (age: 19) * We were camping and he accidentally ripped his car mirror off on a tree trying to boost me. Que to swearing, screaming at the top of his lungs, calling people names, etc, even after I offered to pay for the replacement in full. (age: 19) * Cheated on Nicole with a girl from another state. Went on a week long trip to visit and have sex with her. (age: 20) When we were 20 Graham moved to another state to date the girl he cheated on his old GF with. He'd visit once a year and we'd all get together (old GF included, no hard feelings). At 23 Graham moved back home and things briefly went back to how they were. I started to notice how easily up-settable he was at this point. We went to a party - he was late showing up and thought we were laughing at him, making fun of him, and locked him out on purpose. The music was just loud. Que swearing, cursing, threatening to punch people. Night goes on, he gets into it with the house owner and gets kicked out over something. He storms out and drives off drunkenly, then texts me how shitty of a friend I am. At this point I had no idea what the fuck happened. After talking it over with my friends and now Fiance', I figure it's best to let this friendship burn out as he's quite toxic. I send a text the next morning saying I don't deserve to be spoken to that way. He apologizes and I don't talk to him for ~2 months until I run into him drunkenly at a bar where we make small talk. Another 2 months go by and out of nowhere he sends me an **eight page long** text that's hatemail, going on about how much he hates me, how horrible of a person I am, etc.<|response|> NTA, Asperger's is no excuse to act in such a hostile manner. Bereavement is always tough, but again, you had no idea and then he attacked you (a seemingly well-meaning friend) with eight pages of hate? No, leave him well alone. He sounds dangerous. <|endoftext|>
4624	3	AITA for not letting my roommate have a party? Currently in University and living off-campus with 4 other people that I’ve known for a couple of years. Recently, one of my roommates asked everyone else in the house if it would be okay to have a party in the basement sometime in the near future on a weekend and have a few of his friends bands play down there as sort of a goodbye present to senior year. Two of my roommates immediately gave a solid no and one gave a yes. There are some problems: - The basement is pretty small, might be able to accommodate 15 people max - There is the issue of cops coming if the party gets too loud. A few people in the house smoke weed and would rather not risk it being found by the cops. - It’s going to be loud regardless of whether or not the cops show up and people need their own rooms to be comfortable in. You can hear loud noises coming from the basement in every room. He has tried to address these concerns by saying things like he’d assume all responsibility and that he’d make sure there’s nothing illegal going on to make the cops show up, but even though he says he can make sure things don’t go badly, I don’t think there’s a 100% chance that he’ll be able to guarantee that, which is enough to keep me from giving my okay. I’m glad that he ran it by us so early, but it feels like he is already dead set on having people over. So am I the asshole for refusing to give the okay?<|response|> No. You guys voted, the answer was no, it’s no. He can’t legally assume responsibility for everything - if there’s drugs in the house and you live there, the cops can say you are involved. So, you made a rational decision based on your level of comfort. That’s good I think. You are not the asshole. <|endoftext|>
36519	2	AITA for cutting my grandfather and step-grandmother out of my life? Last year, my grandfather suffered from a brain injury that left him unable to speak, and while he was incapacitated, we discovered that $40,000 had been embezzled from a line of credit in his name. During this period of time, many avenues were explored and, as part of one of those, I was questioned by my family as a possible thief. To say this experience was painful is a dramatic understatement, but it’s a best verbiage I have about it right now. It later came out that my grandfather’s girlfriend, the woman who had acted as my grandmother for 25 years, was the one who stole the money, and who, in a panic about being found out (she blew all of it gambling at the Niagara Casino), implicated me and my cousins why is why I was questioned. Also along the way, she feigned innocence to her adult children and sicced them on my dad for “being a bully”, forged his (my dad’s) signature on some paperwork which seemed like she was trying to make it so the defaulted line of credit fell on him to pay back, and threatened to keep my dad/family at large from visiting. Although my grandfather’s girlfriend was revealed to be the thief, a fact she confessed on my uncle’s answering machine, my grandfather still lives with her and has decided to sweep the whole thing under the rug. When I tried to rebuild my relationship with him around Christmas (he thankfully recovered from the injury and is mobile and verbal again after many months in the hospital), he seemed to respond positively, but then I next heard about how he was ranting to family members at a family event I didn’t attend about how visiting with me was awful and how I (and the rest of my family) owe his girlfriend an apology because “(she’d) done nothing wrong” and that she “spent her entire life savings on his hospital bills,” a fact which is just a blatant lie since we live in Canada and we don’t get hospital bills like that here. She is also still apparently going to the casino. Since this incident, I have had no contact with my grandfather and expect to be estranged from him until he passes (he is currently 91). I am still very much processing my feelings about all of this and, I can’t lie, it’s still painful. I feel like an asshole to have completely given up my relationship with my grandfather and have been getting a lot of pressure to “buck up about it”, but also, I feel like I can’t expose myself to more of this toxicity. Am I the asshole here?<|response|> NTA You were accused of stealing 40,000 when the girlfriend did it and she’s forgiven while you aren’t? wild. <|endoftext|>
96551	2	AITA for saving an uncovered parking spot in my complex? so i live in a very big apartment complex. each apartment has one assigned parking spot in a covered spot, and there are uncovered parking spots for anyone to park in all around the complex. we have a covered spot, but there's 5 of us and my other four roommates have cars so three of them park in uncovered (totally allowed and what it's for). the later at night it gets, the harder it is to find an open spot. it was 10:30pm and my roommate needed to go pick up her boyfriend from work (~4 minutes away), but didn't want to lose her spot (if there's no spot in the complex, you have to park outside of it, minimum 10 minute walk just to the gate). what we ended up doing was she left and i sat down on the ground in the parking spot and smoked a cigarette so nobody would take it. she was gone NO longer than 10 minutes. about 3 minutes after she left, a car rolls through the gate and speeds up as soon as they see the open parking spot i'm in, thinking it's free. they slow down when they see me, and then stop and honk. i give them a thumbs down to indicate the spot is taken. they then roll down their window and tell me to move and that they're trying to park. i tell them that my friend has been parked here all day and that she'll be back in less than 10 minutes and i'm saving it for her. they then proceed to go off on me, yelling about how this isn't a high school cafeteria and you can't just save seats, how i'm what's wrong with our neighborhood (we live in one of the shittiest parts of phoenix? i'm the problem?), how i have no respect, how they ought to park anyway, whether i'm there or not. the whole time i'm just sitting there, smoking a cigarette, vibing and waiting for my friend to get back. they left before she got back, and we laughed about it, but now that i'm reflecting on it, AITA?<|response|> YTA why didn't you just move your car to the uncovered spot so your roommate could have the reserved spot when they got home? <|endoftext|>
130851	4	WIBTA if I report my coworker to INS?? So im a server at a restaurant. I have a coworker who is in his very late 20's and he makes my shifts a living hell. He's rude arrogant and a bully. I talk to my managers and ask to not be scheduled with him, but they wont listen and say theres nothing they can do about it. Anyways, I know for a fact that he is here illegally. He is here on an expired student visa. I'm just trying to pay my way through college and I really like this job because its close and the money is good, but I dread going to work because im always scheduled with him. So reddit, WIBTA if I reported him??<|response|> Yes YTA don't ruin someone's life. Document how he bullies you, if it is serious show it to your manager. If they still do nothing, you don't want to work there anyway, they don't care about you. Getting someone possibly deported won't fix that. <|endoftext|>
24928	4	AITA for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents? My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months. They are both 16. Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.) Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening. I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready. The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine. It's her house. Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity. He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed. Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF? And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'. (not under the covers, the door open etc.) They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? ) Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30. Whatever. Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling. Well, today she came over for the first time. The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me. I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call. My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me. Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband. I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times. My husband agreed. Thing is, we don't really care. I was sexually active at a younger age than them. My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc. He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with. They have been sexually active with each other already. (teens will find a way!) Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection. My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin. (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.) Good friend laughed and agreed. Turns out it wasn't needed. Dad eventually came and picked her up. I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have<|response|> ESH. I mean, their rules are draconian and I wouldn't want to have them as my parents, but I would really hate to entrust my kid to someone who not only lies to me about what my kid is doing, but does so with a sneer in my direction. It's likely that not everybody agrees with the parenting rules you set down, but that doesn't mean they have the right to push your son to break them. Would you want your kid in the care of someone like that? <|endoftext|>
100940	2	AITA for ending a friendship over my friend cheating on her boyfriend? Natasha and I met in school, where we quickly became close and started hanging out one-on-one. We’d often talk about relationships, and at the time I met her she had a boyfriend. They met in the same school (University) we were all attending, but he was an exchange student. After being together for months, he went back to his home country to continue his studies. They had a pact that they’d remain together, and once she was done with her studies, she’d move to his home country (she also had plans to visit him during the summer). Weeks pass and Natasha often times expressed that she missed the physical connection she had, and that long distance has been difficult for her. She still claimed she loved her boyfriend at this time. One night, she texts me drunk at the club stating that she hopes she doesn’t do anything stupid that night at the club. I expressed my concern, and she messaged me the next morning informing me that she had slept with another man. My immediate thought was disgust, as I couldn’t believe one of my close friends was capable of doing something so atrocious. However, I talked to her for a long time, still stayed by her side and convinced her to let her boyfriend know. She did, and he broke up with her. I kept more distance from her from this point on, but still remained friends with her. I stopped going clubbing after I was accepted into my program. Natasha continued to go clubbing often, and on another night out, she hooked up with a man that her best friend showed interested in prior to Natasha and him hooking up. That ended their friendship, and I began to question Natasha’s intentions. Natasha and I haven’t kept in contact since she told me about that incident. I believed that we didn’t share the same values and that’s what ultimately led me to keep my distance from her altogether. I understand that these events that happened aren’t directly related to me, and therefore, I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to have ended the friendship based on circumstances that I wasn’t involved in. EDIT: I don’t personally know her ex-boyfriend or her friend<|response|> NTA. You are who you surround yourself with <|endoftext|>
152184	3	AITA for being critical with an intern? I own a small chain of tire shops in my county and the adjacent one. We have six stores in total and I work out of the main one in my small town. We have a lot of different jobs and a lot of experience to be earned because of that-we have inventory in every store, several large machines to operate, and each store has different office positions. Mine, for instance, has a management department, billing, customer support, legal, etc. We do accept unpaid interns for office work occasionally, but only by application and usually not in the main store. I just don't have the patience for it usually. The main store is much larger than the others and I'm not only working in the main store-I have constant correspondence with the other managers to make sure there aren't any problems that don't get resolved ASAP. Add an unskilled intern requiring training? No thanks. However, an old friend of mine who is prominent in the community approached me directly about his daughter's application. And like I said, small town. Even if the guy wasn't a long-time friend, public opinion is big for staying afloat in small areas and I'm not trying to burn any bridges. So I looked over her application, and it was good enough I'd probably have accepted her to another store, so I took her in. She's nineteen, full-time college (mostly online), and has no paying job, so she's basically interning whenever I let her. And she's not awful, per se, but it's clear she's never worked a day in her life. She didn't know how to file, she's never answered a phone with a professional greeting, she didn't know how time cards work... It's been a slow process of teaching her things I don't usually have to teach my employees, and it's been aggravating because I still have the stress of my real employees making legitimate mistakes and not knowing how to fix it. As I suspected, I don't have the time or patience for a kid living off her parent's money and who doesn't have any real workable skills. This last week was especially stressful after a manager in another store quit suddenly, and I had even less patience for this girl. Most days I ended up dismissive, and one day I yelled at her over a very stupid mistake in filing (which she's made twice now, and once is more than enough). I mean, it's filing-it doesn't take a lot of brainpower. That day her dad messaged me saying she came home in tears and while he understands the "tough boss" approach, he'd appreciate it if I could lighten up since it's her first internship and she's young. I'm honestly tempted to message him back saying if she can't handle a work environment, she should quit-I'm not mistreating her, and if anything I think I've been lenient in teaching her common sense skills. My husband has suggested that this is not only a grievous misstep in handling our relationship,<|response|> YTA. For example, "yelled at her" for a filing mistake is not reasonable. You knew what you were signing up for with an intern. If you can't have patience with a newbie that is a you problem not a her problem. <|endoftext|>
134420	3	WIBTA if I told my best friend I refuse to do group projects with anyone, even her? I’m on mobile, so sorry for any errors. My best friend and I have the same first hour class. She has been my best friend for about 3-4 years now, and she’s like a sister to me. I’ve had terrible experiences with group projects in the past, one experience was a group project with three other people, one of the people being her. Long story short, her section was very rushed and poorly researched. Another person in the group was pretty useless and I’ve had a grudge against group projects ever since. The project I will be focusing is the final project of the semester before Summer break with no redos, as it was due the Friday before finals. The project was worth 75 points, 50 being for the presentation itself and the other 25 points going towards presenting it to the class with the necessary materials. We divided the two sections up and did equal amounts of work for the entire project. We received our grade and were fairly happy with it. However, she didn’t finish the presentation until one in the morning. Normally I wouldn’t be mad at her, as I’ve let projects go until the last minute too. The reason I’m mad is because she promised the day before it was due she would have it fully completed by a reasonable time because we had a time limit on the presentation we were worried about going over (I added way to much information and take full cr Normally I would I have no doubts and be straight up and tell the person I refuse to do group projects. But I don’t want to make it seem like I’m holding a grudge against her, which I’ve been pegged for in the past. Plus, she’s literally my best friend. I’ve already low key mentioned it to her, but she’s blown it off as me joking. So I genuinely want to know, WIBTA if I refused to work with my best friend in group projects for the foreseeable future?<|response|> NTA Just say you've had too many bad experiences and it's not worth the stress. Yes, the bad experience with her counts as one of them, but it's not just her, it's everyone and enough is enough. <|endoftext|>
60492	4	WIBTA if I lose it on a coworker? I(27f) do NOT get along with my coworker (60s f). Truthfully I'm not in high school and don't want drama, she thrives on it. Two years ago I got an email from my boss saying hey we need someone to learn coworkers job and you're the first person we thought of, would you be interested? Being a huge people pleaser I said sure. Since then it's been horrible for me. I got warned by every person in the building how difficult she is. I figure she can't truly be that bad so I stick it out. Guys biggest mistake ever. I have been yelled at, she's refusing to teach me anything new as then she won't be as useful, and at this point people are asking me why I'm still here. I have a medical condition that causes me to not be good most of the time. I'm there and putting 150% but you can tell I'm in pain. She admits she uses the same condition to get out of work because she doesnt want to work. My main issue is she won't do her job. I'm supposed to do all the stuff, except for the stuff she refuses to show me that she'll do later. Main problem is the phones. We're supposed to answer them, set appointments, answer questions. She'll watch it ring or hover her hand over it and won't touch it because it's not her job. Well heres the thing. When I started I said I'd never do phones, I'm petrified of them. I started slowly doing them and now I'm on them six days a week. I have a legit fear of them due to an ex that magically has found me before and I'm petrified he will again. She just hates them. I do two hours a day during the week on phones to cover lunch for everyone. She goes to lunch for an hour of that comes back and will refuse to touch them if they ring. My job is to help I'm not supposed to answer every call. WIBTA if she refuses to answer the phone if i tell her to do her job, that I'm not there to do the stuff she doesn't want to do, and because of her I feel like a failure because it's been over 2 years and I barely know 60% of the job? I'm at the end of my rope and can't wait until she's gone. Update! I took all your advice and decided as mad as I am I took the high road. I talked to a coworker who said to go to our boss (different than hers as I'm technically just a borrowed employee). Well I caught her as she was coming in and we kinda came to an agreement of sorts. As long as we get the manager and director to agree I'll be taking over our sister place and doing the warranty for there. Which means coworker is gonna be mad at them not needing her<|response|> YWBTA because you're better than "losing it." You have clearly listed your issues here for our grand judgement, and you absolutely should do the same for her. Be clear, calm, and firm about how she's falling short and how she needs to change. If she doesn't shape up, speak to your superiors. Don't let this devolve into an interpersonal dispute and potentially damage your own reputation at work. <|endoftext|>
193661	4	AITA 18 yr old, bar, driving I’ve always taught my kids to drink”responsibly”. We showed them that we don’t encourage drinking but know “banning” it won’t help anything so instead we gave them their first tastes of alcohol (they chose when, we never forced them to) and stress the importance of safety. So onto the night in question. My daughter (18) and her 21 year old friend went to a bar. 18s the legal age to enter (though my daughters been into family owned bars without us since she was 15 so she’s not new to the environment) and they can drink in them with a parent guardian or spouse that’s 21+. Well obviously that night my daughter didn’t fit into those categories but she had a few drinks anyway. A third friend, 19, was supposed to met them and drive them all to my house to sleep. She wasn’t going to drink. She had a family emergency and texted their friend explaining that she can’t go and said if they can’t find another ride to call her and she’ll find them one. My daughter called me and explained then asked if I could pick them up in an hour. I confirmed where she was (she told me beforehand and previously gave me her info to track her phone in case I ever feel I need to) I had friends over and told them this. One said that I’m a bad parent and she shouldn’t even be in a bar even though that parts legal. I asked her if she feels that banning drinking works. She said no but it’s not right to encourage it. I asked her if she’d rather my daughter get in a car with her friend that was drinking (they left her car at the bar and picked it up the next day, just like they planned) she said no. So I asked her what she thinks I should’ve done. She was silent. The conversation changed and everything was fine. I picked up my daughter and her friend when the time came and my friend gave them dirty looks the whole time they passed through the room. I noticed and said (with the intention of annoying my friend) “We’ll pick up your car tomorrow after we make breakfast. I’m glad you called me instead of driving” She got even more annoyed. The next day my other friend said I should’ve just let our original friend say what she wanted and ignored her. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here but AITA?<|response|> NTA. I would do the same for my kids. Being there for her doesn’t mean you condone it. I applaud you. <|endoftext|>
142217	2	AITA for accidentally smoking pot around children? I (25f) live in an apartment in LA with my boyfriend (26m). We’ve been in the complex for a little over a year now. There are about 10 units in the building, all different races and ages live here—a brother and sister, a couple of guys around our age, some families with kids, some older people. On our side of the building, everyone has a balcony or patio; we are on the second floor and often sit out on our balcony. The sidewalk below us, between our building and the next, is visible most of the time from where we’re sitting. The issue: my boyfriend and I are pretty big pot smokers. Smoking is not allowed in or around the building, but I know people in at least two of the other units smoke pot, and a bunch of men smoke cigarettes outside & in the stairwells, including the father who lives beneath us with his two girls and wife. So last night, I got home from work around 9pm and we go out to the balcony to enjoy the bong—it’s Friday night, after all. Now, we NEVER smoke when the children are outside, but sometimes it’ll happen that we start smoking and THEN the kids come out and start playing, in which case we start freaking out, try to wave the smoke away, go inside, etc. So of course last night, the girls came outside a few minutes after we had been smoking. It’s about 9:10 at this point, and my boyfriend & I are just sitting in the chairs chatting, we hide the bong and obviously don’t smoke anymore since the kids are out. The girls are playing on the sidewalk downstairs, and after a few minutes the mom comes out and is talking to them in Armenian. I hear one of the girls ask, “why are there people upstairs?” The mom says a bit loudly in English, “they are smoking,” and brings the girls inside a minute later. We both felt really bad. Got that sinking feeling of, well, “AITA? Are we the shitty stoners in the building who everyone hates?” A couple things make me second guess, though. Her own husband smokes enough (cigs, not pot) that it comes up to our apartment, so it must affect their own children. Also don’t forget that we’re in LA. Pot is legal, a lot of people smoke it... and it’s Friday night! Late enough that we obviously didn’t expect there to be children outside. I love children, have worked with them for 10+ years, I am even fond of these girls in particular. We always say hi to them when they’re playing outside and sometimes they tell us about what they’re playing, sometimes I bring our kitten outside to let them pet. I hate thinking we’re the bad guys here. Part of me wants to dismiss the mom, I can judge her for a few things myself; my boyfriend said during the earthquake last night the kids were all running around outside on<|response|> I’m really debating between N A H and YTA. The building explicitly says “no smoking”. <|endoftext|>
34351	4	AITA for preventing my husband from getting the car that he wants? My husband and I have one car and two motorcycles. We both work outside the home full time; I commute on foot and by bike and am happy doing this. My husband commutes by car and by motorcycle. My husband really wants another car but I just don't see the point. He doesn't want to get the car if I'm not into it; thus, no new car. He's sad about it. We could afford the new car but I'd rather spend the money on other things. AITA? Recently my husband got excited about getting a particular used car. It's a 4-wheel drive vehicle with lots of capacity, which my husband greatly prefers to our smaller 2-wheel drive road-oriented car. We could afford it -- we have the money in the bank -- but we're also about to reno our kitchen and I'd really like to have the extra money available in case it's needed to complete the reno (these things seem to go over budget a lot). My husband asked me what I think about it, and I told him I don't think we need a new car, and if we get it then we should sell his motorcycle to help pay for it. He seems pretty sad at the idea of selling his motorcycle, even if he starts commuting full-time in the new car, so he gave up the idea of getting the new car. He ties up his identity in being a motorcycle commuter (even if he wants to switch to mostly driving) and I think selling the motorcycle would make him give up that idea of himself. I feel like an asshole for not letting him get the car that he wants especially since we can do it without breaking the bank. He often tells me that he feels like he can't stand up to me about financial issues and has to always just do what I want. Reddit, AITA?<|response|> NAH. It's not an asshole issue, it's a communication issue. YOu need to both work out finances so that you're on the same page about spending. Fun money, emergency money, etc. So that he can spend guilt free and you don't have to monitor him. And if he can't "stand up to" you, while you're not being manipulative, that's an issue he needs to solve by speaking up instead of resentfully bowing to you. A couple's counselor can help if this is an issue. <|endoftext|>
108457	2	AITA For refusing to take my girlfriend to a concert after she invited me and then uninvited me? TL;DR at the bottom. Ok so... I’ve been with my girlfriend now for almost 4 years and things are great. We have our ups and downs but hey who doesn’t. Recently she invited me to go to a concert with her in a town that’s 4 hrs away, I said of course I would go and everything was fine, we booked tickets, parking, etc. (our plan was to drive down and back home straight after the concert) flash forward 4 months to 2 weeks before the concert and she turns around and says I can’t go anymore because she wants to go with her other girlfriends, so I’m like that’s cool, I’ll just stay home. But she asks me if I will drive her and her friends down to this concert 4 hrs away, then sit in the car and wait in the car park for her for another 4 hrs and then drive 4 hrs home. I say no and she looses her mind, saying that I’m a horrible boyfriend and why won’t I take her down to this concert and sit in the car, in a car park and wait for 4 hrs with nothing to do. She goes on being cranky at me for a week about it until eventually I give in and say I’ll drive her and wait, but her and her friends have to chip in for fuel. But then she gets cranky all over again saying no. I “offered” to take her so I should pay the fuel. So now I’m sitting in a car park, it’s 8pm. I’ve been here since 6pm wondering. AITA? TL;DR - My girlfriend of 4 years invited then uninvited me to a concert and then expected I drive her 4 hrs there, wait 4 hrs then drive 4 hrs back UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your input, After a lot of thinking, today I made the decision to break up with her, it was hard and the next little while is gonna really suck. But I can see that it was the right thing to do. As someone said it was one of those “I can see how crazy this is now that I’m not apart of it anymore” moments, and just didn’t realise at the time. As they say. Hindsight is 20/20 Now that I’ve broken up with her I can also now see some of the things she used to do could be also classed as domestic violence, so once again. Thank you everyone.<|response|> NTA She's a manipulative arsehole though! <|endoftext|>
35415	4	AITA for being mad at my parents for being uninterested grandparents? Growing up, I had amazing grandparents. They were super involved in our lives, babysat regularly, and had sleepovers at their house all the time. They even took us on a couple trips. This was my normal. As I got older, my parents made comments about looking forward to being grandparents some day and after I got married, they were always wondering when a baby was coming (not in an obnoxious way). They even put in a pool in their back yard to “prepare for the next stage of life.” Then, I had a baby. Comments made by them in the past had me thinking that my mom would be willing to watch the baby while I worked part time. She said she didn’t feel up to it, and thought daycare would be a better fit. Sure, ok. Then, I’d call and ask them to babysit for whatever reason, and they were usually busy, or not feeling well, or tired, or some other excuse. I tried talking to them about it, and they said “we enjoy babysitting, but we like spending time with all of you the most.” Ok... My oldest is 10 now, and he has spent the night at their house once, and they have babysat probably 15 times total. When he was 3, his father and I divorced. The lack of babysitting and interest in his life wasn’t as noticeable because he was at his dad’s house half the time. I remarried and had another baby 2 years ago. The trend has continued. They see us about once every 2-3 months and have babysat twice. I asked if they could watch the kids while my husband and I went on a weekend getaway, and they said that they don’t think it would be a good idea. “It’s too tiring.” (They are still in their 50’s, and my dad is prepping now for his second marathon. They are more active and fit than I am.) I’ve tried to accept that they are just not interested, but it’s hard. My friends all drop their kids off for weekends with grandma all the time. My mom’s best friend hosts “camp grandma” once a year, complete with matching shirts and trips to theme parks. It’s so sad to me that my kids won’t ever get that. So, reddit, AITA? I’m honestly hoping that if I am being an asshole, someone can provide me some logic that will convince me to stop feeling this way. I don’t want to resent them, but I can’t seem to get there on my own. Edit 2: I know I could hire a babysitter. We do. It’s not the money. We are lucky enough to have well paying jobs that make our lives comfortable. I just want *them* to want to do it. Ugh. It’s hard to explain why it’s so hard for me to accept that they don’t.<|response|> NAH (yet). They're not obligated to do any of the things you expected, despite them generally being the norm socially. I'd definitely have a sit down and talk things over with them, but phrase it more in a sense of "I want the kids to be able to know their grandparents" rather than "you need to take them occasionally because family" <|endoftext|>
187820	5	AITA for not blowing smoke up my husband’s ass? Throwaway since DH has a reddit. My husband want to be a writer and I try to support him in every way I can. I tell him how good I think his writing is all of the time and make sure he has his space to do his thing (our office became his office). I think he is an amazing writer, however, he doesn’t appreciate the feedback I give him about his work. It’s to the point that he doesn’t let me read it anymore. I will say that I am very honest regarding my feedback of his work but I would never tell him it is bad because it isn’t. I do tell him however whether something feels run on or if there is an inconsistency or if something feels cliched for the genre. Every time I give him feedback however, he acts as if I am ripping apart his manuscript and wiping my ass with it. I refuse to tell him that there is nothing wrong with it and that I don’t see a single thing he could improve upon. I guess my point is, am I the asshole for not stroking his ego on this?<|response|> If he asked for critique, then NTA. If he was just showing it to you, looking for support, then NAH because you were trying to be honest and he was just looking for someone to get as excited about his writing as he was. All in all, I don't think you're wrong for wanting to help him grow. <|endoftext|>
55507	4	AITA for being upset with my soon-to-be former roommate My roommate of two years and I recently moved to our city's downtown to be closer to our work. Our area is a little sketchy, but so far it's been ok. However, my roommate has started to feel really uncomfortable and decided she wanted to move out. I get why she doesn't feel safe in the area, but she did it in a way that just really threw me under the bus. So, I got assaulted by a woman in the street (wasn't hurt and called the police, it was a shock but I've kind of just realized I need to be more vigilant), and the next day she told me she's moving out in September with her friends about 10 minutes away. She said I could move in with my boyfriend or she could find a sub-letter (essentially, leaving me to live with a stranger while she lives with friends), but she would be out by the end of August. I told her that she was being unfair, only giving me a month to figure out accommodations and leaving me to live in a place that makes both of us feel unsafe. When I asked if we could try to find a place together and try to break our lease (later learned that we can't, we don't really have grounds), she said no because of a fight we had earlier that month (which I thought we had talked over and moved past). I told her it will be better in the winter, the heat of the summer mixed with people only drinking beer makes them crazier than normal, and that we're still safe in our home (no break ins and we can always shut our curtains). I also told her she's not moving to an area that's not much better, just not on a main road, so she'll have similar issues. I can't change her mind and I don't want her to stay in a place that makes her uncomfortable, but I'm upset with how she went about it. Basically not giving me a lot of notice and not considering what would happen to me (she's been my closest friends for 2 1/2 years). I was able to figure out people to move in with, so the situation is solved, but I don't know if I want to really be friends with her anymore. Our old roommate told me I shouldn't be upset with her because the situation is solved and it's just that I am more used to living downtown of a big city. I'm upset because she decided to drop a ball on me and gave me little choice whether I wanted to stay (at the end of the day, I'm the one who has assaulted). So, AITA for being upset with how my soon-to-be roommate handled this and not wanting to be friends with her when she's moved out? Edit: Just to clarify, both of our names are on the lease, so she essentially expected me to pick up<|response|> NAH - she has the right to make a choice for her safety, and if she was already uncomfortable, having you be attacked was obviously terrifying enough to her to make it untenable. You have the right to be upset, she is seriously screwing you over on the finance department (particularly if you were the only one whose name was on the lease, which based on the above it sounds like was the case), but she's not doing it for no reason. I'm sorry you are stuck in this situation, and not wanting to be her friend given all this makes total sense, but it doesn't make either of you the asshole. <|endoftext|>
14362	3	WIBTA if I didn't invite my stepmoms mom to my wedding? **For background** My stepmoms (we'll call step mom K for ease of reading) mom has always rubbed me the wrong way. She always seems to be nice, but kinda fake nice, like she's just tolerating me because my dad married her daughter. K and i have a great relationship, no issues to date (abiut 11 and half years.) A few years back, the thing that really got me riled up, was that she invited everyone except me to go to Hawaii. They never did end up going, but she said they would go, and that she would pay for the whole thing. I wasn't even on the invite list, but I was asked if, when they did go, i could come feed and water the five dogs that would be left behind. I wouldn't have been able to go anyways, due to work and money concerns at the time, but the invite would've been nice. My dad was super pissed about this, because he believes very strongly in family ties, and that family, all family, is important and should be respected. After this incident, I've kept little to no contact with K's mom. **The issue** I'm now engaged, and the wedding is in June of 2019. As I've no inclination of dealing with K's mom, I asked my dad if I needed to invite her. My dad said it would be the right thing to do, so i think I'm going to do it. But i really don't want to. So, Reddit, I'm asking. Would i be the asshole in the scenario?<|response|> NTA It's your special day. Not someone else's. But she might resent you for not inviting her, and you will have to live with that, even if it seems unfair. <|endoftext|>
184461	3	AITA for dumping my son's ice cream out On our way back from a Dr I stopped to get us ice cream at a DQ for him (2 yo) doing a good job and behaving. I ordered a blizzard for me and a "mini or less amount of vanilla" in a large cup for my son. I drove up, paid, got the blizzard flip, then out came the large cup. Filled. To. The. Top. Probably 3-4 inches over the top actually. The window person said "I gave him extra!" and handed it over. All I could think of was him getting that all over... everything... in the car. I flipped it over and dropped it out on the pavement below and drove off. Not to make the poor kid sad, I did pull over and share some of mine, but there was no way I was going to give him a heaping tub of ice cream unattended in the back seat.<|response|> YTA. You couldn't have simply handed it back to them and said something like "That's so thoughtful, but he's only 2 so he can't handle this much ice cream. I wanted to larger cup just so he could stay clean." Your need to make a spectacle about it makes you TA. <|endoftext|>
31021	2	AITA for wanting to leave my boyfriend for giving me an STI? EDIT: it’s not a serious STI. It’s perfectly curable and everything will be back to normal in a few weeks. But it still itches and hurts and I still had to tell my conservative parents about it, who are now not speaking to me. We’re both 20 and been together for 3 months. He told me before we started dating that he had casual sex with a “friend” without protection and I pretty much gave him a lecture. I said it’s pretty irresponsible to trust that she is having protected sex with everyone else she casually fucks, and also he could get her pregnant. He seemed to understand my point and said he would stop. So well. He has erection issues and they are aggravated with the use of condoms, so we ended up having unprotected sex. I’m not dodging responsibility here, it’s also my fault for not strictly demanding condoms until he got tested, but here I am with a fucking STI. I don’t want to judge people who are infected and I would hate to be judged for it in the future, but I can’t help it but resent him. Because I fucking told him. And I’ve only had 3 partners in my life, and he’s the only one I’ve had sex without protection. So it has to be him. I’m on the verge of breaking up but I feel like an asshole because it feels like I’m judging people with STIs and him on a dumb mistake. Aside from this he is a really good boyfriend and I could see myself marrying this man. TL;DR: am I the asshole for resenting my otherwise great boyfriend for giving me an STI?<|response|> ESH He sucks for not getting tested before having sex with you. You aren't in any position to lecture him about unprotected sex and resent him for giving you an STI when you literally had unprotected sex with him knowing that he'd had unprotected sex with someone else before you. How could you lecture him about that and then do the exact same thing he did? <|endoftext|>
190250	3	AITA for lying to my mother about meeting boyfriend's parents? I have been dating my boyfriend for about four months now. At about the three month mark I went to his house for the first time and chatted briefly with his parents. It was not a formal sit-down dinner or anything of the sort. Now, my mother has asked me if I have met his parents. I lied and said no. My reason for doing so is that she is a deeply competitive person. She always feels she must be the first to attain a certain milestone, and I am 95% certain she will use this information as leverage to demand to meet my boyfriend herself, in turn. I know how the meeting will go down. My mother has a particular fondness for relating embarrassing anecdotes about me (e.g. when I got lost on the subway) to anyone who will listen. She has done this with my aunt, our maid, my tutor, her coworkers, and more than I care to recall. I do understand my boyfriend will eventually have to meet her. I hope to delay this till at least the summer, when we are a little more established, and he is less likely to be scared away.<|response|> NTA but, as someone else has said, this may be better on a relationship sub. If you can get over your feelings of embarrassment, I'd say tell him all of the stories before they meet, that'll take the wind out of her sails somewhat! <|endoftext|>
19767	4	AITA for picking my neighbors lemons without asking? We had new neighbors move in behind us about a month ago. Since we wanted to make lemonade, we picked about 7 lemons. Now these lemons were on our side of the wall, so we didn't climb on or over the wall to get the lemons. Our new neighbors must have seen us or saw the tree moving, because an hour later we saw the neighbors picking the ENTIRE tree bare. After this, we never heard or saw them again. Our old neighbors didn't care, so I guess we just assumed they would be okay with it as well. P.S. The tree was about 20 feet tall.<|response|> The tree legalities aside, how about this. You did something you've done several times before. Your new neighbor saw it for the first time and responded in a defensive way. Obviously, from their point of view, something was not good. So, knock on their door. Make nice and apologize if you have offended them. Feel free to let them know the old neighbors encouraged picking up the lemons and it didn't even cross your mind that your actions would upset them. You may even wish to offer them some store bought lemons to replace the ones you took. My recommendation is that you overwhelm them with kindness. Let them either become friends or expose themselves as something else. NAH <|endoftext|>
166320	4	AITA For drawing on a persons face with permanent marker? So, today my school had a volleyball prep-rally. One of my friends brought these permanent marker things, like those ones that look fancy that you can get at Michaels. So this girl right next to me, I'll call her Beyoncé. Beyoncé told me to draw on her face with the markers. So I did. I drew smiley faces on her face and wrote "HI" on her forehead. Also I drew a weird mustache under her nose. Then my friend, I'll call him Bobito. Only then did Bobito tell us that it was permanent (I didnt know it was, I thought it was the ones that washed off.) She went to the bathroom, and it didn't wash off. So then she went around telling people that I drew all of that stuff on her face, without her telling me to, and she apparently just stood there and did nothing. Then she told a teacher on me, telling her that she didn't want me to add it and I just did it. I got some of the marker on me, I washed my hands alot and it still barely hasn't come off, even with only hot water and soap. AITA? *Edit: The rest of the marker that was on my hand came off in the shower.*<|response|> NTA. You didn't know it was permanent and had no intention of doing this purposefully. To be honest though, it was kind of a dumb thing to do, and she's right to be pissed. You definitely should have asked your friend about the markers before drawing on someone's face. <|endoftext|>
19853	1	AITA for not wanting to speak to family the stole thousands from me and got away with it. My father was given my grandmothers house. My father put my aunt on the house too as he felt bad she was not included in the will. Aunt passed away and because her name was half on the house it paid off the mortgage(a very small one for repairs). House then had her 2 daughters named added. My dad lived in the house from the day my grandmother passed, my aunt planned on building on the property(100 acres) on retirement which is why she was happy her name was on it too. My father passed away. My stepmother continued to live in the house. Me and my cousins communicated often regarding the house and my stepmom living there and not taking care of the house or paying taxes. All conversations mentioned the house was all 4 of ours..my 2 cousins and me and my brother. My dad from the time my aunt passed away repeatedly said the house is between the four of us and the cousins never debated this. Well, until they sold the house and took the entire profit for themselves ($60,000). They knew financially I could not fight it in court as in Canada this cannot go to small claims. The fun part, the house taxes were never paid by my stepmom, so the house went up for tax sale. I informed my cousins as they do not live near by. I called the tax office and they said the house was only in one cousins name. At that point the house was sold and the agreement was the profit would be divided. After fees, taxes, travel, moving costs, lawyers, the profit was to be divided. It was casually mentioned by them daily it was the 4 of ours. I am angry they did not divide it. They feel they are in the right and did nothing wrong, called me money hungry when I asked about my share. We have not spoken in 4 years. I feel that they led me to believe there would be no issue and the house would be divided evenly without question. Why this bothers me is I loved my cousins up until then. After that they were so cold about everything and denied it was ever mine. I guess they knew all along but I didn't, why talk for years like its ours? This week their father passed away. He was sweet and kind, no hard feelings there. Oddly enough they distanced themselves as he stole money from his mom. I want to message them and say sorry for your loss. I am, but I really don't want to speak with them. If they would admit wrong doing maybe...but... I want to forgive them but I just cannot. They both inherited half a million from an aunt, they did not need they extra 30,000. It would have helped me and my family greatly. I honestly cannot get rid of my disgust for them. Do I<|response|> NTA,for all I would care they could go fuck themselves <|endoftext|>
68646	3	AITA for calling out another mother? Here goes, names have been changed. I’m a mother of a 14 yr old girl. Lola. On the last day of school, another classmate, Kendra, asked my daughter what she was doing after school. Lola had no plans. She struggles to make friends. So Kendra invites Lola to hang with her. Kendra’s friends planned on hanging at Mel’s house. During lunch, Kendra asks Mel if Lola can hang with them at her house. Mel flat out says no in front of Lola. Kendra tells her mom about the Situation after school. Kendra’s mom knows Mel’s mom, Kate, so she calls her up asking if Lola really isn’t allowed to come- they all hang within the same crowd. Keep in mind that Kate is a licensed therapist for a living. Her response? “it’s not a good idea for Lola to come. Don’t you think they’d be taking pity on her. Lola made her bed, now she needs to sleep in it.” My daughter Lola overheard this unfortunately. So, I write Kate a message: “Hi Kate, From what I’ve been hearing, Lola and Mel seems to have some tension between them two. Would you happen to know what this stems from? Is it dance related? Is there something that can be done to help these girls come to terms? As far as Lola goes, she’s said that Mel has just never liked her. Lola has her flaws, just like any child. She does need to work on proper social skills, but please understand, her only role model growing up was me. I missed out on a lot due to deafness and I was not able to correct her at times she needed it. I’m not making excuses for her, as she’s maturing now, she knows better than to be rude. I didn’t realize when she was younger how much my deafness impacted her life and mine as well to be quite honest. I will say though, she is a good child. Last spring, she wanted to have her friends over. She asked if she had to invite everyone in the group chat. I said I would prefer it because it hurts when one is left out. Be the big person and be kind. It’s up to the other person if they want to come or not. This person she was talking about was your daughter, Kate. Ive never approved of her talking about Mel in a negative manner and in fact, I’ve encouraged her to come to terms with Mel. Apologize if you did her wrong in the past. She still says that she doesn’t know what exactly she did for Mel to not like her so she doesn’t know what to apologize for. I will be honest. She knows exactly what you’ve said about her on the last day of school. She is hurt. I am hurt. I’m sorry you feel this way about her. We are good people. I’ve always thought, even if a child had flaws that I didn’t approve of, that instead of shunning<|response|> YTA she isn't bullying her or anything she just doesn't want to be her friend. it happens to all of us you literally can't force someone to be friends with your child .welcome to the real world were everyone isn't going to your friend or you're not entitled to everything <|endoftext|>
6813	4	AITA for telling my husband I won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again? I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. Over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. It all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. We had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. Finally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. When we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I<|response|> NTA You probably shouldn't have been put in that situation to begin with if your husband was unable to go on the trip, it immediately put you in an awkward and unenviable position. It sounds like Alicia has been spoiled by both her parents and doesn't hear the word "no" very often, if at all. She has proven that she has both her birth parents wrapped around her finger and can manipulate both of them with ease. The fact that neither of her parents see anything wrong with anything she did tells me that they are more concerned with complying with her every whim than they are with actually parenting her. <|endoftext|>
152222	4	AITA for hanging up on my dad and considering limited contact? I know the title is simple but it is a lot more than just that. A few weeks ago on vacation with him he got really drunk every night, got in a fight and was ready to square up with me. After that everything has been decent but sometimes a bad night. Anyway just thirty minutes ago he called me yelling, something he only does when drunk. Anyway after he said "Fuck you." I hung up, here is how I see it. He has always told me to respect my parents but when one of them is acting like a child that respect is lost. After I hung up on him he texted me "You are out of my will." Which is fine, I am not expecting a single thing from him when he dies but I feel he is showing his asshole characters and it is reason to limit contact. AITA for this?<|response|> NTA, you can choose who you keep in your life, haven't contacted my biological father in 8 years after he did something similar(getting drunk watching TV and yelling when we were supposed to go to the pool) <|endoftext|>
77843	4	AITA for asking people to stop singing? For over a year now, whenever someone is singing in my presence, wether it be through Playstation voice chat or someone right next to me, I ask them to stop. I'm not sure how to describe the feeling, but simply put, it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm currently being tested for Autism as I've been bothered by lights and sounds a lot, though my therapist says it could also just be my PTSD. The people usually singing around me are my Partner and my little sister. Sometimes it's along to the radio, sometimes it's spontaneous. Whenever this happens, I ask them to stop, letting them know it's bothering me. This happens very often and makes me feel extremely guilty. But the thing is that whenever something makes me feel uncomfortable, a touch, a sound, I can't help but speak out. Now I was wondering, from an outside perspective, AITA for asking people to stop singing each and every time they do?<|response|> Yta, Only because from this small snippet of information, it sounds as if when you get uncomfortable, you "speak out" and you expect the other person to change what they are doing to satisfy you. Outside of being tested, what are you doing to fix yourself or make yourself comfortable, you can not rely on other people changing what they are doing to suit your needs, that is not the real world. Furthermore, the example of the radio, it makes it sound as if the radio playing songs is ok, but people singing with it is not? wtf? <|endoftext|>
36576	3	AITA for telling my boyfriend he has two weeks to get out of my house Posting on an old alt because he knows my main In March I (27f) started dating a new guy (24m) (on the thirteenth). A week after that I went to Vegas for five days with my bestie. While I was there my bf surprised me by getting a flight with a layover in the same city as me and flying home with me. It was supposed to be a visit that turned into him living with me. In the month and a half he's been here he's totalled my car, broken down my new one twice, caused $300 dollars in tow fees, nearly got my car impounded, set two fires in my kitchen, rusted my cast iron pan, stained my stainless steel pan, and basically ignored everything I've said about maintaining my new car (it's a Saab, it has sport mode and an attitude). I went from having a grand emergency fund to having $40 to my name. He's got a job but he keeps putting off setting up direct deposit so all the bills keep falling on me as well as all the emergency costs that keep cropping up. Yesterday was the second break down that nearly got my car impounded because he left the car on the side of a one lane road almost blocking traffic. After that I told him I can't keep doing this and I want him to go back to Chicago (I live in MT) in two weeks when we can buy a train ticket for him. He is also fairly set on marriage even though I told him right from the start I don't want to do that again. I got divorced a little under a year ago and it was hell. I'm not going through that circus again. All in all I'm done with this relationship and the drama but according to him I'm over reacting and should give him a chance to fix it. So am I the a-hole?<|response|> NTA- Get out of that relationship!!!! Get him out of your life. You have only dated him since March, I would have never let a person stay with me that long after only dating them for two months. He sounds absolutely horrible. <|endoftext|>
35246	2	AITA for asking for people to not give me presents, rather just give me money? My [17f] birthday is the 10th and people have been asking me what I want. Recently I've gone through everything and gotten rid of everything that doesnt bring me 'joy' ( I Konmaried everything). While, I do have items on a list if stuff that I want, they're things I don't need right now. On the otherhand, I have a desktop computer that was a hand-me-down and is quickly becoming outdated. I'm going to college next year and I need a computer that can handle the workload that is required for my major. I already have all the components picked out and through my parent's work it can be built for free, but it still comes out to be about $1,550. So I thought that, "Hey, its my birthday soon, ill just ask people to give me cash instead of presents. Because 1) I basically already have everything I need/want other than the computer, and 2) I really really want that computer." So recently (I think this past weekend) I brought it up to my Grandma (who I live with) and while she didn't necessarily say that it was a bad idea, she looked uneasy. I asked her about it and she said that while she doesn't care, she said that others may think that its kind of an asshole thing to request from my friends and other family if they want to get me something. Unfortunately this was talked about after I told my friends, and while they haven't said anything about it, now I'm worried. TL;DR: Told people to not get me presents, just cash so I can buy I new computer.<|response|> NAH, ask for what you want, don't be surprised when a few people get you something else. <|endoftext|>
101793	2	AITA for telling my sister "you used to be a bitch to me" I will try and tell this as clear and non biased as possible as it just happened, but it is coming from one side so... My sister just moved back to where I live and wants to be part of the family pretty much and make it better; so she is organizing a family kick ball event. She came over for dinner tonight at my moms and wanted to know if i will come to the event that is a month away and is a couple hours with a bbg. I said maybe as i have just had back surgery and can't even drive really yet and still on quite a bit of medication. She keeps pestering me and telling me that she wants to have family events. She is pretty much down my throat controlling me telling me she needs to know if I will come so that she can tell me what to bring to a little bbq and kickball game for a couple hours. I repeatedly say maybe as i don't even know if i can get there or w/e and its a month away, but honestly I would love to go. I have been trying to get our family back together all the time and mend the relationship with my little sister as we always tend to fight. I have been always nice to her and she just constantly shits on me. She keeps saying that she is trying to get this family together so that her 1 year old kid can have a good family growing up. Then i say "I have been trying hard to get this family together, but you have been a complete **bitch** to me for years" in a not super serious almost joking manner. Then she gets all mad and starts to go off on me. Then says to her kid that they need to go home and that I don't want to be part of this family. She keeps telling me, maybe, is not an answer because she needs to tell everyone what to bring. After a bit of bitching from her I just say calmly that just put me down as no and could we please just stop fighting. She keeps going off. So now she is all pissed and my mom is a little mad. My mom and I kinda talked it out after pretty calmly as we usually do and I did say sorry to her that I called her a bitch. btw I live at home with my mom and I am a little older than I would like to be living here but, life happens. just some back ground on how each of us usually act. - me : very laid back and nothing much will get me angry. Not truly got my balls when speaking with my sister as she shits on me constantly and thinks very little of me. - sister : super controlling, very high strung and difficult. - I<|response|> Jesus. Is she really planning the food quantities down to the very person? Ok, Joe gets two legs and a burger and 1 cup of potato salad. OMG HE TOOK TOO MUCH NOW SOMEONE ELSE WONT GET ANY. <|endoftext|>
3086	4	AITA for not acting nice to a an old friend of mine who caused me to fall into a deep phase of depression To start off, I‘d like to give u some additional info... So we were pretty close and I always made jokes about me, her and/or the world around us... some were kinda nasty but she never said a word. Once, completely out of the blue, she was acting up and made a big scene how i was bullying her and so on... we lost contact afterwards... So now that we‘re together in college and i still remain the fun guy who always throws out some jokes. We aren‘t talking that much anymore but as soon as we started to get closer again thing escalated pretty quickly again so that, in the end, most of my „classmates“ were trash talking about how I‘m a bully, what really hurt my feelings. I really wanted to get things back to their normal state. Bc everything really just started out of a misunderstanding of a joke MY BUDDY made. But she didn‘t let me talk to her and played off all of the class mates against me. In the end every day after school I just wanted to kill my self. And my depression, btw she knew exactly that i wasn‘t stable and suffered from this, got a lot worse... i didn‘t shower and also didn‘t want to go to school anymore etc. just all the depression things. Now I‘m feeling much better again but I still can not talk to her in a normal fashion... every time I see her I just get angry again and reminded of my suicidal thoughts. Now I don‘t make the jokes anymore but sometimes i just can‘t keep all of my thoughts for myself and kind of let her know that she really should never again try to even look at me....... PS I’m sorry about my english... it‘s not my first language but i just had to ask you guys... tl;dr: Ex-good Friend got offended by my jokes, started to act all weird, started a huge fight in class where basically everyone was just bashing around on me, i got even more suicidal, although she knew of my depression she kept on going, now I‘m not able to always control my feelings and rage against her.<|response|> Both of yall are assholes, just because you made jokes about everything doesn't mean the jokes towards her didn't hurt her. She should have told you if the jokes were bothering her, but you should have asked because even if she was quiet, being quiet does not always mean the jokes are ok. Though, she is an asshole for making a big scene about how she felt instead of talking to you first. Now, even though she did make the scene leading to why you fell into a deep phase of depression, you can't blame it all on her because YOU could have explained to all your classmates the situation. They probably only heard her side and not the full story. <|endoftext|>
124540	2	WIBTA if I asked my boss if he was punishing me for being sick? TLDR: Called in sick for 2 days, called in late the second day because I was sleeping due to being exhausted. Now my manager says I cant got to a training course I'm scheduled for next week. So this actually happened yesterday but essentially, I am currently sick with a flu virus that's been circling. Due to having pneumonia as a baby and having it almost every winter, and even in the summertime once in a while, I caught it quite easily and it's taken quite a hold on me. I haven't been sleeping well due to the coughing and runny nose, my sinuses are blocked and causing my face to ache with the tickle of needing to sneeze. To be frank, I am miserable, tired and very ill. So I called in to work for the past two days. I am supposed to be going to my head office for 3 days next week for some additional training as I am a team lead with my company. I work nights, So I called in for the second time last night around 9pm as that's when I woke up after falling asleep again around 4. I know that was too late but once I saw the time I texted my manager from head office. He asked why I was only just telling him and I explained that I had only just woken up and that I was sorry for the late notice. I also texted my supervisor at the worksite to make sure she was also informed. He then texted me back and said we needed to sit down and talk and also that I will no longer be attending the course at head office next week. He didnt say that me being sick was the reason I couldn't go but I feel as though I am being punished for being sick and I feel its unfair to me to be denied further training for missing work due to being very ill. What do I do?<|response|> NTA Get a doctor's note. <|endoftext|>
145794	3	AITA for calling out my brother on his sexist nature So today I (M) was talking to my brother (while we were playing Apex legends). At the same time he was talking to one of my female friends. (He sent her a request and he wasn’t followed back). So he messages her ‘I saw you today somewhere and you were looking cute’ (he didn’t see her anywhere). Now she ignores it with a one word answer and she didn’t even ask where he saw her. So he messaged her again and again and she got annoyed (she doesn’t know he’s my brother) About some time later she messaged me that some creep is disturbing her and when she finally told him ‘I don’t want to talk’; he insisted on talking to her. Now at the same time he’s slut shaming her and cursing her out while talking to me on the game. I generally disregard his comments, but today she was my friend so I told him ‘the reason you don’t and never will have a girlfriend is because you just don’t consider them equal to you, asshole’ (About a month ago he called me drunk asking why he couldn’t get a girlfriend and I did, even though I look way more unattractive than him. I didn’t answer him then.) So I continued today ‘If you can’t talk to a girl without condescending her as if you’re doing her a favor, then you don’t fucking deserve a girlfriend’ So he tells me ‘you should stop saying so much. You haven’t done anything anyway in your life’ (I’m a Med student, he’s an intern at some shitty IT job). Plus—— So one of his friend (M) and his girlfriend (F) are trying to get him into a relationship with one of her friends and he proceeds to tell me ‘if I don’t get *my friend*, he’ll get to fuck that girl anyway’ to which I reply ‘that girl won’t hook up with you just because her friend tells her, nobody is that idiotic. If you really want a partner, learn to talk straight first’. At this point I just left the game. AITA for this? Cause he’s going to tell everyone in my extended family about this and they will hate me about this (see all of them think very less of girls from what I’ve gathered. I’m from India bye) Edit- I’m sorry if this feels like a validation post. What I really want to know is whether I can help my brother and family to understand gender equality. What I’m feeling right now is I was not correct in how I confronted him about this situation. I could’ve been more calm. But the reason was that my friend had been beaten by one of her boyfriend before and she’s always shaken up by creeps and so I suddenly had a jolt of anger. Edit 2- Alright what I’ve gathered from this is that this is definitely a validation post. I’m sorry about that. I agree with all of you. I should’ve<|response|> NTA. You probably did him a favor. He can't learn unless he's called out <|endoftext|>
7327	5	AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father So I am 17 years old and 2 months away from moving to college and basically starting my own life. Ever since I was little, I have never gotten along with my dad. We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him. Am I the asshole?<|response|> A family friend passed away a few weeks ago. His son told a story during the funeral. He and his father were very different. His father was an outdoors-men while he was a computer guy. They never really spent time together or talked because they had nothing in common. When he went away to college, he started getting into hockey. When his father found out, his father bought a book on hockey and began researching the local hockey team. When he came home from college, they started watching games together. Over time that one shared activity allowed them to build a close relationship. I don't think you are an asshole. I think that you're upset that your relationship with your father isn't what you want it to be and you've given up hope. Maybe your father doesn't know how to connect with you. Maybe you can help bridge the gap. Keep an open mind. You never know what opportunities the future may bring or what opportunities you can create. <|endoftext|>
10064	3	AITA for passing traffic only to cut back in at the last minute? I have had very nice short commutes in my life but just got a new job where my drive back home is about an hour. The first highway backup is on a 3 lane highway where the left lane exits and 99% of people are taking the right 2 lanes. For a few weeks I have politely gotten into one of those lanes as they fill up yet well over 100 cars fly past in the left lane and cut back in before that lane exits. I know that if everyone would just drive politely everything would run so much smoother, but people just lets these people in every time every day and it adds noticeable time to my commute. Am I wrong in taking the “if you can’t beat them, join them, approach and flying past the hundreds of stopped cars in the right 2 lanes before cutting back in when there is a gap before the left lane diverges?<|response|> Just because there are plenty of other assholes doing it doesn't make you less of an asshole for doing it. So yes, you're an asshole. One of many on the road. Someday, you'll get burned when you can't get back in. There are plenty of people out there willing to take it all the way to make you pay for being an asshole. Keep in mind that you, attempting to join a lane of travel that is proceeding straight ahead, are at fault for a collision that occurs when you try to force your way into a lane. Some people are willing to go down that road. <|endoftext|>
24932	2	AITA for parking wrong Kind of long but I would appreciate any insight. I go to a state college and live at my fraternity house off campus. I had to move my truck, which I am trying to sell, out of our driveway for a day and so I parked it in a lot right down the street from our house. We live pretty far off campus and usually use this lot for overflow parking because it's always empty but very recently the college designated this as a campus lot. As I pulled out of my drive, my truck died in the street. Stone dead battery. I had a friend hook up a tow strap and we dragged it to the lot. I come back from class a couple days later and find it gone. I call the campus police and ask them about it and they say it probably got towed. I go to the garage where it is and they charge me $460 to get it back. Because I was selling, I had taken off the plates and removed insurance/registration. I had to get it towed back to my house because it had no plates. Another 200. This was in February in New York. There was a ton of snow. The flatbed could not get up our steep driveway and was forced to put it in the same lot. This lot also has a steep drive to get out of and he barely got out after. My 4x4 was broken at the time and, that night we got another ton of snow. I couldn't get out of the lot with all the snow and only 2 wheel drive and wouldn't have been able to get up my driveway. I met with the campus police chief and explained my situation and he basically told me it wasn't his problem and I had two days to move it. Physically, this was impossible and I couldn't get out of the lot. Two days later, I get towed again. Another $460. I decide to have it towed back to my home two hours north. Garage charges me 45 a day to have it parked behind their shop while I wait for the 500 dollar transport. All in all cost me 1700 bucks. I've been bitter with the garage for charging college students outrageous fees and the campus police for having zero compassion for my plight.<|response|> YTA Sucks your truck wasn't able to handle the weather, but that doesn't give you the ability to park an unplated, unregistered, uninsured truck wherever you want. <|endoftext|>
56153	4	AITA for never helping with the middle of the night baby feedings? Background: we have a 2 month old baby who mostly sleeps through the night, only waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. to eat - sometimes the baby sleeps through the night. The baby eats quickly and is easy to put back down. It’s usually a 20 minute process from start to finish. When we first brought the baby home my husband was awesome about hearing the baby’s cries and we would alternate every other time to feed her. As the baby started sleeping more, he hasn’t been as good about hearing cries. I hear everything. I was getting annoyed so we talked about it and a couple weeks ago we agreed that he would do all the middle of the night feedings and I’d do early morning. He likes to stay up really late and I do better in the mornings with more sleep. Since agreeing on that, he’s been awful about hearing the baby and I’ll nudge him. Sometimes he doesn’t get to the baby so I’ll just do it. I’m not about to flat out wake him up. That just irks me even more. The nights that he does get up, I will help by grabbing a bottle from our fridge and get him set up. Usually when I get back with it, he’ll ask whether I want him to feed the baby or do I want to do it myself. Per our agreement, I always let him do it. I can tell he’s very tired and wishes I would say that I’d do it. But he said he was fine to do those feedings when we talked about it. My reasoning is I’ll be up at 6 a.m. with the baby to eat again, let our dogs out, feeding them, pumping milk for the baby, watching the baby, emptying the dishwasher and getting all the bottles for the day ready, etc. He’s also on leave right now and usually sleeps uninterrupted until 10:30 or 11. AITA for not helping with middle of the night feeds when he gets up and I can tell he’s just as exhausted as I am?<|response|> Well it sounds like you ARE helping with the night feedings, way more than you should be per your agreement. If he wants to renegotiate the agreement then you guys should talk about it otherwise you need to start putting the baby monitor under his pillow or something. NTA <|endoftext|>
123231	1	AITA for asking my girlfriend to show a prospective buyer my couch when I wasn't home? I’ve been trying to sell my old couch for the past 2 weeks. It’s in good condition but my girlfriend hates it and so I posted an ad for it on kijiji. Someone contacted me that they were interested in buying it and wanted to come over to see it. I work 9-6 Monday to Friday but he only worked evenings so our schedules didn’t mesh. However, he wanted to see it ASAP. My girlfriend does not work on Wednesday's and usually spends it studying at home for an exam she’s taking soon so I figured that she could show the guy the couch and if he wanted to buy it take the money for it. &#x200B; When I told my girlfriend - she was angry and said that I should have asked her first (I admit I should have but I knew she was going to be home anyway- she’s a homebody). She said she refused to be home alone with some random guy I found on the internet and that anything could happen. I thought she was being a bit ridiculous. For example, she was home alone one time when someone came to fix our internet . She insisted that was different since it was through our landlord and it was an official business but this is some random guy she doesn’t know and that “strange men” make her nervous. I still thought she was being silly but she flat out refused and thought I was being insensitive. I had to contact the guy and say the day didn’t work anymore. He got annoyed and kind of lost interest in the couch after that - much to my disappointment and now I'm still trying to sell the couch. &#x200B; I just don’t understand why she was being difficult but she insists she did nothing wrong and was just looking out for her safety. AITA here? &#x200B; **<|response|> YTA Do you seriously not understand the difference between a rando from the internet and someone who was HIRED BY YOUR LANDLORD? You're being incredibly thick here. <|endoftext|>
13931	1	AITA for tapping a woman on the shoulder? I went to CVS to get some protein shakes. A woman was standing in line for pharmacy pick-up... right in front of the protein shakes. And facing away from me. I tapped her once on the shoulder with my finger, saying “Excuse me and I’m sorry, but do you mind if I take a look at these here?” I gestured toward the shakes. She spun around wildly and said (quite loudly) “Do you have to touch me? Have some common courtesy!” I went red as beet and said “I’m sorry, miss.” I left. Am I the asshole for tapping a woman on the shoulder?<|response|> Honestly. Who cares? A tap is so innocuous. I get the "never touch a stranger" rule. But it's a tap. Let go. <|endoftext|>
9679	4	AITA for barring someone from my home for breaking both of my ground rules? I'm 19 and my girlfriend and most of her friends are seniors in high school and their prom was this weekend. I hosted an after-prom at my apartment to which 7 or so people came. I have a party once every few months and the ground rules are always the same: no sex and no weed in the house. We sometimes have alcohol, as people our age often do, and this time was no exception. This time; however, one of our friends' boyfriend (who none of us like) brought a bong and some marajuana. I begrudgingly said that it was okay as long as it never entered my house and was never smoked in my house when his girlfriend asked if he could bring it this one time. Well, wouldn't you know it, he brings it into my house and immediately pulls out a lighter and tries to light it right in front of me, first thing. I told him to stop and not to do it again. He did this three times during the night between going outside to smoke. Then, at 11:30, I had to leave to take two people home, and according to the other people there, he both asked his girlfriend for sex, both in my room and on my couch and then he proceeded to again attempt to light his bong before the others could stop him. When I came home, I had to tell him a few more times not to smoke on my house. When my girlfriend and I went to bed, his girlfriend and he slept on the couch and another friend slept on the floor. The floor friend reported to me this morning that he apparently asked his girlfriend for sex a few more times and apparently he heard some faint sex noises from the couch. I texted him and told him that he was no longer allowed to come over because he disrespected my home and he disrespected me. He never replied, but his girlfriend texted me and my girlfriend claiming he was just joking about the weed. Edit: added paragraphs<|response|> Not the asshole. It's your house, your rules, and your ground rules are reasonable. I wouldn't want people having sex on my furniture either, and depending on where you live and everyone else's ages, weed at the party might be illegal. <|endoftext|>
159260	1	WIBTA if I contacted the grandmother of someone who stole from me? I'm not gonna go into detail, it's a long story, but a couple stole $560 from me. I've tried to communicate with them multiple times and they're ignoring me. My family is telling me that it's not worth it to go to court since it was cash stolen and it would just be my word vs theirs and I could just end up losing more money paying court fees if I lose. I found out that the guy has 2 theft charges against him, but otherwise their social media and stuff are very private. After a lot of digging I finally found the girl's grandmother on Facebook. That's the only family member I was able to find from either of them. I know for a fact that this is her grandma. I'm contemplating sending her a message on messenger and informing her what her granddaughter and her fiance have done. I'm a broke ass college student and that money was basically all of my savings and this has set me back A LOT. Should I do this?<|response|> Absolutely do it <|endoftext|>
54406	5	WIBTA if I can confronted my mother about her behavior? I currently live with my mom and for the most part it’s great. However very often my mom seems to try to find an issue where there is not one. For example, my brother woke up early to wash the dishes and as people do, more dishes got into the sink. My mom came yelling asking why he didn’t do the dishes. I said he did but people put some more in as hours had passed. She paused then proceeded to go yell at him as to why he didn’t do the dishes. Another being just today, my mother was cutting my hair, which I am great full for, but she said let her know if it hurts. At one point she was pushing too hard with the clippers and I said, “Oh, that hurts.” In a calm tone. She pauses then says well do you want me to stop, and I just sit like wtf. She continues but for the rest of the cut, she pushes to hard, causing me pain. While it may sound petty as this is only two examples, please understand this has been going on my whole life at least every week without fail. In addition to this she is incredibly selfish, which I don’t care as I have food to eat and a roof over my head. And while not related but still an issue, I feel that she forgot all her kids for my step dad and her grandkids. Her kids meanwhile are still young and require some form of acknowledgement, but that’s ok. Her health is more important. And lastly she loves to bring up the past while simultaneously getting angry when we even mention anything from the past. Would I be the A-hole for bringing this up with her after having to deal with it for quite literally my whole life or am I being self centered? P.S.(I apologize for formatting and spelling errors such as the title)<|response|> NTA, but sadly, I don’t think that it will do you any good to do it. I have a lot of problems with my mothers crappy behavior too. I could fill a book with all of the problems and grief that she has caused me and my siblings over the years and I have called her out on it many times. The problem is that when you get people who are selfish or narcissistic, they can’t seem to see objectively what they are doing wrong and they either do these mental gymnastics to make themselves the victim or they blow up at the person who points out they are wrong. If I were you I would move out when I could and get some distance from her. That will take some of the strain out of your relationship. <|endoftext|>
28112	3	AITA for bringing food from a different restaurant into another restaurant? Hey team, Last night, I went to a concert with my girlfriend and her parents. After finding parking, my girlfriend and her mother went into a Panera Bread to get a meal before the show started. I ran to a gyro place next door to grab a bite to-go. I get my food and go back to the Panera to eat with the fam. As I begin to nom, I notice my girlfriend and her mother staring aghast at me. They also keep staring at the guy wiping down tables behind me and then staring at one another. Finally the guy goes away and I ask them again. This time they tell me that they're horrified that I'd bring food from another place in and the man behind me was the restaurant manager. I laugh it off and say that a big city Panera Bread has more to worry about than a rogue gyro man. My girlfriend later brings up that I shouldn't have brushed off her feelings like that. My girlfriend's dad then come in and agrees with his wife and daughter. So. AITA? Note: I'm American and my girlfriend and her family are British. Perhaps there are some cultural differences I'm unaware of? This happened in America.<|response|> NTA. It’s a Panera, not a super upscale table service restaurant. It would be a different story if you left a mess, or if the entire group got food from somewhere else and brought it there. <|endoftext|>
183963	4	WIBTA if I don’t see my dad at all while I’m in my hometown? I’m 23F and I moved to NYC after I graduated college. My parents are divorced and have been since I was like 5. My mom was the custodial parent so I used to see my dad most weekends growing up. My dad has always been kind of irresponsible and when I would spend weekends with him he would take me to grandma’s house and that’s where I would sleep until he would take me back home to my mom, she lives about an hour from my grandma. There’s no available room at my grandma’s so when I was a small kid I would sleep in bed with her until I got too big and then I just slept on her floor. I can’t sleep on her couch bc she has two and both my dad and my uncle sleep on her couches. As I got older I started to avoid going to my dad’s and making excuses because I hated being forced to go to church while I was there and i hated sleeping on the floor when I have a room with a bed at my mom’s. I’m only in my hometown for a week and I don’t want to visit my dad because I know he won’t bring me back home to my mom’s the same day and I’ll have to sleep on the floor, he also won’t take me to visit my other family nearby, I’ll just be sitting around at my grandma’s house all day. WIBTA if I told him I don’t want him to get me and I want to stay with my mom?<|response|> NTA. If you still want to see him, you could always arrange to meet up for dinner and coffee, or do something outside the house where you can leave at the end and stay with your mother. <|endoftext|>
101436	4	Am I an asshole for not visiting? I'm 19 and living in my mom's house. My parents are pretty much divorced right now and my dad has been on his own for about a year now. I have visited him maybe once a month during this time while my brother has been staying with him almost every other week (he is 12, so no choice). Im starting to feel really bad for being a loner and not visiting. There is nothing wrong with my dad, I love him a ton. I just like to be alone in my room. My excuse this whole time has been that I have college and two jobs, which I do, but I still have plenty of free time. If my parents' roles were switched, I would just stay in my room at my dad's place. Am I being an asshole, or is this normal? And if you have any advice I would love to hear it.<|response|> If you have enough free time, you really should go see your dad. Whether he's letting on or not, I'm sure he's hurt that you're staying at your mom's all the time. <|endoftext|>
5413	2	AITA for giving my friend tip to get better at a game? My friend and I plays overwatch every now and then, she is low silver (im high silver so not much difference.) She constantly complains about other teammates, telling them to get better, telling them how to do their job, and just being overall toxic, but when I start telling her to get better or give her some tips as a mercy main, she gets all toxic and shuns me for the rest of the game, for GIVING HER ADVICE. She always tell me how she hates being told what to do, even though she does the exact same to other players. I tell her how to get a little better, some tips, what to do and not do. And she gets all angry when I do. I kinda just stopped trying, but she still gets all mad when other people give her tips or tell her what to do. It kinda gets annoying when she wants to play ranked when I dont because she is just gonna weigh me down, im finally getting out of silver (dont make fun of me) when she hasn't moved at all, gotten lower in fact. I dont know what to do anymore Edit: Shes a mercy main<|response|> Nopenopenope. Don’t play with toxic people, and overwatch has way too many, my cousins the same way, she dies once and blames the team then gives up and plays a character shes awful as. <|endoftext|>
85943	2	AITA For yelling at my autistic best friend? I could tell he was shaking and he was struggling to keep together so today at school I yelled at him to go see his case manager so he could talk it out and calm down. He has also told me a mixed opinion on if he wants help or not. Most times he doesn’t but I still do as I’m one of the only people that are able to help him and he’s only ever thanked me. I spoke to him after this and he thanked me profusely and said that I am a great friend as did his case manager but I don’t feel like it. AITA?<|response|> Looking for more people to tell you you’re a great friend? <|endoftext|>
14863	4	AITA if I lashed out to my girlfriend for her jokes? My girlfriend (19F) lately have been finding quite the enjoyment out of some of my(22M) errors or lack of knowledge of some stuff and from time to time she really holds onto it for the moment. Yes sometimes it's funny but she's been overstepping it. I've told her before that it's a bit uncomfortable to take it knowing that I don't make a joke out of her mistakes or misunderstandings because I know myself and my type humour I could take it far, so I avoid doing that out of respect. Yesterday we were talking about food and I didn't know some stuff and she started again with it, I went on a bit of a rant about how she could joke about that but couldn't take a shit joke about her because she would get mad easily, and just hung up the phone. AITA for lashing out or is it comprehensible? EDIT: Spelling corrections. EDIT 2: Thanks everyone for your input! I'll have a serious talk with her and gues that will make things clear out.<|response|> NTA You reacted like anyone would when they feel disrespected. Explain to her exactly how these jokes make you feel. I used to be the asshole that draws attention to everyone else's mistakes etc. until a friend sat me down and told me exactly how I was coming off. I honestly didn't notice it at the time but changed my behaviour as well as I could. Maybe she is the same way. If after this talk nothing changes she just plain doesn't respect you and should get her ass dropped. <|endoftext|>
111565	1	AITA for insinuating that a guy might be a rapist in the future I've done some stupid things in the past and because of that I'm known as a slut to this specific groups of guys at my school. Guys ask me for nudes and it's ruined some pretty good friendships because of the guys being too horny to see me as a person and me realizing too late why they hung around me. So when a guy I knew for all of the first semester and thought was funny and cool asked me for pictures of my tits like I was just passing them out I got pissed off. He was being so persistent than I said "no means no" and I think he got the hint and backed off. I was still fuming though so I sent him "just a word of advice, if you're this persistent with girls in the future you might get yourself in some trouble, he responded k and we haven't texted since. I know he was probably only asking because of the stupid shit I mentioned at the beginning and he backed off as soon as I mentioned that he was being too persistent, but was my continued insinuation of rape after that an assholish thing? Even if I was angry when I did it.<|response|> Wow that was a lot milder than I expected. NTA. <|endoftext|>
161093	3	AITA for cussing out a girl that has a romantic interest in me. This isn't really that long. We were not in a relation before this. This girl has a romantic interest for me and after repeatedly telling her to stop, I broke. I didn't get violent. I told her to, "Please get the f. Away from me. I don't like you, and I couldn't give two shits about you. Now, move along before I file a restraining order on your ass. " A couple days pass, and she still bothers me. I snapped, told her the same thing, with more "words" and told her to f off. EDIT: I changed what I said to the person because I went off on a whim and my long term memory is all that great. This happened like a week ago. If you think it is fake then please feel free to ask questions.<|response|> NTA - she is harassing you. Call the cops. <|endoftext|>
157222	4	AITA "cleaning" my roommates messes So I have a roommate who is very inconsiderate when it come to her stuff and cleanliness. We have an apartment together that has to bedrooms a laundry room, a living room and a kitchen. Now I am not a very uptight, everything must be spotless kind of person. I just want things organized and somewhat clean. My roommate has taken over the living room and laundry room with her stuff, she never cleans her hair, snot, or blood(for some reason) out of the bathroom sink, or her shit stains out of the toilet. She doesn't do her dishes to the point where you cant use the sink and we get a fly and maggot problem (easy to get since we live in a basement) which leads to spiders and it just smells gross. I have always been very civil and ask her to clean up her stuff and she'll just get upset with me and try to turn it back on me. She eventually agreed to do a chore chart but she doesn't actually do any of her chores and bitches at me when I kindly reminder that two people live here and i'm not her maid. So my question be would I be the asshole if I just started throwing things into trash bags i.e her dirty dishes, stuff outside of her room, and the stuff i use to clean her bathroom messes, and put them in her room?or in the trash? I'm really fed up and don't know what to do anymore.<|response|> NTA. I’ve had roommates like this. You call them on their shit and ask them to do their part and they act offended, like you wronged them. Start throwing shit out. In truth, that environment is terrible for your health, mental and physical. Don’t put up with it, it’s disgusting and they are not a child. <|endoftext|>
192412	5	AITA for telling my sister I don’t want a relationship with my father? My dad (57) is not a good dude. I’m the youngest of five kids (31M, 29F, 24M, 21M, 14) and some time after my sister was born, my dad became an alcoholic. He abused my mother, berating her constantly and gaslighting her. She had Stockholm syndrome and wouldn’t leave him for the longest time. He hurt all of us mentally and physically, especially me. He was drunk 99.99% of the time, of course, so he doesn’t remember the specifics, just that something horrible occurred. It was so bad that my oldest brother left after college because he was gay, and couldn’t handle my dad and his scrutiny. My mom, my brother (17 at the time) and I left to go live with my grandfather until she died towards the end of 2018. I’m back in the city and living with my sister, who insists that I should have a relationship with him, and that it’s “human nature” to want a connection with him, especially since his health is failing. I’ve told her many times that I don’t want to live with him, and I don’t want to see him. He’s now sober, but he has a narcissistic personality, so it’s just generally hard to be around him, period. The brother closest in age agrees with me, and also doesn’t want a relationship with him, but my second older brother says I shouldn’t just drop him completely, seeing as my dad does want to have a relationship with me. AITA here, or are there NAH?<|response|> NTA. This is tough- what you’ve been through is VERY difficult and I can understand your point of view. Your sister has no right to guilt you or have any input on how you should handle your relationship with your father. While she might want to forgive and move on- it’s not right for her to expect the same from you. You have to do what’s best for you, and your mental and emotional well being. <|endoftext|>
93594	5	AITA for saying "you're good" instead of "it's alright"? Alright, this might sound obvious but please listen because I'm not so sure. So I am very much an optimist. I always try to look on the bright side and figure a positive attitude is always the best way to express yourself, so my phrasing can often sound sarcastic and disingenuous(especially because I'm a 14yo male). I've been saying things "you're good", "have a good day", and "have a great day" for a while now. I just thought it was mundane, I mean, I just phrase hellos and goodbyes differently. But yesterday I was playing a game on my console and the dog destroys my shoe in the other room over while my mom is watching him, and of course she apologizes and I say you're good per usual. She erupts, yelling at me, saying she's tired of my bullshit and outlook on life. She says she's tired of my attitude, that not everything in life is about being joyous, be angry, be sad, have other emotions, it's ok. The thing is it's just what I honestly feel most of the time. The dog ate my shoe, it happens, it's all good. So I'm not sure what to do. My brother and dad seem to take her stance saying it's really annoying. This may seem like a weird prompt, but honestly, reddit, am I the asshole?<|response|> I’m not voting but boyfriend is very much like you and I understand the frustration. When you react in the same way to everything (positively or negatively) it begins to feel like you aren’t engaging. If you have a positive phrase that you use in every situation the other person begins to wonder if you actually engage with what’s going on and what they said. If you’re saying, “have a great day” every morning no matter how grumpy they look or how much the facts point to that being unlikely, it’s a cheap sell. I think something happened, your mom felt bad and apologized and she wanted you to react to a situation (even if it was still positively) that was not the norm in a way that acknowledges that. If you’re saying you’re joyful and positive all the time, that sometimes comes across as you saying that people and situations don’t have an effect on your emotions, which is hard to hear. Again, I could just be projecting so I’m not voting. It’s a great outlook and mindset to have but people want to feel heard. <|endoftext|>
133132	3	AITA for backing out of sex after finding out I was with a 27 year old virgin? So, for the last few months, I've been on kind of a dating kick. But it ended recently because, well, shit got kind of real when a man I was thisclose to sleeping with told me (read: sputtered at me), "I've never done this before." This is how it went: After amicably ending my relationship with a man I loved deeply, I had to get my sea legs, so to say. But really what I ended up getting was my sea drunkness. And my sea promiscuity. Hello to the Tinder cesspool. In the midst of mostly-forgettable, problematic men, I met one who was sweet and seemingly well-adjusted. He had a real job and a real house and wasn't sketchy and didn't really seem into bullshitting around. He was cute and we had enough things to talk about, so I was hopeful that, while I wasn’t looking for a relationship, the idea of going out with someone kind and not-weird for a while sounded pretty appealing. So we did go out a few times. Three times, to be exact. Which, interestingly enough, is the exact number of times it usually takes to go from “Should we sleep together?” to “Yeah, might as well just sleep together.” That wasn’t how it went at all, though. Oh JFC, it wasn’t. And not for any reason I was even prepared for. Because I don't know if, after a sex bender, you can ever prepare to feel the feelings you feel when the man with whom you're between the sheets tells you he's never had sex. Never. Had. Sex. In fact, he waited until he was putting on a condom to inform me that he’d “never done this before.” After the shock, there were two options, really: Do it with the awareness it would not be good for me and potentially emotionally difficult for him, or don’t do it and leave the poor dude still standing with his V card firmly in his shaky hand. So naturally, I went into caring stranger mode. “Oh, jeez,” I stammered. “OK, we need to stop.” “I don’t think I can be the person you do this with. I’m not going to be your girlfriend, this isn’t going to be a relationship -- and you probably should do this with someone who is,” I told him as placidly as possible. He just groaned. For asecond, I did consider another possible plan: Come back at a later date for the mercyfuck. Maybe he just really wanted to get it over with, and I could be the somewhat-slutty lady who could come along and help him get over the hump of virginity. But almost immediately, I realized what a terrible idea that would be, because this did not seem like the kind of guy who could go from zero to 60 and suddenly start having casual sex. He waited a full week to text again, and when he did, he asked me to come over and<|response|> YTA. Not the fact you don’t want to have sex with a virgin, everyone has to start somewhere. It’s how you reacted which was shitty. <|endoftext|>
180380	4	AITA for brushing off my boyfriend? Throwaway because reasons. My boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) are currently long distance while he finishes school. We've been together for almost 3 years now, but keep having the same argument over and over. Some backstory: I work 2 jobs; an office job in the morning M-F and I waitress until 10 or 11 at night twice a week. Needless to say, it's important that I get enough sleep before those days that I work double shifts. Anyways, yesterday on my lunch break at my day job, my boyfriend told me there was something he wanted to talk to me about (not related to our relationship), but wasn't quite emotionally ready yet. The day went on and we didn't speak very much as he's studying for finals. I spent most of my day after work watching Netflix as it was my day off, and I work today. When I called him at around 10:30 pm to say goodnight and rest, he said he was ready to talk then. I told him I was going to bed now and it was going to have to wait, and he got very upset with me, saying this is not the first time I've brushed him off. I told him he should stop bringing up serious conversations on the nights when I need to get a lot of sleep. We both still think the other is the asshole here, so let me ask you Reddit... AITA? EDIT: This is not the first time this has happened, and I consistently try to tell him to have better timing with serious conversations. He had all afternoon to talk to me but chose right before I slept, which he has done so many times in the past as well.<|response|> NTA If he wants to talk about something serious he needs to find/wait for the appropriate time, it's unfair of him to expect you to get into an emotional conversation just before bed and a long and stressful day at work ahead. He's only thinking of his needs, he left you hanging all day with I have to tell you something important' that's a dick move in itself. <|endoftext|>
145055	4	AITA for ghosting my best friend? A while ago, I travelled with two of my friends, one being my best friend at the time. It was a 5 week trip. For context, the best friend, (in this case, Sarah) and I had been friends for a few years and had grown VERY close as we depended on each other in our lowest moments. She was one of the people I trusted most. About 2 weeks in, we arrived in a city that Sarah had been to previously. As such, there were certain tourist locations I wanted to visit, while Sarah wanted to pass. On this particular day, we decided to split up, and chose to arrive at a third tourist location at a set time, 5:30pm for dinner. The other friend and I had a great day, and at around 4:30, started to head back towards the third location to meet Sarah. Being disgraceful navigators, we caught the correct bus going the incorrect way, and had made ourselves late by about 15 minutes. As such, we arrived at location three at 5:45, to be welcomed by Sarah yelling at us that we were irresponsible, and she was incredibly worried that something had gone wrong. While I understand her concern, Sarah had spent the last two weeks getting blind drunk by herself without letting us know, or disappearing in the middle of the night, leaving us to wonder where the hell she was. When she freaked out at us for being late, I was quite frustrated, so I responded “It’s not unlike anything you’ve done on this trip.” I was replied to with a hit, to the face. I was shocked, and didn’t know how to process, so I walked away and didn’t speak for the rest of the night. Nothing was spoken about this entire incident for a few days, until Sarah and I were alone in our hostel in another city. The exchange went like this: S: I want to talk about what happened before, at (tourist location 3). J: Okay, I’m happy to do that. S: I was very scared, and I don’t think you understand what it’s like to be alone and a woman in a foreign city. When you guys were late, I freaked out. What you said was not right, and what I did wasn’t that okay either. J: That’s okay, Sarah, seriously. I’m happy as long as you don’t hit me or threaten to hit me again. S: No promises. I can’t make any promises. When she said the last comment to me, I walked out of the room, and broke down alone. I was incredibly hurt, and felt like my trust in my friend had been shattered. I decided being as cordial as I could with Sarah was the best route. I spent the next 2.5 weeks speaking, laughing and hanging out with her. Nothing else was said about the incident, and when we arrived back home, I blocked Sarah on every platform without any warning. I’ve been told by a few friends that Sarah<|response|> NTA. Assaulting people is unacceptable. Nothing justifies it. I'm a girl, and I cannot fathom some telling me "hey, why did you ghost that male friend of yours? Oh, he hit you, but he meant well". It's an a-class-asshole move to make you feel bad because she is "depressed and would do differently if she could". She hit you but she loves you? Fuck that. You will have a better life without people abusing you. <|endoftext|>
79847	3	AITA - My life is being turned upside down by two toddlers My sister got pregnant as soon as she turned 18. She's a year younger than me & I knew immediately that it was a bad idea. Her boyfriend was a jerk & they fought constantly. A couple months after my nephew is born, my sister gets pregnant AGAIN. Now I'm full-on panic mode because I know my drug/alcohol addicted sister & her BF could barely handle one baby, let alone two. But my mom is excited to be a Gma & got everything set up for my sister. Cribs, diapers, clothes, toys, you name it, my mom either bought it or got donations. Now, something to know about me, I hate kids & it's only gotten worse over time. Lots of drama later, I'm skipping a good 2 years here or this would be pages longer, my sister has been kicked out of our house & my mom ends up taking in my niece & nephew because my sister was neglecting them. They're 1 & 2 at this point, and my disabled mother is spending all her waking (and sleeping) hours to take care of them & get them set up in foster care so we can at least have financial support for them. Oh yeah, and I'm working full time to support two extra mouths. They've been here for 6-7 months when my mom promised at the time they'd only be staying for the weekend... even at the time I had flat-out refused to let them stay. But my mom can't turn away her grandchildren & she doesn't trust their father not to take them to Mexico to spite my sister. She loves them to no end & doesn't want them to end up in the foster care system. I can understand her reasoning, and see it from her perspective, but I only wish she'd never gotten attached to them, listened to my concerns before they were born. But what do I know. Every day it's noise, messes, my house is an absolute disaster & I'm working 40+ hours a week while trying to get my business off the ground in my few hours of free time every day & trying to save up enough to move out of this personal nightmare. My mom's health has declined dramatically (it wasn't stellar to begin with) and I'm constantly worried this stress is taking years off her life. Not only that, the CPS system her is a fricking joke. Not once have I been talked to in private about this situation & my concerns. My mom thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to live with emotionally traumatized, loud, messy toddlers & is constantly guilt tripping me for trying to save up enough to move out. I've fought too hard to overcome my clinical depression to get stuck in this situation. I'm taking promotions & working overtime in this job that I don't care about just to save up enough money to leave, but since I'm the breadwinner of the household, my<|response|> NTA. You didn’t birth those children or ask for this life. Keep working hard to create the life you want. <|endoftext|>
87679	2	AITA for giving a copy of my own book for secret santa? Hello all! I've put myself down for my hospital's Secret Santa thing and we're drawing out gifts next week. I'm a little bit hurried for time, and have recently published my own first novel, which I'm quite excited about. I thought it might be a good idea because it's quite a bit cheaper than the limit set for the secret santa (my book would cost $10 new, but the limit is $25 for our work), and I think it's quite a good read! But when I mentioned the idea to a friend at lunch, they said it might not be very appropriate and that I should look at the recipient's wishlist or listen in to what she says to see if she mentions an interest. WIBTA if I were to give my book as a gift?<|response|> YTA - You are literally choosing to promote yourself rather than get them a gift they'll actually want. This will also make you look horrendously self absorbed if followed through. <|endoftext|>
64466	3	WIBTA for rehoming "our" dog? Background: We live in South Korea, 1 month ago my husband's coworker asked if we could puppysit their dog. A 7 month old puppy. We said yes because we love dogs and after having met their dog we knew it got along well with our 5 year old son. About 2 weeks later the owners tell us that he is now our dog! They don't want it back because blabla. They had many excuses, and I was not that surprised cos I knew they were lazy and borderline abusive to the dog. I immediatly started looking for families to adopt the dog, and now finally it looks like I found the perfect family to adopt it. BUT! My son is really so sad, and it breaks my heart. He doesn't understand why we can't keep it and it has been such a great companion to him this last month. WIBTA if I still gave it away? My main reasons for not wanting to keep the dog is: \- Financial: Our income is not so stable, we would really have to prioritize hard to keep up with vet bills and such. \- We will return to our native Scandinavia and the process for bringing a dog back is complicated and expensive. I know this because we have one dog we already brought from Korea. My country recently made it even harder to bring dogs like this back home, we would have to prove our ownership and go through several steps, would cost a pretty penny. \- I'm currently not working but plan to return to work and then the dog would have to be alone for at least 6 hours a day. However: \- My son really loves this pup and they have truly bonded, everyone can see that. Our dog back home is older and not particularly fond of kids, so this is a new experience for my 5 year old. \- To buy a dog of a similar breed back home would cost as much as brining this one back with us. Not saying we will immediatly get one, but since we will return home next year we might look for a dog a few years down the road. \- My husband would also like to keep the dog btw, but since I'm the one taking it on walks, groom it etc he lets me decide on whether to keep it or not. So WIBTA for re-homing the dog?<|response|> NAH. If you aren't ready to have a dog in your home then it doesn't make you an asshole to give it a new home. It actually makes you pretty responsible. <|endoftext|>
39703	3	WIBTA if I told my cousin I wanted the basement suite room because I'm the daughter, and I've lived here longer? Tl;dr": my cousin wants one of the 2 basement suite rooms, instead of upstairs with my parents, shes lived here like a year and I've been living here getting the short end of the stick for 19 years now. WITBTA if I cited, among other reasons, that I've lived here longer and am the kid, and I should get it? Please excuse formatting. So my(19F) and my sisters(20F) cousin(22F) D moved into the house our parents and us rent around August last year and, while its a lot to get into, shes been kind of hard to live with Currently, in a 2 story house w/ unfinished basement, my parents have a room upstairs, and my cousin D and I are on either side of their room. This is hard for us, she thinks it is more so for her because shes lived on her own and likes freedom, but really it's as annoying for me as well. My sister A is downstairs in the unfinished basement, which shes gotten used to and doesn't want to give up. We've just gotten accepted to rent a new house, a 1 story w/ finished basement suite, with 2 rooms upstairs and 2 downstairs, along with a second kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We've decided that, because shes the oldest sister and used to it(and stubborn so the fight wasnt even brought up) that A would get a basement room regardless. D thinks she should get the other room, citing that shes used to living on her own, and that sleeping next to my parents(her aunt/uncle) is difficult and she shouldn't have to because shes older than me. She and my sister also want the ability to bring boys over and not have to explain to my parents who/why there were there. Shes also said that if shes upstairs, then shes going to be working harder on moving out, and not staying as long, but I dont really know how long she planned to stay in the first place. I feel I should get the other basement room for many other reasons to: I cook more than either of them, as well as bake and own a lot of kitchen stuff, and I'm more likely to clean the easily ignored things. I've got a boyfriend of 2 years who stays over while working sometimes, and would like the privacy. Now, onto the AITA part. It sounds blunt, but I'm the actual daughter, I've lived here longer, I've gotten the smaller room in pretty much every house I've lived in so far, I don't think it's fair that she thinks shes more deserving of the freedom than I am. I dont want to say this, because I'm afraid shell be offended and I'll sound like an asshole D thinks that because I stay at my boyfriends house on average 4-6 scattered nights a month, and that I've got 2 jobs, that I'm "never home" and<|response|> NAH - I think all of your reasons for calling “dibs” sound completely valid. You get my vote! <|endoftext|>
131099	2	AITA for (temporarily) excluding my ex from our dnd group? When my ex and I were still together a friend of mine started running a dnd campaign to which I also invited my then gf. She really took a liking to dnd in general, her character and also the rest of the group. Now that we broke up amicably I need some room to separate myself emotionally, so I took her up on the offer for her to not show up for dnd for a while, as well as voluntarily retreating from common activities that she is a bigger part of. As the breakup is really quite recent I can't yet tell when I'll be ready to treat her as a friend - if I'll ever be - but she is setting a deadline of 2 months when she is definetly going to come back to the dnd group. WIBTA if I turn to the DM who to ask for a longer exclusion?<|response|> Exclude yourself rather than excluding her <|endoftext|>
24355	4	AITA for thinking negatively of my housemate for not offering me gas money? My housemate's return flight was delayed for almost two hours. As a result, the person who was originally supposed to pick the housemate up from the airport could no longer make it. The housemate then contacted me and I agreed to pick him up. When I picked him up, the housemate thanked me and that was it. Previously, when I picked up other housemates from the airport, they always offered to pay for gas or take me to a meal; but not this time. Also, I usually give out small rides; but in this case, the round trip was 95 mi and I drove for two hours after dark. &#x200B; So, am I the asshole here?<|response|> NAH. If he is your mate, he probably just thought you were being a good friend as there was no mention of compensation. It would have been nice of him to compensate you but not expected. Maybe if you said "sure but can you pay for gas?" Then you would be justified. I don't think either of you are assholes. He wasn't required to pay for gas and you only think a bit less of him as a person. No real harm done. <|endoftext|>
73886	3	AITA for not stepping up to get my little sister out of CPS? The facts: -My little sister is almost 5 years old -I am 21 years old, and a full time college student in another county. -My mother is in her 40's, and a heroin addict -She used throughout her whole pregnancy -Father had custody, but is also an addict, house was raided, and sister was taken by CPS almost 6 months ago. -Father began reunification process, is doing necessary steps to get her back, provided he follows through, will have her in or around April. -Mother was granted visitation since then -My grandmother raised my younger brother and I from day 1 of our lives due to the same issues my mother has now. -Grandmother is getting old, has a heart condition, is also an addict on almost no income, and ultimately cant raise another child. Am I the asshole for not dropping my classes in the middle of the semester, to move to another county, in with my grandma, a week after my nana died (who helped raise me, along with her husband, My grandpa, who I live with now, who, has a drinking problem) to raise my little sister, when I am basically still a kid myself? Am I the asshole for being less than sympathetic to my moms request to do so? Am i the asshole for believing maybe she is better off some where that isn't full of people coming and going all day and night with drugs around?<|response|> NTA - you have got to secure your own future before you could even hope to be able to care for someone else's. If you want to help then do from a stable place in when you are ready. <|endoftext|>
114857	4	AITA for not understanding my roommates specific boundaries? I live in a two bedroom apartment with two separate bedrooms and a shared kitchen/living room. My roommate is one of my closest friends. However, she has some annoying boundary issues? She has a problem with me making out (or anything else) with people in our apartment. I get if it was like, in the living room, but even in my own room she's uncomfortable with it. At what point does it stop being a comfort boundary and start being too controlling? She's not lying about it making her uncomfortable, and I'm not judging her right to feel safe and respected in her own home, but how far does that extend before its unreasonable? And am I the asshole for wanting to kiss someone in my own bed when it makes my roommate upset?<|response|> NAH. You both have the rights to your own feelings. I think it’s time for a serious talk between the two of you, and hopefully a compromise or at least some understanding. <|endoftext|>
162516	3	AITA for getting mad at my husband for insinuating I’m a hoe? 23F and when I asked my husband why he thinks I’m a hoe he replied “idk”. To me that sounded like he does in fact think I’m a hoe. Background: Ever since I started dating him, he got me into the habit of sleeping naked because that’s the way he sleeps most of the time. We live at home with my parents and last night my mom had some friends visit her, and they spent the night: 1 male 2 female. My husband works 10pm-7am shifts and when he came back home he saw I was sleeping just with pj shorts and no top or underwear. He got annoyed (?) upset (?) jealous (?) of this and when I wanted to have sex with him he just turned away. Sometimes I wear full Pjs, sometimes I don’t. Right away I knew the fact I was semi naked got him upset which I understand if it was because there was a random male staying over at the house but I didn’t do anything with that 40+ year old male. I then asked him the above question and that’s all he said to me, I makes me feel like crap that’s all he mustered out and I’m livid. Am I wrong for being upset? Edit: grammar<|response|> NTA Of course you are upset. You are in a private space. You are allowed to be naked. He needs to apologize for thinking so lowly of you. <|endoftext|>
192852	5	AITA for being upset at future in-laws differentiating treatment? My (27f) and boyfriend (28m) have been together for 5 years. Boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his stepdad; his mom cares for him a lot, but she's never able to help out practically because she puts her husband first before her kids (so if she wants to do something to help us that stepdad doesn't approve us, well, it's not happening). I've been supporting my boyfriend for the past year while he's been going through some rough patches in life (death of a relative, struggling with rejections for a job in a competitive field, etc.). I've been missing out on some of his family events because of work or because I'm just too tired to attend after working 12+ hrs a day. His family has expressed their disappointment with me multiple times in passive-aggressive joking ways (future MIL scoffing/rolling her eyes when another family member says I'm constantly "working", having every single family member comment on my absence, saying I'm "abandoning" them, etc.). I've noticed my future MIL not liking me as much as she used to, presumably because of my frequent absence. It hurts because I've been supporting her son both financially and emotionally while she has done practically nothing, while preaching that she's always here for her son. My parents have taken in my boyfriend as their own son, allowing us to originally live at my mom's when boyfriend couldn't afford rent at his OWN parents house which they wouldn't waive for him (we have since moved out to our own apt). My mom has said some hurtful things about him before, but she has still taken him in like a son, giving him birthday money equivalent or sometimes more than what I get from them. They haven't treated us any differently. His parents gave us money for Christmas, which I'm extremely grateful for, as I wasn't even expecting to be gifted anything. Every Christmas, they always give us differenting amounts though, with boyfriend's card having hearts drawn all over the card, and mine blank. I don't want to sound ungrateful, but a part of me feels hurt that they treat us differently, when my parents have accepted him like a son. It's not about the amount, just about the fact that they don't treat me the same. Boyfriend agrees with me, stating that his step-family side used to treat him differently than his blood-related cousins, and knows how crappy that feels. Friend thinks it makes sense because of course they love their son more than his girlfriend. Am I the asshole here for being upset?<|response|> NTA for being upset, but it's best to let it go. They aren't likely to change any time soon and who knows, with time it might get better. I adore my in-laws but they have ornaments with pictures of just their family on the tree, including my kids but not me. I got really upset about it last year, but decided that it's not worth it. Some people are just more into bloodlines than others. <|endoftext|>
119113	4	AITA for telling my boyfriend it was my way or tbe highway? Context: [TL:DR at the bottom] My boyfriend [19] and I [F18] have been together about a month and a half. We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. Now, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. I'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. Well, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. We were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. He was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. He paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. I was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave... Well he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. Here's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. He promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. TL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just "teenage boy syndrome" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. Am I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?<|response|> NTA whatsoever. That degree of anger is a huge red flag, even if apology came afterwards (abusers apologize all the time). If my partner did that to me, I would likely break up with them. Therapy would be good for him. I wish you the best of luck. <|endoftext|>
131477	4	AITA for being upset that my husband gave our security code to an exterminator to enter our home when no one was home? As the title says, and my apologies for formatting as I’m on mobile. We’ve had the same alarm/entry security code for over 10 years. My husband and I travel together a lot for work. Our close friends, family and trustworthy neighbors have the code to enter our home, Today, we couldn’t be home to let the exterminator in and I asked my husband to ask them to come back at a later time. Instead, my husband gave the exterminator the code to our front door to let himself while no one was at home. When I told him I wasn’t comfortable with this (actually, that I was upset about it), he swore the exterminator (whom he only knows by his first name) is trustworthy. He said the man has had a company in our area for years and we have nothing to worry about. I’m upset because this is our home, and I don’t trust that this man wouldn’t A) abuse his position, and B) wouldn’t give the code out to someone else who could take advantage of us. We live in a metropolitan area in Florida and although our neighborhood feels fairly safe in comparison, I’m not comfortable with this breach. My husband argued that I had nothing to worry about, but I’m still upset about it. AITA?<|response|> NTA: Your husband shouldn't have given out the code without permission, but I personally think you're being a bit too paranoid. The chance of the exterminator actually abusing his power is pretty low, especially if he's well-respected in the community. Still, you can never really be too careful, so I get your point. <|endoftext|>
48021	3	AITA for asking my lighter back from a friend that consistently takes them with him? My friends and I always come together to smoke weed, and it's normal that a lighter gets passed around and gets "lost" sometimes (read; someone put it in their pocket). One of my friends is usually the one who puts it in his pocket out of habit, not thinking about it. Today i texted him saying "my other lighter just died, wanna hang out tonight" jokingly to call him out on it. To which he immediatly takes a defensive attitude; &#x200B; him: "Dude just a theory, why dont you go buy one?" me: "I did the other day, but then you started gatekeeping my lighter again" him: "Everyone takes them, we're talking about a 1 dollar product here" me: "Then why dont you buy one yourself next time" him: "You're always acting like I stole your ipad" me: "Its just annoying when its the only lighter I have, and just bought it that day" him: "Just walk downstairs, go to your stove and turn it on, its not rocket science" me: "Just stop stealing my lighters, then this discussion can be avoided as a whole" &#x200B; I already delayed asking for it back by a couple of days, because I knew he was going to throw a fit about it, because he probably feels like I'm accusing him of stealing. Which I'm not. He should just be mindful of whose lighters he puts in his pocket or buy one of his own. After a lot of rants from both sides, he blocked me on whatsapp and put the blame fully on me because "I shouldnt make such a big deal out of something this small and he has other shit to worry about". To be clear, I really dont care about the cost of the lighter, its just super annoying to finally come home and realise you dont have a lighter anymore when you want to smoke at the end of the night. Now he will probably make a very big deal out this all when we meet again, so i just wanted to know if im blinded by my perspective and if maybe I am the asshole? &#x200B; TLDR; Asked my friend for my lighter back after he took it with him again, then got blamed for "always making such a big deal out of nothing, just go buy a new one". AITA?<|response|> NTA? It's your lighter, why would the cost matter? &#x200B; Don't take other people's stuff, and if you do it accidentally (like putting it in your pocket out of habit), don't make a big deal just return or replace it. <|endoftext|>
31988	4	AITA for getting a girl kicked out of our community play? Obligatory mobile format and such. So our school is hosting a play for the rest of the town, and our Theater teacher has a super strict no-phone policy during rehearsals. If you get caught with it on, you're cut from the cast. While I'm waiting backstage (not in the scene, of course), this girl is hiding in the stairwell that goes in and out of the classroom/stage playing on her phone. Now, if she was texting or calling somebody, I would've let it slide, but she was literally just on snapchat. So, AITA for ratting out a girl who was doing exactly what she was told not to do multiple times? Edit: at the time of posting this, she doesn't know I told the teacher yet.<|response|> YTA she wasn't bothering anyone... Rehersal can be boring if you aren't doing anything. I get the no phones policy but... Also you say "I would have let it slide" like you are some authority figure. Are you? Did you just do it for the power trip? <|endoftext|>
54861	3	WIBTA if I(M21) didn't go sleep at my sisters(F31) house when her husband is away? Every year the husband of my sister goes away for 1 week and my sister, who has 2 kids (5 yo and 2yo) always asks if I can come live with her for the week. She is very scared alone in the house. Normally I always go, but I never like it. It's always super chaotic with the two kids, I always feel like I'm more a burden than a help and she lives away from all my friends and I don't have a car, the only thing I can do when I'm there is sit at home, study, watch tv, use my laptopt etc, but most of the time I have to entertain the kids, I'm fine doing it for a day, but man I hate having to play with them 24/7 for the whole week. And even if I tell them no, they just keep asking and bugging me about it. When I go to her place I feel like I'm wasting a whole week in my life, that I'm living just to please her. I only do it for her, but last year was the worst year of all. She kept telling that I could go home early, that she's actually fine on her own, asking me why I'm actually there etc... I was there for her, but it seemed like she didn't even want me there even though she did ask me. This year she asked me again, I told her I didn't want too because I don't like doing it and last year she was so mean. She told me that she doesn't remember that she told those things to me last year and keeps asking me to come sleep at her place for the week and that she is very scared. &#x200B; WIBTA if I didn't go?<|response|> NTA. Your sister is a grown up married woman. She needs to put on her big girl panties and deal with her life. It’s not your job to babysit her when her husband goes out of town. <|endoftext|>
117942	3	AITA for asking my girlfriend to stay in her own bed during a weekend trip with her gay friend for a fraternity formal? Update: Thanks for the input everyone. I talked about it with my girlfriend and I told her that it was not fair for her to bear the burden of my insecurities and that she can do whatever she wants to do. The fact of the matter is that I should trust her and not punish her for past relationship problems. Even if my imagination’s worst case scenario were to play out, it’s nothing I’d be able to control anyway... but I’m sure it will be fine. Something I do want to mention is that people are pretty quick to jump to labeling me a misogynist or homophobe. I’m not either of these things, but I’m sorry if I come across as such. I just am pretty traditional and would never imagine going on a weekend trip with three lesbians and sleeping in the same bed. I think if the roles were reversed, people would be responding differently. Nonetheless, I appreciate everyone’s input! Original: Background: We have been dating for 2 years now (I’m 23, she’s 20). One of her best friends is a gay guy and he invited my gf to go to his fraternity formal which is 2 nights in a hotel room in a big city. Their room situation would be her and him in one bed and two other gay guys in the other bed. I asked that she either get her own hotel room or if that’s too much trouble to at least stay with her friend in a room with 2 beds so she can sleep in her own bed. I feel like that’s not a lot to ask considering she’s basically going on a weekend date with another guy. However she acts like it’s too much trouble and she may not go because I’m asking too much. I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I also don’t feel comfortable with my girlfriend getting drunk and sleeping in the same bed with another guy. I know alcohol can lead to mistakes. I don’t know why he wouldn’t have taken a guy to his formal. Maybe he is bi, idk. Gay or not, I think it’s disrespectful. I’ve been cheated on before and she knows it so I wish she would be more understanding. But let me know if I am the asshole please.<|response|> YTA. If you can’t trust her to sleep in the same bed as a gay guy, you probably have some trust issues you need to work out independently of your relationship. <|endoftext|>
85111	3	AITA for telling a guy that he didn't have to bring my race into the conversation? so today i messaged a guy on grindr that i thought was attractive. in his profile, he put that guys don't have to resort to racist messages after he rejects them. I ignored this because I didn't think it was relevant. He responded to my hi that he wasn't into white dudes. Am i the asshole for telling him that he could have just said that i wasn't his type and he didn't need to bring my race into it? He said that i needed to stop acting like I've been victimized for being white. i responded that i wasn't acting like I'm being victimized for my race, just curious why race had to be brought into it. So reddit, am i an asshole and was i being racist? educate me<|response|> NTA I'm sure PoC have to deal with a lot of racist shit on dating sites but this guy really seems to be inviting it. Probably best to just move on though. <|endoftext|>
12696	4	AITA for calling the police on a guy that I thought was a pedo who just turned out to be a father with his young girl? Yup title says it all. I take the bus to visit my boyfriend on the weekends and it’s usually about a 3 hour ride. Diagonally from me was sitting a guy and a small girl - about 7 years old. He kept kissing her on the cheek and lips and stroking her hair telling her how pretty she was. At one point, he took out a thermos and let her take a sip of something in it. The guy looked really creepy and nervous the whole time like he kept turning his head around and looking at people. It final dawned on me that the guy might be a pedophile grooming a child for sexual abuse and then I started freaking out about what might be in the thermos. I went to the back of the bus and into the back room (which was filthy BTW) and called 911 to report a suspicious man and young girl. About 10m later, the bus gets pulled off by three SUV cop cars who stormed on to the bus and yelled at the man to put his hands up and not make a move. A female cop handed the girl a teddy bear and carried her off the bus. The cops escorted him off the bus after putting him in handcuffs “for everyone’s safety” and talked to him outside. They ordered the bus to remain where it was in case they needed to interview witnessed or have his luggage pulled off for inspection. It turns out that after tearing apart his luggage and probably calling his wife or someone to confirm that he was the father, they let him back on the bus. No one knew it was me that called but the entire time I was blushing and shaking like oh fuck did I do the right thing. The father and daughter got back on the bus and we headed towards the destination. The daughter was quiet the entire time and I overheard the father tell her to sit down and be quiet and no more play time. I felt like a dumbass but not only that I pissed off about 40 angry people who were late to their destination. TL;DR: I called the cops on a potential pedo and it turned out that he was just a father with his young daughter. Better safe than sorry I guess? So am I the asshole?<|response|> YTA. People like you are why fathers are afraid of being alone with their child in public and probably why he looked so nervous. There's nothing wrong with a parent being affectionate with their kid. 0% chance you would have done the same if it was a mother with their daughter. You made them both feel shitty and delayed the schedules of about 40 people because you made up a scenario in your imagination that obviously the man has to have evil intentions. <|endoftext|>
44973	3	AITA for Letting the Fishes Die? Ever since I was very young, I had a deep set fear for fish. The way they look, the way they smell, the way they move, everything about them make my skin crawl, and dead fish give me sleepless nights. I know some people can find them appetizing or cute, but I can never find myself among them. No, I really hate fish, and I would do anything to avoid them. My family has a big tank in the house and they had some red and yellow pet fish in there(no idea what kind, never asked, not interested), we had them for a little over a year. An agreement was made before my family had them was that I would have absolutely nothing to do with the fishes. I would not feed them, change their water or even as much as look at them. Nothing personal or what, I could do anything else from cleaning the house to laundry but I would not do anything that has to do with the fishes. There was a day when I was home alone on a weekend that I noticed something was wrong in the tank. The fishes were all gathered at the top of the water level and there were 2 or 3 flat at the bottom. I assumed those at the bottom were dead, but did not look closer. I called my parents and told them about it, they asked me to remove the dead fishes immediately and change the water, in which I refused. While it was clear that the fishes were suffering, I just could not bring myself to look at dead fishes, much less scooping them up or touching their water, the mere idea made my hair stand. My Dad yelled at me through the phone, asking me to cut the crap and save the remaining fishes. I hang up and went back into my room. All the fishes were dead by the time my parents returned. I did not see their actual bodies, but I could imagine and felt sorry. According to Dad the water temperature somehow rose way beyond safety level and the fishes were either suffocated or cooked alive. As expected, I had a whole earful from my Dad, he really loved those fishes. My brother was angry at me too, because he had a favorite among them. Even till now, months later my Dad would bring this incident up from time to time and call me a heartless a** for letting the fishes die. While I do feel sorry for the poor fishes, I simply could not have saved them. I already made it clear to my family on the day we got the fishes that I would have nothing to do with them, and now they put all the blame on me.<|response|> YTA. You let living things suffer. <|endoftext|>
47756	3	AITA : for not wanting my bf and I to have to pick up food for dinner every single time his siblings have a dinner at their moms house. So a couple times a month my bfs family gets together for dinner at their moms house, One of his sisters has two kids a 4 year old and 7 month old , His other sister has a 2 year old And his brothers wife is currently pregnant. So since we’re the only ones with no kids we always get hand picked to go and pick up food from wherever they ordered. We always do it but it’s getting to the point where it’s really bothering me. Usually this happens after we’re getting off work since my bf and I work Saturday and the rest of the family doesn’t but they wait for us to get there so they can order the food and then send us out to get it. I brought it up to my bf since 4th of July is coming up and they’re going to the moms for dinner and I have work that day so I really don’t want to get off of work and have to go to some busy restaurant and pick up food but he said I should understand since they all have kids and when we have kids then they’ll all find a way to rotate like what the hell. So am I the asshole for not wanting to do it anymore ?<|response|> NTA. His family is suffering from complacency syndrome. Having kids isn’t a handicap when you have family that would gladly (and probably safely) watch them while their mom when to get dinner. <|endoftext|>
169394	3	AITA for not wanting to go to a ski resort with my family for my birthday? So I'm trying to come yp with ideas to celebrate my 25th birthday. I ask my pops to see a NHL game in his hometown.. nope my brother and him already planned a football game the weekend of my birthday. I asked if I could tag along but they are going with dad/son mutual friends and they asked my dad about it during his birthday party months ago. I was like cool can I buy a ticket even its cheaper than yalls. Sadly I got the run around of no we planned this. At the sametime I didn't want my birthday to be a thing for their trip. So my dad is asking for other ideas on a different week to plan for and they ask to go to a ski resort. My mom and dad are both in their early 60's and never skied before. I personally snowboard a ton. The only reason I got the job I have was cause they get insane snowboarding/resort discounts. So they ask to go to a resort to enjoy a weekend doing what I love... well guess what I absolutely hate doing? Riding damn bunny hills for hours teaching people how to ski/snowboard and then I feel like an asshole when I wanna go up to my speed and bomb hills and fly 50ft in the air. Everyone says go have fun and enjoy your speed but deep down I know I can't leave people by themselves on their 1-3 days of starting. Especially since my parents are in their 60s and never gone before. This just screams a terrible time because they could fall the slightest way and I'm in a hospital for my birthday weekend. I told my dad "Sounds nice but you guys are getting old and Im tired of riding with people not my speed. It sounds bad but I can't tell ya how many people I've tried to go with and im just floating down bunny hills and then im the asshole when i wanna leave and go down an actual trail, cut thru woods and stuff. I'd love a winter vacation with yall especially since I get timeshares for $$$/week. My dad never texted me back and my mom started texting me and asking questions trying to beat around the bush and guilt trip me that im an asshole for saying that. I even told my dad "If a hot girl asks me to teach her how to ride its always "Yaaaa... no." Its just not fun and honestly more tiring standing on a bunny hill going 5mph rather than going fast and carving. AITA? Update: I've always been bad with expressing myself to others and how to "tactfully" say something to not hurt their feelings. I apologized to my dad and said I just want something we all can enjoy together. Instead we agreed to take a family trip to Montana/Idaho to go skiing, snowmobiling, and let my mom do her<|response|> Jeez. NTA. Your dad and brother planned something on your birthday and didn’t think of inviting you? And then he’s mad when you don’t want to do his backup plan? Wow <|endoftext|>
35775	2	AITA for chewing gum in church? Let me begin by saying that I’m 17 and far from religious. Today I went to church to watch my smaller cousins first communion. I realized that after the communion I would have to greet many family members, which caused me to pop a few pieces of gum so my breath wouldn’t stink. During the ceremony I was chewing my gum when the people in front of me asked me to stop because it was “rude to god”. Now I was kind of shocked because 1, this seemed ridiculous to me as I wasn’t bothering anyone, and two I wasn’t being loud or gross. I still don’t know whether I was wrong, or the people in front of me were overly sensitive. As I’m not religious, I really don’t know what’s wrong or right, but getting angry over chewing gum in church seems a little ridiculous. So AITA ?<|response|> INFO. How in the heck did the people in front of you know you were chewing gum if you weren't being loud? <|endoftext|>
12026	4	AITA for being mean to aggressive street vendors? I was at a street (hawkers) market in Singapore recently with my family. At this street market, vendors will come up to you very often if they see you have no food... probably every 2 or 3 minutes especially because we came well before dinner rush and there weren’t many other people for them to bother. At first I was very nice in declining their solicitations to buy food, but they don’t take no for an answer and because their English isn’t very good, you need to often say no to them 3 or 4 times for them to go away. We were waiting for my cousin to show up from work which took a while, and as a result, had to fend off a lot of street vendors - we cracked some beers while we waited. After getting tired of the vendors after probably the 10th time, as soon as they opened their mouth I would talk over them and say “No thank you no thank you no thank you” until they went away. They were not being respectful of us just trying to enjoy a few beers (and already having said no), so I wanted respond in a way to get them to leave us alone as soon as possible. My girlfriend thought my behavior was rude and that I should have continued to respond to them respectfully - AITA?<|response|> NTA. They know they can guilt people into buying food- it's their livelihood- they don't care if they piss you off- I'm sure they're used to it. If it bothered them, they wouldn't continue pestering you. You could have been much ruder- I think you did fine. <|endoftext|>
27206	4	WIBTA for breaking up with my girlfriend of two years because she's decided to abstain due to her parents finding out So I'm a bit lost at the moment. Me and my girlfriend have had a great relationship over the past two years and I've made a lot of great memories but she's religious and I'm not. I've always respected her views, went to classes and church occasionally but I don't think I ever see myself changing. Recently though (yesterday) her parents have found out that we've been having sex after all this time and have spoken with her and she's decided to abstain. We met up yesterday to talk about it and I stupidly said that I would to try work things out but in reality and with more time thinking about it I can't see it working in the long run. Plus I don't feel that we would be getting married anytime soon. It seems like such a crazy thing to break up over, but sex is an important part of a relationship and it's not something I'm willing to wait out so I guess we're not compatible. I feel like such an dickhead to break up with her because of this but I don't want to string her along for the next few months, get no sex. Then make the breakup worse because we might fight over this and shes thinking that it could work out.<|response|> NAH- I don't know why everyone is saying you are in the wrong. It is ok to break up with someone because you expect different things in the relationship. Staying with her will probably just lead to resentment on your part and the possibility that you inadvertently pressure her. If sex is important to you in a relationship then find that and you can both part ways civilly. <|endoftext|>
12338	4	WIBTA for asking my aunt to come over for Thanksgiving? So, my dad can’t really be around smoke because he had a recent surgery and can’t be around nicotine and smoke. We want to be with one of my aunts for the Thanksgiving holiday but she and my uncle both smoke a lot inside her home. We don’t want to go up there just ourselves because what’s the point of a family gathering if one member isn’t allowed to go? So Reddit, would my mom and I be the asshole if we invited my aunt and uncle to Thanksgiving dinner with a no smoking stipulation? If so, how could we politely make the request? Edit: Thanks for the input guys. My aunt was totally not offended and I learned mom and I really worry for nothing. lol<|response|> NTA because that literally is something that your dad's health depends on. You don't even have to request this that politely, as I feel like this should be more of a mandatory thing considering the situation. <|endoftext|>
27433	4	AITA for not being quiet while my boyfriend games? My boyfriend is a relatively avid gamer (he games for 3-6 hours a night) and he usually is on mic, meaning others can hear us. Other important information is that we live in a (quite small) studio, so there is nowhere for me to go in order to minimize noise. It is also relevant that I am a singer, musician, and visual artist. &#x200B; He gets mad when I am too loud while he games. Obviously this means I cannot sing, play instruments, or really walk around (I tend to be very clumsy) and sometimes he even gets frustrated when I eat crunchy/loud foods like chips, carrots, etc. My main frustration is that he basically wants me to sit still for hours on end. I've asked him to give me breaks in the middle so I can walk around our apartment, eat, sing, or whatever. He also doesn't like the lights on, so I can't draw. In this time, I can basically (with headphones) can watch TV/ go on reddit/ text friends/ do whatever, that is quiet and electronic. &#x200B; Recently we had an argument because while I was trying my best to not disturb him, I was watching videos and I kept laughing, because they were funny. He asked me if I could stop laughing, and I told him I could sit in my car, the bathroom, or he could turn his mic off. He told me that it was very disrespectful to the people he was playing with, for me to keep making noise (and embarrassing to him.) &#x200B; This is admittedly a dick move, but about 2 hours after he said he would be done, he kept shooshing me and I started singing at pretty much full volume, because I was tired of sitting on my ass in the bathroom, not even feeling like I was allowed to laugh in my own home (and it was really starting to hurt to sit on tile for \~ 2-3 hours). &#x200B; Idk if this changes anything, but I think the thing that really frustrates me the most about this arrangement, is that he obviously values the enjoyment/comfort of the people he games with more than my own comfort in my own home (from my perspective). I feel like for indeterminate amounts of time I am on "lockdown" in a way- not being able to do any of the things that make *me* happy- or even sometimes comfortable, like eating. He makes me feel like I'm being a dick for disrupting other people's gaming experience, which I know I probably am, but AITA for thinking that maybe that shouldn't be the priority here? &#x200B; Also thanks for reading this post. I'm sorry if it seems like the answer is obvious either way. I just feel like I really don't know, because he's treated me like the answer is so obvious, even though I feel completely differently. I also don't really feel comfortable asking anyone irl, because I think they would jump to conclusions<|response|> NTA. What you want to hear is that your boyfriend is a total dick and you should leave him. However, we both know that you're not going to do that, this post isn't going to change anything, and you're just going to try to use these answers into putting some pressure on him in order for him to be less of a dick, which is going to cause a huge fight between the two of you, he's going to say he can'T believe you went behind his back to talk shit about him, and he's going to post his own version of the story under the title of "AITA for playing videogames?" <|endoftext|>
42442	2	AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop watching children’s cartoons? So my boyfriend is 26 and we’ve been dating for almost 5 years. He’a a big guy with a soft heart which is why I love him. He’s compassionate, kind, loving and caring and even sensitive. But here’s the thing. I learned recently that he likes to watch children’s cartoons like Cailou and Arthur sometimes at night or whenever he’s relaxing and it really irritates me. He’s a grown man, why is he watching stuff that 2 year olds watch?? So I brought it up to him last night and he nonchalantly said that’s what he likes sometimes because it reminds him of growing up and misses those days. I get that but really??? You still watch that stuff? He might’ve gotten defensive because he brought up how I go on Facebook for my free time (he doesn’t have social media) or watch certain movies or shows that he might not approve of. Is this normal for a guy his age to watch that stuff? It’s weird. He also cries sometimes when watching something sad or that reminds him of something. I like that about him but sometimes he can cry at the stupidest things. Alright I got it I’m the asshole<|response|> YTA. Yes, it's normal. You know what's not? Telling someone you're supposed to care about that you think the things he likes are stupid. You're the one who needs to grow up. <|endoftext|>
164374	2	AITA for ditching my date to a formal event three days before? I'm not feeling too great about this. I (20F) moved to New Zealand a few months ago and fell in with a group of friends. One of the guys in the group (20M) and I really clicked as friends, and he knew I was gay from the first day we met. He asked me to be his date to his department's cocktail party in August--it's happening this weekend. I said yes at the time knowing that we were friends and felt that I was not leading him on. As fate had it, I fell in love with his ex-fling (20F). They dated for a month over a year ago and were never official. She broke up with him because he was clingy and manipulative, but also because she was pretty sure she was gay. He pined over her and was a "nice guy" for a whole year. I asked him if he would be okay with me pursuing her and he said yes. She and I started dating shortly after he asked me to the formal event in August and have been official for a month. At a friend's birthday two days ago, I was very intoxicated and my guy friend made a move on me. I denied him. He got angry and went to our mutual friends telling me I had been into it, and this news made it back to my girlfriend, who was very upset. Fortunately the group was on my side and believed me, as he'd done the same thing to my girlfriend just a few months prior. He has a history of making drunken passes and trying to take advantage of women, so they advised me to cut him off completely and not go to the cocktail party. It also seemed like he lied about the situation to break me and my girlfriend up. This situation was also extremely upsetting for her, so there was no doubt in my mind that I was skipping out on the event. I blocked him on all social media except for Facebook messenger. I sent him a message explaining what had happened and that I was not going to come on Saturday anymore. I put my event ticket up for sale in our school's Facebook page saying that I had a scheduling conflict, since I had paid for my own and wanted my $50 back if I wasn't going. He's obviously upset and though most of my friends have taken my side, a few think I should have gone anyway since I already made the commitment. AITA?<|response|> NTA. That guy’s a creep <|endoftext|>
101209	1	AITA? My mom wanted to use my expensive backpack and I told her no So 2 years ago for my birthday I got an big branded collaboration backpack and matching shoes from my grandma. It was $75 and the only backpack I will use and I use it everyday. I absolutely adore it and it’s still in perfect condition. I don’t allow people to use things that are super close to me and my mom knows that. The backpack and the rest of the line including the shoes and clothes were limited edition and aren’t sold anywhere anymore except for buy/sale where they’re $200+ and I don’t have the kind of money for that if something were to happen for it and my mom told me she wouldn’t replace it. She was going into surgery. (Not a big one) and said she needed a change of clothes. Her hospital stay lasted literally only 3 hours and she didn’t use a change of clothes and I told her she wouldn’t need a change of clothes. She’s calling me selfish for not letting her use my backpack even tho it means everything to me. Me and my mom also don’t really get along. I say she’s selfish for not seeing this from my eyes and not asking my brother for a backpack or using a reusable grocery style bag. There’s tons of other options in the house but she wanted my special backpack. And now she won’t talk to me. So AITA? Edit: the hospital she was staying at was an hour away Edit 2: I asked her to borrow something that meant a lot to her. She said no because it meant a lot to her.<|response|> NTA. How does an adult woman not have their own overnight bag, a big purse or a backpack? <|endoftext|>
134667	3	WIBTA for cutting ties with an old friend who used to tease me romantically/sexually and now doesn't care about me? Background: I have known this person since Year 8 (about 14) and I'm 26 now. They helped me be social at school when I really wasn't and helped me when I had no where to live a couple years ago. As most people do, I fell deep into a crush with her during highschool. However, she never reciprocated, so we never dated. But really, most of the time of our friendship has been her talking about how she is sexually frustrated, and occaisionally she'd say things like "you know, I think about seeing what you're like in bed" and stuff. Then I went through a rough patch a few years ago, and I stayed over at her place. She requested some platonic cuddles, and I happily obliged, knowing exactly what was happening. I didn't fool myself into thinking she wanted anything. But now I'm getting married next year. I have a child on the way with my favourite partner. And this friend? Couldn't care less. So WIBTA if I didn't invite her to my wedding and just overall cut contact, considering she now doesn't seem to care about my life? edit: a typo<|response|> NTA. Your life, your choice. If she can't be supportive or a good friend, she doesn't need to be in your life. Sounds like shes just pissed because you were her backup and now she lost you <|endoftext|>
157208	2	AITA for not even tasting food my boyfriend made I(m19) was staying over with my boyfriend. He told me he’d make dinner and went to kitchen. He called me after like half an hour. He made pasta with KETCHUP. What kinda monster does that. I told I didn’t want that and made sandwich for myself. He asked me to try it and I refused. For some reason he got so upset and wouldn’t talk to me at all.<|response|> NTA. Gross To everyone staying YTA and he should just try it: this isn’t like he made brussel sprouts and he should just have one bite because he might like it. It’s Ketchup. On Pasta. We know it’s going to taste disgusting. <|endoftext|>
81635	4	WIBTA if I didn't go to a friend's recital? Hi Background: I'm a student currently undertaking some important exams. During 'exam season', I do not have to go to school, I only need turn up for my exams. I take my studies seriously, as does my friend. She has a music recital on a day I have an exam, and has asked me to come. The scenario: This friend is very introverted and only has one or two other friends. I don't know for certain, but I think I would be considered her closest friend. Her recital lasts all morning, until about an hour before my exam (three hours total). Normally, the day of my exams, I like to study all morning. It reassures me and admittedly I really need the study time for this exam (she is also taking this particular exam). My debate: If I don't go, it's doubtful anyone else will be there for her, and I should go to be a good friend. However, I really do need to study, and will be anxious all morning if I don't. Other relevant information: * It takes me 1.5 hours to get to school, to get there for her recital I would have to leave at 7:30 am. * I do not know anyone else at the recital Would I be the asshole if I didn't go? Thanks.<|response|> YWBTA if you didn't let her know. Explain to her that you don't feel comfortable going to her recital because you have an exam that day that you need to study for. You should be prioritizing school. In terms of your character, I think it says a lot that you have debated this much about attending her recital. Maybe there is a compromise? Let her practice her recital in front of you the night before? Let her know that you still want to see it even if you don't get to be present for the actual recital? <|endoftext|>
24398	2	AITA for totally dropping my ex boyfriend? A little context, my ex and I knew each other from middle school (in our 20s now), we stopped talking for a few years when he moved to another state, got back in touch and started dating. A is ex boyfriend We were also both in a relationship with my now husband (all of us were in a polyamorous relationship and all were okay with it) Not long after A and I started dating M (husband), A started to get really really interested in M and seemed to start blowing me off... so I stopped trying to make conversation with him as much. One day, M takes a 3 hour drive to see A, and on his way home he gets into a wreck. My best friend and I rushed to his side with no hesitations, thank God he was okay though his car was totaled. All this to say, life was crazy for a few days. Now, 2 things to keep in mind. 1) I lived in the same state as M and 2) I introduced M and A So as emotions were high, A was starting to get.. mean to me. Distant, unresponsive when I tried to tell him about our boyfriend. A couple days after the accident, he flat out tells me "I dont want to be with you anymore. I want to be with M only. But I dont want him to be with you too. So he has to choose, you or me. And if he chooses you I dont want anything to do with either of you" I didnt respond to that, M gave A his answer... A still tried to have conversation with me but I never replied. AITA for essentially ghosting him for saying that??<|response|> NTA. He stated how things would play out based on M's decision, and you simply followed through. <|endoftext|>
9509	4	AITA for getting annoyed when my neighbor parks in front of our house? This is something that is not as much hitting me but rather my family, as I can´t drive and am not really affected by this situation. So, we have a neighbor on the opposite site of the street. My family currently has two cars that they use and while one of them can be parked in the yard, the other one has to be parked somewhere else. We usually do this in front of our house. That is pretty common in our street, basicially anybody has a specific space they park in. Now comes our neighbor into play. The neighbor has two bigger cars which need space to be moved around. He has garages he can park them in. However, due to his cars being big he appearantly can´t drive the cars out if someone is parking on the opposite site of the street. No problem, my family just parks the car a little bit down the street in front of our house. Only problem is he likes to park there too, when he´s too lazy to drive his car into the garage. On more than one occasion when my parents came back from a marathon the parking space was taken up by him, so my parents either had to park up the street or park on the opposite site of the streets where his garages are. Which he then complains about and puts pieces of papers on the cars telling us how shitty the parking is. He is allowed to park in "our" parking space by law, just as my family doesn´t have any obligation to not park on the opposite site of the street. I just get really annoyed by this. He is perfectly able to park his car in his garage or his yard but is appearantly too lazy to do so, while my family doesn´t park on the opposite site of the garages on most occasions. I know this is an extremely petty argument, I just find it so rude that he thinks he can park whereever he wants but gets annoyed when he takes up parking space and we have to carry heavy groceries down the street just because he can´t be bothered to park on his property. AITA for thinking this way? I know I should not get annoyed by this.<|response|> Even though he's being an asshole as well, he's allowed to park in front of your house. I don't want to call you an asshole but it's such an inconsequential problem, there's no reason to make a big deal out of it. Just park in front of his house and if he confronts your family, tell him not to park in front of yours. Also I'd plant a camera so you can see if he potentially damages your car. Ik it sounds overly cautious but if he's getting upset at you parking in front of his house don't be surprised if he does something to your car. <|endoftext|>
94891	2	AITA For telling my daughter she looks prettier with shorter hair? The other day my daughter asked for my help in styling her hair because of an event she was planning to attend. I helped her out, but couldn't help but notice how long her hair had grown. The last time she got a haircut was maybe a year ago and it looked much better then. Not just because of the natural split ends that come from that, but I think longer hair doesn't really frame her face quite as nice. I told her that while I thought her hair was pretty, she looked prettier with shorter hair. I didn't think she'd take this comment the wrong way, but she did and got extremely upset. She kept repeating that I said she was ugly, which I obviously never did. She then said she planned on keeping it the way it was and by this point, I was a bit irritated and told her "you never listen to me," which was apparently the wrong choice. She accused me of calling her fat and overweight when she was younger (she lost a lot of weight after she graduated secondary school and is pretty thin now) and said that I thought she was ugly. I denied it again of course and she finished it off by saying "you looked prettier when you were younger," and that was that. Since then, she has seemingly been avoiding me which I think is silly since this was nothing more than a petty argument. I admit that I should not have said anything else after the initial comment, but I was really so wrong for what I said?<|response|> YTA. Why even say that as she’s getting ready for an event? Did it serve any purpose except put her down and tell her, that in your opinion, she’s not looking her best? This is clearly not the first time you’ve done this, either. <|endoftext|>
43980	4	WIBTA if I kicked my mom out of my house? So my mom and 2 brothers have been living with my husband and I for about a year. My moms never really been responsible with bills which makes it really hard. We decided upon them moving in that they would pay a flat "rent" amount. Our bills are obviously higher but we still pay a majority since it's our house. However, theres 4 of them and 2 of us and they're always late on paying. We cant have people over too late because they go to bed early. Our love life is minimal because they're always home and now my mom is saying we need to help her with all the food she buys because she's cant afford it. My husband and I buy our own food and toiletries for ourselves and the guest bath. Shes really only buying things for herself and my brothers. They're old enough to help her out but she refuses to take money from them. She insists I buy my own food and label it. In my own home. So, I'm kind of over this entire situation and would like her to leave. My close family says it be mean since she's my mom but I can't anymore. Would I be an asshole if I asked her to leave in a reasonable timeframe?<|response|> NTA. You're being very reasonable in that you're going to give her a reasonable amount of time to leave if you ask her to do so. I know it can be hard to have to do these things with close family members but she shouldn't be imposing on your life. If I were you, I would just ask her to leave - maybe you should even offer to help her find a new place and everything too <|endoftext|>
116907	4	AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister? The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out. &#x200B; My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on. &#x200B; I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it. &#x200B; I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong. &#x200B; Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents "expect" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was "grounded" because i turned my phone off in the theater. &#x200B; It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her. &#x200B; I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her "slave" for the rest of my life. &#x200B; I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here? &#x200B; Edit/Update kinda: Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's<|response|> NTA. These are perfectly legitimate and understandable feelings. You have done nothing to sign up for taking care of another human being (it's not like she's your kid), and that was wrong of your dad to "joke" about, because it sounds like he probably is really thinking along those lines. Be honest with your parents about how you feel- make clear that it's insane that you're expected to be a full-time babysitter (grounded for no phone in a theater? That's fucking bullshit). <|endoftext|>
94238	4	AITA for coming out to my grandfather who can't handle stress at the minute? I have always been pretty close to my grandfather and always saw him as my father since my real father was absent. I have always been a daddy's girl even when I met my boyfriend at 14 and later dated at 15. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 8 years and I only came out as bisexual to him last year after denying and doubting myself for years, I did come out to my gran at 13 and she told me it was a phase and my hormones etc so I decided to put it in the past and I hated the thought of being bisexual and how people will treat me as it made life with friend awkward etc. I talked to my boyfriend about telling my grandparents about being bisexual because I just want to feel fully accepted, my boyfriend saw no point as I would never be able to bring a girlfriend for them to meet since my boyfriend and I are planning to get married etc. however, I told my grandfather today after beating around the bush and talking about my brother who is bisexual and asking questions such as "would you have wanted 'my brother' to tell you or stay silent?" etc and questioning religion etc, however, my grandfather is suffering from health and mental problems and his head is a mess right now and any stress will make him confused. I feel like an asshole for putting my need to feel accepted above his mental health and taking all of this in at once. I just wanted to finally be able to feel like I am free if that makes sense. Am I the asshole for wanting to come out before it is too late and risking my grandfather to become very stressed?<|response|> NAH. Honestly though, if you really do end up marrying your boyfriend, and maintain a monogamous relationship, what does it matter to come out to grandfather, or really to anyone? I’m not trying to be dismissive of your sexuality. That is a sincere question. <|endoftext|>
83678	4	WIBTA for deliberately making my parents life hell? I come from a Malayali family(Indian for those who were wondering) however I was born and brought up in Mumbai . Recently my parents have been talking about shifting back to Kerala as they believe it will make us "come together " as a family. All of my siblings (20m,15f) and me (16f) think that this is utter bs and they just want to be closer to our extended family. However this shift will reduce all of our chances at a better future as we aren't going to get all the opportunities we do presently. Also , we don't want to be separated from all our friends. My brother will still remain in Mumbai as he has a job, but us girls will have to go. My family is full of misogynistic and homophobic people and my cousin (who is gay) has suffered enough shit from them. We tried to explain all this to our parents but they just won't listen. So me and sis decided on what we think is a good plan. The idea is this - we will start putting insane amounts of effort in our school and extracurricular activities so as to show our parents exactly what we will miss if we shift . Both of us are very talented at singing and painting respectively and know that we could win a lot of awards if we tried . If that doesn't work then we will start dropping hints to our family friends about how unhappy we are about this shift. Both my mom and dad are people pleasers and will bow too the pressure. The reason we didn't perform to our full capacity earlier is that my brother(who is a genius in computer) started hating it because of my family's pressure to constantly overachieve. Neither of us wanted our respective talents to become something we hate so we decide to underplay them. We know for a fact that this tactic might destroy or at the very least put a strain on our parents social life, but given that they would gladly do the same , neither of us feels really guilty . However when my brother heard of this , he thought that was very cruel of us , so we wanted a 2nd opinion.Also fyi this has been an issue for 3 months and it has devolved to near daily fights on this issue. So, WIBTA for knowingly destroying our parents social life? Edit: ok so a lot of people do not get what the issue is here. I *am* aware that me performing well doesn't make me ta. What I meant to ask is whether the both of lying to our parents by ommision and now making all their friends laugh at their idiocity makes me ta. I specified my culture as we don't believe in telling others about our family issues . Edit2: I have a feeling that most of the responders are American or something. Please understand that in my culture, log kya kahege( what<|response|> NTA. You’re a kid, and you have very limited power. Your parents are making a decision that will have a serious negative impact on you, and you have very limited means through which you can try to advocate for yourself. Your parents don’t seem to want to listen to you, so you’ve found a way around it. I’m unclear though how this would make your parents’ life hell? It sounds like you’re going to shine in school and have family friends pressure them to stay. What is so bad about that? Staying doesn’t sound like it would be hell for your parents. <|endoftext|>
124553	3	AITA for not saying anything? Ok so pretty much, I work in a restaurant/cafe where our main front is as a cafe but the owner is a well known restauranteur who thinks the business can be more than it actually is (he was given management of the place as a lease sort of thing by the city council). I was working FOH one day, and it was a pretty quiet day so my manager was looking to send someone home early, I'd had a pretty full week in terms of hours and i was starting to feel my anxiety start to creep in so i volunteered and the manager let me clock out and go on my way. Since it was pay day though, i wanted to treat myself a little bit and ordered a proper lunch from the kitchen before i went out back to get my things. When i came back out my lunch was ready and the cafe had gotten a fair bit busier so i grabbed my plate of food and went and sat in the smallest table we had off to the side and in the corner so I could just be by myself. While I was eating, a boomer couple walked past, and the husband stopped by while the wife kept walking, obviously looking for a table, and he asked if they could share the table with me. Being caught off guard like this and still reeling from my mindset I kind of stumbled and didnt really say anything (I get very quiet when I'm anxious) but then almost instantly his wife called him over saying they could sit up at the bar leaner. My manager came up afterwards and told me I could eat my lunch out back in the office if i wanted (my manager is a saint, he is incredibly kind and understanding about my mental health), so as i was walking out back i passed by the older couple and said to the man "I can go out back and you guys can have the table if you'd like" but then he just waved me off and said "Its alright you were already rude enough" which took me aback, because while I get that it probably came off as rude, I didnt think it actually would considering I probably looked very scared he was even talking to me. The interaction left me in a bit of a sour mood for the rest of the day, so I just ate my lunch and left. So, AITA for not saying anything?<|response|> NTA. That dude’s just a weirdo. I saw your response on another comment where you were trying to see things from his perspective, which is really nice and fair-minded of you so points for that, but fuck that guy. Don’t waste your time feeling guilty, he’s obviously not as nice as you. <|endoftext|>
144200	3	AITA for not immediately helping a coworker First off a little background so you understand our situation at work: In our department we have the office and the non office people. Office people usually don't interfere with the other peoples work but we might be called to help out if we're short staffed. There is a certain thing non office people have to do at a certain time period. Lets compare it unloading a truck delivery, just not quite as labor intensive (it's still lifting things up and moving them). There is no set time limit for how long this work should take, but it usually arrives at around 1pm and should be finished by 3pm. Again, no big deal if it isn't but the work not being done by 3pm maybe happens once or twice a year. &#x200B; At this particular day we were very short staffed. I did realize this by arriving at work in the morning but didn't think much about it as I would (usually) get called if I needed to help. At delivery time I went on lunch break with a colleague from another department. After coming back I was called to my boss' office because a coworker filed a complaint. She was all alone during delivery time and saw me walk out on lunch break instead of helping her, which pissed her off. Now doing this work alone is shitty, I get that. But neither did she call me at the office to help out, nor did she call out to me when she physically saw me going out on lunch. If she called out to me then I would have surely come back. Not to mention if she waited about 1 hour there would've been other colleagues coming to help. She didn't need to finish the work by herself as it is not (completely) time sensitive. She wouldn't let this go so we basically don't talk to eachother anymore unless we really need to interact for work. Our department is pretty split on this, as most people say she could've just called me, while others say I work here long enough (5 years) to know that I should help out on short staffed days. &#x200B; What do you think?<|response|> NAH This is a failure of management to define a specific protocol to handle these situations. If there were a well articulated policy in place then there would have been no conflict. <|endoftext|>
18524	3	AITA For telling my SO that I value her advice and my friend's advice differently because they work in different fields Hi everyone! First time posting here. &#x200B; While talking about my job prospects, because it's currently not going so well right now, I said to my SO of almost 2 years that while I appreciate her advice, it's different because she's not in the same field, Computer Science. She is Math and Econ and works with pricing at a large company. I live with housemates that will be interning at Amazon, Google, Capital One, and Goldman Sachs and we often talk about the hiring process and the technical interviews. She said she is hurt because I said that I value my housemate's advice more than hers. But I explained that it's different because when she gives me **general** advice I value her input greatly, comparably to my mother's advice. However, this, specifically, is something that she might not have as much experience in, which I do not blame her for. &#x200B; That being said, her feelings were hurt, so clearly what I said wasn't okay. I apologized immediately and told her I will try to structure my words better so that this doesn't happen in the future. &#x200B; This happened yesterday and she is still upset about it and does not want to continue our regular conversations through text, because I am at work during the weekdays and visit her during the weekends. &#x200B; I would love some input on what I might have did wrong or is there something that I am not seeing? &#x200B; &#x200B; **EDIT:** I want to clarify that I did not verbally compare my SO to my mother. I respect her enough to know not to cross that line. Also, as one of the Redditors mentioned, the reason why I said that her opinion and my housemate’s opinions are different is because she verbally told me to not rely on their experiences because it’s something that I can find online. To which I partly agreed with but I also said that doing mock interviews with them and learning about the questions that were asked during their respective interviews is extremely helpful.<|response|> I'm going to say YTA becasue while it's she's not directly working in computer science. Those companies you listed are large and deal with math, econ, and pricing. Are you sure there isn't going to be some overlap in the hiring process? Plus, you're the one without a job right now, she does and you're going to devalue her advice right now? <|endoftext|>
30060	3	AITA for asking my dad to pay me back for a speaker? I have a speaker I purchased off Amazon about a year ago now. I believe I payed $25. My parents are going on a trip to their native land soon and my dad wants to “borrow” my speaker. He has his own speaker but it’s really big and bulky. Mine is like a triangle shaped beats pill so he wants to take mine on the trip. The problem is, they have a lot of family that lives in poverty and I know for a fact every time they go they give a lot of their own things away since they can “just buy another one” later. He’s been asking and asking for my speaker and i said no because I know him and I know he’ll end up giving it away. He swears he won’t but once those kids hit him with “wow that’s so cool... we don’t have anything like that here. If we did it’s soooo expensive” and the puppy eyes, it’s over. I told him to buy his own speaker on amazon since he could even find a cheaper one. He found the same one I bought but it’s cheaper in a different color. I have Amazon student prime so I signed in for him to get prime shipping. I comply forgot to add his card and just checked out with my usual payment method. When I realized i had used my card, I asked him to send me the $20. My mom was so upset with me for asking him to pay me back. I work a minimum wage job and I have been forcing myself to only use my money towards paying off my debts, groceries for the household, and gas. I try so hard to not buy anything unnecessary because I don’t make that much and I want to save up for a car. I love my parents and of course, if this was a situation where he couldn’t afford his own speaker, I wouldn’t have said anything. He didn’t say anything about me asking for the $20, he just sent it to me through PayPal but my mom is so upset and saying I’m stingy and ungrateful for asking him to pay me back. I feel really bad about it now and if I am TA in this situation, I’ll give him his money back. So reddit, AITA?<|response|> NTA. Your dad agreed to give you the money to order him a speaker with the benefit of your free shipping. <|endoftext|>
104894	5	AITA for now not wanting to go to my cousins wedding? Bit of a long one guys but I’m a bit stuck. My cousin is getting married next year, she is on the side of my family we only get to see on occasions like Christmas and the odd get together during the year. Now she has invited me to the day of her wedding but only invited my girlfriend to the evening... my problem here is that the wedding is over 4 hours drive away and we’re going to be going up with all of my family that are also invited but because my girlfriend isn’t invited to the day of the wedding (only the evening party) she is going to have to stay in the hotel on her own all day. I’ve explained to my cousin I don’t really want to have to expect her to do that but apparently there’s just no space which is absolutely fine, I understand that happens with weddings and what not you have a number and can’t go over that.. so I’ve said i will just come to the evening aswell... she is now quite upset and doesn’t seem to understand why I’ve made this decision. Am I missing something here? I’m only doing what i think is right! I’m not driving 4 hours with my girlfriend and my family to then have her be the only one who has to wait in the hotel on her own all day until the evening whilst everyone else is at the wedding... need some outsider points of views I think? The way my cousin has reacted I am seriously considering just telling her to take us both off of the list completely.. does that make me an asshole? I don’t really know<|response|> Yeah, I do think you’re being an asshole. It’s a shame your girlfriend isn’t invited to the day portion of the events, but it is quite common. After all, it’s not just about space but each additional guest for the wedding breakfast costs the couple getting married. So I can see why your cousin might not want to invite your girlfriend, who she barely knows, to the expensive part of the wedding. You mentioned you’re getting married in Bath. Bath is beautiful. There’s so much your girlfriend could do during the day. Plus it’s weird you haven’t brought this up with her - really over protective. It is kinda awkward for you and your girlfriend, but you’re seeing it as a slight when it isn’t. It’s about space and money. <|endoftext|>
35238	3	AITA for not wanting to talk a lot? Hi there! Obligatory formatting apology, mobile, etc. Basically, my roommate (19f) and I (20f) are very close friends, have similar rooming styles, and are in the same sorority. We spend a LOT of time together. And I genuinely enjoy that time except... she's been like, really chatty lately. Mostly in the room when it's just the two of us. And while I'm always willing to set down my phone and pay full attention when it's something serious, she knows that a big part of the reason we are rooming together is because we like a really quiet room. For me, that includes a lot of the more extraneous chatter, because when I'm in my room I often take that time to recharge and sort of retreat into myself (I'm super introverted). So I end up getting kind of annoyed and not really fully participating in those convos (not ignoring, but not adding or feeding into them). So, AITA for being annoyed and trying to shut down more of those conversations? Also, WIBTA if I brought this up to her? I haven't yet out of fear of hurting her feelings, but I feel like a lot of these convos don't have to take place in our room which is a designated quiet space.<|response|> NAH. If you want to bring it up with her, do it with tact and good intentions. That being said if you expect your room to be a 24/7 quite place I think you are expecting a little too much. <|endoftext|>
4678	4	AITA for not inviting a friend to a movie night? I'm part of a friend group that really enjoys watching movies, and it is made up of six people (excluding me). We regularly go watch movies together in theaters and hold movie nights at each other's homes. One of our friends (let's call him Tom) is a film student in university. And he is an absolute pain to go watch movies with. He nitpicks every single movie that we watch together to the point it sucks all the joy out of the movie. When we've confronted him about it, he blows it off as him being "analytical" and thinks that we're not "enlightened enough to understand true film". Next week, I'm hosting a movie night for my friends, and I am seriously considering not inviting Tom over, and just inviting my five other friends. My parents and my brother thinks I'm being an asshole, and I do feel a little bad about excluding him from a group activity like this. AITA? &#x200B;<|response|> Give him a warning, “I’m hosting a movie night but I’m not having you over if you plan on monopolizing the convo with your critique.” Then it’ll be up to him if he wants to go. It’ll solve the issue of that night specifically and also tell him that, as a group, your comments were serious- he may want to reconsider his behavior if he wants to stay in the group. Totally fair!! <|endoftext|>
82600	4	WIBTA if I refuse to or refuse to allow my son to participate in my fiancé’s family Xmas traditions? Okay anon because my soon to be mil has found a vent post about her from my main account before. So my fiancé and I have been together a little over two years. We have a 13 month old son, and we are set to get married in March. Like a lot of people, we split up the holidays between my family and his. The first year we were together I spent Christmas with his family, last year we did thanksgiving with them and Christmas with mine, and this year it’s reversed. So we’re set to go to their place on dec 21, and stay for about a week Their traditions start on Christmas Eve. They have always gone to dinner and then to an evening church service. I will say, I am very openly atheist to my fiancé, but I do not think he has told his parents that. I like to refer to my fiancé’s family as part-time Christians. They go to church like twice a year, once for Christmas and once for Easter. His mom is all Jesus-y, and mentions god more often than I am really comfortable with, but it usually doesn’t affect me so I don’t argue. The first year we were together, I really wanted his family to like me, so I went to dinner and just sat quietly through the service after. This year, I am not comfortable going. I don’t want to offend anyone really, so I won’t say what I really think of church and christianity as a whole, but I am not comfortable being in a church for any amount of time and I don’t want my son to be forced into going without a say. I told my fiancé that I would not be going, which he said was fine, but he wanted to take our son. We argued for a bit and I just told him we’d talk about it a different time. He thinks I’m being an asshole because I won’t let our son participate in their traditions, but I think he’s being ridiculous by trying to force religion on a person who doesn’t know any better and can’t make their own decisions. So, Reddit, AITA for wanting to leave the Xmas eve dinner with my son and just wait at home until everyone else is done at church? Side note, the church service would literally be starting at our son’s bedtime, so that is another hesitation I am having.<|response|> ESH. A 13 month old isn’t going to be indoctrinated by attending one church session. He’ll probably just scream and cry through the whole thing - so not much point, really. But you and your fiancé need to have a conversation about religion ASAP - his vote is as important as yours. If this helps: another way to think about it (when he’s older) is that by being exposed to different options, he will actually be able to make an informed choice for himself. He will probably have a greater understanding of other people, of literature, of art, and even of world politics, just by knowing what others believe and think. (Obviously this isn’t going to happen until he’s older.) <|endoftext|>
179948	3	AITA for repetitively grounding my son because of his marijuana use? TL;DR : Son keeps smoking weed, I keep catching him. He no longer hangs out with friends. Does good in school despite smoking. This is a long story. The first time anything had happened with my son was when he was caught at a party drinking and had to go to a substance abuse program after blowing a .076 BAC. This was beginning of sophomore year (high school). My wife and I had let him off easy, trusting that he would not do this again. We talked about how it’s wrong to drink at this age and he seemed to fully understand and cooperate with us, so there was no punishment. Fast forward to January of his sophomore year, I had found weed ash outside of his window on the snow the morning after he hung out with a couple of friends. I took his phone and he wasn’t allowed to play xbox or meet with his friends for about a month. At that point, I decided to start randomly drug testing him. Some time after he was ungrounded, he went on an overnight field trip for his business club, where he smoked with his friend and I was able to find out after he tested positive for THC. He was once again grounded and not allowed to do basically anything for about a month and a half, and because of this he didn’t go skiing much and after that the season was over. He no longer hangs out with his friends because they all enjoy smoking when they hangout. My son says he likes smoking and he doesn’t experience any side effects which is hard to believe. He has good grades in schools with only a couple Bs from 9th grade and the rest are As. He seems to be really upset that he doesn’t hangout with his friends anymore as they don’t include him in many activities. I think it’s for the better since he won’t be ruining his childhood through marijuana use. He is a very social person so it’s kind of a bummer he isn’t with his friends. So reddit, AITA for being too harsh?<|response|> Reddit's going to say you're being too harsh because Reddit likes weed. Regardless, though, it's your house, smoking under 18 is illegal everywhere, and if your rule is no illegal behavior then that's the rule. It's concerning his friends smoke on school trips where the consequences could be serious and impact his post-high school plans. NAH. <|endoftext|>
18635	4	AITA for quitting my job without giving notice? I worked a night job, taking phonecalls from customers and putting orders in the system. I was employed casually for 16 months working on a roster that gave me about 4 or 5 nights a week, though the shifts were only four hours. Most nights, I didn't even work the full four hours and was sent home half an hour to an hour early, meaning I didn't get paid for the time that I missed out on. This is a problem, because (due to a very bad depressive episode that began a few years ago that I'm now getting on top of with meds and therapy) I am in debt and need all the money I can get. The working environment was very toxic. The supervisor and her 2iC were petty and belittling, and showed no respect for anyone but each other. They constantly complained about our manager (who works the day shift), other staff members, and customers. They showed blatant favouritism with those of us under their authority. There were two of us employed before another girl, and my supervisor and the 2iC trained her beyond what we were trained to do, despite that fact that we were senior to her and she was employed to do exactly the same job we were. Ultimately, she also resigned before either of us. They were also vulgar and inappropriate, making jokes and comments that are not appropriate for the workplace. Recently, the supervisor made a joke to the other non-favourite coworker that she should have picked up one of the clients of the prostitute who works down the street to "make a little extra money before you go home". I was offered a new job doing something similar for another company. The hours are better (30 hours a week, looking to move into full time after a trial/training period), and I'll get benefits like sick days and leave that I didn't get at my casual job. I have accepted this job and started less than a week later, finishing up my roster with the old job without telling anyone until payroll was processed because I didn't want them stripping me of what few shifts I had left there or not paying me, because I needed the money. TLDR: In order to escape a toxic working environment I took a new job, and they asked me to start in 3 days. I left my job without notice so they didn't take away my last few shifts and paid me on time. EDIT: I should also point out that I was not under contract with the former employer, and my status as a casual employee meant that I was not required to give notice by law. It would have purely been a professional courtesy, and had my new job asked me to start in a few weeks, I absolutely would have given notice.<|response|> NTA. Your old job sounded like absolute pure misery. Nothing wrong with leaving without notice, especially since you were part time and only working 15-20 hours a week of misery. <|endoftext|>
72754	3	AITA because I don’t want my brother to come on my birthday trip? I’m 19F and live with my parents and (30M) brother. I turn 20 in a couple weeks. I don’t really want anything for my birthday. Christmas isn’t that far off and I only want a few things for then which I can wait for. My mom offered for my birthday, since I happen to have a long weekend from school on the day of my birthday, to take me on a little 3 night vacation at this little resort town a couple hours from where we live. We went once before for my 16th birthday and my present was an amazing spa treatment and that’s basically what she suggested we do again. I happily agreed. It was going to be just my mom and I - my dad said he wouldn’t come and would let us have girl time. The problem I discovered today... my brother found out when and where we were going and had never been and now wants to come with us. I really don’t want him to. Him coming would change the whole dynamic of the trip and be another person to worry about. I feel selfish but it’s MY birthday and I don’t particularly get along with my brother. He’s loud and unorganized and often speaks over me and just drives me crazy. I was actually looking way forward to getting away from him for a few days. My mom said it was up to me and I said I really didn’t want him to come. I feel like an asshole, but I also think him coming would ruin my good time :/<|response|> NAH. Not all siblings get along, and this was set up as a "girls trip" so bringing your brother would clearly change the dynamic. Your mom even gave you the choice so they seem to understand. <|endoftext|>
54473	4	AITA for choosing to put a criminal record onto a girl for a small crime of taking my wallet? Im a highschool sophomore and visited korea (home) for a week in summer vacation. Very first day I ride a bus w my mom to the dentist and at the end of the ride notice my wallet is gone, we checked the whole bus and its nowhere to be found. It was really early in the morning so very few people rode the bus and as we travelled for over an hour 2 or 3 people kept changing while we stayed on the whole ride. Anyway we get off and instantly go to the police. It was a valuable wallet with lots of money inside that I had saved up to spend for a week and also as we rode that bus and checked everywhere, we concluded that it was likely a theft, not me just dropping it somewhere. Anyway we get back to HongKong, where I live, and after a month we get a call from the police department that they had found it and could give it to us if we come again on August. As we submitted it as a theft however we had a choice to either send her over to the criminal place (not sure what its called in english) where she would get a line and a history of criminal activity or we could just sign the paper saying its all g. We decide to sign the paper with an apology from her. However later we get another call from the police saying she can not be there on that day so we should just go and sign without apology. Obviously we were not happy with that as she should adjust her to time to meet us, so we decide not to sign if shes not there. Now thats when the police goes bat shit crazy on my mom saying we’re entitled victims and not all victims are good and we should just sign as we live away so we’re obviously rich and this wont fuck w us at all. We get pissed, hang up and just instantly send her over where she gets a criminal record. Its harder to get a job and she was studying to become one of the government workers which she cannot get now because of this. I honestly feel bad and ppl tell me im an asshole for ruining her life over a wallet. AITA? Edit: I do understand we should not punish the girl for the policeman’s attitude, but as she did not contact us in any way and we got her thoughts through the police, it seemed like there was no explanation from her for us to make a better choice.<|response|> You didn’t ruin her life, she committed the crime of stealing your wallet (which isn’t exactly small) and those are the possible consequences. You would’ve been forgiving, but she didn’t even offer the apology, NTA. <|endoftext|>
171866	3	AITA Taking all the money that my deceased father left off from my sister because she's going to spend it with non-constructive shit ? My father died a month ago, and left some money for me (22) and my sister(25);We are splitting the money 50/50 Fair and Square.She wants to spend half of her part in a trip, a mountain hike.But the point is. She's unemployed and that's the only money she's got left, for expenses (the trip will cost half of the money + expenses from the trip and to prepare, it will happen 2 months from now.)She'll have very few left when she's back from it. Will not have ANY source of income and will have thrown all that money away.The point is.The account is on my name, legally the money is mine. (Dad trusted me more with finances)And i want to either invest that money or save it for some good purchase. Like a car a college education.If we invest the money, or at least hold it to buy more important things than a trip. It will be more beneficial for us.Am I the asshole if I do not let her access her part of the money ? EDIT1: Dad died all of the sudden, no testament of will, and I would NOT use her money, just hold it. Edit 2 : Update, decided to leave it at that. Will not hold her money.<|response|> YTA. You know it was intended to be split 50/50. Maybe using it to make memories is how she wants to remember her dad. While you might legally have the right to withold the money, you know that's not what was agreed/planned/expected. YTA if you keep it from her. <|endoftext|>
54132	4	AITA: Ditching My Mom For My Dad Growing up I was 100% a momma's girl, she was easily my best friend. My dad worked a good amount, but even when he was home we would mostly argue or not speak (we are both very hot-headed individuals). We would argue a lot, and typically name-calling was involved, just very low-blow-type arguments that were mostly based on my lack of caring about highschool & grades and his strict rules of not letting me really have a social life. My mom was kind of afraid of my father because of how he would yell and she would sometimes back me up in arguments but other times side with him. I told her how I hated him (teenager stage) and even went as far as saying to divorce him. Also, my parents went years without sleeping in the same room, it was strange but my mom blamed it on his snoring. I knew they had their issues. Anyways, right before I turned 17, my dad got into a very serious accident. He broke almost every bone in his body, had to get a leg amputated, lost a ton of blood, and wasn't going to make it. Fast forward a year or two, quite a few strokes, some seizures, and a couple heart attacks later, he made it. Needless to say that scared the living shit out of me. My dad lost his job and went bankrupt while he was hospitalized, and was going through a real shit time. My mother and I were there for him the whole time. Until she wasn't. She filed for divorce while he was still in the hospital (towards the end). I felt anger towards her for it and for the first time ever- I sided with my dad. After my dad got out of the hospital and the divorce cleared up, he moved out of state and I stayed with my mom for a while. Until I decided I was going to move closer to my dad because I was so worried something was going to happen to him. Since I didn't have the best childhood with him I felt like I wanted to have a better relationship with him since after his accident (one of those 'you never know what you've got until it's gone' type moments). My mom was not a fan of my decision. She stayed in the same town as I moved across the country to stay with my father. She didn't contact me often, she'd sound annoyed when I called, and things just weren't the same. Recently I visited back home to see my mom and we got into a very intense discussion. She told me she was upset and hurt that I would choose my father over her. She brought up how he treated me like shit as a kid and said terrible things to me and how she was always there for me. She told me that things would never be the same with her because of my decision to move closer to<|response|> NAH. family Dynamics change immensely when accidents happen. That's okay. It is also ok for her to feel hurt or upset over those things as I'm sure they did hurt. Probably would have been better if she discussed those with you at an earlier point but things happen. I'd say the person who is the most asshole is your father for the mistakes he made. But again, NAH. <|endoftext|>

And there is no animal shelter in my area :( So i dont know And I thouth of giving her a shower in my backyard but my brother told me it would get sick<|response|> NTA you are a very compassionate person. Chances are, the cat will find somebody else who will feed it, or find another food source. They’re rely self sufficient as long as they’re old enough to survive alone <|endoftext|>
172985	2	AITA if I’m upset my boyfriend keeps using my bath bombs I know how stupid this sounds but my brother got me some lush bath bombs for my birthday and I kept them at my boyfriends place because he has a bathtub and I don’t know in my bathroom.. Now he loves baths and I occasionally get him his own bath bombs because he takes them more often than me, which he takes as me not wanting to use them. But.. I specifically asked him not to use them because they were a gift with each one being picked out for it’s purpose or it’s name and I wanted to use them myself when I have the time. Now we’re in a fight because he used 2/3 and he says I’m being selfish... AITA for not wanting him to use my gifted bath bombs?<|response|> NTA, tell the sulking child to simply buy his own like a big boy <|endoftext|>
58057	5	WIBTA for telling me roommate her “boyfriend” is not her boyfriend and she needs to emotionally mature? My roommate (23F) met a guy at work in March. They both lived in the same city at the time, but only three weeks after meeting and hanging out outside of work once he moved to another state. They text every once in a while and she likes to send him nudes (that she sometimes sends to me because wants approval) to which he will respond with “nice” or “you’re hot.” Fast forward to May, she flies out to visit him and the first night he’s “busy with work” so she has to stay in a hotel because he says he won’t be home all night. The second night she goes over, loses her virginity, and has sex a couple more times with him the next day. When she flies home the following day, she is telling me how head over heals in love she is with him. More texting and nudes ensue and now we’re at this week and she is complaining to me that he only wants to talk over snapchat because he “wants to respond to her right away” (her words) even though he responds to her (15 a day) snaps around once or twice a day. She will send a boob pic and when he responds with anything less than a “drool” response, she calls him out and asks why she isn’t getting the attention she deserves. He’ll respond with “I’m in public.” Basically, what I’m trying to say and I’m rambling is it’s VERY clear he is nowhere near as interested in her as she is in him and she’s acting like a crazy girl, should I tell her???? WIBTA? Edit: thank you for all the advice so far. Also sorry for misspellings and errors due to mobile use.<|response|> NTA You mean well, but don't do it. I 100% guarantee that it is going to backfire on you. She's crazy in love with this guy, and she is NOT going to listen to you. She's going to think that you "just don't understand" or "you're just jealous." Trust me, I've been there. She is not going to listen to reason. The best thing that you can do for her is to be there when this goes bad, and she gets hurt. She's going to get her heart broken and she's going to need you then. <|endoftext|>
