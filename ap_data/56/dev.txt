893	1	It's a must read. If you're the type of person who wasn't compelled to finish the Mortal Instruments, this book will bring justice.
861	1	great read...
612	4	Reading Ulysses is like ascending Everest. Establish a base camp at the beach, watch for the fireworks. Leave your fellow climbers for dead at the bar during the parade, and try to find that treacherous passage to the next level. The winds and weather are bad at times, particularly in the brothel, but veterans say that if you can make it to the soliloquy, you are home free. I teared up at the ending, in part from the beauty of the passage, in part from relief and shock at the pure achievement.
46	2	Great read. Very well written, with vivid imagery and consistently well crafted and clever prose. The author makes a lot of insightful points about a variety of issues and the characters are well developed.
885	1	two words... Absolutely Adorable!!! The love story of Hunter and Taylor was very entertaining and a great read.Simply an awesome Read!
283	2	For a short novella, this certainly packs a punch! Looking forward to learning more about Charles and Anna, and their world.
468	1	"How I LOVE a bad-shit crazy character! Gone girl deliveres that in lovely ""I will eat your soul"" plot! Love it!"
846	1	Holy hell. What a ride. My heart was ripped out a couple of times during this book. Madeline Sheehan has left me absolutely speechless. I will post a review after I think about this book for a while. A must-read!
660	2	A great finish to the D'Artagnan series - definitely enjoyed it. Ending wasn't what I wanted though, you could tell he was just trying to permanently end the series. It could easily be having seen the movie made me want more drama.
577	2	AWESOME READ!!! I loved to story of Aiden and Emma. It was a little predictable but in a very fun, easy read sort of way. can't wait to start reading the proposal!
302	2	I was unimpressed with the substitution of several seemingly unrelated stories strung together for the novel I was expecting. Yes, they all tied back together in the end, very clever. Disappointing, because normally I really enjoy that sort of clever. Plus, I was all excited when the first of the stories started up and it was back in the crimelord days. Perhaps what I should really do is go back and re-read Taltos and Yendi.
829	1	Read this book. End of. Full review to follow shortly.This Man ConfessedJodi Ellen Malpas
273	2	2.5 stars. There is a good short story here that has been unfortunately puffed out into novel length. The story/characterizations are very thin. This is the type of mildly entertaining work you read in an afternoon and forget a week later.
83	2	I liked it. I would have loved alternating points of view in Divergent... except maybe that would have killed a little of the mystery and intrigue surrounding Four. This was a good glimpse into his side of things, but it feels a little hastily written. Can't wait to read the other shorts about him.
579	2	It started off slow and it didn't really go anywhere until near the end. The romance was predictable and some twists were o.k.
229	2	Art was pretty, Lori is amazing and so is Carl. I still love Rick but the entire quality went a step back for me. Michonne is horribly written and Carol slitting her wrists over Tyreese makes no sense to me at all. Not my favorite volume so far.
806	1	I loved this book. I agree with Elizabeth - the movie wasn't close. Something about Nicholas Cage trying to do an italian accent?
584	1	Third read through. Still can't make it all the way through without calling friends who haven't even read the book to ugly cry.
715	2	I truly enjoyed this book. Tina Fey is funny, but that's nothing new.
696	2	"3.5 stars. Took me forever to read this because of college. I don't know if that affected me or not but once I started reading again after a month things seemed kind of dragged. It picked up again for a bit. Some of the decisions that Jacob and Emma made were so annoying and I felt like the ending ""battle"" was a bit of a cheap exit."
913	1	I love a good mythology book.
117	2	I kind liked this book - but I didn't. It was sort of funny sometimes and I really liked how he speak in a past/future tense because of the time travel thing, but the story got a little dragging on the other hand.
349	1	I'm in so much pain.
872	1	CUTE
150	3	This was a great tale. It was written for children obviously, and it has a fairy tale feeling to it. The whole time reading this I kept thinking about how I can't wait to read it to my kids when they get older. How did I not read this when I was younger? Absolutely delightful!
389	1	Re-read August 2016.
74	3	3.5 stars In fairy tales, when the lost are found, they get to enjoy the happy ever after that they deserve. For Lily, escaping the monster that held her captive for eight long years should have been the start of the happy ending for her and her six year old daughter. Instead, it is just the beginning of her next painful journey, one where she must battle with the man who kidnapped her, face the family who has fallen apart in her absence, find some balance with the man who had been her first love, and discover her place in this strange new world that used to be her home.

40	3	A good book but a definite comedown after the first two excellent volumes. This book is beautifully written as were the first two but it is thin and repetitive. Not a lot of plot progression or character development. A pleasant read but I felt no urgency to keep turning the pages. What new material is present here is quite good, there's just not enough of it.
726	2	Let me just say that before I read this book I liked to think of myself and neutral and leaning toward Team Unicorn...Now, post-reading of this book, it is safe to say that I am Team Zombie. The zombie stories were brilliant and excellent, the unicorn stories (with the exception of 2-3 stories) were just plain horrible and stupid.
685	2	I was afraid it would merely be a rerun of Pillars in a new era, but it managed to add a new dimension.
842	1	Put this on your list of must reads ASAP. One of my top 5 of 2012. I don't write long reviews but suffice it to say I was up until 3AM finishing this book. Andrew Parrish is my new book boyfriend. Oh, and did I mention the sex is HOT? Beautiful beautiful story.
593	4	This is the first Erdrich novel told from one character's point of view throughout that I have read, and it is well done. Erdrich uses a few sneaky ways to get other peoples' information into the story, but they are believable (even the dream stories). I was glad to see familiar names. Nanapush has a significant role, and others make a cameo appearance (Father Damien, a character from The Bingo Palace, and two other families whose names I recognized but can't think of now). There is an interesting balance between the tense plot moments and boyish day-to-day moments as the plot moves inevitably onward to a satisfying ending. We really get to know the major characters, and I found most quite likeable.
669	2	3.5 Stars First book by this author, not what I expected! Lots of swoony romance plus lots of drama. Loved the strong heroine, she saved the day for me! Also loved the very hot sexy times. Full review to come shortly.
500	1	A really great ending to a gruesome, tense, romantic, and exciting trilogy.
618	3	4.5 Stars! WOW! What a gorgeous story! New-to-me author Emma Scott has written a beautifully-crafted, lyrical story with memorable characters and a simply beautiful love story. Full review to follow.
934	1	Just bought this book. Bout to read it (in a couple months...) LEGGO!
298	2	This time, there is another murder and Hannah has to investigate to help clear her friends name. A nice secuel to the first book. I enjoyed reading it, because I love the town and the characters. The main plot about the murder was nice, and I love when Hannah gets way more clues and info than the cops. Its cute and fun, but just that.
767	2	Lost me after the sweaty, limestone dust filled rape scene
348	1	One of the best stories I've ever read.
346	1	Rating: 3.5 stars. It was a fun read.
376	1	I'm trying to decide how many stars to give this book. Yes, it is poor in laces but in others it is ok and I was drawn into the story and the world. Probably two and a half but I'll have a think.
979	1	I NEED this book like yesterday! Can't wait for this.
742	2	4.5 stars, just because I struggled so much with the beginning of this book and it took me a long time to get into it. Once I did get into it, however, I read the last 280 pages in one sitting!
811	1	"""Loving or warring, it always felt good with her. Although loving was better, because I got to sleep over."" Fantastic addition to Tate and Jared's story! Full review to come."
925	1	Man, oh man. I don't even know what to say about this book. So many things...
274	2	"Great read! I guess I am more used to King's later work however because I actually found myself thinking ""I wish this was a little longer."""
666	2	After the first read, this book is the worst one in the Harry Potter series. Characters are not as likeable as they are in the other books. However, I recently reread it (after reading book 6), and found it to be a very good read.
818	1	Review to follow.
170	3	Like the other Elizabeth Chadwick book I read (A Place Beyond Courage, about William Marshall's father) I found this really beautifully written and pleasingly descriptive. I love how immersed I feel in the time period. However, William Marshall is presented as a fairly two flat two dimensional goody goody character here. I also prefer my novels to contain more internal monologue from their protagonists. This book needed greater analysis of Marshall's inner life, his inner thoughts and feelings.
173	3	This is an incredibly fast read (I read the whole thing on my morning bus ride and when I was administering midterms) but a really solid one. Great character development, I really understand who these people were and why they behaved the way they did. The relationship between Connor and Ann feels very true to life. A sophisticated and nuanced treatment of abusive relationships.
136	4	After reading just the first few pages of this absorbing fantasy novel, readers will swear that the authors has magical powers of her own. The action, the characters, the mythology, the setting- every element of this tale shimmers off the page. Street smart con artist Nahri will steal you heart just like she eventually enchants Dara, the djinn that she accidentally summons. These reluctant partners must work together to escape foes from Dara's past, discover the full potential of Nahri's talents, and learn their roles in a kingdom fraught with a tangled history and dark betrayals. The next book in the trilogy cannot come soon enough! This ARC was provided by HarperCollins, in exchange for an honest review.
86	3	Prettily written and easy to read, but for a 400+ page book there's not as much there there as you would expect. Sisi is isolated from court and largely disconnected from politics, which means we focus mainly on her feelings about herself and her family, her daily routines, and a few interpersonal relationships. This stuff is fine but a little thin to build a whole book around.
41	2	This book is crazy awesome! Fantastic world building, beautiful writing, great character and relationship development. I just found every aspect of this book compelling. A fascinating start to what promises to be a spectacular series.
66	2	I love unexpected twists in a book, but I hate them nearing the end of the story. I should probably hate this book, yet I love it. It's raw, it shocks you, it makes you smile, and it makes you cry (really). Great book :).
240	2	I liked the concept behind this I just didn't find it entertaining. I guess the problem for me is that any literary detectives have to come up against Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next stories which are my favourite books of all time. I kept expecting this book to be funny but it wasn't. A good and interesting idea but perhaps brought in too many different magics and for me it didn't really fully explain what the library was and the importance of it.
545	1	One of my favorites from Grisham. The movie was good to (but of course not as good as the book)

547	1	Man I wish I hadn't read this yet so I could enjoy it again.
978	1	The sentences, they are beautiful.
560	2	I totally came into this book expecting a cliche, cheesy romance. I honestly thought the book was going to be about the MC dating twenty different boys during the summer. Luckily, I was wrong.
990	1	3.5 stars Listened to audiobook.
98	1	If I marry Rainbow, will I get half of her brain? How does that work? One of the best stories I've this year & this author is quickly becoming a top favorite of mine.
974	1	The lesson here is that you cannot know whether you like something unless you try it. Some senators are not as smart as they think they are.
218	3	When Jenny Kramer is brutally raped, her parents are devastated, the police are stymied, and the inhabitants of the quiet little Connecticut town are shocked. In an effort to help, Jenny's doctors offer to give her a new drug that will erase her memories of the attack, and she and her family jump at the chance to make this horror go away. Memories are not so easily suppressed, however, and Jenny finds that living without the full knowledge of that night might be worse than facing the truth. With the help of a local psychiatrist she attempts to recall the rape so she can see that the guilty party is brought to justice- but by the time the truth is completely brought to light, there will be more pain, betrayal, and death than anyone could have imagined. All is Not Forgotten is a seriously disturbing thriller, with twists and turns that will not soon be forgotten. This ARC was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review.
439	1	Surprisingly cute read!
347	1	This is so so so adorable!
138	4	Sadie Blue was determined to make something of herself, despite the harsh nature of her childhood in the little mountain town of Baines Creek. What seemed like true love and a hope for a brighter future tarnished within days, however- now, at 17, she is stuck with an abusive, drunk bastard of a husband, and no way out until she begins to realize that her humble little community might hold the answer to her prayers if she's brave enough to reach out. This story, set in 1970s Appalachia, is a tale of sorrow and triumph, a cathartic read that drags you low from the first sentence in order to ensure that you feel the release when Sadie finally gains her well-earned happiness. Weiss reveals terrible truths in subtle phrases, showing readers a long legacy of misery, hardship and bad choices that Sadie must fight to break free of. If the Creek Don't Rise is full of compelling and engaging characters and an intricately crafted setting that makes the back woods folklore and simple kind of justice feel right at home. Thank you to Sourcebooks for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.
576	2	AWESOME SEXY READ!!! Only problem I found with it was that it ended a bit suddenly and I feel like I was left hanging. Not in a cliffhanger kind of way but I just wanted a bit more on their HEA... But other than that it was a great read.
335	2	3.5 stars In this rather odd, but decidedly charming novel, a lonely and work-obsessed woman inherits a remarkable sourdough starter and embraces a new hobby which leads to many personal and professional surprises. This ARC was obtained at BookExpo17- with thanks to Macmillan- in exchange for an honest review.
695	2	I enjoyed this book. It wasn't perfect or innovating, and it was kind of predictable. Still, it was a nice read and I enjoyed the story. I also like how the romance was kind of already established, so it wasn't insanely cheesy or cliche or something.
160	3	This was quite the nifty book. I really enjoyed exploring the world Cheney created. I know less than nothing about Portuguese history so I approached this as the type of book where the author builds her own unique world rather than as a story that has anything to do with real life Portugal, though this does have some of the stylistic trappings of historical fiction that I enjoy. Interesting characters, an ambitious multi-layered mystery, solid prose, a highly enjoyable read for sure. I look forward to reading the next volume.
877	1	Review to come soon...
288	2	3.5 stars. Though bumped it to 4 just for Reid and his HEA ending. This was a fun, quick read for me. I enjoyed the H/h even though the whole tough MMA fighter turned makeover TLC What Not to Wear was a bit hard for me to buy into. Other than that I enjoyed the writing and those hot sexy scenes.
411	1	Review to come
626	3	4.5 stars. Saying this book was amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. However, it lagged in some parts and it didn't really pull my heartstrings as much as I thought it would. I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars but still an excellent read none the less.
333	2	Very good debut novel. Sharp plotting, good characterisation and great world building without being intrusive.

928	1	One of the best books in the series I think.
982	1	Listened to audiobook.
681	2	Ok I think this book should come with major warning labels! I mean come on can anyone withstand sooo much death and sorrow like Caden? I mean seriously poor guy!! I am left depressed and will require several hours of watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S episodes to get over the gut wrenching, depression leading, emotional wreck I became after reading this book.... Sooo if you want to cry, get depressed, then this book is for you. But as for me, as much s I loved Ever and Caden and only wish for their happy ending I don't think I can handle what I know will be a very sad journey on the next two books.
106	2	When I picked up this book, I didn't know much about it or about the author. I think that was for the best, as I didn't see any of the surprises coming. It reminded me of something by Victoria Holt or Mary Stewart. I didn't think they wrote books like that anymore, so it was a nice find. Now I'm eager to read another book by this author. (Note: I received my copy of this book through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.)
504	4	One of the most enjoyable stories I've read in some time. Captain Jack Aubrey was a fascinating character. You just wanted him to succeed - to capture the Spanish vessel, to gain the respect of his men, to gain the respect of the Admiral. The book is set during the Napoleonic Wars, and it was interesting to see all the Kings ships were nothing but glorified pirates, capturing all vessels they could on the open seas. The book also strongly reminded me of my sailing lessons from last summer - I still had to look a lot of words up, but I remembered ones like leeward and abeam. Makes me want to go sailing!
198	3	As bizarre as this horror/humor/80's love letter novel is, I feel like it was written just for me. Being the exact age of the protagonists, the pop culture references were alarmingly familiar, the horror tropes were right up my alley, and the entirety of the book was just ridiculously fun. While I never had to save my best friend from demonic possession, I can't help but think that might have added some much needed excitement to my slightly sedate teenage-hood. As an aside, the paperback cover of this book is the most insanely perfect piece of artwork I've ever seen! Love it!
970	1	I think I might have enjoyed this book even more the second time around. I'm even more excited for The Rose and the Dagger to come out on Tuesday now, and I didn't think that was possible.
981	1	Listened to audiobook.
892	1	And then all of a sudden im for team will. 4.5/5 bc. I wanted more fight scenes :O jem djjqjjujnfhe but will is so s weet omg
587	2	3.5 - 4 Stars! Fans of strong Alpha heroes and military romance will like this one. There is lots and lots of swoony romance and a very dramatic plotline. If you want to lose yourself in a romantic story then this is the book is for you.
833	1	Nice and angsty! Sexy and very emotional story. Team Ash all the way. But I have a soft spot for Mason!
101	1	I hadn't read this because I'd heard there was a cliffhanger ending, then I heard there wasn't. I decided to read it and find out for myself, and it doesn't end in a cliff, but oh, it sure does leave you wanting more! I really really enjoyed this book. It has everything that I love. I cannot wait for book 2! I'm pretty sure you'll be adding Marcus to your list of BBFs!

205	3	Bumbling every-man Tom Barren goes from the 2016 of our futuristic dreams to the 2016 we are all sadly too familiar with, thanks to his typical bad luck and a time-traveling fiasco. While Tom goes on a quest to return to his own timeline, readers are treated to a fast paced story that has something for everyone- science, romance, adventure, suspense, family drama, philosophical quandaries and more. Everything works seamlessly and results in a book that is sure to delight. Thank you to Penguin Group/Dutton and Netgalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.
387	1	Nev Chamberlain, you are a sexy man... YUM! This was a great, fun and sexy read from beginning to end. Though an epilogue would have been nice to see what else is in Nev and Cath's future.
705	2	"2.5 stars. The beginning was pretty confusing, and it took me a while to get used to the italic writing. I wish the author just decided on one point of view, instead, this book is written in both first person and in third person. Honestly the synopsis just explains the whole book. The book wasn't really what I was expecting, Arthur didn't even die until the middle of the book and those ""seven years of hardship"" were literally just skimmed over. I just skimmed the ending because I didn't feel like reading pages worth of italics."
521	3	DNF. Gave up at around 20%. Way too many grammatical and editing issues for me to continue. I also couldn't get past the simplistic and degrading nickname that Vicious had for the heroine (he called her Help) That was offensive to me. Moving on.
637	3	I had a lot of fun reading this one! It was really compelling and I liked all of the characters a lot. It was equal parts creepy, funny, and romantic. The only problem I had with the book that knocked it a star was the fact that there would be times when reading where I felt that certain events were really choppy and didn't flow in a way that made sense, or Mara reacted to something in a way that I didn't understand or wasn't believable. I'm really hoping a lot of things get answered by the end of the trilogy. Other than that I really enjoyed this and can't wait to start the next one after that ending!
175	3	"Without getting too heavily into spoilers this book has a contrived final act twist that undermines a lot of great work that comes before it. Also, both this last turn and the first supposed ""secret"" is very obvious to the audience long before the author actually gets around to spelling them out. That being said, if you can deal with coincidence to the point of contrivance in your narratives, this is very well written and interesting."
471	1	This book is so damn good!!
838	1	Hot and steamy. Review to follow..
222	2	The Shahrzad in the original Arabian Nights was a force to be reckoned with, truly cunning, manipulative and fearless. This Shahrzad was nowhere as impressive. The writing was beautiful but maybe I'm just not a fan of overly Romantic stories. It just failed to impress me.
604	4	Principle thesis: black Americans (and, by extension, any minority) might in actual result have been better off over the last 50 years with some form of (voluntary?) segregation, to the extent that such segregation could fire an angst to excel against the cracker powers. The thesis is troubling to the alluvial plain of the post-Civil Rights movement in America's political-culture, but the writing itself is a blazing scrim of hip-hop cultural riffing that leaves no bleeding heart do-gooder unscathed, no conservative talking head unsullied, no cultural sellout untouched, and no stone (or Molotov cocktail) unthrown. That is to say, it is very sharp, fun, and painful to read. Rated PG-13.
38	2	Not up to par for Chamberlain. This book isn't glaringly bad but it is mostly bland and forgettable. Of the two point of view characters one is dull and the other is potentially interesting but not given enough time to engage the reader. Mildly entertaining at best.
834	1	4 1/2 stars, a beautifully written book. Full review to follow.
8	3	Fascinating, frightening, enjoyable, and much better than the movie! One of the greatest things about Clive Barker is that no two books of his read the same, they are all truly original and so different. If not for the advertised fact, I wouldn't know that the same man who wrote The Abarat wrote Mister B. Gone and any of his others. It seems the main thing they have in common is their fantastic consistent quality. I definitely count him among my favorite authors.
133	4	This book is kind of tricky. It is pleasingly written stylistically and it's an easy read so I cruised along on the momentum of the smooth prose and the potential of what this book could have and should have been for a while before I realized that it is hollow and aimless. This is a book where the extraordinary is deliberately made mundane for some reason and characters are stubbornly underdeveloped. It is as if all the drama has been removed from this story, leaving a bloodless collection of 19th industrial factoids sprinkled amidst a bunch of ciphers enduring an oddly dull series of tragedies. Mildly entertaining for a while but ultimately unsatisfactory.
258	2	"If you pick up this crazily awesome book late at night like I did last night you will be forced to stay up all night just to finish it, as I have. I just could not put this book down. It was unique and creepy and really excelled at creating a frightening atmosphere, while having ambitions beyond just scaring its audience. All the fun of a popcorn read and all the beautiful prose, sensitivity, and depth of a so called ""literary"" novel. I loved it! Drop what you're doing and read this now."
578	2	Another end of a great series. A great way to end the series, too. ;_______; Everything was properly sequenced and I never get tired of Marie's alternate POVs unlike other books where it feels like there's only one narrator speaking even if there is two. ((Also, am I the only one who's interested in Antarctica??? That place is so cool))
937	1	I feel as though I should re-read this...maybe soon?
162	3	"It took me a little while to acclimate to this book. At first I found the time jumps jarring and the dialogue over stylized. However once I got into the rhythm of the story I thought it was pretty awesome. This is set in a fascinating historical time period (San Francisco 1876) and in addition to the main plot we get great information about a heat wave, a small pox outbreak, race riots, baby farms, corrupt juvenile ""reformatories,"" legal prosecution of cross dressing, etc. The characters are dazzling and complicated and enthralling and the backdrop is great. This book is a bit messy narratively for sure but it is so cool and unique and engrossing I would highly recommend it."
954	1	Hey! No pointless love triangle? YES PLEASE! :D
317	2	I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the second book! While I liked the characters and I know secrets must stay somewhat hidden bc of whatever underlining plot there is, it turned me off that there wasn't really enough for the reader to go on and even try to figure out what Jax' big issue is. Maybe it was me. Either way I enjoyed it.
78	4	Attorney Catherine Lockhart and her husband private investigator Liam Taggart are quite a team, frequently working together on cases that require their combined skills and determination in order to provide justice and closure for those who seek their help. Apparently they are earning quite a reputation as the ones to hire for unique and challenging cases, because their newest prospective client is a woman with a wild story of a war-torn city, a cherished sisterly bond, and long-ago promise that must be fulfilled. Readers craving a well-crafted mystery with a rich historic background will be pleased to discover Catherine and Liam, and will surely be eager to hunt down the previous two entries in this engaging series. This ARC was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review.
798	1	Loved this book.
313	2	I finished reading this at 2am. Two words: CLETUS. WINSTON. I'll be back with my favorite highlights, but as usual Penny delivers a witty, smart, lovely story that I'll be smiling about for days and definitely re-reading in the future.
48	4	This book was super awesome. It was compulsively readable, it was very hard for me to put it down once I started it. In the hands of a lesser author this book about a dysfunctional family who gathers together to sit shiva after the death of their father might feel old hat but the consistently witty prose and impressive insights into human behavior and relationships elevate it considerably. In addition to the toxic relationship between the four siblings, the protagonist is also contending with the destruction of his marriage. Great read!
217	3	Whitehead has crafted a horrifying and moving vision of the plight of a cotton plantation slave whose journey toward freedom takes on an Odyssey-like feel. Cora is a fully realized character that draws readers in as she experiences abuse, love, betrayal, and hope for a new future.
128	4	Stylistically, I found this book quite witty and well written. India Black had a clever, biting narrative voice that immediately hooked me in. However, style was all this had going for it. The actual meat of the story was totally underwhelming. I was not intrigued or entertained by the plot at all, and no character outside of India leapt off the page to engage me. Even India's charms as a protagonist wear off because her narration, while fun at times, is one note.
305	2	This is the sort of fascinating and unsettling book that draws me in and keeps me up reading and ultimately makes me wonder: Am I jaded by too many exploding giant robots? Because I don't, at the end of this book, feel like anything has happened at all -- not even to me.
60	4	Although this book doesn't stand up to a re-read quite as well as I'd like -- the actual plot is not very complex and even the first time through serves mostly as a character vehicle, which means that the second time it can get a little frustrating watching people fail to realize things which are by now quite obviously foreshadowed to the returning reader -- the two things that I loved about it so much the first time remain utterly delightful, enough to keep those five stars up there. One: the post-apocalyptic setting is just the way I like it, with the patching-together of old technology to new purpose, the generational gaps between the people who remember and the ones who don't, and the hints of someplace else to go where things are better but also worse. Two: the use of religion as magical realism generates a very weighty background because it can borrow from actual history, and it provides (to me, anyway) an immediate connection with the characters (like the protagonist here) who start with a strong fear of and resistance to it because they are nonbelievers/grounded in nonmagical realism.
740	2	My favorite installment so far! I'm so bad at writing reviews for later books in series but this book was amazing. It had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and I've grown so attached to all of these characters. I'm so excited to read winter but at the same time I'm so not ready.
646	3	Eudora Welty hits one out of the park with her pitch perfect white trash versus the educated/cultured. This short, well-sketched novel builds slowly to the last angry scene in which words are finally exchanged. Perfectly describes the lament of humble, reflective persons when confronted with persons who care only about themselves.
848	1	6 stars!! I'm DEAD. Full review to come after Release Day, May 14th. Eyes Wide OpenRaine Miller
328	2	A near future tale of a world where disease is defeated. Told from the point of view of the cure. In so many ways this is a brilliant book, grim, but brilliant.
589	1	4 1/2 beautiful stars. Loved it. Review to follow.
691	2	It was cute, fun to read. This book just proves that you just can't wait and stand by. You have to climb the stairs (lol) and make the first move. If not, nothing is ever going to happen.

965	1	I just love Amy Poehler so much
664	2	I read this while backpacking through Europe after college. It was a fascinating insight into the Spanish culture - anyone going there should definitely read this.
536	3	Sad yet heart-warming all at once--well written and an easy read An extremely well told tale, with an historic background that brings on the melancholy. Bad people are everywhere, sometimes right in front of you--but the most painful scenes are lightly told. The writing is very smooth and somewhat formulaic, so it is possible to skip ahead to the dialogue and not miss any story point. This enabled me to power through in 15 minute subway ride segments over the course of about ten days.
228	2	I raced through it so I might have skipped some details. I love this better than The Apprentice, that's for sure. The ending was different than what I was hoping but as long as it's interesting, it was worth read.
461	1	So apparently I am Team Zombie after all. I was not expecting that!
528	3	There is nothing quite like a Tessa Bailey book for a good hot dose of dirty-talking Alpha. A well written story, smoking hot sex scenes and characters I actually cared make Staking His Claim a must-read. I absolutely love Matt Donovan! And since I do judge books by their covers, I also give an A+ to this steamy cover for Staking His Claim. Highly recommended. (ARC provided by the publisher for an honest review.)
711	2	Really liked this book and while I see the similarities to Vampire Academy I feel like VA had more charm. Still, this book was kind of predictable but I really liked it.
645	3	My first book by Hurston since she showed up in a deck of famous author cards. Very original and easy to read once you can get into the flow of converting the spelling of vernacular speech into spellings you are familiar with. Hilarious sayings and stories. The protagonist is strong like that in the Color Purple (Alice Walker loves this book) and her three (consecutive) husbands are also well drawn and believable. Wonderful.
225	2	Since I hate writing reviews, I'm gong to keep this one short and sweet. WHY DID IT HAVE TO END? I want an Angel Moreno of my own. *sniff* (I can dream right?) The only thing that irked me about this book was how petty Sarah and Angel were being when it hit climax.
557	3	Some very interesting character development, an attention holding plot. Some historic information about World War II women prisoners (though the country was changed). Once the main character became an entrepreneur, it became unbelievable, but still a fun read.
832	1	Wonderful book! Full review to follow
694	2	The lore in this series is incredible. I absolutely adore it. I felt like this book started dragging in the middle and it was completely unnecessary for the book to be 600 pages. There are still some loose ends but I enjoyed reading this so.
518	2	I haven't stayed up until 5am to finish a book in a while - it felt good. This was a great murder-mystery thriller, and more interesting as it's set in Sweden and deals with journalists, corporations, and hackers. Good stuff!
721	2	4.5 stars *sigh of content* Faith in Jennifer Brown restored. I LOVE Hate List but was EXTREMELY disappointed by Bitter End. Well, after reading this book, safe to say she has redeemed herself(at least in my eyes). This book was pretty predictable and the ending was open-ended but it was beautifully written and the journey was amazing! Learned a lot about OCD too!
975	1	My oldest child is five. In a few years he will be able to write as well as Dan Brown.
164	3	This book was just awesome. Beautiful writing, unique and well developed mythology and world building, interesting and complex characters, moral complexity and nuance, a plausible romance (I usually hate love at first sight story lines, this might be the only book I have ever read that actually pulled one off). I just loved this one. Can't wait to read the second.
736	2	I absolutely loved this! These are the socially conscious fairy tales we all need and deserve. Such a good collection and a perfect way to end my Miss Peregrine binge read.
36	3	This book was more modest in its ambitions than any volume of the magisterial first Mistborn trilogy but it was still a rollicking good read. The plot was well constructed, the characterizations were strong, the banter-y dialogue was enjoyable to read. It also did a good job of setting up some great mysteries for subsequent volumes. I am also really excited to find out that volumes two and three are coming out relatively soon so I don't have to wait too long to see the continuation of this story.
149	3	Two gleaming, sad, pristine stories about loss and healing. They're written with a lot of sentiment, which translates into beauty sometimes and corniness at other times. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Katayama's Socrates in Love, for instance, but I also got the feeling, several times, that Yoshimoto writes like Murakami haters like to think Murakami writes.

18	2	This book was dark and thought provoking. It was like an experiment in human nature, written from a child's point of view. It was the perfect length too.
230	2	I love little Carl. Hershel kind of annoyed me in this one, whereas I really like him in the series. Andrea and Dale together is a freak-fest, but hey whatever floats your boat.
21	2	currently on 23 % and taking a little break from it as it is about to send me into a reading slump. I am enjoying the book a lot and it is a easy read but I need to take a break from it because I strongly dislike reading Catelyn, Rob, and Ned's POVs and there is so much of them. This review will be edited once I manage to pick it up again and continue it.

620	3	An unblinking, unvarnished look inside the brutal life of a 70's MC gang. A perfect stroy with incredibly detailed referenced to South Florida in the 1970's. An ending that will take your breath away. Let the author stalking begin!
988	1	4.5 stars Review to follow.
522	4	"Had the pleasure to read an early copy, and it is just a beautiful story!! A Love So Tragic is a gorgeous second-chance romance. Nic and Peyton have a passionate connection but a very rocky road to their own HEA that is emotional, sometimes painful and very, very REAL. I loved the ""rawness"" of it all. More to come closer to release day!"
747	2	Ally Carter's newest series has everything typical of an Ally Carter book in the best way possible. Carter's books are always fun and full of strong female characters. I think that this series is a little more mature than some of her other series, but it could just be that she has grown as a writer. Overall a great plot and fun characters.
259	2	I loved the first story in this book. I found the second terrible and the third stale and mediocre so I decided to quit there.
111	3	3.5 stars Nick Cutter, the author of the wonderfully creepy The Troop and The Deep, is back again with a new horror story that has an Old West feel. Three guns for hire are recruited for a possible rescue mission- a woman's nephew is being held at a compound called Little Heaven, where Reverend Amos Flesher holds a cult-like power over the community members. The Reverend is a minor threat compared to the ancient evil that our unlikely hero's wind up doing battle with in this disturbing novel that is sure to delight horror fans. Thank you to Gallery Books and NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.
264	2	I really liked this book at first but as it went on I found it overwritten and meandering and just exhausting. I made it through 300 pages but I just can't bring myself to finish.
192	3	I was a little worried, because this book starts out like the kind of stock Lifetime movie where a middle-aged woman decides to change her life, but once we start getting the flashbacks to Judith's teenage years in Nebraska, it gets much more interesting. McNeal is a fabulous writer, and his descriptions of both people and nature are very apt. Plus, it's always interesting to read a love story written by a man, especially when the main character is a woman. It made me cry, and that's one of my tests for greatness in this kind of book.

351	1	Blah. Nothing here to keep me interested. Maybe I will try again another time.
395	1	review to come
319	2	This is difficult for me to rate. On one hand I loved it, on another I didn't. Regardless, it made me think. It made me thankful for my life. It made me open my eyes a little wider. For that, I rate it a 4.
24	2	Too many authors think that they have to use the shock value because of JK Rowling and George R R Martin. This book is unnecessary and ruined a quite enjoyable appendix to the Shadowhunter world. Unimpressed.
116	1	Just ok. Liked the characters but Ash, didn't like the world or the ending. So, not for me.
485	1	This was very much up my alley. I really enjoyed it :)
508	4	Another warm, romantic and totally hot story! I have a confession: I am addicted to Alexa Riley's books! They are quick, sexy, and always well-written. The heroes are devoted to their women and the heroines love every second of it. There's always a HEA in the world of Alexa Riley!
329	2	What can I say, a guilty pleasure. I read these after watching the third or fourth TV series and they are not disappointing. The writing style is light and not without humour, much more so than in the series. Fluff, but enjoyable fluff.
894	1	First Neil Gaiman read
465	1	Huh. I could've sworn that this was already on my shelves and reviewed....
301	2	Reasonably funny, but not as ambitious as the first one; it suffers by comparison. I'm definitely still interested in more in this world, though.
922	1	Read this years ago but I'm pretty sure I cried at the ending...
663	2	One of my all-time favorites. The ultimate revenge story. One fascinating aspect to think about was that back in the day this novel appeared as a series of articles in the newspaper in France...
279	2	4.5 stars. Really good! I can't wait to get into part 6. Fascinating dystopian world and great character development. A few very minor nitpicks about the ending of Wool 5 but other than that, awesome reading experience.
672	2	This novella gets 5 stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue, and 1 star for the often laughable supporting storyline. There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV's but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.
864	1	Review to come soon...
952	1	Aww fluffyness level= max. Oh, and the protagonist has some raging hormones...
801	1	A quick read, and probably better than  The Da Vinci Code.
163	3	Cool plot and world building coupled with some really cheeseball writing. I was interested and impressed by many of the things in this book. I liked the premise, the mythology, the pacing, and I found the plot pretty consistently involving. However I also spent some time rolling my eyes at the pedestrian prose, all the stupid asides about clothes, make up and cars, everything having to do with generic yet improbable super jerk Jericho Barrons. A fun read though as long as you set your expectations to guilty pleasure rather than high quality literature. I picked up the second book right away despite the flaws in this one.
171	3	I am happy to report this book is just as great as book one. It builds on the first book and sets the stage for the third in a deeply satisfying way while also having a well constructed beginning, middle and end of its own. Character development remains excellent, and the moral and intellectual sophistication of the narrative remains intact. These books are simultaneously mentally and emotionally engaging. The world building is so great I feel totally immersed in the book's universe. I can't wait to read book three!
71	2	So completely adorable! Simple, sweet, & satisfying (Lily is right, alliteration is fun!) From the beginning readers know the path this tale will take, but watching Lily & her pen pal reach their happy ending is a delightful journey nevertheless.
297	2	Ok, So I know this book is about nothing but a silly, senseless love story, but I still enjoyed it. Its not well written and has MANY flaws, but I'm a romantic and like some parts of the book. Specially the end, when there is finally some action (even if is way too far-fetched). However, I get that this isn't one of the best books of all times, not even of the month, but I think its enjoyable and anyteen would fall in love with the book, even if it doesn't make any sense.
853	1	Great book. A must-read.
189	3	"Huh. I like this book a lot better the second time around, and I'm about to start reading the rest of the trilogy for the first time. I'm not sure what I think of the device that gives away what I would have expected as the plot of the trilogy in the first pages -- this is obviously not a spoiler, so: Tobin clearly does successfully take the throne, which ought to be shifting the focus from ""what happens"" to ""how do people feel about the way it happens"", but I still feel like the pacing of the story is very conventional and driven by the tension of whether Tobin can be positioned for the coup.... Brilliantly creepy, though. It will be interesting to see how the question of Tobin's sexuality is handled in the next book!"
639	3	Reading this book, at first, seemed very tedious to me. I wanted a decision from the main character so badly, and was so angry that she couldn't seem to make up her mind about anything and when she did make up her mind she changed it a day later. But really I think that I just really sympathize for the situation she is in. I don't focus on as many of the smaller details as she does, but I'm not sure what I want for her in the long run. I personally prefer Aspen over Maxon and think it would be great if she just waited out his military service and lived a nice quiet life as a two since she hates being in the spotlight. However, I want her to become queen not because I want her to necessarily be with Maxon, but because I want her to be able to use her power as Queen to fix their broken society because she has the courage and passion to do it!
112	3	3.5 stars, 9th&up A young woman with a traumatic past attempts to break out of her self-imposed shell, which results in her being re-introduced to the boy who saved her life when she was younger. Sparks fly, complications arise, and Mallory begins to suspect that this time it might be her turn to do the rescuing. Teen readers in the mood for some angst with their romance will be well served to pick up Armentrout's latest novel. A sigh-worthy, satisfying read. This book was obtained at BEA16 in exchange for an honest review.
918	1	So much happened in this book.
255	2	I read half this book and it was inauthentic, pretentious garbage. It feels like it was written by a hipster alien who has no concept of how people and relationships actually work. I considered finishing it just so I could dismiss it in good conscience and enjoy a few more laughs at Groff's expense but ultimately I decided life's too short and bailed.
287	2	Super short yet steamy read. I would've liked to see some more character development. Not sure if I would jump the guy who left me 10 years earlier the way Charlotte did though. I wanted to see him grovel more. :P
773	2	Wonderful period description of what it was like for British traveling to South America. One of the best descriptions of a fever I have ever read.
772	2	For the description of the machine of capital alone in the early chapters this book is a stand out. And then later the scene in the farm store.
14	3	I await each new Liane Moriarty book with heightened anticipation- and her latest does not disappoint. Truly Madly Guilty was an engaging story filled with humor, tragedy, angst, envy, secrets, and more. Reading this novel is like being privy to juicy gossip whispered across a white picket fence- irresistible. Spread the word: this is a story that should not be missed! This novel was obtained from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
463	1	Re-read 8/2008
17	2	I literally did not finish this because it was too intense. I wasn't ready for the level of darkness I reached, and so I gave up. Good stuff, just a little too much for right now. Perhaps I'll try again. I loved the first book!
85	2	There's bits I hate but I'm going to give it a four for beautifully marrying the futuristic with the supernatural. At times it is brilliant, at times purely frustrating but that's 16 year old girls, talking cats, characters from Shakespeare (I'd take him more seriously if he was called Robbie), iron horses and a dark mysterious winter prince can do.
72	3	Psychic powers, dangerous adventures, & true love. Oh my! From the very first page (with its entertaining email exchanges) to the last paragraph (where all loose ends are tied up nicely, complete with a HEA), Krentz/Castle keeps readers fully satisfied. Another fine entry to the Harmony series.
689	2	Surreal. Entertaining. Far more allusions than I can recognize. Worth pondering.
33	3	I continue to heart this series. Balogh has a knack for writing well developed characters that the audience develops a strong attachment to. She doesn't bother with melodrama, or contrived misunderstandings, or plot propelling stupidity. She trusts that she can captivate her readers by chronicling the lives and loves of fundamentally good people working through their grief, growing as individuals, and falling in love in a mature, thoughtful way.
997	1	Listened to audiobook.
