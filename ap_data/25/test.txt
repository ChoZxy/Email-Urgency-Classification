Mr. Romney's amazement wasn't just about some gadget at a "petrol filling post" but that people could actually buy food products there and that they actually eat it.\n\nThis very second Mr. Romney isn't even carrying a wallet.

You don't have to look like a runway model, but YOU DO need to look like you take care of yourself, eat reasonably well, and exercise.

WW seem to want to be a size zero, while WM seem to like the athletic Swedish model body. Anyway, I think both of the ladies above look very attractive. However, I don't understand this fixation on having butts and thighs that are WAY out of proportion with the rest of one's figure. That isn't attractive to me, personally. I just don't get it. And, seeing a HUGE rear on a small girl just doesn't make any sense. I don't know how it's physically possible to have skinny arms, legs, waist, and still have a humongous derriere and/or thighs. Many men like a nice-sized butt, including WM and AM (I know from experience), so a BW's full, round bottom isn't necessarily a problem for men in general. But, MOST men (including BM) don't want a bottom that's so obese it looks like it's own planet. Get and stay in shape for your own health and opportunities, BW."
