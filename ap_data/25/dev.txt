218	neg	"How A CSM Works. \n  After a hand is over the cards just used are placed back into the shuffler to be mixed with the other cards in the shoe. Shuffle Master\u2019s King uses an elevator system to randomize the cards. As the elevator is moved up and down, cards are randomly inserted into one of the 19 shelves in the elevator. The shuffler randomly selects a shelf of cards to deliver into the shoe. Because of the non-linear process, every discard re-inserted following a hand has a chance of appearing in the next round.  Although Shuffle Master says The King differs from their competitors continuous shufflers because the others use a linear design most CSMs so the same thing. They put the discards back into play and does away with the dealers having to stop to physically shuffle the cards at the end of a shoe. \nThe House Edge The continuous shufflers have no benefits for the player and has been dubbed the "uncomfortable shoes". It eliminates card counting for the skilled player and will also have a major disadvantage for the basic strategy player. It speeds up the game! \nWhen the CSM was first introduced many players felt it would probably increase the house edge. As it turns out this is not entirely true. Michael Shackleford, The Wizard of Odds did a mathematical analysis of the Continuous Shuffling Machines and found that there was a very slight reduction in the house edge. \nIn a four deck game the edge is 0.034 percent and in an eight deck game is tis0.014 percent. Before you get excited about a slight reduction in the house edge you have to realize that when the casino uses a CSM the speed of the games is increased by about 20 percent. The basic strategy player stands to lose more in the long run because they are exposing more money to the house edge. \nAs a player I feel it\u2019s a treat to visit a casino that offers double and single deck games. I would hate to see these games eliminated altogether. Even a multi deck shoe game is preferable to the Continuous Shuffling Machines. The best way you can let the casinos know this is by refusing to play Blackjack at the casinos that use a CSM for their Blackjack games"

Mr O handled that pretty dam good. its about respect whether u like the man or not. bill clinton joins in the negative talk about Mr O but if u havent heard him u would never know when u c them together.\xa0\n\nhow about u watch the full clip of the incident. sam donaldson knows its wrong, bill o'reilly said so, & even hannity. Mr O did answer his question. tucker knows better & if immigrant munroe has a problem, go back from whence u came & free up a job 4 a real american!GROW UP! ACT LIKE ADULTS!
