He spurred the creation of the tea party. He helped the GOP win the House majority in 2010 and make big gains in the Senate. His Obamacare has helped revive the Commerce Clause and given a boost to conservative jurisprudence. His refusal to support human rights has caused a bipartisan revulsion and reminded us that foreign policy must be girded by American values. He\u2019s sent independents running into the GOP\u2019s arms. He\u2019s forced conservatives to think hard and express eloquently principles of religious liberty, limited government, free markets and Constitutional democracy.\n\nObama also has wreaked havoc in the the Democratic Party. He\u2019s firmly affixed the \u201ctax and spend\u201d label to it after Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. He\u2019s made Clinton into a pitch man for Mitt Romney. His rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline has split the party. His refusal to adopt the Simpson-Bowles commission\u2019s recommendations has turned Democrats into reactionaries, defending the status quo on entitlements. He\u2019s alienated Jewish voters. He\u2019s re-McGovernized the party, which now stands for appeasing despotic powers, turning on allies and slashing defense spending.\n\n(Pack it up dude, your eviction notice will be delivered in November)"

Alls I know is although I thoroughly disagree with the absolute abolition of religion, its very obvious that we have to find a way to evolve our thought processes. \nOh, and as far as movie related articles are concerned, Scientology is famously a very big force in the entertainment industry, as many of the big name A-list actors follow that faith.

I really am. What happens in your life, in your car and in your marriage should not be a public issue. Unfortunately, because you are a public figure, sometimes your private life does become public. I guess it comes with the territory and maybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used to it by now. It still must bite, though......Of course I long for you to own your mistakes, Tiger. If you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already, and I hope you are, man up to the pain you caused your wife and family. Let the hot searing anger she has for what you did change you, not harden you. It must be a hard road to walk, both for her dealing with what you have done, and for you, making sense of where to go from here when you are in the public eye the way you are. Stand behind your actions by way of fully admitting and acknowledging them to yourself. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lie to yourself or pretend they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as bad as others think or that somehow you were justified. You weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You are reaping what you sowed, Tiger. Own it. But see, whether you acknowledge all that publicly to your fans is entirely up to you. It makes no difference to me if your public apologies are detailed or not. For it is not us you need to be apologizing to. Because you are well known does not make you accountable to the public. Share only what you want, and keep the rest private. Keep it all private, if you can. But, and I speak from painful experience here, coming entirely clean does feel good. Really good....\\n\\nTonight, I am praying for restoration for your marriage. Having almost lost mine, because of my own sin and pride as well as that of my husband, I now hold redemption in marriage in such high regard....But my advice, as someone who has been there? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hide it. Own it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Change your ways. Feel repentance. Apologize to your wife. Seek counseling, lots of it if you can. Let the searing pain and guilt and remorse you hopefully feel inspire in you to see yourself for what you are: A wretched sinner in need of forgiveness.\\n\\nYou, your heart, and that of your wife and children are what matter. Focus on them, on saving your marriage, if that is what you want to do. And truly, my husband and I pray that it is what you want to do."\\n\\n"
